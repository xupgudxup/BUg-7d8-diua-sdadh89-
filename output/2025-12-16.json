    "description": "Looking at the Packers passing offense in their loss to the Broncos",
    "fullText": "Every week, we use this space to look at the Green Bay Packers’ passing game from the previous week, so let’s get to it.\n\nIt was a tale of two halves for Jordan Love. He looked unstoppable in the 1st half, going 17/22 (77.3%) for 215 yards (9.8 YPA) and 1 TD (122.4 QB Rating). He also had 6 explosive plays through the air (gains of 16+ yards).\n\nIn the 2nd half, he was 7/18 (38.9%) for 32 yards (1.8 YPA), 0 TDs & 2 INTS (7.4 QB Rating). He had 1 explosive play through the air. There are a multitude of reasons why the numbers fell off in the 2nd half, but the early injury to Christian Watson (two official 2nd half pass attempts on-or-before Watson’s injury) certainly played a role. Matthew Golden catching 2 of his 3 targets for 37 yards in the 2nd half is certainly something to keep an eye on as Watson’s status for Week 16 is still very much up in the air.\n\nThe Packers lost Zach Tom (their starting right tackle) late in the 1st half and replaced him with Darian Kinnard. On top of the down-to-down downgrade in protection between those players, Kinnard is also the preferred 6th offensive lineman in the Packers’ heavy packages. They didn’t lean heavily into it in the first half of this game, but that has been a package they’ve had a lot of success with this season: since rolling it out in Week 10, the Packers have run 48 snaps in their 6OL package, and they’ve had a success rate of 58.3% on those snaps. Of those 48 snaps, 15 were pass plays. On those pass plays, they’ve sported a 60% success rate and an explosive play rate of 26.7%.\n\nAfter Tom went down, the Packers didn’t have a single snap with their 6OL package. Maybe that was because it was a package they didn’t love against the Broncos overall (they had 2 snaps out of 6OL before the Tom injury), but maybe they didn’t prep Jordan Morgan for that role during the week and opted to just stay out of it altogether. As of the time of this writing, we don’t have any information on Tom’s injury in terms of his outlook for the rest of the season, but it’s certainly something to monitor going forward.\n\nThe real story of the passing game was the constant pressure Love was under. This week, Love was under pressure on 52.2% of his dropbacks, per NFL Pro. That was the second-highest pressure rate in the league, only behind Shadeur Sanders at 52.4%. The main difference? Sanders’ average time to throw was 3.15 seconds, while Love’s average time to throw was 2.97 seconds. Love’s numbers under pressure aren’t bad – 10/19, 147 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT – but it was a constant throughout the game and pressed harder in the 2nd half.\n\nThe most jarring thing is his pressure rate when not blitzed. The Broncos blitzed on 39.1% of Love’s dropbacks, but their pressure rate was greater when they didn’t blitz him. Love faced pressure on 53.6% of his snaps when he wasn’t blitzed. He was pretty good on those non-blitzed reps – 15/25, 151 yards, 1 TD – but the numbers very much tell the story that the tape does: whether they brought extra bodies or not, the Broncos defensive line was able to generate pressure. I don’t have numbers split by half, but, based on the film that I watched, I’d say it’s safe to say that the pressure numbers increased after Zach Tom went down with his injury. Kinnard has shown himself to be a perfectly cromulent tackle, but he’s not on the level of Tom, and the Broncos made a point to attack that.\n\nThat shouldn’t hurt the Packers too much in the short term as their next two opponents (Bears and Ravens) rank near the bottom of the league in terms of generating pressure (27th and 29th, respectively), so we should see the passing offense operating pretty well as the season starts to wind down. But, after a nice 1st half in this game, we were treated to a pretty frustrating 2nd half. Love certainly wasn’t at his sharpest at times (he was slightly off on a couple throws and passed up at least one open, deeper option in favor of a shorter one that allowed him to get the ball out quicker), but the combination of pressure and the injury to Christian Watson is what ultimately put this offense in the ground.\n\nBefore we get out of here, I want to take a look at one of my favorite plays of the day: the touchdown catch by Josh Jacobs.\n\nThe Broncos had just scored a TD to take a 7-6 lead with 8:19 left in the 2nd half. The Packers proceeded to go on a 9-play, 75-yard drive that culminated in this play on 3rd & goal from the 14.\n\nThe Packers come out in 11 personnel (1 RB, 1 TE, 3 WR) in a 3×1 set. They have Christian Watson [9], Jayden Reed [11] and John FitzPatrick [86] in a bunch on the left, with Matthew Golden [0] as the isolated receiver on the right. Josh Jacobs [8] is the single back, aligned wide in the backfield. And when I say wide I mean WIDE. As in, outside-the-tackle wide. That alignment gets him outside leverage on Dre Greenlaw [57].\n\nThe Broncos appear to be in a Quarters look pre-snap, and the Packers are running a Smash variant with Watson and Reed on the left Post/Rail with Golden and Jacobs on the right.\n\nLove is initially looking to hit Reed on the left on a Post-Corner route, but when Love checks the safeties post-snap, he sees Brandon Jones [22] camped directly in the middle, taking away the throw to Reed. With Jones in the middle, Love works back to Jacobs on the right.\n\nWith the route distribution on that side, the boundary corner runs with Golden to the inside, leaving Jacobs all alone with Greenlaw on the outside. Jacobs hesitates at the top of the stem to sell a Choice route, which is something the Packers have shown a lot this season. That holds Greenlaw in place just enough for Jacobs to break vertically up the field and get an angle.\n\nGreenlaw does a good job recovering, but Jacobs Mosses Greenlaw and shows extremely strong hands to come down with the TD.\n\nGood read by Love and a tremendous catch by Jacobs.\n\nAlbums listened to: Cat Power – The Greatest; M83 – Resurrection [Soundtrack]; Lykke Li – so sad, so sexy",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid take on CF Talavera in their first Copa del Rey game in the Round of 32 on Wednesday night, in what should be a straightforward encounter for the team.\n\nAs such, rotations are expected to be made by manager Xabi Alonso, even more so considering the number of injuries in the squad.\n\nCastilla youngster David Jimenez is expected to start at right-back, with no Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Fede Valverde needing a rest.\n\nNow, according to journalist Rodra of ESPN, young midfielder Thiago Pitarch is also a strong contender to start for Real Madrid against Talavera on Wednesday.\n\nJust 18 years old, Thiago was a regular presence in the first-team squad under Xabi Alonso during the short pre-season and the early parts of the campaign, although he never made his official senior debut.\n\nOfficial debut awaits. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nThe youngster moved back to Castilla once the injured senior midfielders made their way back, but remains a player held in high regard by the club as well as Alonso.\n\nPitarch was named in the squad for the weekend win against Alaves, where he was an unused substitute.\n\nNow, though, there appears to be a strong chance that the 18-year-old La Fabrica talent plays tomorrow against Talavera to make his first-team debut for Real Madrid.\n\nSo far this term, Pitarch has played 12 times for Castilla in all competitions, scoring and assisting one goal apiece. He also has one appearance for the Real Madrid C team.\n\nA talented midfielder, the teenager has been knocking on the first-team doors throughout this season, and his chance might finally come tomorrow against CF Talavera.",

    "description": "The Chargers upgrade their trenches with top center prospect Logan Jones in this new 2026 mock draft.",
    "fullText": "One of the most popular strategies you’ll see for the Chargers in the early rounds of 2026 mocks will be them trying to fortify both sides of the trenches. Center and offensive guard are likely at the top of their needs list but I also wouldn’t be surprised if interior defensive lineman is also up there. Guys like Teair Tart and Da’Shawn Hand have played well, but the Bolts need more youngsters to grow and develop with the team. Caldwell is a good start, but I’d like to see more.\n\nEnter this two-round mock draft I threw together to show what a 1-2 combo could look for the Bolts come April. The Bolts need impact players and these two have shown a history of being just that for their respective programs.\n\nJones was recently named the nation’s top center by winning the Rimington Award, following in the footsteps of former Hawkeye and current Ravens center Tyler Linderbaum. Jones was also named a consensus All-American and First-Team All-Big Ten selection after another stellar season in which he allowed just five pressures, zero sacks, and was called for just two penalties all year. He finished the year as Pro Football Focus’ highest-graded center and ended the regular season with an elite 90.1 pass block grade.\n\nWatch Iowa center Logan Jones get to the 2nd level to bury LB #0…so much of this on his tape pic.twitter.com/iy3VFynagO\n\n— Connor Rogers (@ConnorJRogers) October 22, 2025\n\nJones was also ranked seventh on Bruce Feldman’s Freaks List which ranks the 50 biggest freak-athletes in college football. Here’s the blurb on him:\n\n“A former basketball player who was in the 260-pound range in high school, Jones first dunked in ninth grade at about 6-1. Now, at 303 pounds, he is one of the country’s best centers. Last year, Jones had zero sacks allowed in 280 pass blocking snaps, per PFF. He set the program record this offseason with a 705-pound squat. He holds the position record with a 36.6-inch vertical, a 1.53 10-yard split and a 4.09 shuttle. His 470-pound hang clean this summer is also a position record, but he was hoping to break the program record for all players held by another Freaks List alum, Tristan Wirfs.”\n\nCurrent Chargers starting center Bradley Bozeman is currently ranked 39th out of 30 qualifying centers this season. Need I say anything more? The Bolts need to find a new starting center and Jones is the perfect fit for Jim Harbaugh-coached team.\n\nIt doesn’t get much better in the nickname department than “The Godfather” but what else can you call a guy whose last name is Corleone?\n\nAlong with his intimidating moniker is his 335 pounds on a 6’1 frame. PFF currently has him ranked as their seventh-best interior defender and despite a drop in production this season, they believe he’s still a viable player at the next level.\n\n“Corleone, or better known as The Godfather, has been in college football for quite some time. He was one of the highest-graded players in the country in 2022, sporting elite PFF run-defense grades thanks to imposing strength and massive size. His PFF overall and run-defense grades have steadily dropped each season since, and he suffered blood clots in the 2024 offseason, which is worth noting given his weight. Corleone has unique quickness for a nose tackle, and even though he possesses shorter arms, he can stack and control centers at will in run defense. His pass-rush win rate has been below 10.0% for two seasons, likely a product of his lack of length, which only gets more challenging to overcome in the NFL. As a true nose tackle for a 3-4 scheme, he can still bring plenty of value.”\n\nAs a freshman in 2022, Corleone had three sacks and 5.5 tackles for loss. In 2023, he replicated his three-sack campaign while notching a career-high 6.5 tackles for loss. In ‘24, Corleone recorded another five tackles for loss and a new career-high of 3.5 sacks. This year has been a bit of a letdown, however, as Corelone has played in 10 games due to injury while failing to record a single tackle for loss or sack.\n\nObviously this dip isn’t shying PFF away from believeing he’s one of the best at his position in this class, but it very well could sink his draft stock a bit. Don’t be surprised if he falls a round or two when it’s all said and done. For this exercise, however, we’re trusting PFF and believe Corleone is worthy of a late pick in the second.",

    "fullText": "Ian Rapoport under fire for doing some serious PR work for Raiders LB Devin White originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL's top insiders, guys like ESPN's Adam Schefter and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, need to have player agents on their side to do their jobs effectively.\n\nSometimes, that can create some odd social media posts that seem to be more like public relations boosts than anything else.\n\nThat's what happened with Rapoport on Tuesday. This is what he posted about Raiders linebacker Devin White on X:\n\nIt’s been a challenging season in Las Vegas, but the #Raiders have some success stories — LB Devin White is a big one.\n\nHe has emerged as a potential Comeback Player of the Year candidate in DC Patrick Graham’s scheme, as the fifth player in team history to eclipse 140 tackles.… pic.twitter.com/UOL7A8OAP2\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) December 16, 2025\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nThere's a lot more to the story of White's season, though.\n\nThe Athletic's Ted Nguyen quoted Rapoport's tweet and wrote this: \"Tackle numbers are one of the most misleading stats. He just hasn’t been good. So many blown assignments.\"\n\nAnother NFL writer, Cory Kinnan, added this in his own quote tweet: \"Nasty agent copy and paste work here.\"\n\nMORE: Bills may not win the AFC East — but they sent a clear warning to the rest of the NFL\n\nIt's definitely a shaky look. Most followers expect Rapoport's posts to include transactional or injury news. This one is neither.\n\nInstead, it's an out-of-the-blue post promoting the credentials of a linebacker on the Raiders that no one had been thinking about.\n\nIf Rapoport wrote posts like that all the time, it'd be one thing.

    "fullText": "There is a moment from Gotham FC’s NWSL Championship celebrations in Manhattan last month that stayed with England defender Jess Carter.\n\nIn contrast to blue and white confetti sprinkled through the New York sky as “Empire State of Mind” and “Feliz Navidad” blared through the speakers, it was in a much quieter moment. Carter was standing atop a blue, double-decker bus, waiting for their parade to begin, when she noticed a young fan in the crowd.\n\nThe fan stood in the cold, beaming with excitement, holding a sign not meant for Carter, but Gotham’s goalkeeper and Carter’s fiancée, Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\n“He was just so excited to see us, but it wasn’t to see us, it was to see Ann,” Carter told The Athletic on a recent video call, with a proud smile. “We’ve always talked about inspiring little girls, but that’s a little boy, and he’s looking up to us and thinking that this is something he could do. That was a really beautiful moment.”\n\nGotham’s celebrations punctuated the end of a grueling season for the 28-year-old defender. In a span of 181 days, Carter won three major titles for both club and country: the inaugural Concacaf W Champions Cup with Gotham in May, the European Championship with England in July, and, last month, she helped Gotham win their second NWSL title.\n\n“Winning with England is always incredible, and getting to win this trophy here with Gotham has been amazing,” Carter said. She laughed, then continued, “I’m still trying to understand this league (the NWSL). But being part of it and seeing how special the championship is, and how much it means to everyone, is incredible. This team, they’re great people. So, getting to do it with them was even better.”\n\nCarter signed with Gotham last summer after six years at Chelsea. The five-time Women’s Super League champion, already one of the best defenders in the world, quickly became a vital part of the NWSL club’s backline.\n\n“The athleticism here is unmatched,” Carter said. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever experienced before, on a regular basis. Everybody seems to be super strong and super fast and super fit, whereas when I played in Europe, I felt I was competing more comfortably for strength and for pace with a lot of players. Here, everything has to be spotless; otherwise, you get punished.”\n\nWhile the WSL remains more tactical, the style of play in NWSL is rapidly evolving, Carter said.\n\n“Even since I’ve been here just over a year, teams that maybe would have traditionally gone a bit more direct are now trying to play out through the back, and they’re trying to build and (be) more technical and tactical,” she said. “That’s coming into the NWSL a lot more. I think having a lot of players from all over the world is what contributes to that.”\n\nFor Carter, the celebrations in Manhattan doubled as a belated celebration for winning a second consecutive Euros with England over the summer. She missed out on the massive homecoming her national team received in London after topping Spain in the final, opting instead to fly back to the United States early to rejoin Gotham.\n\nComing back served as a necessary reset for Carter, who was targeted by online racist abuse from the start of the tournament. Two days before England’s semifinal against Italy, Carter shared a statement on Instagram condemning the abuse. She said she would be stepping away from social media as a result.\n\n“It was really tough,” Carter said. “I’m not someone who would speak out about something like that. I’m happy to ask for help, but I don’t think I really realized how much I needed support at the time. A lot of people are taught from young to ignore it and move on and rise above it. And it’s, like – actually, why? Why should we not speak about it?”\n\nAt first, Carter ignored the abuse and moved on, believing any response would be giving in. But the hate didn’t stop.\n\n“You don’t want to let those people win,” she said. “It’s only getting worse and worse in the women’s game, and that’s something that we don’t want to be part of our game.”\n\nCarter’s sister encouraged the defender to speak out, asking her to consider how she would feel if this were happening to her nieces or nephews, or her teammates.\n\n“There’s a lot of stuff that happens in football that you just have to get on with, but my sister was like, ‘If this was Khiara (Keating), LJ (Lauren James), me – if this was them it was happening to, you’d want to be able to support them. You’d want them to speak up about it.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, of course I would.’\n\n“I’ve got mixed-race nieces and nephews. It’s not just about me. It’s for all the little boys and girls looking up to me or trying to find anybody that looks like them. It’s really hard to find anyone that looks like me trying to do my job, and the fact that I can be that for someone else, I owe it to myself and to them to continue to fight.”\n\nThere was an immediate outpouring of support for Carter, from her coach, Sarina Wiegman, and her teammates, to the global soccer community. “But then on the other side of it, I got more abuse for attention seeking and lying or bringing that negative attention on the team,” Carter said. “It’s like, you could have 1,000 positive comments, but there’s one or two, still, I think (that) hurt more than the 1,000 positive.”\n\nTwo men have been arrested in relation to the online racist abuse sent to Carter, which she sees as an important step toward meaningful change. The matter remains ongoing. The BBC reported earlier this week that one man will be summoned to court, with police telling the publication he would be charged with making malicious communications.\n\n“A lot of reasons why people don’t speak up when they face any abuse, is because, well, what’s it going to do? (They think that) nothing’s going to happen. … When people see there’s repercussions to their actions, they just might second-guess what they say or what they do,” Carter said. “Holding people accountable is the biggest step in trying to keep the women’s game as clean as possible.”\n\nCarter was with the Lionesses when they won their first-ever Euros championship in England. They overcame eight-time champions Germany in the final in extra time. But this summer, when they defeated World Cup winners Spain, it felt different for Carter, who played a bigger role on the pitch for their 2025 championship.\n\nCarter remembers how “up and down” the tournament felt for England, which opened the competition with a stunning loss to France, followed by a 4-0 bounce-back victory against the Netherlands.\n\n“What I’m most proud of is staying true to myself in that whole experience of the Euros,” Carter said. “For me, it’s about: how do we rise above it and show what I can do and continue to persevere and grow? That’s the biggest thing that I took away from the Euros. It’s not even just the win. It’s the fight, the determination, that all of us showed.”\n\nEngland’s path to victory parallels Gotham’s journey to its second NWSL crown in three seasons. The team entered the postseason in the final qualifying spot. They orchestrated the biggest upset of the year when they defeated Kansas City Current – statistically, the best team to ever play in the league – in the quarterfinals.\n\nGotham went on to defeat the Washington Spirit in the championship match. Last year, Gotham was left heartbroken when the Spirit defeated them in the 2024 semifinals after a penalty kick shootout.\n\nGotham’s Championship win happened on a Saturday night in San Jose. By Monday morning, the team was back on the East Coast, standing atop those blue buses as they prepared to roll down Broadway. The celebration felt like it was owed to Gotham and its fanbase after their 2023 championship was met with far less fanfare. The club and city officials made it happen, with 36 hours between Gotham lifting the NWSL trophy in PayPal Park and receiving the keys to New York City on the steps of City Hall.\n\nThis year, Carter has become a more visible face for brands around the world, including e.l.f. Cosmetics in the United States. The makeup company spotlighted Carter as one of their chosen trailblazers in a documentary-style campaign series.\n\nShe plans to enjoy downtime and visit family in England and Germany. Then she will be “ready to go again.” “It’s been nice to switch off from football, that’s for sure,” Carter said.\n\nGotham has a short offseason, with the inaugural FIFA Women’s Champions Cup fast approaching. When Gotham won the Concacaf W Champions Cup in May, they qualified as the reigning continental champions to FIFA’s new global club competition. They will play Brazilian club Corinthians in the tournament’s semifinal on Jan. 28 at the Brentford Community Stadium in west London. The winner then heads to Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium for the final on Feb. 1.\n\n“Sometimes I wish it was somewhere else, because I know London,” Carter said, with a laugh. “But at the same time, the NWSL deserves to be recognized, and it’s a great opportunity for us to do that in London. Women’s football is excellent in England, and hopefully a lot of women’s football fans turn out and want to come and watch.”\n\nMaybe there will be another young fan in the crowd who will catch Carter’s attention. “When I think about how I’d speak to my younger self, or the younger boys or younger girls, it’s just about staying true to yourself,” Carter said. “I don’t think people realize what you’re capable of, until you’re really put in those tough situations.”\n\nShe is capable of plenty, including a few championships in a span of 181 days.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nEngland, Gotham FC, NWSL, Women's Soccer, Women's Euros\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "One NFL analyst weighed in on Phillip Rivers' performance in the Colts' loss to Seattle.",
    "fullText": "ESPN's Ben Solak doesn't believe that the Indianapolis Colts should start Phillip Rivers at quarterback over these final three games.\n\n\"After one game of Rivers, albeit against a great defense without two starting tackles, I'd play Leonard if and when he's healthy,\" Solak wrote recently. \"I'd play Anthony Richardson Sr. if and when he's healthy.\"\n\nSo what makes Solak feel this way?\n\nIn short, he feels that a key portion of Shane Steichen's playbook was too limited on Sunday with Rivers under center.\n\nAs Solak noted, the Colts' offense leads the NFL entering Week 16 in yards per play from under center. However, with Rivers at quarterback, Indianapolis ran only one such play against Seattle.\n\nWith Rivers' limited mobility, the Colts relied on pistol and shotgun formations.\n\nFrom under center, the Colts have had a very strong running game this season and a very versatile offense. From pistol or shotgun, those elements became more limited.\n\n\"Let me emphasize that point: This was, and remains, the best under-center team in football,\" wrote Solak. \"The running game, in particular, is a strength.\"\n\nSolak added, \"The Colts are highly versatile from under center. They operate a wide range of concepts with a wider set of tags and motions to those runs. With every week, they have changed.\"\n\nWhile Rivers' knowledge of Steichen's offense and his decision-making provided stability at the quarterback position, there was also a lack of explosive plays from the Colts' offense.\n\nUtilizing the quick passing game often, Solak mentions that the Colts had only two pass attempts of 20-plus yards the entire game. The play-action game was also limited as well.\n\nThe caveat to all of this, which Solak made sure to point out, was that the Colts were up against a very good Seattle defense. This, of course, factored into some of the results.\n\nSolak also says that Rivers' performance exceeded his expectations. But what Solak also saw on Sunday from the Colts was a limited playbook.\n\nSteichen has already announced that Rivers will be the Colts' starting quarterback against San Francisco this week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Why one NFL analyst wouldn't start Phillip Rivers at quarterback",

    "fullText": "Coming into Week 15 against the Cleveland Browns, Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson was very vocal about getting the passing game, and the offense as a whole, off to a faster start.\n\nEven in the bitter cold temperatures, the Bears did just that with a healthy balance of both their pass and run offense, with quarterback Caleb Williams throwing for 242 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions in the 31-3 win.\n\nWilliams has not reached the mark of 70% completion that his head coach had set out for him this season, and while he only hit 60% in the win over Cleveland, the second-year quarterback made some remarkable throws. Following the game, Johnson spoke about how Williams made some special throws in the game and that he was able to lead his receivers to more big play opportunities with run after the catch.\n\n\"Did I see that today? Yeah, once again, I've got to go back and look at it,\" Johnson said when asked about Williams' accuracy in the win. \"Sometimes my perspective doesn't always show that for me. But yeah, I thought he did a good job finding some open guys, and it didn't feel like we had a little bit more run after catch here this week than maybe what we've had over the last few weeks. Usually that's a good sign.\"\n\nHe may have not reached a high completion percentage in the game, but Williams' play was noticeably better than the last couple of weeks. There's no better time for Chicago's quarterback to find a rhythm and groove in his game, with just three games left and the Bears fully locked in the mix for the NFC playoff race.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears HC Ben Johnson evaluates Caleb Williams performance vs. Browns",

    "description": "The Nevada Athletic Commission provided an update Tuesday into the ongoing investigation surrounding former UFC featherweight Isaac Dulgarian.",
    "fullText": "The Nevada Athletic Commission provided a brief update Tuesday into the ongoing investigation surrounding former UFC featherweight Isaac Dulgarian. Despite the case being one of the UFC’s most concerning betting-related controversies in recent years, plenty of questions remain unanswered.\n\nFor the second consecutive month, Dulgarian was on the NAC’s meeting agenda under the designation of “conduct deemed by the commission to reflect discredit to unarmed combat.” As was the case during the commission’s November meeting, no findings were publicly disclosed and no disciplinary action was taken on Tuesday. Instead, the commission ruled that Dulgarian remains suspended while the investigation continues.\n\nDulgarian, 29, has been under scrutiny since his first-round submission loss to Yadier del Valle on Nov. 1 at UFC Vegas 110. In the hours leading up to the bout, regulators and sportsbooks detected suspicious betting activity, including sharp line movement and unusually large wagers placed on del Valle, who entered the fight as a significant underdog. Dulgarian was released from the UFC days after the loss.\n\nThrough his lawyer, Dulgarian commented on the allegations and controversy for the first time Tuesday with a written statement, read by attorney James Hobbs:\n\n\"As you know, it has been alleged in correspondence with the state of Nevada Athletic Commission that there are grounds deemed by the commission supporting the temporary suspension of our client, Isaac Dulgarian. While Mr. Dulgarian denies any claims of conduct that can discredit in the field of unarmed combat, he consents to another extension of the temporary suspension.\"\n\nFollowing the fight, UFC CEO Dana White said the FBI opened an investigation into the betting irregularities. To date, the FBI has neither publicly acknowledged nor commented on the status of that investigation.\n\nDulgarian’s longtime coach Marc Montoya also addressed the situation on Uncrowned's \"The Ariel Helwani Show\" in early November, insisting he had no knowledge of any misconduct and confirming that Dulgarian is no longer training at Montoya's Factory X gym. Dulgarian also previously trained at Glory MMA & Fitness, a gym that was at the center of a major UFC betting scandal in 2023.\n\nThat case involved allegations that insider information regarding an injury to fighter Darrick Minner was exploited by bettors connected to former UFC fighter and coach James Krause. Minner and teammate Jeff Molina were suspended as a result, while the broader investigation into Krause’s role has never been publicly resolved.\n\nThe NAC’s next opportunity to address Dulgarian’s case will come Jan. 20 at its first meeting of 2026.",

Because I feel like I have one of the most profound histories with John Cena. I've been tag team champions with him, I beat him in the main event of WrestleMania, I've had multiple WrestleManias with John Cena. How many people can actually say that?\" Miz said. \"And I feel it's [relationship with Cena] gone through maybe 15 or 20 chapters.\"\n\nMiz went on to say that he campaigned for the match, but because of \"certain circumstances,\" it never came to fruition.\n\n\"I went to everyone. It's not even that it was shot down. There were instances where it could've happened, and things happen in this industry that nobody really knows about and you don't need to know about, right? There was a moment where it could've happened, but then that moment went away because of certain circumstances. And so, it never came back.\"\n\nAdd the exclusion of Miz from Cena's last chapter as another questionable decision from WWE creative in their handling of Cena's retirement run.\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit the \"SI Media\" podcast and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Despite loss to Josh Allen and Bills, can Drake Maye still challenge for NFL MVP? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots fell back to Earth with their toughest loss of the season. It wasn’t just that they couldn’t afford to lose to the Buffalo Bills, their main divisional rival, but blowing a 21-point lead also raised questions about their status as true contenders.\n\nThe Patriots had dominated with one of the easiest schedules in the league. They even took down the Bills in their first meeting of the season, and they looked poised to make a statement again on Sunday before Josh Allen went berserk in the second half.\n\nMore than that, that loss may have also cost Drake Maye a shot at MVP. When asked about the game, however, he only talked about how bouncing back from this setback will be the actual challenge now:\n\n“Move on to next week and learn from it,\" Maye said, per NFL.com. \"It was a long stretch where we were feeling good about ourselves. Now it's about responding from losing to a good team.\"\n\nJosh Allen made a statement and proved to be the best quarterback in the league right now. He made big play after big play with a three-touchdown performance to bring his team back to seal a 35-31 win. Even so, Maye still has a chance to win MVP.\n\nThe Pats are still in control of their destiny, and at 11-3, they can be the No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the AFC. They will close out the season by facing the Baltimore Ravens before back-to-back matchups with eliminated divisional rivals, the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins. At worst, they should be able to win two of those games.\n\nDrake Maye is leading the league with a completion percentage of 70.9 percent. He has thrown for 3,567 yards and 23 touchdowns to go along with just seven interceptions and a passer rating of 109.1. He also has 362 rushing yards and four scores on the ground.\n\nOf course, Allen’s numbers aren’t half bad, either. He’s thrown for 3,276 yards, 25 touchdowns, and ten picks while completing 70 percent of his passes, all while also logging 535 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns.\n\nAllen’s numbers are slightly better, and he’s the reigning MVP and one of the faces of the league.\n\nBut if Maye leads the Patriots to a 14-win season after winning just four games last year, it’ll be almost impossible not to give him the award.",

    "fullText": "Gian Piero Gasperini has a wish list for the Roma attack and it’s in a clear order, with Joshua Zirkzee first, Yuri Alberto second, and Giacomo Raspadori only third.\n\nThe Giallorossi know they need to secure some reinforcements over the January transfer window and their recent results show the need for a reliable centre-forward, even if it is an atypical one.\n\nGasperini will be heavily involved in the selection process and Zirkzee is at the top of his list.\n\nThe Manchester United outcast is considered to be a centre-forward, with Raspadori as a support striker who can also play in a wider role.\n\nMANCHESTER, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 30: Joshua Zirkzee of Manchester United looks on during the Carabao Cup Fourth Round match between Manchester United and Leicester City at Old Trafford on October 30, 2024 in Manchester, England. (Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nThe former Napoli player had been appreciated by Gasperini when still in charge of Atalanta, although that was to play off centre.\n\nSo the coach would gladly bring both in, but if that is not possible, then his pick would be Zirkzee.\n\nNow it is up to director Frederic Massara to push Manchester United into getting a deal done quickly, not waiting until mid or late January.\n\nIt is also true that Gasperini would like Yuri Alberto, but he is seen as an alternative to Zirkzee, while Beto is mentioned largely because both Everton and Roma have the same owners.\n\nThis isn’t a priority, and would only be pursued if Artem Dovbyk were to move on.\n\nMADRID, SPAIN – SEPTEMBER 30: Giacomo Raspadori of Atletico de Madrid celebrates scoring his team’s first goal during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Phase MD2 match between Atletico de Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt at Estadio Metropolitano on September 30, 2025 in Madrid, Spain. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nIt is confirmed that Gasp also likes Giovane of Hellas Verona, who is on the wish list of Inter and Napoli already.\n\nRaspadori is seeking a new club, seeing as he never got much playing time with Atletico Madrid, so it’d be ideal for Roma if Tommaso Baldanzi (liked by Verona) or Stephan El Shaarawy were to make way.\n\nJack knows that Maurizio Sarri is an admirer and would gladly take him to Lazio as a centre-forward, but a lot depends on Taty Castellanos.",

    "description": "Arsenal’s late win over Wolves solved one immediate problem but raised several others, leaving a familiar question hanging over the season as momentum stutters.Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images“...",
    "fullText": "“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.”\n\nThe Greek philosopher, Heraclitus said this and you would have to concede, I think, the man had a point. This thought has been buzzing around my brain for many of the hours passed since Arsenal’s dramatic and, it has to be said, ever so slightly fortuitous win at home to Wolves on Saturday night.\n\nAs is this one. From a philosopher of a different, footballing kind,\n\n“And the important thing is to be there (in March), to be close there and after that arrive at the end of the season with the chance that we can fight for it (the Premier League title).”\n\nYes, dear reader, Pep Guardiola is in my head. And it’s so, so, so unpleasant. Guys, seriously. Of course, he was talking a few weeks back, when Arsenal were looking just a little more certain that is currently the case and the gap between ourselves and Manchester City was a couple of points better than it is today.\n\nThe imperious Arsenal team who were blocking out the sun for everyone else has gone – for now anyway. If you were to look at our performances since Spurs and file them away, you’d be dropping them into the drawer tabbed “Unconvincing” and this makes it easy to believe we may not see this team again.\n\nBut within Guardiola’s words, a message to his team is also a message to ours. “The important thing is to be there (in March)”. It doesn’t matter how, you just have to be there.\n\n10pm Saturday night, despite the winner, I was angry and therefore gratified, when I watched Mikel Arteta’s post match interview, to perceive that anger reflected in the manager’s demeanour and words. It’s been a while since I’ve seen him positively ticking with his team, but there he was. I have to say that my initial reaction to our, curiously passive, performance was that it was complacent, but having listened to the ArsenalVision podcast, their more psychological explanation does chime to a certain degree.\n\nI do also think, as passive as we looked, we definitely had more than enough chances to break the game open much earlier than we eventually managed. I’m not sure if you could see a more graphic illustration of the Martinelli conundrum than the Champions League superstar who scored an absolute worldie from the edge of the FC Brugge box on Wednesday night somehow putting a free header wide from all of 2 yards. Meanwhile, a more alert centre forward than Viktor Gyokeres may have found himself at the near post to tap a great cross in in the first half.\n\nGyokeres also saw Jurrien Timber beat him to yet another cross later on in the game. At this point, I don’t know whether to be mad at Gyokeres for his lack of anticipation, or at Mikel Arteta for creating a system where one of your defenders is routinely beating your centre forward to the ball.\n\nEither way, it’s not right, is it?\n\nIn the end, Arsenal were grateful to – who else? – Bukayo Saka for digging them out of a self created hole. Yes, we were lucky that Saka’s 70th minute corner ricocheted off the far post into the Wolves net via the helpless Sam Johnstone, but let’s not pretend that both Saka and Rice have not been trying this corner out for weeks now.\n\nOne of them was bound to get it right eventually.\n\nSimilarly, following the latest 90th minute – what a nasty habit we’re developing – gut punch as Wolves found the equaliser they’d been threatening for at least five minutes, it was Saka who turned saviour.\n\nJust three days after former Manchester United and England full back, Paul Parker was presumably offered money to venture this, “are you mad?”, opinion on Saka,\n\n“Saka doesn’t bother defenders because they know what he’s going to do, he’s too predictable. He’s going to turn his back and try and fend you off and then either try to get a foul or pass it back.”\n\nIt was Saka who found the time and space to bother Wolves, as he had been all night, arcing one last cross into the penalty area. On his first Premier League appearance in almost a year (and wasn’t it great to see him back?), Jesus rose in a seasonally inappropriate way to deliver us from our sins, only to see Saka’s cross cannon into the net via Wolves Mosquera. Predictable Saka may be, but – despite having had seven years to do so – it seems that Premier League defences are yet to figure out a way to stop him.\n\nI’m kind of wondering whether Parker has actually watched Saka play football, like ever. His description of Saka could have been applied to practically every Arsenal player on Saturday night, but not the man from Ealing who was up and at it all game.\n\nAfter the game, Mikel acknowledged the need to refocus and restore some basic principles into his players. In fairness to them, they have been going every three days since September, with only international breaks as a pause. It’s been pretty relentless. With a week between this Wolves game and the weekend visit to Everton, hopefully we can have a bit of a reset. At least we get to do it off the back of a win.\n\nIf you’re worried about what you saw against Wolves, I don’t blame you but remember; when the players step out at Hill Dickinson stadium on Saturday night, as the river flows onwards towards March and that run in, they will be changed men.",

Then, the year 2025 was like, hold my beer.\n\nThe truth is, everything that could go wrong, has gone wrong for the Jets in Aaron Glenn’s first season as head coach. After their 48-20 loss to the Jaguars on Sunday, the 3-11 Jets enter their Week 16 matchup against the New Orleans Saints ranking 27th in scoring and 30th in points allowed.\n\nNow, one of their players has decided he’s had enough.\n\nAccording to Jordan Schultz, wide receiver Allen Lazard has requested his release from the team. On Tuesday, the Jets granted Lazard’s request by placing the 30-year-old receiver on release waivers.\n\nAny team can now claim the 6-foot-5 receiver, and the Pittsburgh Steelers are one to keep an eye on, thanks to Lazard’s relationship with Aaron Rodgers after being teammates for eight combined seasons with the Green Bay Packers and Jets.\n\nThough, Lazard hasn’t been particularly productive in New York this season (who has?). He’s been active for ten games, receiving two starts along the way. Yet, he’s only recorded 10 receptions on 18 targets, taking them for 70 yards and a touchdown.\n\nTeams will now have the opportunity to claim the remainder of Lazard’s $2.25 million contract, though he’s reportedly prioritizing the chance to join a contending team, which could put the 8-6 Steelers in play.\n\nMLB Rumor Opens Door To NY Mets, NY Yankees Landing Major Free Agent on Cheap Deal\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "fullText": "Manchester City and Brentford will meet at the Etihad Stadium in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday evening, with the tie an opportunity for Pep Guardiola’s side to return to the final four of a competition they once dominated – while the Bees could edge closer to a first ever major trophy.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2021, the Citizens won six of the eight iterations of this competition, but since then they haven’t even got past the quarter-finals. After seeing off Huddersfield Town and Swansea City in the earlier rounds, City further gained both confidence and ground in the title race at the weekend after running out 3-0 winners away at Crystal Palace, despite being thoroughly challenged throughout the game.\n\nGuardiola’s side still remain Arsenal’s closest rivals for the Premier League title this season and have won nine of their last 10 matches in all competitions, the only blemish being a defeat to Bayer Leverkusen with a much changed side.\n\nTheir visitors Brentford have had a much tougher route to the quarter-finals, with Premier League sides Bournemouth and Aston Villa standing in their way before a trip to Grimsby Town saw them through to the final eight. Keith Andrews’ side have surprised many this season following a summer of upheaval which included the departures of both their manager and forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. Brentford have impressed so far under their new boss and have already caused some notable upsets in the form of wins over Newcastle United and Liverpool. As far as the bigger picture is concerned, success in the Carabao Cup would mark a first ever major trophy and an indication of just how high the club have climbed over the last half-decade.\n\nCity surprised many by arriving at Selhurst Park without Jérémy Doku, with Guardiola revealing the Belgian was struggling with an issue in his leg, though he didn’t comment on its severity. Doku is one of three question marks ahead of Tuesday’s game as he joins John Stones on the injury list for City. It also might prove too soon for former Ballon d’Or winner Rodri as the Spaniard still recovers from a hamstring issue. Mateo Kovačić will certainly be out for an extended period of time as he nurses a severe ankle injury.\n\nAs for Brentford, they are set for a boost as Kevin Schade and Arsenal loanee Reiss Nelson could be fit enough to start for the Bees, providing much-needed bolstering to Andrews’ front line. However, the visitors will be without winger Dango Ouattara, who jetted off to the Africa Cup of Nations on Sunday evening. Despite this, and having no European competitions, Brentford should be able to field a full strength side.\n\nThe game will kick off at 19:30 GMT at the Etihad Stadium, and will be televised on Sky Sports Main Event in the UK.",

The team broke an eight-game losing streak by taking down the New York Giants.\n\nThere won't be any playoff games for the Commanders this year, but ending on a positive note and going into the offseason with positive momentum is important. The team will have to go the rest of the season without star quarterback Jayden Daniels, but Marcus Mariota has been serviceable in his place.\n\nOn Tuesday, the team announced a series of roster moves:\n\n- Placed WR Noah Brown on the Reserve/Injured List- Designated CB Darius Rush practice squad injured- Signed WR Chris Moore from the practice squad- Signed WR River Cracraft and TE Gee Scott Jr. to the practice squad\n\nWe have made the following roster moves:\n- Placed WR Noah Brown on the Reserve/Injured List\n- Designated CB Darius Rush practice squad injured\n- Signed WR Chris Moore from the practice squad\n- Signed WR River Cracraft and TE Gee Scott Jr. to the practice squad\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) December 16, 2025\n\nIt's disappointing to see Brown go back on the injured list. The receiver will end his season having only played in four games. Replacing Brown will be an old friend, Chris Moore, who is being promoted from the practice squad. Moore spent most of the season on the roster, but was released to make room for Brown and then re-signed to the practice squad.\n\nWide receiver River Cracraft will take Moore's practice squad spot, and tight end Gee Scott Jr. was also added to the practice squad. Cracraft will be on his second stint with Washington's practice squad this season.\n\nOver the last few weeks, some players could get a chance to impress and prove they belong in the league.

    "description": "Matthew Stafford is as low as -300 at BetMGM and DraftKings, while Drake Maye’s shortest odds are +380 at FanDuel.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has the largest lead of the season in NFL MVP odds thanks to a slipup Sunday from the New England Patriots' Drake Maye.\n\nStafford would tie Y.A.Tittle and Rich Gannon as the oldest first-time NFL MVP (37).\n\nMaye was just held under 200 yards passing for the first time all year.\n\nOnly one top-eight finisher in last year’s MVP voting is in the race for this year’s award.\n\nStafford and Maye have been locked in a seemingly two-horse race to win the MVP trophy for more than a month.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Maye was installed as a -120 favorite, while Stafford was back around +120. The 37-year-old, 14 years the senior of Maye, reclaimed a narrow lead one week later, leading into a decisive Week 15.\n\nStafford and the Rams took down the visiting Detroit Lions, 41-34, behind their QB’s 368 yards and two touchdowns against one interception.\n\nMaye and the Pats got off to a hot start against the AFC East rival Buffalo Bills, surging ahead to a 21-0 lead in the second quarter and a 24-7 halftime score. However, their second-half collapse allowed the visiting Bills to steal a 35-31 victory.\n\nMaye was held below 200 passing yards for the first time all season. He finished with 155 passing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and an interception, while the Pats’ winning streak ended at 10 games.\n\nStafford’s shortest odds, -300 at BetMGM, translate to a 75% implied chance to win the award. Maye’s +380 at FanDuel equals a 20.8% implied chance.\n\nThe Rams finish their season by visiting the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons and hosting the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nThe Pats' three-game run includes matchups at the Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets and against the Miami Dolphins.\n\nWhile it seems hard to believe that anyone other than Stafford or Maye could win the MVP, the reigning award-winner is doing his best to surprise.\n\nBuoyed by the comeback victory on Sunday, Bills QB Josh Allen is down to around +500 at the top online sportsbooks. He had 193 passing yards and three touchdowns last weekend and is now fourth in passing TDs, sixth in QBR, and eighth in passing yards.\n\nThe closest challenger is Denver Broncos QB Bo Nix, although his lowest odds are +7,500 at bet365. That gives him just a 1.3% implied chance to take home the award.\n\nJust below Nix is Jordan Love, whose Green Bay Packers fell in Mile High on Sunday. Love is anywhere from +8,000 to +15,000 despite leading the NFL in QBR and ranking fifth in touchdowns and seventh in passing yards.\n\nThe only other player who seemingly has a chance is Sam Darnold. The long shot is +10,000 across the board as he prepares to face Stafford and the Rams on Thursday Night Football.\n\nThe 2025 NFL MVP odds race is nothing like the one a year ago.\n\nWhile Allen is still in the mix after winning last year’s award, none of the other top eight finishers a year ago are in with a shot at the 2025 MVP. Justin Herbert, who finished ninth, is about seventh in odds (anywhere from +10,000 to +15,000), and Darnold, who was 10th last year, is sixth in current odds.\n\nAssuming a quarterback wins the MVP - which seems inevitable - it will mark 13 years since a player at a different position took the award. The last to do so was running back Adrian Peterson.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "FC Bayern Munich have officially completed the purchase of the 15,000-seat-arena in Unterhaching. The current home of German fourth-tier side SpVgg Unterhaching will play host to the Bayern women’s home matches in the future. Kicker reports that the Bundesliga record champions are also toying with the notion of moving the Bayern reserves to the Unterhaching ground. FCB II presently play their games at 1860 Munich’s Grünwalder Stadion.\n\nThe Bayern women have also played matches at the Grünwalder Stadion in addition to the Allianz Arena. A crowd of nearly 58,000 spectators came to watch the women host Bayer Leverkusen in their 2025/26 Bundesliga debut at the Allianz. Like the Haching ground, 1860’s historic arena can also play host to around 15,000 guests. Bayern plan to make some renovations to the venue, which they have already paid approximately €7.5m for.\n\n“The acquisition of the Unterhaching sports park is another milestone in the overall development of our FC Bayern women’s team,” Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen noted in a statement on the FCB website. “The new sporting home of our women’s team will meet UEFA requirements and also satisfy spectator demand in the future.”\n\n“We thank Bayern for finding a solution that was beneficial to all parties and marks another milestone in our partnership,” SpVgg President Manfred Schwabl noted in his own statement. “Our sporting home will be rendered fit for the future via infrastructure measures that meet the ever-growing demands of professional football.“",

    "fullText": "Paris St-Germain and France forward Ousmane Dembele has been named the men's player of the year at the Fifa Best awards.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who won the Ballon d'Or in September, picked up the Fifa award in Qatar on Tuesday after helping PSG to four trophies in the 2024-25 season.\n\nThe former Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund player, who joined PSG in 2023, had 51 goal contributions in 53 games for Luis Enrique's side last term.\n\nAfter helping PSG to a first Champions League triumph, Dembele beat Barcelona's Lamine Yamal and Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe to the prestigious individual award.\n\nDembele was present at the awards ceremony before his side's Intercontinental Cup final against Flamengo on Wednesday.\n\nThe award, which is based off events from August 2024 to August 2025, is voted for by men's national team coaches, men's national team captains, journalists and fans.\n\nThe Frenchman's success underlines his status as one of the best players in the world.\n\nDembele initially struggled for form during the first half of the 2024-25 campaign but saw his season spark into life after being redeployed as a central forward.\n\nEight of his 35 goals came in the Champions League last season, including crucial strikes against Liverpool and Arsenal in the knockout stages.\n\nDembele joins an illustrious list of names, including Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, to have won the award since its inception in 2016.\n\nIn total, he has scored three goals and provided three assists for PSG across all competitions this term.\n\nOn the international stage, meanwhile, Dembele helped France qualify for next summer's World Cup, where the two-time winners will face Senegal, Norway, and one of the play-off winners in the group stage.\n\nIn total, six players involved in PSG's 2024-25 season were named in the team of the year, while Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk and Chelsea's Cole Palmer were the only representatives who played in the Premier League last term.\n\nThe players selected were Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG/Man City), Achraf Hakimi (PSG), Willian Pacho (PSG), Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool), Nuno Mendes (PSG), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Vitinha (PSG), Pedri (Barcelona), Lamine Yamal (Barcelona) and Ousmane Dembele (PSG).\n\nIndependiente winger Santiago Montiel won the Puskas Award for the stunning overhead kick he scored against Independiente Rivadavia in Argentina's Primera Division.\n\nThe 25-year-old's incredible acrobatic effort was enough to earn a 1-0 win for his side in May and left opposition goalkeeper Ezequiel Centurion rooted to the spot.\n\nMontiel, who is the second successive Argentine to win the award after Alejandro Garnacho in 2024, said: \"I didn't think about it, I just hit it.\"\n\nArsenal and England midfielder Declan Rice was shortlisted for the award for the second of two free-kicks he scored against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.\n\nEarlier in the night, Manchester City's Donnarumma was named the Fifa Men's goalkeeper of the year for 2025.\n\nThe Italian shot-stopper, 26, played a key role in PSG's Champions League triumph last season before moving to Etihad Stadium in September.\n\nDonnarumma, who kept a clean sheet in the final against Inter Milan in May, finished ahead of Premier League goalkeepers Alisson Becker, Emi Martinez, David Raya and Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois to win the award for the first time.\n\nIn addition to the Champions League, Donnarumma helped PSG win Ligue 1, Coupe de France and the Trophee des Champions titles during the 2024-25 season.\n\nAfter guiding PSG to four trophies over the course of the 2024-25 campaign, Luis Enrique was crowned coach of the year on Tuesday night.\n\nThe 55-year-old, who has been at the helm since 2023, masterminded victories over Liverpool, Arsenal and Inter Milan to help the French side secure a first Champions League triumph.\n\nThe former Barcelona manager beat Liverpool's Arne Slot and Barcelona's Hansi Flick to the award.\n\nHowever, he was unable to make the award ceremony night, with PSG's assistant manager Rafel Pol Cabanellas accepting the award on the Spaniard's behalf.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing […]",
    "fullText": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing a notable free agent they have been linked to for a very team-friendly rate.\n\nThe Mets and Yankees had very different results in their 2025 MLB campaigns. While both clubs entered the year as serious World Series contenders and were two of the best teams in the league during the first half, the club from Queens shockingly collapsed in September and missed the playoffs. Although the Yanks got to the playoffs, they were ousted in the divisional round by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nAfter seasons that fell well below expectations, both clubs have been active this offseason as they look to improve their roster. Oddly enough, they are also in the market for the same positions. Each team is looking to bolster its rotation and is reportedly pursuing Michael King. They are also looking for new first basemen.\n\nTo the chagrin of Mets fans, the team lost home run king Pete Alonso in free agency to the Baltimore Orioles. While the Yankees are expected to move on from Paul Goldschmidt. Unsurprisingly, they have both been linked to Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami. A player whose market is reportedly weaker than he and his reps expected.\n\nRecent reports have suggested the corner infielder’s market has been weak as he closes in on the Dec. 22 deadline for him to sign with an MLB team. It has created some speculation that he might just end up returning to Japan if he doesn’t get the sort of offer he is looking for. However, Ken Rosenthal doesn’t buy into that discourse.\n\nIn a new report, he spoke about how Murakami’s swing and miss rate is believed to be the big reason why some teams are balking at giving the 25-year-old a big long-term contract. Rosenthal believes that the issue is overblown, and Shohei Ohtani had a higher rate before he made the move from Japan in 2018. The MLB insider firmly believes Murakami will be playing in the MLB next season.\n\nMunetaka Murakami stats: 69 G, .286 AVG, .392 OBP, .659 SLG, 1.051 OPS, 24 HR, 52 RBI, 40 R\n\nThat is very good news for the Mets and Yankees. Despite the questions about his defense and swing and miss rate, he is one of the greatest home run hitters in Japanese baseball history, and still hasn’t even hit his prime. With far fewer teams expected to be in on him, the pair of New York clubs could get a young player with huge upside at a far cheaper rate than they expected a month ago, or for fewer years.\n\nNew York Jets Player Requests Release From Team After 28-Point Loss\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "fullText": "if you thought Drake’s bets were reckless, meet Hollywood producer Jon Peters.\n\nThe former head of Sony Pictures bet $5 million on Jake Paul’s Netflix fight against Anthony Joshua, and is so convinced that “El Gallo” will pull off the upset, Peters even convinced his children to wager separate bets, with a total combined payoff in the neighborhood of $50 million.\n\nPerhaps I was wrong about bettors “going broke.”\n\n“This is my first time I’ve ever bet on anybody in my life, other than myself, because I’ve been watching his career, and he’s like me,” Peters told TMZ Sports. “He’s like a weed that grew into an oak tree. When I talked to Jake on the telephone, and he [said] he would rather die than lose, I wanted to hear that. The other guy, is this just another win? He’s a champion. He’s also seven years, eight years older. I think Jake may knock him out in the first round. I’ve been a fighter my whole life. I know about fighting. I just believe it. And I have my kids betting on it, too. With everybody betting, we could make $50 million.”\n\nDon’t worry, his kids are “all millionaires.”\n\n“I already told [Jake] that I have options on a movie called Bullitt, Steve McQueen movie,” Peters added. “And I’ve been wanting to do it with Brad Pitt, but he’s a little old — and Paul is a movie star. Girls like him, kids like him, people like him. He’s a modern day phenom. But once he wins this, I think he will want to go fight that big, tall guy in England. The shorter guy can punch up easier than a big guy can punch down. When you punch down, you lose your power. When you punch up, you twist your legs, and you snap that punch into the ribs, and you snap that punch into the head, and bang, there you go.”\n\nHard to imagine this iconic car chase with “El Gallo” behind the wheel.\n\nI don’t know if this qualifies as “suspicious betting activity” but it’s certainly raising a few eyebrows when you consider all the sports-related betting scandals over the last several weeks. With this kind of money in play, it will be hard to dodge allegations of fight fixing if Paul, who was outboxed by Tommy Fury, somehow beats the 28-4 Joshua, a former heavyweight champion with scary knockout power and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nOne more reason to tune into Netflix on Friday night, I suppose.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur find themselves at a familiar crossroads, balancing patience with performance as scrutiny intensifies around Thomas Frank’s early months in North London. According to reporting by Caught Offside, internal conversations have begun regarding Frank’s long term future, even though the club hierarchy are not yet preparing for decisive action.\n\nFrank arrived in the summer of 2025 with a reputation for tactical clarity and player development, yet results have failed to match expectation. As Caught Offside state, “The future of Thomas Frank as Tottenham Hotspur manager is becoming uncertain, with mounting pressure on the Danish coach following a string of poor performances and growing discontent among supporters.” That sense of unease has been fuelled by displays that have lacked cohesion and conviction.\n\nTottenham’s ownership group ENIC continue to show restraint. The report notes that “Spurs’ owners, ENIC, are not currently planning an immediate dismissal.” There remains a belief that Frank “deserves more time to implement his tactical ideas and stabilise the team.”\n\nHowever, patience is being tested by evidence on the pitch. Defeats and dropped points have carried weight beyond the league table. The 3-0 loss to Nottingham Forest is referenced as a flashpoint, while draws against lower ranked sides have deepened supporter frustration. One senior source sentiment captured in the piece suggests concern that the campaign could unravel if momentum is not recovered quickly.\n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, the issue appears less about isolated results and more about direction. The article highlights “lack of attacking rhythm, defensive vulnerability, and unclear identity” which are problems that resonate strongly with fans who expected immediate clarity from a coach renowned for structure.\n\nIf change becomes unavoidable, the name leading internal discussions is familiar. Caught Offside report that “Mauricio Pochettino [has been] identified as the strongest potential replacement.” His emotional connection to the club is underlined, with the reminder that “The Argentine, who famously guided Spurs to the Champions League final in 2019, still holds enormous affection among supporters.”\n\nThere is also the practical complication that “Pochettino is currently the head coach of the United States men’s national team.” Yet his understanding of Tottenham’s infrastructure and his history of developing young players are viewed as compelling reasons to consider a return, should circumstances align.\n\nWhile Pochettino is framed as the frontrunner, contingency planning is evident. Caught Offside confirm that “Tottenham have also shortlisted Oliver Glasner and Marco Silva.” Glasner’s FA Cup success at Crystal Palace and Silva’s disciplined work at Fulham are cited as examples of Premier League proven adaptability.\n\nThese names suggest Spurs are prioritising managers who can impose structure quickly, a telling detail given the current concerns around identity and control.\n\nFrom a Tottenham supporter’s perspective, this report cuts deep but also carries a strange sense of hope. Nobody wanted Thomas Frank to struggle, especially after the optimism that followed his appointment. Many fans accepted that early turbulence was inevitable. What hurts more is the feeling that Spurs still look uncertain about who they are meant to be.\n\nThere is sympathy for Frank, particularly given injuries and transition, yet patience in football is always conditional. Supporters want to see a clear idea, even if results lag behind. Right now, that clarity feels elusive. The pressure he faces is immense, not just from results but from the weight of history and expectation that clings to this club.\n\nThe mention of Mauricio Pochettino inevitably stirs emotion. For many fans, his era represents belief, progress, and identity. A return would not be about nostalgia alone, it would be about reconnecting with principles that once made Spurs competitive and coherent. At the same time, supporters understand the risks of looking backwards.\n\nWhat fans truly crave is alignment, between board, coach, and squad. Whether Frank can still deliver that remains uncertain, but this report makes one thing clear, the coming weeks could define not just his future, but the direction of Tottenham Hotspur itself.",

    "title": "College Football Playoff picks, predictions for 2025-2026 bracket: Who will win it all?",
    "description": "There was no shortage of drama this college football season, but how will it close out and who will hoist the championship trophy? Our experts give their picks.",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff has finally arrived — games were played, decisions were made and controversy reigned once again.\n\nThere was no shortage of drama this college football season. With the precipitous falloff of teams like Penn State, Clemson and LSU, the door was opened for newcomers like Tulane, James Madison and punchy little upstart Alabama.\n\nThe most controversial decision the CFP committee made was placing three-loss Alabama and two-loss Miami into the field and leaving Notre Dame out. That's despite the Tide getting shellshocked in the SEC title game and the Hurricanes being ranked behind the Irish since the very first set of rankings came out.\n\nBut alas, the CFP bracket is set, and 12 teams remain. Who will win it all?\n\nOur team of college football experts breaks it all down with their picks for every playoff game. Feel free to disagree, or to make your own picks in the comments below.\n\nA year ago, we saw Ohio State lose its final game before the playoff and then run through the field in one of the greatest postseason winning streaks in the history of the sport. This year, the Buckeyes lost to Indiana in the Big Ten championship game — a defeat that we believe will launch Ryan Day and Co. into another postseason run.\n\nThe Buckeyes are just too talented and playing too good of defense not to run through this field. That pick shouldn't surprise you, but how about my pick for runner-up: the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Tech's front seven is good enough to knock off Big Ten foes Oregon and Indiana and advance to the title bout.\n\nThings got tough for me in the semifinal round. The first two rounds are pretty straightforward. Alabama over Oklahoma was nearly a coin flip, but it feels like Oklahoma's luck is going to run out with an offense that needs to be better. I think Miami has enough to take down Texas A&M, even with new Kansas State coach Collin Klein still calling plays for the Aggies.\n\nAll four top seeds should win in the quarterfinals. The closest game could be the rematch between Ole Miss and Georgia. In the semifinals ... I went back and forth a lot. I think each of the top four seeds is more than capable of winning the national title. Texas Tech upsetting Indiana isn't a statement against the Hoosiers. I have no doubts about how good they are. I just wonder if the loss of Stephen Daley will loom large at some point in the playoff.\n\nOhio State vs. Georgia could be the game of the year and I'm not going to be surprised if it comes down to a late field goal once again. In the title game, I have to go with the Buckeyes over the Red Raiders. Tech's defense has been so, so good at forcing turnovers. But Ohio State's ability to protect the football — the Buckeyes have just nine turnovers in 13 games — will be the difference.\n\nWith the amount of time teams have to prepare, the first round of the playoff should go according to form with home teams holding serve. The one possible exception could be in Norman, where Oklahoma has to beat Alabama for a second time this season to advance. Asking any team to beat a quality opponent twice in a row is difficult in college football, but Alabama's specific weakness — running the football — plays into the hands of Oklahoma's defense to such a degree that the Sooners have a real edge in the matchup.\n\nI also expect to see a reversal from last year, where the four teams that got byes into the quarterfinal all lost. If you talk to enough coaches, they would rather have the extra week of rest over playing a first-round game, so this trend should start to even out soon. A lot of people will pick Oregon to beat Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl, but that defense is going to present real problems for the Ducks. It's hard to envision another Georgia quarterfinal exit given the way they played down the stretch, and both Indiana and Ohio State have taken care of business all season against lesser teams.\n\nIf we get semifinal matchups with Georgia vs. Ohio State and Texas Tech vs. Indiana, we should all feel very lucky because that lineup would truly reflect the four most dominant teams of the year in college football. From there, it would be anybody's ballgame in terms of making the national championship.\n\nIt’s not how you start, it’s how you finish. And throughout this year, nobody has been better at finishing moves than Georgia. The Bulldogs turn boa constrictor in the second half of their games, encircling opponents and then smothering them. They’ll pull the same move in the playoffs, letting Indiana, Ohio State and Oregon get the early acclaim and then suffocating them deep in January. Georgia is ragged, Georgia has exploitable holes, but Georgia’s defense is like the sunset, inevitable and everywhere.\n\nThe playoff gives teams a chance to right wrongs from the regular season, and both Alabama and Oregon will take advantage. Alabama will look like a decent team against Oklahoma, and then validate everyone’s belief in their playoff unworthiness by getting waxed by Indiana.\n\nOregon will have little trouble with JMU and will overcome Texas Tech in the great Booster Battle, and will avenge a regular-season loss to Indiana in the semis.\n\nOhio State vs. Georgia will be the best game of the playoffs; it’s just the Buckeyes’ bad fortune to (again) meet the Dawgs in the semis rather than the finals.\n\nOf course, if my preseason predictions are any indication — I had Texas over Penn State in the title game — I would not recommend wagering any of your actual money on these picks. You’d be better off wagering on Notre Dame to win.\n\nAlabama is the first three-loss team to earn an at-large bid to the CFP. The Crimson Tide won’t let the opportunity go to waste. They’ll avenge their Nov. 15 loss to Oklahoma. If Ty Simpson can protect the ball and reestablish a rhythm, Alabama can dig Oklahoma a hole that it won’t be able to climb out of. The Sooners are averaging just 2.9 yards per carry over their past three games, and quarterback John Mateer — seemingly still affected by his early-season hand injury — has completed just 43.4% of his passes traveling 10-plus air yards in 2025, per PFF.\n\nMiami and Texas A&M will put on the best show of the opening round. The Hurricanes will have chances for big plays. The Aggies’ aggressive defense allowed touchdowns of 50 and 80 yards against South Carolina on Nov. 15 and touchdowns of 29 and 35 yards in the second half of its loss to Texas on Nov. 28. That’s music to the ears of do-it-all wide receiver Malachi Toney and quarterback Carson Beck, who has thrown only one pick in his past four games.\n\nOregon won’t have too much trouble against a pesky James Madison squad, but it will get a glimpse of what’s to come when it faces Sahir West, who stacked three sacks in the Sun Belt title game. That’s because the Ducks’ quarterfinal opponent will be Texas Tech. Bolstered by an elite pairing of linebackers, namely Jacob Rodriguez, the revamped Red Raiders are third nationally with just 3.96 yards per play allowed this season. That defense will deliver when it needs to versus Oregon. Speaking of awesome defenses, Indiana has one, too. The Hoosiers will put an end to an Alabama offense that’s been increasingly one-dimensional.\n\nOle Miss is my surprise pick. Pete Golding is a stabilizing force in Oxford, and he’ll be aided by the return of soon-to-be LSU offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. The Rebels are enjoying their best season in program history, and Lane Kiffin’s departure won’t interrupt that run. Behind a persistent run game and a fun passing attack engineered by Trinidad Chambliss, Ole Miss will outscore Georgia in a rematch of the team’s Oct. 18 meeting. That said, the Rebels’ storybook season will come to a halt against Ohio State, which will snap back into form versus Texas A&M following the Buckeyes’ Big Ten championship defeat.\n\nOhio State will get another crack at Indiana. First the Hoosiers will expose Texas Tech’s red-zone issues — the Red Raiders are a ghastly 101st nationally in touchdown percentage (56.2%) down there — thanks to a Bryant Haines defense that’s tied for fourth in sacks and ranks second in tackles for loss. Indiana got after Julian Sayin and confused him by disguising coverages. The Buckeyes will have a better plan this time around during a week that won’t involve a signing day scare and offensive coordinator Brian Hartline being named USF’s head coach. Ohio State was held to 10 points against Michigan last year before exploding offensively in the CFP. With star receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate, there’s a good chance that happens again. Fernando Mendoza will win the Heisman, but Sayin will win the national title.",

    "fullText": "Today GitHub announced changes to pricing for GitHub-managed runners and introduced a new per-minute charge for organizations using self-hosted runners.\nBelow we’ll dive into what changed, the backstory, how companies have been using self-hosted runners, and how this affects third-party providers like us.\n\nThere are two main changes, in order of importance:\n\nGitHub Actions were released on November 13, 2019. Actions let individuals and organizations automate workflows on nearly any GitHub event (e.g., “issue created”),\nwith most usage focused on CI/CD for pull requests: running linters, executing tests in parallel, building deployable artifacts, and more.\nActions quickly dominated the CI/CD market and replaced Jenkins and other providers for many organizations on GitHub.\n\nGitHub Actions weren’t perfect, but they covered ~80% of most companies’ needs and were natively integrated into GitHub’s model, UI, and billing.\n\nThe biggest drawbacks of GitHub Actions were:\n\nOn April 22, 2020, support for self-hosted runners was released. This gave companies the flexibility to choose where and how they run Actions.\nTeams could run jobs on self-hosted machines within their own infrastructure, pick more powerful CPUs, and curate a “golden image” with the exact packages and tools their org needed.\n\nBest of all, GitHub’s orchestration was free for self-hosted runners. Companies paid only for the compute from their chosen providers while GitHub handled orchestration at no charge.\nToo good to be true — especially for large enterprises with the skills to operate their own runner fleets.\n\nSoon after, a new market emerged: companies providing custom runners for GitHub Actions. The winning strategy was to buy the fastest hardware available\nand place it in specialized data centers to squeeze out maximum performance. The common one-liner: “Our per-minute price is half as much, and the runners\nare twice as fast.” That’s an easy sell — promising to cut CI bills by roughly 4x.\n\nWe chose a different path. With Cirrus Runners, we price by concurrency (how many jobs you can run at once) and don’t charge per minute at all.\nThis maps directly to our cost model: we buy the hardware and place it in data centers on monthly contracts, unlike generic cloud providers where near-infinite scale comes with higher per-minute margins.\n\nLike any other pricing change, it’s bittersweet — sweet for ~99% of users and a little bitter for the top ~1%. In this case,\nteams that only use GitHub-managed runners will just see smaller bills. There’s no change to CPU speed, memory, or machine types — just pricing.\nBut the ~1% who push the limits on self-hosted will start to see an extra line item in their monthly bills.\n\nOur opinion is that this change has been a long time coming. GitHub’s functionality for self-hosted runners hasn’t seen much movement recently.\nThe announcement post indicated plans to invest in self-hosted experience and outlines a few upcoming improvements. Unfortunately,\nthese improvements don’t align with the most popular feature requests the community actually asked for for years.\nWe hope it’s only top of the iceberg and we’ll see more improvements but only time will tell.\n\nCirrus Runners has always been fixed-price for unlimited minutes, and it will remain so.\nOur principle has always been a fixed monthly price with no hidden costs—no extra charges for traffic or storage.\n\nOn average, our customers save around 15x compared to what they would have paid to GitHub. In that context,\nthe new per-minute fee is roughly ~0.1% of the effective per-minute cost our customers avoid by using our fixed-price model.",

    "description": "We replaced WebRTC with plain WebSockets for real-time GPU streaming and got lower latency, simpler infrastructure, and better reliability everywhere.",
    "fullText": "This is a really good article. WebRTC is like magic for demos and small peer to peer communications but really struggles after say 8 inbound video feeds. It is not the tech that fails. It is that the quality of the meeting is dictated by how well or badly the worst computer in the meeting can decode those incoming streams. I saw that Youtube uses RTSP for the streamer but was at one point using WebRTC for the watchers. That works very well as the server IP is public so you don't get into NAT hell. We're developing AI voice agents and experimenting with surfacing them in browsers but there are lots of extra moving parts to go from PSTN based system to webrtc/browser/stun/coturn/sfu and that is just the delivery layer! Websockets is a much more straightforward approach . The irony with plain old voice is that the customer and client expect it to work 100% of the time. There is zero tolerance for jitter, delay, dropped calls etc. for what is \"old\" tech.\n\nI look forward to seeing what happened!\n\n\"Next week: Why we threw all of this away.\"\n\nLove the pragmatism here. WebRTC is brilliant enginering but its a square peg in alot of client-server scenarios. The TURN server debugging nightmares you described are super real - we had similiar issues where 20% black screens with zero error messages drove everyone crazy. Switching to WebSockets cutting out the ICE negotiation dance and getting direct HTTPS proxy support is such a smart move for controlled deployments. Curious about the head-of-line blocking tradeoff tho when packet loss spikes.",

The HBM3E bandwidth advantage over MI300X is impressive but what really caught my eye is how the 126MB L2 cache almost completely offsets the cross-die latency penalty. Ran some FluidX3D variants last quarter and bandwidth-bound workloads like that absolutley benefit more from raw HBM throughput than extra L3 capacity. Dunno if this stays true for transformer inference where the attention mechanism can exploit larger caches, but for traditional HPC the B200's aproach seems optimal.Expand full commentReplyShareNo postsReady for more?",

    "description": "The biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model.",
    "fullText": "AI was big in 2025, but so were many other developments and worries.\n\nThe biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model. Let’s start, shall we?\n\nWhile most of the money went to proprietary models, open source AI datasets, orchestration frameworks, evaluation tools and guardrail stacks have all seen gains.\n\nSuch open source AI efforts as Common Corpus, along with the  dozens of AI projects hosted by the Linux Foundation’s AI & Data group are enabling us to use community infrastructure for generative AI rather than relying solely on proprietary APIs, making open AI stacks a serious option for businesses and users.\n\nWhile the open source AI definition remains controversial, and very few AI projects fully qualify as open source by the strict requirements of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) AI definition, AI remains built on a foundation of open source software. The debate over open weights, data and training code will continue, but even the most proprietary large language models (LLMs) couldn’t exist without open source programs.\n\nAgentic AI, owes everything to open source. To orchestrate our latest generation of AI agents, we’re using several programs.\n\nThe most important of these, at this early stage of the game, appears to be the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is an open standard and open source implementation for uniformly connecting agents to tools, files, databases and other systems.\n\nMCP is increasingly the “plumbing layer” under many agents and IDE assistants, and there are numerous open source MCP servers and toolkits that let any compatible agent framework plug into the same tools.\n\nMCP isn’t the only agentic AI middleware that’s speeding up:\n\nA Linux Foundation report released in August showed that venture capital‑backed commercial open source companies have outperformed comparable closed‑source vendors over the last 25 years.\n\nThat report, alongside open source adoption data from an April OSI survey, which from 96% of organizations are maintaining or increasing open source software use, has cemented commercial open source as the default way to build software.\n\nTogether, these reports are driving more funding, more mergers and acquisitions, and more “open core plus services” strategies around critical open source projects.\n\nOf course, we knew that. After all, a 2024 Harvard Business School study already showed that  96% of commercial programs rely on open source and that the total value of open source code comes to a cool $8.8 trillion. That still doesn’t stop companies that made the mistake of confusing open source as a software development model with a business model; it never was. It never will be.\n\nSo it is that in 2025, we saw more companies move from open source to fauxpen source. For example, the ScyllaDBteam announced in December 2024 that it would move to a single “ScyllaDB Enterprise” stream under a source‑available license.\n\nAt the library level, there have been high‑profile examples of previously permissive projects switching quietly to source‑available, paid‑for‑commercial‑use terms, such as the Fluent Assertions .NET testing library moving, this past January, from Apache‑2.0 to a proprietary source‑available license with per‑developer fees.\n\nThen, there’s the DevOps program Puppet. Although Puppet’s core codebase is still under the Apache 2.0 open source license, its commercial parent company, Perforce, has changed how official builds are distributed and licensed.\n\nWhat changed is that new “hardened” binaries and packages built by Puppet/Perforce are now shipped from a private repository. The Puppet Core End User License Agreement (EULA) offers a free tier capped at 25 nodes, with commercial licensing required for additional nodes. Effectively, this makes Puppet a source-available program, even though the code is technically still open.\n\nThe result in Puppet’s case is the same as we’ve seen in other such attempts to close once open source projects: Unhappy programmers have forked the project. The fork is known as OpenVox.\n\nThese forked projects, which include Elasticsearch with its fork OpenSearch, Redis with the Valkey fork, and Terraform with the OpenTofu fork, have been somewhat successful. All four forks have achieved meaningful traction, but at different scales and under different definitions of  “success.”\n\nOpenSearch appears to be the most successful. It reports strong growth, including double‑digit, 78%, year‑over‑year download increases and a roster of major members such as Amazon Web Services, Canonical, SAP and Uber.\n\nValkey has also proven to be popular. The latest release, Valkey 9, is reported to be far faster than the newest version of Redis. In particular, Valkey users report that it’s consistently ahead of comparable Redis releases on raw throughput, especially on larger, memory‑heavy workloads where Valkey’s multithreaded I/O and cache‑prefetching kick in.\n\nWhile OpenSearch and Valkey have both advanced beyond their parent projects, Terraform vs. OpenTofu is another story. People still see OpenTofu and Terraform as differing only in their licenses. Over the last few months, though, that’s been changing as OpenTofu, which joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in April, steers more of its own course. Latest releases now include state encryption, a feature the Terraform community has wanted for years, and early variable evaluation.\n\nFinally, OpenVox continues to present itself as a “soft fork.” Its directors want it to stay 100% compatible with Puppet so it can serve as a drop-in replacement for Puppet deployments. That, however, appears to no longer be possible, as Gene Liverman, the leader of OpenVox, wrote, “We can no longer guarantee that our modules will work with Puppet Core or Puppet Enterprise.”\n\nFrom the project maintainers’ viewpoint, Perforce is breaking compatibility. For now, though, OpenVox is essentially a healthy, community lifeboat rather than a full‑scale Puppet replacement ship.\n\nDespite the simple fact that we all depend on open source, all too many projects remain underfunded. Others, such as NET 6, are still popular, but their maintainers have quit supporting them. What’s a user to do?\n\nThis isn’t a new problem. Back in 2021, Tidelift, a security company that also financially supported open source maintainers, found that 46% of open source project maintainers received no pay at all. Almost as bad, even those who were paid, a mere 26% earn more than $1,000 per year for their work.\n\nThings have not improved. In fact, they’ve gotten worse. In 2024, Tidelift’s latest results showed that now 60% of open source maintainers are unpaid.\n\nAs  an open letter signed by 10 open source foundations  and published in September pointed out, “Most of these [open source] systems operate under a dangerously fragile premise: They are often maintained, operated, and funded in ways that rely on goodwill, rather than mechanisms that align responsibility with usage.”\n\nSo it is that, according to the open letter, “a small number of organizations absorb the majority of infrastructure costs, while the overwhelming majority of large-scale users, including commercial entities that generate demand and extract economic value, consume these services without contributing to their sustainability.”\n\nA specific example that I’ve been covering is how FFMpeg, which is used by everyone who watches videos over the Internet, is horribly underfunded, even as major companies such as Amazon, Google and Netflix depend on its code. There are many other such projects. This can not continue.\n\nThe answer is that companies must — Must — start financially supporting mission-critical open source projects. The cost to do this is minute compared to the damage they’d suffer if these projects folded or were hit by a major security problem.\n\nIn 2024, the xz data compression library code, which had been deliberately infected with malware, came close to inserting a backdoor into Fedora, Red Hat’s community Linux. Had it been successful, it might have ended up in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its clones.\n\nThis would have led to the greatest Linux security disaster to date. We dodged a bullet.\n\nUnfortunately, the open source software supply chain security is under sustained, high-volume attack, with npm- and PyPI-focused campaigns escalating.\n\nSeveral high-impact campaigns in 2025 centered on compromising open source package ecosystems, especially npm.\n\nIn November, researchers from Wiz, Aikido, and others detailed a “Shai-Hulud 2.0” wave of trojanized npm packages that exfiltrated developer and CI/CD credentials from environments using popular libraries tied to major Software as a Service and cloud tooling.\n\nTens of thousands of malicious repos were spun up as part of the campaign. GitLab’s vulnerability research team also reported a separate widespread npm supply chain attack that harvested credentials for GitHub, npm, and major clouds and propagated by infecting additional packages owned by victims.\n\nThese are not one-off instances. Industry threat reports in 2025 describe a surge in software supply chain attacks overall, with October setting a new monthly record, and open source ecosystems featuring prominently among the targets.\n\nAnalysis from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 and other research teams notes that attackers increasingly prefer compromising maintainer accounts and publish pipelines rather than core source repos, because this path can silently poison trusted packages at scale.\n\nA study by ReversingLabs, released in March, reported that, while observed open source malware packages have declined somewhat, the risk has shifted toward leaked developer secrets and build-time exposures.\n\nResearchers examining popular npm, PyPI, and RubyGems components continue to find hard-coded credentials, weak application hardening, and exposed data inside widely used binaries deployed in enterprises. That kind of mistake was stupid back in the ’80s, when I first encountered it in production software, and it’s unforgivable today.\n\nMaking matters worse, security companies such as JFrog and Veracode report that exploding dependency graphs, faster release cycles, and heavy reuse of open source libraries mean a single malicious or vulnerable package can ripple through thousands of downstream applications in days.\n\nThis dense interconnection makes the blast radius of attacks like the npm-focused campaigns in 2025 significantly larger than that of many earlier open source incidents, especially when the target libraries appear in 20 to 30% of scanned cloud environments.\n\nWhat can we do about it? We must more broadly adopt software bills of materials (SBOMs), Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)-style attestations, and tools from the Open Source Software Foundation ecosystem to track provenance and integrity of open source components.\n\nOpenSSF and its partners highlight initiatives such as Sigstore for keyless signing, Scorecard for automated project risk assessment, and the Open Source Project Security Baseline, which aim to give both maintainers and consumers clearer security expectations.\n\nEvery year, I tell people that they must take security more seriously. Lately, as open source supply chain violations become ever more common, I’ve been saying you must ensure the code in your supply chain is both safe and written by someone trustworthy.\n\nLooking ahead, I can only redouble these warnings. Now we’ve already had serious security breaches in the last few years. You remember: Solarwinds, JetBrains TeamCity, and Apache Log4j should all come to mind quickly. As bad as those were, worse security disasters lie ahead if we don’t take open source supply chain security much more seriously.",

    "title": "Pctx-Py – Code Mode for Python Tools and MCP",
    "description": "Announcing the pctx Python SDK, a websocket callback mechanism where agents can execute MCP and Python tools in a single Code Mode environment.",
    "fullText": "Through a websocket callback mechanism, agents can execute MCP and tools defined in any language within a single execution environment.\n\nCode Mode delivers dramatic token efficiency by letting agents orchestrate multiple tools through generated code instead of sequential tool calls. The challenge: you need your Python ML models, data pipelines, and business logic accessible alongside MCP servers for GitHub, Stripe, and other APIs. Previously, this meant rewriting Python tools in TypeScript or giving up Code Mode's efficiency gains.\n\nPort of Context released pctx-py, the first Code Mode architecture that supports any programming language while running 100% locally. Agents can now orchestrate Python tools and MCP servers together within unified Code Mode execution. Your existing Python codebase becomes available as typed functions alongside any MCP servers you've configured. The agent generates a single TypeScript code block that coordinates all operations—Python ML inference, database queries, and MCP API calls—in one efficient execution cycle.\n\nThis unlocks the full token efficiency of Code Mode without abandoning your Python ecosystem. Write tools in Python using familiar libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, asyncpg), register them with pctx, and agents can mix them freely with MCP servers. Single execution. No context serialization overhead. Type-safe orchestration across your entire tool set.\n\nMCP servers provide standardized access to external APIs—GitHub, Stripe, Slack, your internal services. They're designed for Code Mode, exposing typed function interfaces that agents can call from generated code. But your business logic, ML models, and data processing live in Python.\n\nBefore pctx-py, you faced an impossible tradeoff:\n\nOption 1: Rewrite Python tools in TypeScript\n\nOption 2: Use traditional tool calling for Python, Code Mode for MCP\n\nOption 3: Abandon Code Mode entirely\n\npctx-py eliminates this tradeoff: Python tools and MCP servers, unified in Code Mode. Your Python code registers as typed functions. Agents see Python tools and MCP servers as a single, cohesive API. One code block orchestrates everything.\n\nThe pctx code server connects Python tools and MCP servers through a websocket callback mechanism:\n\nMCP Servers: Connect via standard MCP protocol. Expose typed functions like github.create_issue() and stripe.get_customer().\n\nPython Tools: Register via pctx-py websocket connection. Expose typed functions like ml.predict_churn() and data.query_metrics().\n\nAgent's View: All tools appear as typed TypeScript functions in a single namespace. The agent generates code that freely mixes Python and MCP calls—ml.predict_churn() alongside github.create_issue()—without knowing which backend implements each function.\n\nThe code server routes each call to the appropriate runtime (Python process or MCP server), collects results, and returns them to the sandbox for continued execution. From the agent's perspective, everything is just typed functions available for orchestration.\n\nThe agent never knows where tools execute. Python tools, MCP servers, and future language SDKs all present the same interface to the TypeScript sandbox. The code server handles callback routing transparently.\n\npctx-py enables Python developers to define tools that agents can orchestrate through Code Mode:\n\nOnce your Python tools are registered, the agent receives them as typed functions alongside any MCP servers you've configured. The agent's language model generates TypeScript code that orchestrates these tools:\n\nThis code executes in a single pass. No sequential tool calls. No context serialization overhead. The code server routes each function call to its implementation—Python process, MCP server, or future language runtime—and returns results to the sandbox for continued execution.\n\nThe Pctx class wraps your Python tools alongside the three core Code Mode functions that enable agents to discover, inspect, and execute code with access to your tools.\n\nThe MCP ecosystem provides hundreds of pre-built servers for popular APIs: GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, Notion, Stripe. These give agents immediate access to external services. But your unique business logic lives in Python—ML models trained on your data, pipelines processing your formats, queries against your databases.\n\npctx-py lets you combine both: leverage the MCP ecosystem for standard integrations while adding Python tools for domain-specific operations. Agents orchestrate both in a single code block, eliminating the token overhead of traditional tool calling.\n\nPython's strength is data: pandas for transformation, scikit-learn for ML, asyncpg for databases, numpy for computation. These libraries represent decades of optimization and community investment. Rewriting them in TypeScript to fit Code Mode constraints means abandoning this ecosystem and duplicating battle-tested logic.\n\nWith pctx-py, Python tools stay in Python. Your ML inference runs with scikit-learn. Your data processing uses pandas. Your database queries use asyncpg. The code server handles orchestration and type safety while Python handles what it does best.\n\nTraditional tool calling serializes every tool definition into context: 200+ tokens per tool, multiplied by your entire tool set, repeated on every request. With 50 tools, you spend 10,000 tokens before any real work begins.\n\nCode Mode solves this by exposing tools as typed functions—~15 tokens per tool. But this only worked if you rewrote Python tools in TypeScript. pctx-py brings Python tools into Code Mode's efficient execution model. All your tools—Python and MCP—get Code Mode's token efficiency.\n\nDefine your tools and connect to your agent:\n\nEverything runs locally. No API keys required. Fully open source.\n\nAn agent orchestrates Python ML models alongside MCP servers to assess customer churn risk:\n\nThe agent generates TypeScript that orchestrates Python tools and MCP servers:\n\nSingle execution cycle. Type-safe orchestration. Tools in their native languages.\n\npctx and pctx-py are completely free and open \n\npctx represents the first Code Mode architecture designed for multi-language execution from the ground up. The websocket callback protocol that enables Python tools isn't Python-specific—it's a language-agnostic contract between the code server and tool runtimes. We're building SDKs for Go, Rust, and other languages using the same protocol.\n\nUnlike cloud-based Code Mode implementations locked to a single vendor's sandbox, pctx runs 100% locally on your infrastructure. As new language SDKs arrive, you'll be able to mix Python ML tools, Go infrastructure services, Rust performance-critical components, and MCP servers in the same Code Mode execution—all with the same token efficiency and type safety, all running on your own machines.\n\nAbout Port of Context: Port of Context builds infrastructure for production agentic AI, enabling secure and efficient connections between agents, tools, and data across language boundaries.",

    "description": "Taiwan’s government has ordered a one-year block of a popular, Chinese-owned social media app following its failure to cooperate with authorities over fraud-related concerns.",
    "fullText": "Taiwan’s government has ordered a one-year block of a popular, Chinese-owned social media app following its failure to cooperate with authorities over fraud-related concerns.\n\nXiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, has surged in popularity among young Taiwanese in recent years, amassing 3 million users in the self-ruled democracy of 23 million. But the Instagram-like platform has also stoked concerns among officials that it could be used in pro-Beijing propaganda or disinformation campaigns, which Taiwan says it has been battling for years.\n\nChina’s Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to annex it by force if necessary.\n\nTaiwan’s Ministry of the Interior on Thursday cited Xiaohongshu’s refusal to cooperate with authorities as the basis for the ban, claiming that the platform has been linked to more than 1,700 fraud-related cases that resulted in financial losses of 247.7 million Taiwanese dollars ($7.9 million).\n\n“Due to the inability to obtain necessary data in accordance with the law, law enforcement authorities have encountered significant obstacles in investigations, creating a de facto legal vacuum,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nCNN has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment. It is unclear when the ban will take effect. Users in Taiwan could still access the app on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe ban comes amid growing alarm among governments worldwide over cybersecurity vulnerabilities and disinformation campaigns associated with Chinese apps like Xiaohongshu and TikTok that have gained global popularity.\n\nChinese regulations require companies to store data domestically and allow the government access to that data. Beijing also actively surveils and censors content it deems unfavorable, a practice experts say can sway public opinion.\n\nUS Congress passed a law last year that forced TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the platform to an American owner or face a ban, which caused the app to go dark for several hours earlier this year. President Donald Trump later sought to salvage the platform and negotiated a deal with China, though a final agreement has yet to be inked.\n\nIndia blocked TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps over similar concerns in 2020.\n\nSeveral Western countries, including the US, the United Kingdom, and European Union nations, have banned TikTok on government devices on national security grounds since 2023. The US state of Texas has also added Xiaohongshu to its ban, pertaining to government-issued devices.\n\nAs early as 2019, Taiwan banned Xiaohongshu, TikTok, and its sister app in China Douyin from official devices.\n\nEarlier this week, Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs flagged five apps as posing “significant cybersecurity risks,” including Xiaohongshu, TikTok, X-like Weibo, and China’s everything app WeChat. These apps could collect sensitive data and share with third parties without consent, it said. A cybersecurity assessment conducted by the National Security Bureau also found that Xiaohongshu failed all of its evaluations.\n\nHowever, the ban has already sparked some backlash from users and opposition parties, who described it as an infringement on freedom of speech.\n\n“We once mocked people in China for needing VPNs to access information,” Lai Shyh-bao, a legislator of the main opposition party Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, said on Facebook. “Internet freedom in Taiwan is heading toward a day when people will need VPNs.”\n\nMajor international platforms such as Facebook, Google, LINE, and TikTok have all appointed legal representatives in Taiwan, complied with local regulations, and fulfilled their legal obligations, the Ministry of the Interior said.\n\nTaiwan authorities have requested that Shanghai-based Xiaohongshu submit concrete remedial plans, but the company has yet to respond, the ministry added.\n\n“This is not a problem unique to Taiwan. It exists around the world, and even within China itself this platform has repeatedly violated regulations…From our perspective, it is a malicious platform — one that is beyond legal oversight and operates with unclear intentions,” said Ma Shih-yuan, deputy minister of the interior, at a Thursday presser.",

    "description": "Roughly one-in-five U.S. teens say they are on TikTok and YouTube almost constantly. At the same time, 64% of teens say they use chatbots, including about three-in-ten who do so daily.",
    "fullText": "Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand teens’ use of social media, the internet and artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.\n\nThe Center conducted an online survey of 1,458 U.S. teens from Sept. 25 to Oct. 9, 2025, through Ipsos. Ipsos recruited the teens via their parents, who were part of its KnowledgePanel. The KnowledgePanel is a probability-based web panel recruited primarily through national, random sampling of residential addresses. The survey was weighted to be representative of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 who live with their parents by age, gender, race and ethnicity, household income, and other categories.\n\nHere are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology­­­.\n\nThis research was reviewed and approved by an external institutional review board (IRB), Advarra, an independent committee of experts specializing in helping to protect the rights of research participants.\n\nEven as teens express mixed feelings about social media’s impact, these sites remain a key part of their lives, with some using them “almost constantly.”\n\nNow, AI chatbots, like ChatGPT and Character.ai, are getting teens’ attention. Roughly two-thirds report using chatbots, including about three-in-ten who do so daily, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 1,458 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17.\n\nYoung people turn to a variety of platforms, but YouTube stands out for being used by nearly all teens. Roughly nine-in-ten report ever using it.\n\nTeens widely use three other platforms:\n\nFewer use Facebook (31%) and WhatsApp (24%). And no more than about one-in-five say the same of Reddit or X (formerly Twitter).\n\nToday’s online landscape for teens is marked by both stability and new trends.\n\nWhatsApp is one platform that stands out for its growth in recent years. Today, roughly a quarter of teens say they use WhatsApp, up from 17% in 2022.\n\nX and Facebook have declined in use over the past decade. Today, 16% of teens use X, down from 23% in 2022 and 33% in 2014-15. And Facebook, once the go-to platform for teens, is used today by about three-in-ten teens. This is far lower than the 71% in 2014-15, though on par with 2022.\n\nThe shares of teens who use other sites or apps, like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, have stayed relatively stable in recent years.\n\nJump to read about teens’ online experiences: Online platform use by demographic groups | Frequency of online platform use | Use of AI chatbots | Frequency of chatbot use | Internet use\n\nTeen use of specific online platforms varies across demographic groups – including when it comes to gender, race and ethnicity, age and household income.\n\nTeen girls are more likely to use Snapchat and Instagram. For example, 61% of girls say they use Snapchat, compared with 49% of boys.\n\nMeanwhile, boys are more likely to use Reddit (21% vs. 12%) and YouTube (94% vs. 89%).\n\nThere are differences in use by race and ethnicity across all the platforms asked about except Reddit. Black teens are more likely than their White or Hispanic peers to use Instagram, TikTok, X, Snapchat and YouTube. For example, 82% of Black teens say they use Instagram. This drops to 69% among Hispanic teens and is even lower for White teens (55%). And Black teens are more likely than Hispanic teens to use Facebook.1\n\nWhatsApp is used by a larger share of Hispanic and Black teens than White teens.\n\nOlder teens stand out from younger teens in using nearly every platform we ask about. For instance, three-quarters of 15- to 17-year-olds say they use Instagram, compared with 44% of 13- to 14-year-olds.\n\nYouTube is the only site measured that older and younger teens are equally likely to use.\n\nTeens in households with lower and middle incomes are more commonly using TikTok and Facebook, a largely similar pattern to previous years.\n\nFor instance, 46% of teens living in households earning less than $30,000 a year say they use Facebook. Similarly, 39% of those in households with incomes between $30,000 and $74,999 say the same. However, this drops to 27% among teens in households earning $75,000 or more.\n\nIn a pattern seen in previous Center surveys, a larger share of teens who identify as Democrats than Republicans say they use TikTok, Instagram, Reddit and YouTube.\n\nFor example, there is a large partisan gap for TikTok: 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning teens say they use TikTok, compared with 60% of Republicans and Republican leaners.\n\nYouTube is not only widely used, but it’s also the platform the most teens visit on a daily basis. Roughly three-quarters of teens say they use it every day.\n\nSomewhat smaller shares report going on two other platforms daily: TikTok (61%) and Instagram (55%).\n\nJust under half say they visit Snapchat every day (46%), while far fewer say the same of Facebook (20%).\n\nOverall, teen daily use of these platforms remains relatively stable from past years.\n\nSocial media is not only a daily feature in the lives of teens, some report using these platforms “almost constantly.” About one-in-five teens say this of TikTok and YouTube.\n\nFewer describe their use of Instagram and Snapchat as almost constant (12% for each). And just 3% say this of Facebook.\n\nAcross these five platforms, 36% of teens use at least one of these sites almost constantly.\n\nThe share of teens who say they are on TikTok almost constantly ticked up slightly to 21% this year, from 16% in 2022. The shares who report using YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook almost constantly have changed little since 2022.\n\nThere are some gender differences in frequency of using these sites or apps.\n\nSlightly larger shares of teen girls than boys report being on TikTok and Instagram almost constantly. Teen boys are more likely than girls to visit YouTube this often (20% vs. 13%).\n\nSimilar rates of girls and boys say they use Snapchat and Facebook almost constantly.\n\nBlack and Hispanic teens are particularly likely to report being on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram almost constantly.\n\nFor example, 35% of Black teens say they’re on YouTube almost constantly, compared with 23% among Hispanic teens. Both groups are much more likely than White teens (8%) to say this.\n\nThere are only small or no racial or ethnic differences in visiting Snapchat or Facebook almost constantly.\n\nAI chatbots have become more common in daily life, from education to entertainment. For the first time, we asked teens about their overall use of chatbots, how often they use them and which ones they turn to.\n\nA majority of teens say they use chatbots. Roughly two-thirds of teens (64%) say they ever use an AI chatbot. Fewer (36%) do not use this tool.\n\nWhile many teens use chatbots, there are some differences across demographic groups:\n\nAbout three-in-ten teens say they use AI chatbots every day, including 16% who do so several times a day or almost constantly.\n\nDaily use of chatbots differs somewhat by race and ethnicity as well as age:\n\nIn addition to understanding their overall use, we also asked teens about their use of six specific chatbots.\n\nChatGPT (59%) is by far the most widely used chatbot and the only one we measured that a majority of teens use.\n\nThis is more than twice the rate of the next most commonly used chatbots: Gemini (23%) and Meta AI (20%).\n\nFewer say they use Copilot, Character.ai and Claude.\n\nBlack and Hispanic teens are more likely than their White peers to say they use Gemini and Meta AI.\n\nBlack and White teens differ modestly in their use of ChatGPT and Character.ai.\n\nThere are no significant differences in use for Copilot or Claude.\n\nTeens ages 15 to 17 are more likely than those 13 to 15 to report using ChatGPT and Meta AI.\n\nChatGPT use is more common among teens in higher-income households. About six-in-ten teens living in households earning $75,000 or more (62%) say they use it. That compares with 52% of teens living in households earning less than $75,000.\n\nMeanwhile, lower- and middle-income teens are more likely to use Character.ai. Some 14% of teens in households with incomes of less than $75,000 report using it. This is double the rate among teens in households with incomes of $75,000 or more (7%).\n\nGo to the appendix for a full breakdown of AI chatbot use by demographic groups.\n\nThe survey also explores how often teens use the internet.\n\nNearly all U.S. teens (97%) say they use the internet daily, including four-in-ten who say they are almost constantly online.\n\nThe share of teens who say they’re online almost constantly is much higher today than a decade ago, though it’s a slight dip from last year.\n\nBlack (55%) and Hispanic teens (52%) are about twice as likely as White teens (27%) to say they’re online almost constantly.\n\nBeing online almost constantly is more common for older teens. While 43% of 15- to 17-year-olds report being online almost constantly, 34% of 13- and 14-year-olds report this.\n\nTeens living in households that earn less than $75,000 annually are more likely than those in households earning $75,000 or more to say they use the internet almost constantly.\n\nThere are no significant differences in internet use by gender.",

    "description": "Americans spent $175 million on these teas, jams and other products in 2024",
    "fullText": "Smashed into a jam, or dried and steeped as a tea, elderberries have been used by Indigenous peoples and in traditional medicine for thousands of years.\n\nNative Americans have relied on the small purple fruit to help lower fever and treat respiratory illness but the berries’ immune protective properties are also supported by western medicine. Americans spent $175 million on elderberry products in 2024.\n\nA handful of studies, over the past decade, show that consuming the berries in supplement form, as a syrup or tea could relieve cold symptoms and shorten the illness.\n\n“Elderberry cannot cure a cold or flu but may be beneficial to some people for symptom relief,” Dr. Kelly Erdos, a clinical pharmacist at Banner Baywood Medical Center, said in a statement.\n\nPart of the magic may have to do with the berry’s antioxidants, substances that help prevent cell damage that can lead to chronic disease.\n\n“It could also increase your risk for things like colds and flu, since if your cells are working to fight free radicals from smoke, allergens or pollution, they may not be able to fight off viruses as efficiently,” Erdos noted.\n\nElderberries contain anthocyanins - pigments that give berries their color. Anthocyanins are also potent antioxidants that have been associated with lowering blood pressure and provide natural compounds known as flavonoids.\n\nAfter bacteria in our gut breaks down flavonoids, they’re used to benefit different parts of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAnd the berries contain a good amount of vitamin C, which has been shown to reduce the length of a cold, as well.\n\n\"If you were going to have a common cold that lasts about seven days, it may cut it down about 13 hours,\" Dr. Jesse Bracamonte, a Mayo Clinic family physician, said of vitamin C.\n\nThere are six to 35 milligrams of vitamin C in each 100 grams of elderberries. Women should get around 75 milligrams a day of vitamin C and men should get 90 milligrams, according to federal health guidance.\n\nSome doctors further cite a protein in elderberries called hemagglutin that has been shown to help prevent infection.\n\n“This protein can stop a virus’s ability to replicate and penetrate cell walls, preventing a virus from causing an infection to take over the body,” the Lam Clinic says.\n\nSo, should you add them to your diet?\n\nElderberries are toxic to humans when uncooked, resulting in diarrhea, vomiting and nausea. But they are safe when cooked, which eliminates the toxicity in elderberries.\n\nThey’re commonly sold in pies, jams, juices, and jellies, as well as dietary supplements. Elderflower tea comes from the same plant that produces the berries, known as Sambucus.\n\nElderberry dietary supplements are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and people should talk to their doctor before taking new products.\n\nStill, the berries boast benefits beyond immune health and researchers have found that drinking 12 ounces of the juice every day for a week can improve gut health and aid weight loss.\n\nProducts using elderberry extracts can soothe the skin.\n\n“If you like elderberry syrup or jam, you can eat it. It’s a healthy food when cooked properly,” integrative medicine specialist Dr. Naoki Umeda told the Cleveland Clinic.",

    "description": "Two new surveys zero in on Gen X angst when it comes to retirement savings, why they’re in this mess, and how they’re taking steps to dig themselves out.",
    "fullText": "For Gen X, fears of a future retirement savings shortfall are finally hitting in the gut.\n\nWith the first of this cohort turning 60 this year, decades of kicking retirement savings down the road have come back to bite them.\n\nTwo new surveys zero in on their angst, why they’re in this mess, and how they’re taking steps to dig themselves out.\n\nLet’s start with the hand-wringing. More than 8 in 10 are worried that they will not have enough money for a comfortable retirement, according to the Schroders 2025 US Retirement Survey, which provided an exclusive first look at the report to Yahoo Finance.\n\nOn average, Gen Xers expect to retire with $711,771 saved — below the estimated $1.2 million they believe they’ll need.\n\n“Many Gen Xers entered the workforce just before the dot-com crash, then endured the global financial crisis and the 2020 bear market that was sparked by the pandemic,” Deb Boyden, Schroders' head of US defined contribution, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis is also the test generation for employer-provided 401(k) plans, which emerged just as they were entering the job market.\n\nAs I explain in my latest book, \"Retirement Bites: A Gen X Guide to Securing Your Financial Future,\" little financial education was initially provided to help workers understand these plans, investment options were limited, and only relatively small amounts were permitted to be invested. Core features to boost savings, like auto-enrollment for employees and auto-escalation of the amount saved each year, weren’t around, so savings inertia set in.\n\nGen X is also operating with high levels of credit card debt and student loan debt, making retirement saving one of numerous pressing priorities. Among those currently participating in a workplace retirement plan, nearly one-quarter of Gen Xers borrowed from their account, compared to 17% of millennials and 21% of baby boomers, per the Schroders data.\n\nThe top three reasons were paying for unforeseen family or personal emergencies, paying down debt, and keeping up with the increasing cost of living.\n\nGen Xers have “repeatedly been encouraged to save for retirement, but this advice wasn’t always easy to follow amid an array of competing priorities, which ranged from childcare to student loans and caring for aging parents,” Boyden said.\n\nThe good news: There’s still runway ahead.\n\nRight now, many Gen X workers are in their highest-earnings years, so pumping up retirement savings with catch-up contributions can provide a significant boost, combined with a drilled-down focus on budgeting to spotlight lifestyle creep. That due diligence exercise is the best way to trim spending and free up money for additional contributions.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Thousands of people flocked to Tokyo's Ueno zoo to have a last glimpse of the popular twin pandas that are set to return to China next month, worried if or when they get to see their replacement in Japan as Tokyo's relations with Beijing sunk.\n\nThe Tokyo metropolitan government announced Monday that Xiao Xiao and his sister Lei Lei will return to China in late January and that their last day of public viewing will be Jan. 25.\n\nTheir departure will leave Japan without a panda for the first time in more than half a century. Prospects for their replacement are not favorable as ties between the two countries have plunged in recent weeks.\n\nGiant pandas are native to southwestern China and serve as an unofficial national mascot. Beijing lends them to other countries as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over them and any cubs they produce.\n\nYuki Imai, a panda fan visiting from the neighboring Kanagawa prefecture, said she was shocked by the news of the twins' return and decided to visit. “I thought I should come and see them soon while I still can.”\n\nMany queued for more than two hours to get to see the twins for one minute. Kazuhiro Yamamoto said he came to see the pandas with his wife Hiroko “for the one last time,” and that the twins may be returning sooner due to the rocky relations.\n\nThe four-year-old twins were born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens in June, 2021, and raised there, but they remain on loan from China and must be returned by February.\n\nRelations between Japan and China have worsened since Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in early November that its military could get involved if China were to impose a naval blockade or other action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nChina has since restricted tourism to Japan, and cultural events and exchanges between local governments have been canceled.\n\nThe row escalated this month when Chinese drills involving an aircraft carrier near southern Japan prompted Tokyo to scramble fighter jets. Japan also protested that its aircraft were targeted by repeated radar-locking — a move considered as possible preparation for missile firing.\n\nTadashi Nakatani, a 51-year-old calligrapher at a temple who regularly visits from his hometown of Kamakura, west of Tokyo, said international relations may affect the panda diplomacy, but he has hope.\n\n“When things calm down and the relationship becomes stable, I sincerely hope that pandas will come again, and that a day will come when everyone can enjoy seeing them again.”\n\nChina sent the first pair of pandas to Japan in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Since then, Japan has never been left without a panda.\n\nThousands of visitors formed a long line outside the zoo Tuesday morning. During their one-minute viewing time at the panda zone, visitors called out the twins’ names and took photos or videos as the pair nibbled bamboo sticks or strolled around.\n\nBeginning next week, only up to 4,800 visitors who successfully booked their 1-minute slot online will be able to see the beloved twins, according to the zoo.\n\nJapan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Monday that pandas have long been loved by Japanese people and he hoped the friendship through panda diplomacy between the two countries will continue.\n\n“Exchanges through pandas have contributed to improve the public sentiment between Japan and China, and we hope the relationship will continue,” Kihara said. He noted that a number of local municipalities and zoos have expressed hope that new pandas will be loaned out soon.\n\nUeno Zoological Gardens curator Hitoshi Suzuki, referring to the panda twins, said raising them in good health was challenging. “But they gave us many kinds of joy and surprise. They also brought great delight to our visitors. We have nothing but words of gratitude.”\n\nThe zoo plans to promote other animals to make up for the absence of the pandas, while waiting for their replacement. “We will keep the panda area for the time being, so that we can accommodate possible new arrivals at any time.”",

    "title": "The Largest Immigrant Groups In The U.S., Ranked — And How They Arrived",
    "description": "These are the largest immigration groups in the U.S. and how they came here.",
    "fullText": "America has always been a nation shaped — and reshaped — by waves of immigration, but few eras have been as politically charged or emotionally fraught as the current moment. With record numbers of people arriving at the border, legal pathways in constant flux, and immigration dominating nearly every election-cycle debate, the question of who is coming to the United States — and how they are getting here — has become one of the country’s fiercest hot-button issues. Politicians weaponize it, communities feel its impact, and families live its consequences every day.\n\nBut behind the headlines, outrage, and policy battles lies a deeper, more human story: millions of people from around the world building lives, roots, and futures across the U.S. Their journeys are as diverse as their destinations — shaped by conflict, climate change, opportunity, and the promise that America still represents for so many. Understanding the largest immigrant groups in the country — and the routes, risks, and realities of how they arrived — offers a broader, clearer picture of the nation’s identity and the forces shaping its future.\n\nHere are the largest immigrant populations in the U.S. today — and the stories behind how they got here.\n\nMexican immigrants have long been the largest group of foreign-born residents in the U.S., making up a significant portion of the population. They often arrive through family reunification, employment opportunities, or seeking asylum from violence and economic hardship. Living predominantly in states like California, Texas, and Arizona, they have profoundly influenced American cuisine, music, and the labor market. While many face challenges such as legal hurdles and societal prejudice, their contribution to the U.S. is undeniable.\n\nThe Pew Research Center highlights that Mexican immigrants have increasingly become naturalized citizens, reflecting deeper integration into American society. This trend speaks to a growing commitment to establishing roots and participating in civic life. Despite political debates surrounding immigration policy, the Mexican community's resilience and adaptability continue to shape their American experience. They prove that while borders may separate lands, communities can build bridges through shared values and aspirations.\n\nIndia stands as the second-largest source of immigrants to the U.S., with many arriving on employment-based visas thanks to their high educational attainment. Indian immigrants often excel in fields such as technology, medicine, and academia, significantly contributing to these industries' growth. Silicon Valley, in particular, has seen a remarkable influence from Indian professionals, leading to a fusion of innovation and cultural exchange. Yet, beneath the surface of professional success lies the personal challenge of balancing dual cultures and identities.\n\nFor many Indian immigrants, community centers and cultural festivals provide a vital link to their heritage. These events offer a space to share traditions with younger generations and foster a sense of belonging. While adapting to a new country comes with its own set of hurdles, the Indian community’s strong family ties and cultural pride are central to their resilience. Their ability to integrate while preserving their rich cultural heritage is a testament to the enduring spirit of immigrants everywhere.\n\nChinese immigrants have a storied history in the U.S., dating back to the Gold Rush era, and continue to be one of the largest immigrant groups today. Many arrive through student visas, seeking education and the American Dream, while others come through employment-based channels. Major cities like New York and San Francisco host vibrant Chinatowns, which have become cultural landmarks offering a taste of China right in the U.S. These communities serve as a hub for new arrivals, providing familiar languages and customs in a foreign land.\n\nA study from the Migration Policy Institute notes that Chinese immigrants have seen a notable increase in family-based green cards, indicating a trend towards long-term settlement. This shift suggests a burgeoning commitment to building lives in America, complete with family and community. While they face significant challenges, such as navigating immigration laws and combating stereotypes, their journey is marked by perseverance and cultural exchange. The Chinese American narrative is one of blending tradition with modernity, crafting a unique identity within the American mosaic.\n\nThe Filipino community represents a significant portion of the immigrant population, with many arriving in the U.S. through family-sponsored visas and employment in healthcare and service industries. Their presence is particularly strong in states like California and Hawaii, where they have woven their cultural traditions into the American fabric. Filipino immigrants often bring with them a rich tapestry of cultural customs, from vibrant festivals to culinary delights, contributing to the multicultural landscape of the U.S. Despite the distance from home, strong familial bonds and a supportive diaspora network provide a safety net for many.\n\nFilipino immigrants frequently navigate the challenges of assimilation while maintaining ties to their heritage. The community often relies on faith and communal gatherings as pillars of support, helping to ease the transition into American life. With a high proficiency in English, Filipinos often integrate more smoothly into the workforce, though they still encounter obstacles such as wage disparities and discrimination. Their resilience and community-focused approach not only enrich their lives but also those of the broader American society.\n\nEl Salvadorans represent the largest Central American immigrant group in the U.S., many of whom have fled violence and economic instability. They predominantly settle in urban areas like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., where robust communities have developed over the years. These immigrants often face the dual challenge of dealing with trauma from their home country while adapting to a new and sometimes unwelcoming environment. Despite these hurdles, the Salvadoran community is known for its strong work ethic and cultural pride.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) has provided a lifeline for many Salvadorans, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. even if their immigration status is uncertain. This status has offered a sense of stability, although its future remains a political hot topic. The Salvadoran community's resilience is evident in their rich cultural expressions and community-building efforts. From vibrant pupuserías to cultural festivals, they contribute to the diverse tapestry of American life.\n\nVietnamese immigrants have established a significant presence in the U.S., many arriving as refugees following the Vietnam War. Over the decades, they have built thriving communities, especially in states like California and Texas. Vietnamese Americans have enriched the cultural landscape, with contributions ranging from cuisine to art and business. Yet, the journey to establishing these communities has been fraught with challenges, including overcoming language barriers and trauma from their war-torn past.\n\nCommunity support and family networks play a crucial role in the Vietnamese American experience. These immigrants often prioritize education and economic stability, with a strong focus on future generations. While they continue to navigate the complexities of identity and belonging, Vietnamese Americans have made indelible contributions to the cultural and economic fabric of the nation. Their story is one of perseverance, triumph, and the enduring American Dream.\n\nCuban immigrants have a unique immigration story, often driven by political factors, with many seeking refuge from communist rule. The Cuban American community has a prominent presence in cities like Miami, where they have significantly influenced local politics and culture. Cuban immigrants have historically benefited from favorable immigration policies, such as the Cuban Adjustment Act, which provided a pathway to legal residency. This facilitated their integration into American society, allowing them to become influential both economically and politically.\n\nThe Migration Policy Institute highlights that Cuban immigrants tend to have higher rates of naturalization compared to other Latin American groups. This has enabled them to wield considerable political power, particularly in Florida, where their votes can sway elections. Despite facing challenges such as cultural adaptation and generational divides, Cuban Americans continue to thrive. Their journey is marked by a profound love for both their homeland and their adopted country, reflecting the complex nature of immigrant identity.\n\nDominican immigrants have carved out vibrant communities across the U.S., particularly in New York City, where they form a significant part of the city's cultural mosaic. Many Dominicans come to the U.S. in search of better economic opportunities, often through family reunification or employment visas. Their influence is evident in the lively neighborhoods of Washington Heights and the Bronx, where Dominican culture is celebrated through music, dance, and cuisine. Yet, beneath the vibrant exterior lies the challenge of navigating racial and economic disparities.\n\nThe Dominican community places a strong emphasis on family ties and cultural heritage, often maintaining connections with relatives back home. This transnational identity shapes their American experience, influencing everything from business ventures to community activism. As they continue to tackle issues like immigration status and socioeconomic barriers, Dominicans in the U.S. remain steadfast in their pursuit of the American Dream. Their resilience and cultural pride are key components of their identity and strength.\n\nGuatemalan immigrants form a growing part of the U.S. immigrant landscape, with many fleeing violence and poverty in their home country. They often settle in states like California and Florida, where established communities offer support and resources. Their contribution to American society is most evident in sectors such as agriculture and construction, where they play a crucial role. However, Guatemalan immigrants often face significant challenges, including navigating complex immigration processes and overcoming language barriers.\n\nStrong community networks and a commitment to cultural preservation help Guatemalans maintain a sense of identity amidst the challenges of immigrant life. Cultural events and festivals serve as a reminder of their roots, offering a sense of belonging and unity. As they strive for better opportunities, Guatemalans continue to enrich the diverse American tapestry. Their journey is one of hope, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to building a better future.\n\nKorean immigrants have made significant strides in the U.S., establishing vibrant communities and contributing to various industries. Many Koreans arrive through employment-based visas or family sponsorship, settling in cities like Los Angeles and New York. Korean cultural influence is widely felt, from the global popularity of K-pop to the culinary delights of Korean barbecue. Yet, the path to integration is often marked by challenges such as navigating linguistic barriers and achieving economic stability.\n\nThe Korean American community places a high value on education, often pushing successive generations towards academic and professional success. This focus has led to a strong presence in fields like medicine, technology, and business. While they face challenges like racial discrimination and intergenerational gaps, their resilience and community solidarity are formidable. Korean Americans continue to be a vital part of the U.S. cultural and economic landscape, blending tradition with modernity in their pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nHonduran immigrants are part of the growing Central American presence in the U.S., often escaping violence and economic strife back home. Many settle in states such as Texas and Florida, where established communities provide a sense of familiarity and support. Hondurans contribute significantly to sectors like agriculture and service industries, bolstering the American economy with their hard work and dedication. However, the journey to stability is often fraught with obstacles, including the challenges of legal status and economic disparities.\n\nCommunity organizations and networks play a crucial role in supporting Honduran immigrants as they navigate their new lives. These groups offer resources and advocacy, helping to address issues like access to education and healthcare. Despite the challenges they face, Hondurans in the U.S. remain committed to building better futures for themselves and their families. Their stories are marked by hope, resilience, and the determination to overcome adversity.\n\nJamaican immigrants have a long history in the U.S., known for their vibrant culture and significant contributions to American music and sports. Many Jamaicans arrive through employment visas or family reunification, with a strong presence in cities like New York and Miami. Their cultural influence is profound, seen in the popularity of reggae music, jerk cuisine, and the achievements of figures like Usain Bolt. Yet, while they enrich the cultural landscape, Jamaican immigrants also grapple with challenges like racial discrimination and economic inequality.\n\nThe Jamaican community is characterized by its strong sense of identity and pride, often celebrating their heritage through festivals and community events. These gatherings offer a space to preserve culture and foster connections, providing support in navigating the complexities of immigrant life. As they continue to contribute to American society, Jamaicans demonstrate resilience and adaptability. Their story is one of cultural exchange, perseverance, and the enduring quest for the American Dream.\n\nColombian immigrants have established flourishing communities in the U.S., particularly in states like Florida and New York. Many Colombians come in search of better economic opportunities, fleeing violence and instability in their home country. Their influence is felt in various sectors, from business ventures to cultural festivals, adding to the rich tapestry of American society. However, the path to integration is often marked by challenges, including legal hurdles and economic disparities.\n\nCommunity support and cultural pride are central to the Colombian immigrant experience. Through vibrant events and traditions, Colombians maintain a connection to their heritage while navigating their new lives. Despite the obstacles they face, Colombians in the U.S. remain committed to building better futures for themselves and their families. Their resilience and cultural contributions continue to shape the American narrative, showcasing the enduring spirit of immigrants everywhere.\n\nHaitian immigrants form a vital part of the U.S. immigrant community, many arriving as refugees from political turmoil and natural disasters. They primarily settle in states like Florida and New York, where strong diaspora networks offer support and resources. Haitian culture is vividly expressed through art, music, and cuisine, enriching the American cultural landscape. Yet, the journey to stability is often challenging, with issues such as legal status and economic inequality posing significant hurdles.\n\nFaith and community play a crucial role in the Haitian American experience, providing a foundation for navigating the complexities of immigrant life. Churches and community organizations offer a sense of belonging and advocacy, helping Haitians address issues like housing and education. Despite the challenges they face, Haitians remain resilient and determined, contributing significantly to American society. Their story is one of perseverance, cultural pride, and the unyielding pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nBrazilian immigrants are an emerging presence in the U.S., drawn by economic opportunities and political stability. Many settle in states like Massachusetts and Florida, where vibrant communities offer cultural familiarity and support. Brazilian culture is celebrated through festivals, music, and cuisine, adding to the diverse American mosaic. However, the path to integration is often marked by challenges, including legal hurdles and cultural adaptation.\n\nCommunity support and cultural pride are central to the Brazilian immigrant experience. Through vibrant events and traditions, Brazilians maintain a connection to their heritage while embracing their new lives. Despite the obstacles they face, Brazilians in the U.S. remain committed to building better futures for themselves and their families. Their resilience and cultural contributions continue to shape the American narrative, showcasing the enduring spirit of immigrants everywhere.",

    "fullText": "The 1970s gave us muscle cars, oil crises, and some truly wild automotive experiments. While everyone's chasing Camaros and Corvettes at auctions, there's a whole world of fascinating machines from that decade that fly under the radar.\n\nThese overlooked cars offer character, quirky engineering, and surprisingly solid performance without the six-figure price tags. Some were ahead of their time, others were wonderfully weird, and a few were just plain misunderstood.\n\nAlright, time to check out these gems from the '70s that deserve more love from collectors.\n\nThe Gremlin gets mocked for its chopped-off rear end, but this little oddball was actually pretty clever. AMC created it by literally cutting down a Hornet to compete in the subcompact market, and it worked.\n\nWith optional V8 power, the Gremlin could surprise unsuspecting muscle cars at stoplights, and its quirky styling has aged into legitimate charm. You could get one with a 304 cubic inch V8 that made around 150 horsepower, which was respectable for the era.\n\nWhile collectors chase AMX models, clean Gremlins remain affordable and are starting to earn respect as honest, unpretentious American compacts.\n\nThe wedge-shaped TR7 was supposed to be Triumph's answer to modern sports car design, and while it had production issues, the driving experience was genuinely fun. Its \"wedge\" design was polarizing, earning the tagline \"The Shape of Things to Come,\" though reliability concerns overshadowed its decent handling.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced about 92 horsepower in North American spec, which sounds modest but kept the car nimble and engaging. Later TR8 models got a V8, but even the standard TR7 offers an accessible entry into British sports car ownership.\n\nThese days, you can find them for a fraction of what you'd pay for an MGB or Spitfire.\n\nBefore the 240Z became a collector darling, Datsun was building sensible sedans that happened to be incredibly well-engineered. The 710 was a reliable, practical sedan that competed with Toyota Corollas but somehow never achieved the same nostalgic status.\n\nIts 2.0-liter engine made around 94–97 horsepower (SAE net), depending on emissions spec and could reliably cruise all day without complaint. The wagon versions are particularly appealing today, offering classic lines and surprising cargo space.\n\nWhile collectors obsess over Z-cars, the humble 710 represents Datsun's commitment to quality without demanding classic car prices.\n\nSold through Mercury dealers, the Capri II was a captive import from Ford of Europe rather than a traditional American pony car. Built in Germany, it brought European hatchback styling and a more refined driving feel to the U.S. market at a time when domestic performance cars were shrinking.\n\nPower came from sensible options like the 2.3-liter four-cylinder or an optional 2.8-liter V6, prioritizing balance and fuel economy over straight-line speed.\n\nWhile it never tried to compete directly with muscle cars, the Capri II offered tidy handling, distinctive fastback styling, and a level of character that set it apart from its American contemporaries. Overshadowed by Mustangs and later fox-body Capris, the Capri II remains an overlooked slice of 1970s transatlantic automotive history.\n\nThis mid-engine, targa-topped Italian was designed by Bertone and offered sports car thrills in an affordable package. With just about 75 horsepower from its 1.5-liter engine, the X1/9 wasn't about straight-line speed but rather handling and driver engagement.\n\nThe mid-engine layout gave it phenomenal balance, making it a blast on twisty roads. Its removable roof panel predated the Miata's popularity by decades and offered open-air driving without sacrificing structural rigidity.\n\nWhile Fiat's rust reputation scared some buyers away, well-maintained examples prove that proper Italian sports cars don't need big price tags.\n\nThe Volaré replaced the beloved Valiant and initially suffered quality issues, but the platform itself was quite capable. Once Chrysler sorted out the early problems, these became solid, dependable cars with comfortable rides.\n\nYou could option them with everything from slant-six engines to 360 cubic inch V8s making around 160–170 horsepower (SAE net), depending on year/trim. The Road Runner package added some muscle car DNA to a practical body, creating an interesting sleeper.\n\nEarlier Mopars often get all the love, but clean examples represent affordable entry into Chrysler performance heritage.\n\nBefore Subaru became synonymous with crossovers, they built a compact pickup truck with rear-facing jump seats in the bed. The BRAT (Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter) cleverly avoided the chicken tax by including those seats, classifying it as a passenger vehicle.\n\nIts four-wheel drive system was ahead of its time for a small truck, and the about 67 horsepower from its flat-four engine was adequate for the lightweight body. The quirky design and practical utility made it perfect for outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nToday, rust-free BRATs are increasingly hard to find, but they remain much more affordable than vintage Toyota trucks.\n\nThe Alfetta brought Italian performance engineering to the sedan market with its unique transaxle layout for perfect weight distribution. Named after Alfa's successful racing cars, it featured a rear-mounted transmission that helped achieve 50/50 balance.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced around 109-130 PS but delivered smooth power and that distinctive Alfa character. Its handling was exceptional for a sedan, rewarding drivers who appreciated precise steering and responsive chassis dynamics.\n\nWhile collectors chase Spiders and GTVs, the Alfetta sedan offers genuine Alfa driving pleasure without the premium prices.\n\nThe Vega had serious quality issues at launch, but the GT version with its sport suspension and styling upgrades was actually entertaining to drive. Its aluminum-block four-cylinder was innovative if flawed, producing around 85 horsepower (SAE net) in typical mid-’70s GT spec (varies by year/engine option).\n\nThe lightweight body and decent handling made it competitive in autocross and club racing. Many enthusiasts have discovered that dropping in a small-block V8 turns the Vega into a genuine pocket rocket.\n\nSure, the reputation keeps values low, but that means more opportunity for builders and drivers who want an affordable project.\n\nFrench engineering excellence doesn't get enough credit in American collector circles, and the 504 proves that point beautifully. This sedan won European Car of the Year and featured independent suspension, comfortable seating, and surprisingly robust construction.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder made around 96 horsepower but delivered smooth, refined power delivery. Its ride quality was exceptional, combining European handling with comfortable long-distance cruising.\n\nWhile Citroëns get the quirky attention, the 504 represents practical French design that actually worked reliably in American conditions.\n\nBefore the RX-7 became a rotary icon, Mazda built the smaller RX-3 with the same spinning triangle magic. U.S.-market RX-3s used the larger 12A rotary, with published outputs closer to about 90 horsepower in North American spec; the engine’s willingness to rev was a big part of the appeal.\n\nRacing versions dominated their classes in IMSA competition, proving the chassis was more than just economical transportation. The coupe and wagon versions offer distinctive styling that stands out from typical Japanese offerings.\n\nCollectors focus on RX-7s and leave these earlier rotaries as affordable alternatives with genuine motorsport heritage.\n\nVolvo built a reputation on safety and practicality, but the 242 GT showed they understood driving dynamics too. This special edition featured unique aerodynamic bodywork, sport suspension, and distinctive alloy wheels.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder produced around produced about 123 hp in fuel-injected B21E form (outputs varied by market and rating standard) and delivered surprisingly spirited performance. Its handling was sharp for a Volvo, rewarding drivers who pushed it through corners.\n\nWhile 240-series cars are common, finding a genuine GT with its special equipment is increasingly difficult, yet they remain affordable compared to BMW 2002s.\n\nThese twelve overlooked machines from the 1970s prove that collector appeal isn't always about what's most expensive or most famous. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, quirky charm, or genuine driving pleasure that got overshadowed by flashier contemporaries. The best part about exploring these forgotten gems is that you can actually afford to buy one, drive it, and enjoy it without worrying about depreciation or astronomical restoration costs. As the collector car market continues evolving, smart enthusiasts are discovering that sometimes the most rewarding classics are the ones everyone else walked past.",

    "title": "What are TPUs? Everything you need to know about Google's market-moving AI chips.",
    "description": "Google's TPU business is ramping up. Here's everything you need to know about Google's AI chips, and what they mean for Nvidia's dominance.",
    "fullText": "Google has been in the AI chip game for more than a decade. Now its custom hardware is moving markets.\n\nShares of Nvidia and other chipmakers tumbled last month following a report that Meta — one of Nvidia's largest customers — was exploring a deal to use Google's AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.\n\nGoogle has primarily used its TPUs for internal use, but it also leases them to external customers through the cloud. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the dominant provider of AI chips with its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nGoogle has a potential blockbuster business to unlock. In a research note sent December 2, Morgan Stanley projected that 5 million of Google's TPUs will be purchased in 2027 and about 7 million in 2028, significantly increasing its prior projections.\n\nHere's a breakdown of everything you need to know about TPUs, what they're used for, and when they might become a more prominent threat to Nvidia's chip dominance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Google needed more powerful and specialized compute power for the type of AI work it wanted to do. A team led by the now-CEO of Groq, Jonathan Ross, designed a new chip based on a specific type of integrated circuit for machine learning. The TPU was born.\n\nGoogle has continued to improve and refine its TPUs over the years, making them more effective at both training models and inference, the process where a trained model answers a question or performs a task. As large language models have grown in size, Google has also increased the memory bandwidth of later TPUs to handle these bigger workloads.\n\nGoogle says its latest \"Ironwood\" TPU, which the company is making widely available, is more than four times better than its predecessor for both training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPU cards, which launched in 1999, were originally designed for gaming, not AI. When researchers later discovered that the chips were useful for tasks such as training neural networks, Nvidia doubled down on the AI market.\n\nGoogle's TPUs, on the other hand, were designed for AI from the get-go. Being more specialized means they're more efficient than Nvidia's chips at some tasks, and faster for running select AI models. They have something called a systolic array, which lets a more constant stream of data pass through the chip, rather than having to keep fetching more from memory.\n\nWhere Google's TPUs have a big edge is in cost at scale. It's possible to have thousands of TPUs working in tandem in a single \"pod.\" Because they are faster at some calculations than GPUs, running many TPUs at once can sometimes be more cost-efficient.\n\nThat may become more important as companies increase investments at the inference stage, which Google says its latest TPU is especially good at. That could save companies money.\n\nOne advantage that Nvidia has over Google is its CUDA software, which makes it possible for regular applications to use GPUs for general computing tasks — not just for graphics. CUDA also only works with Nvidia chips, one of the biggest points of friction stopping companies from switching to Google's chips.\n\nGoogle is trying to change that. For example, there is a lot of industry demand to have TPUs better support Pytorch, a popular tool for building AI applications that was created inside Meta. Google is allocating more resources and attention to better supporting Pytorch, which data suggests is seeing much more demand than Google's own Tensorflow software, according to Google employees and industry experts.\n\nWhen it comes to TPUs, Google remains its own biggest customer. It uses the chips across the company to power products like Search and Maps. Its latest Gemini 3 model was trained on TPUs.\n\nWhile Google has prioritized its own needs, it has leased its TPUs to other customers. Apple used TPUs to train its in-house AI model, Business Insider previously reported. In October, Anthropic announced a blockbuster deal with Google that it says will see it using up to 1 million TPUs. Broadcom, which helps build the TPU chips for Google, revealed in its Q4 earnings call this week that it has received a total of $21 billion in orders from Anthropic for Google's Ironwood TPUs.\n\nMeta is also in early testing of Google's TPUs, according to a person familiar with the matter, although it's not clear if it will result in a long-term deal.\n\nGoogle's TPU business could be poised to explode in the coming years. In a research note this month, Morgan Stanley wrote that every 500,000 TPU chips sold could potentially add around $13 billion in revenue to Google's balance sheet in 2027.\n\nHaving TPUs isn't just a potential revenue boost for Google. It also gets a feedback loop in using TPUs to run and train its AI models, learning from them, and changing how it develops its next chips to be better at the things Google needs.\n\nNvidia's GPU is still very much the chip du jour, but other tech giants are increasingly pouring resources into their own custom chips. Amazon just announced its new Trainium3 custom AI chip, which the company says can cut the cost of training and powering AI models in half compared with a GPU.\n\nMany TPU buyers are also Nvidia customers, and some industry insiders told Business Insider that it's more likely that the rise of more specialized chips will see companies and labs diversify the chips they use, rather than going all in on one provider.\n\nThat could still hurt Nvidia, which could lose pricing power as a result of a more diverse market.\n\nHowever, even if Google's TPU business finds more momentum, it doesn't mean Nvidia will suddenly crumble overnight. Jordan Nanos, member of technical staff of research firm SemiAnalysis, said his firm believes companies, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, will all \"sell lots\" of chips in the future.\n\n\"We don't see TPU as a significant threat to Nvidia's business, but it has been a real player in the market for many years,\" said Nanos. \"It is possible that Google sells TPU servers externally in the future, to many more customers. Right now, they are very selective.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact this reporter via email at hlangley@businessinsider.com or Signal at hughlangley.01.

    "fullText": "EVs aren't really working out for Ford, so now it's chasing the AI boom instead.\n\nThe Detroit auto giant said on Monday it would pull back from electric vehicles in a move that would cost the company $19.5 billion.\n\nIn addition to scrapping planned electric models and building more hybrids, Ford said it would repurpose its EV battery factory in Kentucky to build batteries to power data centers and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe Mustang maker added that it would invest $2 billion to scale the new energy storage business, which it said would \"leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity.\" Ford plans to deploy at least 20 gigawatt-hours of energy storage systems by the end of 2027, which is roughly equivalent to the power used by 2,000 US homes for a year.\n\nIt comes as the race to build ever more powerful AI models fuels a data center boom across the US, putting pressure on the electricity grid.\n\nFederal estimates suggest data center power demand is expected to as much as triple over the next three years, as tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure.\n\nEVs, meanwhile, are heading in the other direction. Demand has cratered in recent months after buyers rushed to purchase electric vehicles before the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit in September, and automakers are rolling back investments and betting on hybrids as they gear up for an EV winter.\n\nFord said the factory at Glendale, Kentucky, which the US automaker built as part of a joint venture with Korean battery company SK On, will produce commercial batteries for the data center industry. Another battery plant in Michigan will produce smaller units for residential use, Ford added.\n\nFord is following in the footsteps of rival Tesla, which operates a thriving energy storage business. Elon Musk's automaker raked in over $10 billion last year from selling batteries to support the grid and power people's homes.\n\nTesla's Megapack commercial batteries have been used by Musk's startup xAI at its massive \"Colossus\" supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee. In May, the AI startup reportedly deployed 168 Megapacks to help stabilize the electricity supply at the site, which is one of the largest data centers in the world.\n\nFord's bet on energy storage comes as the company overhauls its wider EV strategy.\n\nThe Blue Oval announced on Monday it would cancel plans to build some large electric vehicles, and turn its F-150 Lightning electric pickup into an \"extended range\" EV with an additional gas generator.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley told Bloomberg on Monday that the move was the result of the EV market in the US shrinking and \"the customer changing their decision.\"\n\n\"The EV market in the US went from 12% of the industry to only five, and that really, in the end, was the big decider for us,\" he said.",

But rather than feeling nervous, I felt safely cocooned in my personal space.\n\nThe suite had a door to slide shut for privacy and side buttons for adjusting the seat's angle and lighting.\n\nThe blanket and pillow were cozy, and the travel kit had some useful amenities, like slippers, lip balm, hand cream, and an eye mask.\n\nI was hoping for a pair of pajamas, but those weren't offered on our 8 p.m. flight.\n\nOnce we leveled off, I was able to fully recline in the Delta One lie-flat seats.

We just felt ready to take on the day.\n\nSplurging isn't always possible, but we're keeping our options open for future flights. As they say, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame wrote on Substack that a \"crappy business\" became the \"belle of the ball.\"",
    "fullText": "When it comes to regrets, Michael Burry has a few.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who bet on GameStop years before it became a meme, explained why he sold the stock before it skyrocketed in a Substack post on Monday night.\n\nBurry, who recently pivoted from hedge fund manager to online writer, first invested in GameStop in the summer of 2018. The video-game retailer's stock looked undervalued to him, and he saw an array of catalysts that could send it higher, he wrote.\n\nThey included a console refresh in 2020, the possibility of a buyout, the potential sale of the Spring Mobile business, and strong cash flows and a large cash pile offering scope for a \"very big and consequential buyback,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe exited the position in the second quarter of 2019 after the stock failed to budge. But he reinvested in July 2019, buying the stock \"with both hands\" and making it one of his larger holdings, in part because high short interest presented a fresh catalyst, he wrote.\n\n\"I visited a GameStop store to make sure I was not crazy,\" Burry wrote. \"It did not work. Even the stuff that was not on sale looked like it should be on sale.\"\n\nBurry wrote to GameStop's board to push for changes at the company. He shared that his public activism drew emails from Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill, a retail investor who would become the face of the GameStop meme mania, and Chewy cofounder Ryan Cohen, who would go on to become GameStop's CEO.\n\nBurry said he bought into GameStop the second time at a split-adjusted average price of 83 cents, or less than 1/26 of the current $22 stock price.\n\nHe purchased an almost 5% stake and held it for more than 16 months. \"Most of that time, I lent my shares out at very good rates — high double digits — which was lucrative and a big part of the trade,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry cashed out by the end of November 2020, selling his shares for an average of $3.38 each, or more than four times what he paid.\n\nWeeks later, retail investors on forums such as r/WallStreetBets executed a historic squeeze on GameStop short sellers, sending the stock to an intraday high of over $120 on January 28, 2021.\n\n\"At the peak my yearslong investment might have turned $12 million into $1 billion, but that was never a possibility,\" Burry wrote, noting that he would have sold long before that point.\n\nBurry — best known for predicting and profiting from the housing crash that preceded the 2008 financial crisis, a story told in the book and movie \"The Big Short\" — reflected on whether he should have played his hand differently.\n\n\"I could have analyzed that situation better,\" he said. \"I knew GameStop inside and out, and I thought I understood the volume, short interest, and other dynamics.

    "title": "The estate attorney who says simple estates aren't actually simple — and why you should care",
    "description": "Estate planning tips include wills, trusts, and digital assets. Attorney Kerri Koen shares eight essential steps for protecting your legacy.",
    "fullText": "If you've ever thought that you're too young or too broke to worry about estate planning, Kerri Koen would like you to think again.\n\n\"It's really important that we're all proactive and have these documents in place before we need them,\" says Koen, partner at Modern Legacy Law Group. \"You're the only person who can make these decisions on your own behalf.\"\n\nAlthough it may be unpleasant to think about death or incapacitation, doing so can help you make decisions that align with your values and help your loved ones avoid an arduous court process after your death, Koen says.\n\nAs an estate planning attorney, Koen helps clients — mostly in their 30s, 40s, and 50s — create estate plans to bring peace of mind and security after a tragedy. Here's how you can do the same.\n\nLeaving your assets in a meaningful way isn't just for the rich. In fact, \"I would argue it's actually more beneficial to those who aren't multimillionaires,\" Koen says.\n\nShe often sees people come in saying they just have a simple estate — a home, a retirement account, and some cash, for example.\n\n\"They're saying it's very simple, but the problem is that the laws that apply aren't always simple,\" she says. Proper planning can help you avoid costly court processes and minimize how your estate is taxed, she adds.\n\nA will is the \"driving document\" of an estate plan, Koen says. This legal document, which can be five pages or 100, depending on the complexity, outlines how your assets will be divided in the event of your death. It also covers important legal decisions, like who should take custody of your kids or pets.\n\nHowever, it's not the only important paperwork.\n\nYour estate plan should also include a power of attorney (a legal document that designates who can make legal and financial decisions on your behalf if you're unable to) and advanced care directives to express your medical wishes.\n\nThese documents vary by state, and work together to address issues like who can access your medical records and whether you want to be kept on life support.\n\nA trust is a legal structure in which one person transfers assets to another person or entity, for the benefit of a third party. That sounds complicated, and it can be, but many people can benefit from a trust, even if they're not wealthy, Koen says.\n\n\"If we want to avoid probate processes, or protect assets from Medicaid and creditors, that's where we see trust planning come into place,\" she says.\n\nTrusts can be particularly important if you have minor children, since they allow the people raising your children to access assets without owning them. That can help when life gets messy: say, your sister takes custody of your children upon your death, so you leave her all your assets. However, if she gets sued, any assets she owns — even if they were intended for your kids — can be taken.\n\nTrusts avoid this by giving guardians \"the access, without giving them the actual assets,\" Koen says.\n\nEffective estate planning accounts for not just death, but disability as well, Koen says. Plan for not only what would happen if you become disabled (by appointing a power of attorney), but also for if an heir becomes disabled.\n\nIn that case, leaving them assets directly could compromise their access to government-funded services. Whereas setting up a trust can give them access to funds to supplement their care without disqualifying them from services like Medicaid, Koen says.\n\nClients often say things like \"I'd want my spouse to take care of my sister if I died.\" That's a nice sentiment, but it can mean different things to different people.\n\n\"Put a number to that,\" Koen says. Doing this can take some reflection, she adds. First, think about what \"take care of\" means to you; then, work with your attorney to reach a specific amount of funds you'd like allocated for the given purpose. Your attorney can also help you make sure you have the assets within your estate to support that gift or inheritance.\n\nAnother way to be specific: name backups for key roles, like your power of attorney or guardian of your children. That way if your first choice isn't able to step up, you still have someone you trust, Koen says.\n\nKoen once worked with a family where the two adult children were named to administer a trust together. Come to find out, the siblings weren't speaking.\n\n\"We have this wishful thinking,\" that family feuds will resolve, Koen says, but that isn't always the case.\n\nInstead of hoping for the unrealistic, create a plan that you're certain will work with current family dynamics and minimize conflict—like leaving separate gifts to siblings who have a tense relationship.\n\nToo often, digital assets fall through the cracks of estate planning, Koen says. This can include financial assets, like cryptocurrency, as well as personal legacies, including social media, digital photos, and even access to your phone.\n\nWhile digital inheritance isn't well-regulated, there's been a lot of progress over the past five years, Koen says.\n\nFor example, Apple, Google, and Meta all allow users to appoint a legacy contact who can access your accounts if you die. There are also less formal decisions to consider, like whether to leave your social media active if you die or become disabled. This is especially important if you generate income from these accounts.\n\nIt's tempting to put off making decisions about estate planning, but Koen says almost all her clients are happy once it's done.\n\nAlthough you should review your estate plan every three to five years (and after major life events like a birth or divorce), there's relief in having a will and other important documents in place.\n\n\"The number one thing I hear is [that clients] thought this was going to be scary,\" Koen says, \"but they're actually leaving the office with tremendous peace of mind.\"",

    "description": "I moved into an RV and lived on the road for two years after losing my dog. Eventually, I landed in Galveston, Texas, and found my perfect home.",
    "fullText": "In 2023, I lost my soul dog, Chubbs. He had been with me for 14 years through every apartment, every move, and even a cross-country relocation from Texas to New York.\n\nWhen he passed, it felt like someone had pulled the anchor from my life. I didn't just lose my dog; I lost my sense of safety and the steady presence that had guided every chapter of my adult life. The grief felt overwhelming.\n\nIn the quiet that followed, my husband and I started asking hard questions about what \"home\" really meant. We'd both spent years chasing careers, paying rent in cities that never felt permanent.\n\nSo, we did something radical: We sold almost everything we owned, from our furniture to our books, and bought an RV.\n\nWe had no intention of settling down anywhere; life on the road was our near and distant future plan.\n\nThose first months on the road were a crash course in patience and perspective.\n\nEvery day, we woke up to the hum of nature and winding highways. We worked remotely wherever we parked, building a life that could fit inside a 32-foot space.\n\nWe spent a few peaceful months in North Carolina, surrounded by trees and cool air, and almost stayed. In Pennsylvania and Kentucky, we discovered unexpected beauty in small towns and winding back roads.\n\nArizona and New Mexico, though, were a little tougher — we found them a bit too dry and stark, and longed for the ocean and more greenery. Each place taught us its own lesson about what felt like home and what didn't.\n\nLife on the road wasn't always easy, but it gave me the quiet I needed to heal after losing Chubbs.\n\nThe more miles we drove, though, the clearer it became that I didn't just want to keep moving. I wanted to build a life that felt full again, something steady and rooted that my dog would have loved, too.\n\nEventually, the road led us to Galveston, a Texas Gulf Coast island that had always held a piece of my heart.\n\nGrowing up in Texas, my family had vacationed here often, and I was instantly hit with nostalgia and happy memories. I felt right at home with the salty air, laid-back island vibe, and Historic Strand District, a commercial area with many of Galveston's oldest buildings.\n\nAt first, it was just another stop; we thought we'd stay for a few weeks. However, we were wrong.\n\nThe island's mix of old-world charm and creative energy is unlike anywhere else in Texas. There's art on every corner, history in every building, and a deep sense of community that instantly made us feel like family.\n\nAfter years of constant motion, we finally felt rooted.\n\nSettling in Galveston reignited something I hadn't realized I had lost: creative connection.\n\nI began writing again and eventually joined a local publication focused on the arts, where I help tell the stories of the island's artists, musicians, and makers.\n\nNow, my work feels personal and purposeful, even though it looks less like the corporate life I led in the past.\n\nI've met so many people who also came to Galveston after a big life change or loss, and found peace in the island's slower rhythm.\n\nThis city has a way of bringing people together, whether through a shared love of art, a late open-mic jam, or a quick chat over coffee at one of the local hot spots.\n\nIn my experience, the people in Galveston are warm and welcoming. Whenever I go to a grocery store or even for a walk on the Seawall, I find myself in conversation with a few BOIs (Born on the Island) or IBCs (Islander By Choice), all curious about my travels.\n\nWhen Chubbs died, I lost my sense of home. For two years, every place we parked the RV felt temporary, a stopover rather than a destination.\n\nI kept hoping that somewhere along the way, the road itself would heal me, but I learned that grief doesn't disappear when you keep moving. It follows you until you stop for long enough to face it.\n\nGalveston was the first place that made me want to stay.\n\nThe rhythm of the waves reminded me of those quiet RV mornings when the world felt still, but here, there was something more: people, community, connection. The same serenity I'd found on the road existed here, just grounded by roots instead of wheels.\n\nAfter years of living everywhere and nowhere, planting roots feels both strange and sacred. Some mornings I still expect to pack up and go, but then I'll catch the smell of salt in the air or head to my favorite coffee spot, and I remember why we stayed.\n\nThe island may not be where I thought I'd end up, but in Galveston, I found what I'd actually been chasing all along: a place that feels like home.",

    "fullText": "People are used to fighting for seats when commuting to work. It just usually doesn't continue at the office.\n\nThat's becoming the norm as companies realize their RTO mandates are bigger than their office spaces, writes BI's Emily Stewart.\n\nFrom Instagram to AT&T to Amazon, companies have called workers back to the office only to find out they don't have enough desks for everyone.\n\nThe desk shortage could be due to a lack of foresight, a sneaky layoff technique, or something in between. But one thing is for sure: It's not a problem set to disappear anytime soon.\n\nEven if companies do expand their footprint, it won't be so that workers can get their own slice of cubicle heaven. The most common ratio between desks and employees is 1-1.49, and most companies want even more workers for every seat they have.\n\nCompanies' RTO woes aren't an easy fix.\n\nI understand executives' reluctance to snap up more office space. The post-pandemic scars from carrying expensive leases for desks that remained empty still run deep.\n\nBut hot desking doesn't feel like a silver bullet.\n\nSure, you can bet there will always be enough seats because some workers will be sick, on vacation, or taking meetings on a random day. And that'll likely pay off during certain parts of the year. (You'll have your pick of the litter at the office starting next week.)\n\nBut for other chunks of the year, it could become a constant game of musical chairs. And if bringing people back to the office is all about productivity, does it really make sense to have them spend their morning looking for a spot to set up their laptops?\n\nA hybrid setup affords you more flexibility. But most people might gravitate toward coming into the office on the same day, which could create a similar desk availability issue. (Fridays aren't really a crowd favorite.)\n\nYou could mandate certain days for employees to spread things out, but that's likely to ruffle feathers. And isn't the whole point of coming into the office about everyone working together in person?\n\nThat raises a larger question about what a company's real RTO motive is. Because if it's about getting people back to the office to work together, giving them a desk to do it feels like it should be high on the to-do list.",

    "fullText": "These days, there isn’t an issue Phil Mickelson can resist weighing in on.\n\nIn the wake of Sunday’s deadly Bondi Beach attack, where 16 people were killed and 42 were injured, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is calling for tougher gun laws.\n\nOn Monday, Mickelson couldn’t stop himself from weighing in, quote-tweeting a video of Albanese’s statements.\n\n“The (two) terrorists didn’t seem affected by the strict gun laws already in place,” Mickelson wrote on X/Twitter. “In fact, the shooting went on for a long time since there wasn’t anybody else with a gun to stop them. I’m not a big gun guy, but even I’m not this dumb to believe what this guy is selling.”\n\nFollowing the shooting on Sunday, Albanese said that the federal government is prepared to take further action to strengthen Australia’s gun laws. He announced that tougher firearm measures would be placed on the national cabinet agenda later in the day.\n\nAlbanese said the proposals would include limits on the number of firearms individuals can own, along with periodic reviews of gun licenses rather than allowing them to remain valid indefinitely.\n\nHe highlighted that people’s circumstances can change over time, including the risk of radicalization, and argued that licensing systems must reflect that reality through ongoing checks.\n\nAlbanese added that if further tightening of the laws is warranted, he is ready to pursue it and hopes to secure the support of the national cabinet.\n\nOn Saturday, Mickelson weighed in on another political issue that has nothing to do with him, siding with Rep. Jim Jordan’s criticism of Democrats after the official release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from ICE custody.\n\nMickelson wrote — on social media, of course — that the political party had won “at the expense of America and its citizens.”\n\nLegendary radio host claims politics split Mets’ clubhouse: ‘It started over Trump’\n\nMike Francesa reveals why Mets’ Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor’s relationship was ice cold\n\nJets’ longtime superfan says enough after 46 years: ‘No more of this crap’\n\nEx-NFL player thinks Jaxson Dart’s style may complicate Giants’ coaching search.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced the engagement of his son, Donald Trump Jr., to model and socialite Bettina Anderson at a White House holiday party on Monday.\n\nTrump Jr. and Bettina Anderson made their public debut as a couple at Trump's inauguration following months of speculation about the nature of their relationship.\n\nSince going public in January 2025, Trump Jr. and Anderson have appeared together at numerous White House events and Palm Beach galas.\n\nTrump Jr., who is Trump's oldest son, was previously engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host and campaign advisor whom Trump chose to serve as his administration's ambassador to Greece.\n\nAnderson, a Palm Beach socialite, model, and the founder and executive director of the wildlife conservation nonprofit Project Paradise, was first spotted in the Trump family's orbit at the Republican National Convention in July 2024.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House, Trump Jr., Guilfoyle, and Anderson did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of their relationship.\n\nAnderson was photographed sitting behind Trump Jr., Guilfoyle, and other members of the Trump family on the third and fourth days of the Republican National Convention.\n\nGuilfoyle was still wearing her engagement ring.\n\nAnderson and Trump Jr. were photographed dining together at the Honor Bar, a restaurant located about 4 miles from Mar-a-Lago, The Daily Mail reported.\n\nNeither responded to a request for comment in September about the nature of their relationship.\n\nTickets to the fundraising dinner cost $100,000 a couple and admission to a fireside chat cost $30,000 a couple, the Palm Beach Daily News reported. Serving on the host committee of the event required a $250,000 contribution.\n\nAnderson and Trump Jr. were photographed holding hands as they left Buccan, a restaurant in Palm Beach, on Anderson's 38th birthday, The Daily Mail reported.\n\nAnderson also shared a photo on her Instagram story of a bouquet of flowers and a card reading, \"Many have said you're aging out but I think you're perfect...happy birthday!\" She tagged Trump Jr. in the post, appearing to indicate that he was the sender.\n\nLater that month, Anderson joined Trump Jr. at the Trump family's New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nWhile Trump Jr. did not officially confirm that he and Guilfoyle had broken off their engagement, he said in a statement to Page Six that they \"will always keep a special bond\" and that he \"could not be more proud of her and the important role she'll continue to play in my father's administration\" as ambassador to Greece.\n\nAnderson and Trump Jr. attended an inaugural reception at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, DC, on January 18. On January 19, they held hands and danced to \"YMCA\" by The Village People at the Turning Point USA Inaugural-Eve Ball.\n\nAnderson and Trump Jr. traveled to the Capitol Rotunda together on Inauguration Day but sat separately for the ceremony. Trump Jr. sat with his family members on the inaugural platform, while Anderson took her seat in the crowd.\n\nGuilfoyle was also seated in the audience for the inauguration, but not with the Trump family as she had been at the RNC.\n\nPresident Trump was the first sitting president to ever attend the Super Bowl. He was joined by Trump Jr., Anderson, and other family members and associates to watch the Philadelphia Eagles defeat the Kansas City Chiefs at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.\n\nTrump Jr. and Anderson were photographed cuddling in their seats in the House chamber before Trump's speech began.\n\nTrump Jr. and Anderson attended the mfAR Palm Beach Gala in support of the organization's AIDS research and global HIV prevention.\n\nOther celebrities in attendance included Martha Stewart, who received mfAR's Award of Inspiration, Tommy Hilfiger, and Ricky Martin.\n\nThe gala was held days after People magazine reported that Trump Jr.'s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump, is dating Tiger Woods.\n\nThat same month, they also attended a golf event at Trump National Doral, Trump's golf resort in Doral, Florida.\n\nTrump Jr. and Anderson were seated in front of Tiffany Trump and Michael Boulos for the military parade in Washington, DC, which featured 6,600 troops, 150 vehicles, and over 50 aircraft.\n\nTrump Jr. and Anderson joined Eric and Lara Trump at Trump Turnberry, one of Trump's golf clubs in Scotland, for the announcement of a new trade deal between the US and the European Union.\n\nThey were then joined by two of Trump Jr.'s children, Spencer and Chloe, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new golf course at Trump International Golf Links.\n\nAround the same time that Page Six broke the news of Trump Jr. and Anderson's engagement on Monday evening, Trump announced that the two were engaged and called them up to the White House podium to say a few words.\n\nIn a video from the event shared by far-right activist Laura Loomer, Trump Jr. thanked Anderson \"for that one word, yes.\"\n\nAnderson could be seen in the video wearing a diamond ring.\n\n\"This has really been the most unforgettable weekend of my life, and I get to marry the love of my life, and I feel just like the luckiest girl in the world,\" Anderson said at the holiday party, according to the video.",

    "description": "The startup aims to fully automate front-office healthcare tasks for independent provider groups with AI.",
    "fullText": "When Valerie Health CEO Peter Shalek demos his product to clinicians, he has an unusual pitch: \"This is a weird demo, because you'll never have to use this software.\"\n\nValerie Health, which Shalek cofounded alongside Uber Health founder Nitin Joshi, aims to fully automate time-consuming front-office tasks in healthcare, such as referrals and patient scheduling.\n\nIt's taking over those tasks for independent provider groups, a focus that's helping the startup rack up new revenue — and new venture funding.\n\nValerie Health just raised $30 million in Series A funding led by Redpoint Ventures, the company said Tuesday. The raise brings Valerie Health's total funding to $39 million since its 2024 founding.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health is already working with several of the nation's largest independent provider groups, in areas ranging from urology and podiatry to cardiology.\n\nAcross specialties, the front-office challenges for provider groups are often the same, Shalek said: juggling patient intakes and follow-ups against a backlog of referrals.\n\nThose administrative burdens and related financial pressures can lead provider groups to be acquired by hospitals or consolidated by private equity firms. But those deals can mean higher costs for patients and lower satisfaction for the clinicians impacted. Shalek wants Valerie Health to help providers thrive independently.\n\n\"I think that there's an opportunity to make it so that independent practice is the easiest, the highest quality, the most profitable place to deliver care, which is really the core mission we have,\" he said.\n\nValerie Health takes over tasks for healthcare front offices with its own employees in the loop to review the software's autonomous actions.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health helps practices grow, too, by processing new and existing patients faster to increase the volume of patients coming in by 5% to 7% on average.\n\nThe startup has plenty of competition. More companies are setting out to automate administrative tasks for hospitals and healthcare practices, such as the Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup Tennr, which raised $101 million in Series C funding in June at a $605 million valuation to focus on automating patient referrals.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health is bringing in business through its singular focus on independent provider groups and its ability to automate tasks without healthcare practices lifting a finger.\n\n\"It takes a lot of work from our side, but it allows us to just solve these problems for our customers without saying, here's another piece of software for you to train your staff on. That's the last thing these practices want. They just want us to do the work,\" he said.\n\nValerie Health wants to move fast as the market fills. Shalek said the startup is focused on grabbing more customers next year while continuing to build front-office solutions, such as voice AI agents for patient follow-ups. Valerie Health started selling its tech earlier this year; its revenue tripled last quarter from the previous quarter alone, and given the customers already in its pipeline plus the demand it's seeing in the market, Shalek said he expects revenue to grow six to seven times next year.\n\nThe startup is also hiring across its teams, including engineering, product, and sales. Joshi also spent two years as an engineering manager at fintech startup Stripe, so Shalek said Valerie Health has been able to bring over talent from both Stripe and Uber as it expands.",

    "description": "I'm trying to let my teen take the driver's seat as they apply to college. We only discuss college during designated times, and it's been challenging.",
    "fullText": "My fifth and final kid is a senior in high school, which means it's time for graduation, award nights, and most importantly, the college application process.\n\nAt a recent college night presentation, I met with a high school counselor. They gave all parents a startling message: You're not in the driver's seat during the application process. You're not even in the passenger seat. You're in the back seat.\n\nI took the counselor's advice and decided to step back, letting my teen take the lead as they apply to colleges. At times, this has been tough, but I keep reminding myself that this is their journey.\n\nThe post-secondary counselor talked with my child about their academic profile, major, and what they were looking for in a college. They discussed that even though my child has the background to get into highly selective (and very expensive) schools, they want to be a high school teacher, so it's not really necessary.\n\nTalking about money with kids is never fun. College is the most fraught money conversation we've had with our kids.\n\nIt was helpful to have another trusted adult discuss my child's preferences with them and help them figure out what matters most when selecting schools. Thankfully, I didn't have to be the one who directed them away from prestigious schools.\n\nI only stepped in to tell my kid how much I could afford on tuition.\n\nRather than continually nagging my kid about applications and to-do lists, I send out meeting invites to complete specific tasks, such as the FAFSA, campus visits, and scholarships.\n\nDuring these scheduled times, we sit at the kitchen table while my kid does the work. I'm available if they need me to complete forms or determine a suitable time for a campus visit.\n\nI then don't bring up college unless they do outside these scheduled times. This is hard. I'm curious to know what they're thinking and if everything is getting done. However, since we started scheduling times, my child is now proactively chatting instead of us having to ask.\n\nThe college application process teaches, sometimes the hard way, the importance of deadlines. Colleges have limits — a limited amount of scholarship money, a max on people admitted, a finite number of rooms in the best dorm — and waiting until or missing the deadline means you miss out.\n\nMy child lost out on presidential scholarships for one of their top schools because they were working to a deadline. The scholarship application process required a two-day in-person interview, and they discovered this the day before the application was due.\n\nWe couldn't make the in-person interview time, so they were unable to apply. It was frustrating, but, it was a lesson learned.\n\nWhen this presidential scholarship mishap happened, I realized how I could be helpful. I created a spreadsheet to compare schools and provide a quick view of deadlines for applications and scholarships.\n\nI'm not going into the Common App or looking over my kids' shoulders as they fill out applications. We review the spreadsheet during our college task meetings, and they get to work.\n\nI then do my best not to look at it, ask them questions, or nag them the rest of the week.\n\nI realized the best way I can stay involved is by celebrating my kids' wins.\n\nI take pictures on tours, read the brochures, and check out the acceptance packet swag. It's an exciting time for both of us, and this helps me feel more involved.\n\nEvery scholarship, every acceptance, regardless of amount or whether they choose that school, is a win and a testament to all we've both done to get to that point.",

    "description": "I realized that independence is an important thing to teach my children. Now my son is feeling like the smart, capable kid I know he is.",
    "fullText": "\"Mom, I have to go to the bathroom right now,\" my 8-year-old son frantically informed me from the backseat.\n\nWe were stuck in the middle of a crowded Starbucks drive-thru after school one day, and his 3-year-old brother was asleep in his car seat. So, desperately, I offered a solution: \"Alright, you can go inside by yourself, and I'll meet you at the front patio.\"\n\nHis 6-year-old brother immediately volunteered to go with him — \"I have to go, too!\" — so I unlocked the door and watched them as they crossed in front of my car and disappeared around the corner to find the public restrooms. It was the first time I'd ever let them do something like that on their own, and I was surprised at how nervous it made me feel. Surely, our parents in the 90s let us run around playgrounds, libraries, and other places by ourselves, so why was I so worried about letting them do this simple thing? Because they could get hit by a car or kidnapped or make a nuisance, my anxious brain not-so-helpfully reminded me.\n\nIt turns out, I didn't need to worry at all. By the time I made it to the front of the store to pick them up, they were beaming with their accomplishment. It made me realize it was time to start creating small moments of independence for my eldest son (and his younger brothers when appropriate).\n\nSocial psychologist and author of \" The Anxious Generation,\" Jonathan Haidt, conducted a study with the Harris Poll, alongside co-authors Lenore Skenazy and Zach Rausch, which surveyed more than 500 children ages 8 to 12 in the U.S. The results, published in The Atlantic, found that despite many children having access to online worlds like Roblox (about 75% regularly play the game), fewer than half of the 8- and 9-year-olds studied have ever gone down a grocery-store aisle by themselves.\n\nReading this stuck with me. At first, I thought I couldn't believe the metaphorical leash these kids are on. They're parents aren't letting them go even one aisle down? But then I realized that even though my kids are confident walking around stores, I usually don't let them out of my sight anywhere else.\n\n\"Without real-world freedom, children don't get the chance to develop competence, confidence, and the ability to solve everyday problems,\" the authors said about the survey results.\n\nAnd without giving kids the skills to practice, it won't become natural. Haidt encourages parents to start giving kids more independence beginning at age 8, and I immediately decided to try it with my son.\n\nWe started this experiment at Target, where I typically didn't mind my kids looking at the video games or toys while I browsed the nearby book section.\n\nThis time, I wanted to take it one step further, so I asked my 8-year-old to go a few aisles down to grab a loaf of bread while I picked up some yogurt and cheese. He left and came back in less than a minute, proud of his find — and much happier having a task to focus on than just following me down each aisle, complaining of boredom. I loved it, and the trip didn't take nearly as long.\n\nAnother time, my 6-year-old needed to use the restroom, and his older brother offered to take him on his own — at the front of the store. After a few minutes, I got nervous with many thoughts running through my mind. What if they lost me because I wasn't on the same aisle as when they left? What if they couldn't find the bathroom and they were wandering around scared? Am I a terrible mother for letting them do this?\n\nI ended up leaving mid-aisle to speedwalk to the restrooms, where I found them exactly where they said they would be, with one in the bathroom and the other patiently waiting on the bench outside the door. I felt something in my own brain click into place: my eldest son knows what to do, he is responsible enough to do it, and he loves that I trust him to go off on his own.\n\nI just had to get over myself long enough to let him.\n\n\"So, what do I say, again?\" my son asked. We had just pulled up outside our favorite pizza joint, and he was going inside to pick up our order.\n\n\"Say, 'I'm picking up an order for Sydni Ellis,'\" I repeated. He jumped out of the van to grab our pizza, but first, he whispered his line a few times like an actor in a play (or like an anxious kid learning how to be brave). It was emotional watching him pace in front of the restaurant for a few seconds, building up the courage to go in and talk to an employee. I didn't intervene, and when he was ready, he went in by himself.\n\nWhen he opened the van door with pizza in hand, he was beaming. His face was glowing with the brightest smile of happiness, accomplishment, and relief I had ever seen, and it was seared into my memory.\n\nThis is why independence is important. He did it. He built up confidence, tackled tasks he wouldn't have been responsible enough to do when he was younger, and felt like the smart, capable kid I know he is. By encouraging him to do things on his own, I'm helping set him up for the future and giving him a priceless feeling of autonomy.",

    "fullText": "As winter temps drop, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski is sharing some cold, hard facts.\n\nThe 57-year-old fast-food executive recently shared his top career tip in a viral Instagram video, warning that it might \"hurt your feelings.\"\n\n\"Remember, nobody cares about your career as much as you do,\" Kempczinski said.\n\n\"This idea that there's somebody out there who's looking out for you, who's going to make sure that you get that opportunity, who puts you in the right thing — great if it happens,\" he said. \"You've got to make things happen for yourself.\"\n\nA post shared by Chris Kempczinski (@chrisk_mcd)\n\nKempczinski is, of course, not the first corporate leader to make this observation.\n\nSeveral, including Business Insider founder Henry Blodget, have for years recommended that workers \"be the CEO of your career.\"\n\n\"When people enter the workforce, they often imagine that their job and career success and satisfaction is someone else's responsibility,\" Blodget wrote in 2023.\n\nBlodget said that some school and early-career situations involve predictable requirements and progressions, often with a mentor whose job it is to help you succeed. However, that model often stops working sooner or later, leaving the individual solely responsible for their own direction.\n\nKempczinski's comments also come amid a broader shift away from loyalty between employees and employers, a shift that was probably best summarized earlier this year in a memo from AT&T CEO John Stankey.\n\n\"I understand that some of you may have started your tour with this company expecting an 'employment deal' rooted in loyalty, tenure, and conformance with the associated compensation, work structure, and benefits,\" Stankey said. \"We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements and towards a more market-based culture — focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment.\"\n\nIn an earlier video, Kempczinski shared a key tip to help workers get control over their time, energy, and attention: \"Be organized.\"\n\nKempczinski said he keeps a tidy email inbox, computer, and workspace.\n\n\"Staying organized is a way to make me stay focused,\" he said.\n\nTaken together, it's safe to say that you should keep track of what you need to do for your own life and career because nobody else is going to do it for you.",

    "description": "Netflix's podcast deal with iHeartMedia brings exclusive video podcasts like \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"My Favorite Murder\" to the streamer in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Netflix just made its second big podcast move, announcing a deal with iHeartMedia to exclusively host the video versions of more than a dozen of its shows.\n\nThose shows include \"The Breakfast Club,\" cohosted by popular radio personality Charlamagne tha God; true crime show \"My Favorite Murder\"; and \"Dear Chelsea\" with Chelsea Handler.\n\nNetflix said the shows will launch on its platform in early 2026 in the US, with other markets to follow.\n\nNetflix stressed the variety of the shows available through the deal. Bob Pittman, iHeartMedia's CEO, said it let his company complement its audio foundation with a leading video-first service. The video versions of the shows will only be available on Netflix — and crucially won't be on YouTube — while iHeartMedia retains the audio-only rights and distribution.\n\nThe deal is Netflix's second big foray into video podcasts after announcing a similar deal with Spotify in October for shows including \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" \"The Rewatchables,\" and \"Conspiracy Theories.\"\n\nNetflix's move into video podcasts is part of a broader effort to expand its content offerings beyond its core of TV series and movies. The streamer has added content from YouTubers like Ms. Rachel, sports programming, and even games as its engagement time has flattened. Netflix is also seeking to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business.\n\nBesides its Spotify and iHeartMedia deals, Netflix has explored potential pacts with individual podcasters, including Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame, two people familiar with the talks previously told Business Insider. Netflix has also been looking to hire a video podcast executive.\n\nThe streamer told potential partners it wants to have 50 to 75 shows when its video podcasts launch in early 2026, two dealmakers previously told Business Insider, with one hearing the platform was looking to build that number to as many as 200 over time.\n\nThe iHeartMedia deal checks a few boxes for Netflix, which, in keeping with its stated goal of serving everyone, has been seeking shows across various genres, including pop culture, true crime, sports, and comedy. \"The Breakfast Club\" is the 15th most listened to podcast, according to Edison Research, and its daily format could help Netflix establish itself as a routine destination. The deal notably doesn't include iHeartMedia's other podcasts in the top 50, including the flagship \"Stuff You Should Know,\" \"Club Shay Shay,\" and \"On Purpose with Jay Shetty.\"\n\nNetflix's podcast negotiations have, in general, been complicated by the fact that video distribution rights are often controlled by a mix of the host and the network.\n\nFor some podcasters, being on Netflix offers a potential new audience and the prestige of being part of a curated offering. However, for others, Netflix's demand for video exclusivity would mean giving up the important ad revenue and reach they gain on YouTube, and potentially alienating their fans who find them there.\n\nThere are also questions about how much Netflix will promote the shows and what viewer data it'll share with hosts, who are accustomed to receiving robust data on their shows from YouTube.\n\nPodcasts are mostly an audio experience, but people are increasingly watching them in video form. An Edison Research report in July found that over half (51%) of people in the US 12 and up said they had watched a video podcast, with 37% having watched one in the previous month.\n\nHere are all the shows initially coming to Netflix as part of the iHeart deal:",

Users can choose a channel and start watching, with the Reels playing automatically.\n\nInstagram for TV is part of the platform's ongoing effort to adapt to the ways users are connecting via the app. The company said in a press release that it has heard from its community that \"watching Reels together is more fun,\" so the product was designed with that social aspect in mind.\n\nTessa Lyons, VP of product at Instagram, told Business Insider that the team heard from users who were finding ways to cast their Reels to the TV so they could watch them with friends.\n\n\"People already want to get together and connect with each other over Reels on the TV,\" she said, adding that this allows them to actually share with friends. \"Not just DMing them, but actually be together enjoying them.\"\n\nLyons said she personally felt the need for this feature when she realized, while on the couch watching TV with her husband, she was often actually watching Reels on her phone instead.\n\nInstagram for TV is in a testing phase, with plans to eventually expand to more devices and countries. Instagram said this early test is designed to learn which features are best for shared viewing on a TV screen.\n\nFuture features could include using your phone as a remote, more intuitive ways to surf channels, and channels that combine your and your friends' interests into one shared feed, like Instagram's Blend feature.\n\nUp to five Instagram accounts can be connected to the Amazon Fire TV device. Once you click into your account, Instagram will automatically group Reels into a channel based on your interests.\n\nLyons said Instagram's North Star has always been \"helping people connect with their friends over creativity,\" adding that the goal has remained even as the platform and the way people use it have changed.\n\n\"The way in which people share evolves,\" she said. \"I think that's natural.\"\n\nHave a tip?

The company first demoed the product in May 2024 at Google I/O and made it freely available in September 2024.\n\nFor car-chatting enthusiasts, Brin recommended drivers \"shouldn't do it now, because we have a way better version coming.\"\n\n\"The publicly available version right now is not the good version,\" he said. \"Give me a few weeks to actually ship what I have access to.\"\n\nBrin said that the current available version of Gemini Live is backed by an \"ancient model.\"\n\nGoogle's recent model updates have made waves in the AI world. In November, the company debuted Gemini 3. The model is more visual, Google said, and its \"most factual\" model to date.\n\nGemini 3 was also the first model Google added directly to search on day one. Users could immediately access it by clicking \"AI Mode,\" rather than having to visit a separate app or website.\n\nThe other LLM makers took note. Meta employees now have access to Gemini 3 Pro.\n\nOn the panel, Brin acknowledged that his answer to the driving question seemed \"kind of self-advertising.\" He does listen to some podcasts, he said.\n\n\"The 'All In' guys are actually one of my favorites,\" he said. Brin has appeared on the podcast multiple times.",

    "fullText": "This year might be remembered as the end of a distinct era in markets.\n\nLazard's top strategist said said he believes 2025 marked the beginning of the end of American exceptionalism in financial markets. That's due to prevailing concerns around America's macro outlook, which could influence investors to begin shifting away from the dollar and, eventually, selling their US assets in the coming years, according to Ron Temple, the chief market strategist of Lazard's advisory and asset management business.\n\n\"I think this year is the beginning of the end of American exceptionalism in markets, and we're probably going to see it first in currency, and we're going to see it in other risk assets as we move into 2026,\" Temple said, speaking to CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nThere are several reasons Temple thinks investors are ready to shift their exposure away from the US.\n\nConcerns about the Fed. Chatter about the Fed's credibility has picked up this year. The central bank is facing pressure from President Donald Trump to lower rates aggressively, a move that could stoke more inflation.\n\nThe Fed is also facing a tough balancing act to support the job market while keeping a lid on price growth. Central bankers just issued their third rate cut of the year, with inflation hovering above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nInvestors may first start to shift away from US assets through currency hedges, Temple speculated, citing his conversations with investors who expressed interest in reducing their exposure to the US dollar.\n\nEventually, investors could begin to sell investments like US Treasurys and risk assets like stocks, Temple added. Investors already got a glimpse of what that could look like in April of this year, he noted, when Trump's tariff announcement caused investors to dump US stocks and Treasurys.\n\n\"Frankly, I do think when we look backward, we're going to say 2025 was the first year in many people's lifetimes where we say US Treasurys viewed as a credit asset more than a risk-free asset,\" Temple added.\n\nAmerica's outperformance has been a topic of debate on Wall Street this year. More have sided with the view that the US market is looking less attractive than it has in the past, thanks to worries around tariffs, the strength of the US economy, and rising deficit spending.\n\nIn a note to clients last month, Goldman Sachs said it believed the US market would see some of the worst returns over the next decade compared to other markets around the world.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America and Apollo have also floated the idea that returns for the S&P 500 could be nearly flat over the next 10 years, with worries mounting over a \"lost decade\" for the US market.",

    "description": "Before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, iRobot's dominance was waning and an Amazon acquisition failed. A timeline shows the Roomba maker's decline.",
    "fullText": "iRobot, the maker of the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this week after years of mounting financial struggles and a failed $1.4 billion acquisition deal with Amazon.\n\nThe 35-year-old company once reigned supreme in the world of robotic vacuums, but its dominance waned amid rising competition from lower-cost rivals and weakening consumer demand.\n\nHere's a look back at how this once mighty, pioneering robotics company arrived at this moment.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Colin Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — who had a \"vision of making practical robots a reality,\" the company says on its website.\n\niRobot focused on designing robots for space-related research and military use in its early years.\n\nIn 1998, the Massachusetts-based company won a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, to build a tactical mobile robot. This led to the development of iRobot's PackBot, which was later used in search operations at Manhattan's Ground Zero following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nIn 2002, iRobot had its consumer breakthrough with its debut of the Roomba, its iconic self-cleaning disc-shaped vacuum.\n\nOver the next two decades, the company went on to release dozens of Roomba models. It has sold over 50 million models globally since.\n\niRobot went public in November 2005 with its IPO priced at $24 per share. It began trading its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol IRBT.\n\niRobot saw its annual revenue peak in 2021 at $1.56 billion, but sales have been falling ever since.\n\nSales dropped, in part, thanks to stiffer competition from Chinese rivals like Dreame, Roborock, and Ecovacs, as well as other brands such as Shark and Samsung.\n\nAmazon agreed to buy iRobot in 2022 for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction, but the deal collapsed two years later with the companies saying there was \"no path to regulatory approval in the European Union.\"\n\nThe same day the companies announced that the proposed merger was scrapped in January 2024, iRobot cut 31% of its staff, and Angle, iRobot's cofounder and longtime CEO, also stepped down.\n\nIn a March 2025 earnings report, iRobot said there was \"substantial doubt\" about the company's ability to continue.\n\niRobot attempted to find a new buyer after its deal with Amazon collapsed. In an October 2025 regulatory filing, it said the last remaining potential acquirer pulled out \"following a lengthy period of exclusive negotiations.\"\n\nThe company warned that without fresh funding, it \"may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely seek bankruptcy protection.\"\n\niRobot filed for Chapter 11 on December 14 and said the company would be acquired by its China-based primary contract manufacturer and lender, Picea Robotics, through a court-supervised process. Under the deal, iRobot would be taken private.\n\nThe company said it expects to continue to operate as normal and does not anticipate any disruption to its core operations, including its app and ongoing product support.\n\n\"The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners,\" said iRobot CEO Gary Cohen.",

Imports of dairy products from the EU likewise were subject to anti-dumping probes.\n\nThe EU runs a massive trade deficit with China: over 300 billion euros ($348 billion) last year. However, the trading bloc is a major exporter of pork and key supplier of byproducts such as ears, snouts, feet and other items considered to be delicacies in China.\n\nIn September, China ordered preliminary anti-dumping duties, in the form of security deposits, of 15.6% to 32.7% for pork imports from EU companies that collaborated with the anti-dumping investigation, and up to 62.4% for all others.\n\nChina’s Commerce Ministry concluded that the EU was dumping pork and pig by-products in China, selling them at prices below production costs or domestic market prices, and harming China’s pork industry. The final tariff rates of 4.9%-19.8% are due to take effect beginning Wednesday and last for five years.\n\nSpain, the Netherlands and Denmark will be the most affected.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry said the new tariff will apply to all kind of pork products, fresh, chilled, frozen, dried, pickled, smoked or salted.\n\nIt said it had reached its conclusions in an “objective, fair and impartial manner.”\n\nEU exports of pork products to China peaked at 7.4 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in 2020 when Beijing turned to imports to meet domestic demand after its pig farms were devastated by a swine disease.

    "title": "Do you actually need an adjustable bed? Sleep experts weigh in on the benefits, and who should pass",
    "description": "Adjustable bed frames aren't for everyone. Sleep experts recommend using one if you're a back sleeper, but skip if you're a stomach or side sleeper.",
    "fullText": "I once fantasized about how an adjustable bed would change my life. I imagined lounging in bed, reading while elevated, and fighting off acid reflux in the middle of the night. And then, I finally got one. The novelty quickly wore off.\n\nOver the last few years, the benefits of adjustable beds have been widely praised, with many mattress brands offering discounts or free bases with the purchase of a new mattress. Some models come with advanced features, such as underbed lighting, massage, and even sleep tracking. I was eager to add one to my bedroom, but I've come to realize that there is a certain subset of people who will love and benefit from an adjustable base; for others, it may just be another upsell.\n\nThe best adjustable beds can be a valuable tool for better sleep, but they're not suitable for everyone. In my case, I'm a side and stomach sleeper, and I realized these positions are not conducive to using an adjustable base, unlike those who find comfort sleeping on their back.\n\nCurious to learn if adjustable beds are worth it, I talked to Kelly Murray, a certified pediatric and adult sleep consultant and owner of Kelly Murray Sleep Consulting and Dr. Jason Snibbe, a Los Angeles-based orthopedic surgeon and sports specialist, to learn more about who can benefit from an adjustable bed frame and their impact on sleep and body health. My takeaway — if you have a medical condition that can be managed by sleeping upright, it's worth the investment. If not, you might want to skip that free mattress and adjustable frame bundle and just stick with the best mattress.\n\nWhile you can find adjustable beds being advertised to just about everyone, the real benefit is for people with a medical condition like GERD or snoring. \"If you have a diagnosed medical condition where elevation provides documented relief, an adjustable bed can be genuinely helpful,\" Murray said.\n\nAdjustable beds are most commonly used to provide relief for acid reflux and snoring, as the slight elevation can help alleviate acid reflux and reduce snoring. \"Research shows that elevating the head 6-8 inches significantly reduces nighttime reflux symptoms by using gravity to keep stomach acid down,\" Murray said. \"For snoring, elevating the head 30-60 degrees can help keep airways open, though if the cause is sleep apnea or structural issues, you need to address those underlying conditions.\"\n\nMany people with chronic pain, including conditions such as arthritis, are able to manage their symptoms by elevating their head and feet to take pressure off their spine.\"Adjustable bed frames can help with back pain by elevating your legs and flexing the lower back,\" Snibbe said. \"When your back is in the flex position, it opens up the areas where nerves are being compressed. This can decrease pain and nerve compression.\" Many adjustable beds call this \"zero gravity mode, \"which you'll frequently find as a preset. If you experience swelling in the legs, an adjustable bed can help relieve the pressure and reduce inflammation. Snibbe also recommends adjustable beds for people who experience swelling due to exercise or a vein condition.\n\nOthers — such as pregnant people, those recovering from surgery, and people with mobility issues — can benefit from the versatility of adjustable beds. Elevating the legs can make surgical recovery easier, according to Snibbe. Adjustable beds also help reduce swelling in the lower body, which is particularly beneficial for pregnant people. Plus, adjusting the height of the head or legs is useful for those with mobility issues to enter or exit the bed.\n\nMany people gravitate to adjustable frames for comfortable lounging or working in bed, although Murray recommends using your bed only for sleeping. But, if you're going to use your bed as a makeshift workspace or want to unwind with a few episodes of your favorite show before bed, the elevated head is much more comfortable than lying flat.\n\nYou'll also find other premium features on certain models, such as underbed lighting, which can be helpful if you get out of bed in the middle of the night to go to the restroom, USB ports for charging devices, sleep tracking and snore detection, and massage capabilities. The massage features however, tend to be more like a vibration than a kneading or tapping sensation. That said, the vibration could be handy as a silent alarm to help get you out of bed in the morning, as some can be programmed to turn on at certain times.\n\nIf you don't experience snoring, frequent acid reflux, chronic pain, or swelling, you likely don't need an adjustable bed. When asked who doesn't need an adjustable bed, Murray said: \"Most people, honestly. If your sleep struggles involve stress, anxiety, or racing thoughts, that's a nervous system issue, not a positioning problem,\" she said. \"Similarly, hormonally-related sleep disruptions won't be solved by an adjustable bed.\"\n\nUnless you're a back sleeper, adjustable beds might not be the most comfortable. Given that your spine should stay as straight as possible while you sleep, elevating the head and feet while sleeping on the side or stomach could cause discomfort. After trying an adjustable bed and sleeping elevated for a few nights as a stomach and side combination sleeper, I couldn't get comfortable. I did appreciate elevating the head of the bed when reading before bed, but I was just as comfortable propping myself up with pillows, and that doesn't require the same hefty investment of a bed frame. Snibbe also noted that the flex position makes it difficult to move in your bed, and makes sleeping on your side uncomfortable.\n\nIf you sleep with a partner, you'll want to consider a split-style bed to cater to different sleeping preferences, but that also requires investing in two twin XL mattresses, and in some cases, special sheets. I used a queen-size version that unilaterally lifted the mattress for both my partner and me, as opposed to giving us each individual control of our sides, which meant we both had to agree on the same incline. My partner, a back sleeper, might appreciate sleeping elevated, but as a side and stomach sleeper, I did not have the same needs.\n\nA smaller concern with adjustable beds is their appearance — they usually aren't an aesthetic addition to your bedroom as they're more of a tool. However, the good news is that many can fit inside your existing bed frame. Adjusting a mattress also leads to bedding slipping around the bed, and sheets can slip off the corners when the bed adjusts.\n\nIs an adjustable bed worth it for most people? The short answer is no — unless you sleep predominantly on your back, plan to watch TV or read in bed, or have a medical condition where sleeping elevated could alleviate symptoms. Snibbe recommends adjustable beds for those who experience chronic leg swelling or spinal conditions, and Murray agrees. \"They're worth it if you have a diagnosed condition where elevation provides documented relief and you've tried less expensive alternatives without success,\" Murray said. \"But if you're hoping an adjustable bed will cure chronic insomnia without understanding why you're not sleeping, you'll likely be disappointed.\"\n\nIf you're interested in elevating your position while you sleep but aren't sure if it's for you, Murray recommends trying less expensive alternatives first, such as wedge pillows or adjusting your pillow placement.\n\nIf you think you'd benefit from an adjustable bed, these are the best adjustable beds we've tested.\n\nThe Purple Premium Plus Smart Base is your best option for an adjustable bed with massaging capabilities, app connectivity, and pillow, head, and foot adjustments.\n\nThe Lucid L300 Bed Base is an excellent budget adjustable bed option that comes with a generous return policy and a 10-year warranty. However, it lacks bells and whistles like massage features or under-bed lights. The backlit remote, though, does have a flashlight, and the bed features built-in USB ports.\n\nIf you are looking for an adjustable bed frame that provides hard data to guide you in improving your restfulness, consider the Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Ergo Smart Base.",

    "description": "Most of us stick with the same bank once we've opened an account, not realising there are far better options available.",
    "fullText": "People’s relationships with high street banks are fairly dysfunctional. They don’t particularly love what they have to offer, or how they’re treated, but once they open an account, they hang around for decades with them because they can’t face having to find something new.\n\nUnfortunately, once people are settled with a current account, they’re very likely to stay put for all their other finance needs too. Our research shows that 42% of people hold savings with the same bank as their current account, and one in five of them never even consider an alternative.\n\nIt means we’re remarkably unlikely to switch savings accounts. The research shows that despite the Bank of England bringing in a handful of rate cuts over the past year, and the high street banks enthusiastically passing them on, 56% of people haven’t moved their savings during that time. In fact, a third haven’t switched in the past five years and more than a quarter have never made the change. When asked if they would ever switch at any time in the future, 43% of people said no.\n\nBeing loyal to your bank is always an expensive business, but it can be especially so at a time of falling rates – when the high street giants have slashed rates a lot more than competitive online banks and savings platforms. Unfortunately, inertia can be even more powerful in this environment, because people assume rate cuts are the same across the board, so they don’t bother switching.\n\nThe risk is that this cash is still sitting in high street savings accounts, which currently pay an average of 1.15%. With inflation at 3.6% it means that every passing month sees the spending power of your savings drop. It’s easy to miss this when you’re seeing interest payments go into the account every month, but you’ll soon see the impact when you come to spend it.\n\nShopping around can get you a much better deal, but it’s also worth considering what this money is for, and when you need access to it. Some of it will be emergency savings. When you’re working age, you need cash to cover three to six months’ worth of essential spending in an easy access savings account or cash ISA, and when you have retired you should be able to cover one to three years’ worth.",

    "fullText": "The holidays came early for five BlackRock employees, who joined an elite circle of some of the firm's most accomplished technologists on Tuesday.\n\nThey became members of BlackRock's Tech Fellows program, a group of 24 senior technologists playing a crucial role in the $13.5 trillion firm's vision and operations.\n\nThis year's members underwent a rigorous application process — from being nominated to completing written evaluations and interviews — before being voted into the program by current fellows, Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and executive sponsor of AI, and the co-executive sponsor of the program, said.\n\n\"We think about the combination of technical expertise, domain expertise, commercial mindset, but really lifting the platform, the culture, the experience across the firm,\" said Ajitsaria, who has been involved with Tech Fellows since it launched in 2020. Many of this year's fellows are credited with mentoring other technologists, according to an internal announcement shared with Business Insider.\n\nTechnologists are gaining more and more influence on Wall Street as firms race to adopt AI. BlackRock has long positioned itself as equal parts financial technology company and asset manager. Aladdin — the firm's sprawling risk and portfolio management platform — underpins its client relationships, and tech-related revenue is among its fastest-growing businesses. BlackRock's technology services and subscription revenue jumped 28% year-on-year over the last quarter, fueled by Aladdin and the integration of newly acquired Preqin's private-markets data business, the firm reported in its latest earnings.\n\nFour of this year's fellows work in Aladdin, though Ajitsaria said that the group has always represented a wide swath of the firm's businesses.\n\n\"We are also really deliberate about leveraging and applying our tech fellows to the firm's most critical technology initiatives,\" Ajitsaria said. As of 2023, one in every third BlackRock employee was a software engineer or technologist, according to a document about the firm.\n\nFellows meet internally at least once a month and are expected to foster the firm's engineering culture both internally and externally — they might, for example, contribute to BlackRock's engineering blog or attend conferences, Ajitsaria said.\n\nBlackRock has set high targets for the year 2030, when it aims to reach $35 billion in annual revenue and fundraising $400 billion in private markets. As Ajitsaria said, \"the 2030 vision of BlackRock is very much underpinned by technology.\"\n\nThese five new fellows have just become a more integral part of that vision.\n\nAs the head of Aladdin Studio Engineering for Aladdin Data, David Woodhead has spearheaded the effort to \"open Aladdin,\" giving stakeholders access to the platform's data and analytics models, among other tools. He's recognized for \"championing modern data platforms, cloud-native technologies, and open-source adoption,\" according to the internal announcement. Woodhead has helped craft the very architecture of Aladdin.\n\nBeyond his role at Aladdin Studio, Woodhead also oversees services that give Aladdin and its clients reference, market, and other third-party data. He joined BlackRock in 2006 and is based in Virginia, serving as a managing director.\n\nKirsty Craig has been at BlackRock for 15 years and now serves as the head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech. She's shaped how the firm uses AI and data science in investment research. While Craig is this year's only fellow who doesn't work within the Aladdin program, she has forged collaboration between the investment and technology teams.\n\nCraig has worked in offices in Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia, and is currently a managing director.\n\nNew York-based director Infant Vasanth is known for his work pushing BlackRock's internal research and automation platform forward. He joined the firm in 2011 and is now a senior director of engineering, running the team behind an analytics and automation platform.\n\nVasanth, an advocate for open-source, often speaks at tech conferences and is the brain behind multiple patent filings. He also leads a team focused on Aladdin Studio's AI abilities.\n\n\"Drawing on deep expertise in neural networks and pattern-recognition algorithms, he applies research rigor to building enterprise-scale AI systems,\" the announcement said.\n\nMichael Duncan, a director and engineering lead on Aladdin's Trading Engineering team, is the architect behind a collection of tools dubbed BlackRock's Xceler Ecosystem, which is now integral across Aladdin and has helped raise engineering standards. His team is in charge of \"delivering multi-asset trading solutions and technology across global markets,\" and Duncan has improved its abilities.\n\nBeyond that, Duncan is the global engineering lead for part of Aladdin and leads a client support and performance engineering program.\n\nDuncan joined BlackRock in 2020 and is based in Chicago.\n\nNew York-based Charlie Johnston joined BlackRock as a summer intern in 2013 and has worked his way up to being a director. A software engineer, he has improved the quality of the asset management giant's code and development processes.\n\n\"Charlie's technical contributions and collaborative approach have strengthened the engineering community across Aladdin,\" the internal announcement reads.",

    "description": "My first stay at a Ritz-Carlton resort was at the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón in Florida. The luxury hotel chain had some surprising amenities.",
    "fullText": "When I arrived at the Ritz-Carlton, Naples, my reservation was nowhere to be found. I was riddled with anxiety until an employee informed me that I was at the wrong location.\n\nMy stay was about five miles east at the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón. I didn't realize the city had two locations, and I was surprised to find out they were so close to each other.\n\nGuests of each Ritz-Carlton have access to all amenities at both locations, and a shuttle service runs between them. I was stoked because I'd never stayed at a hotel with this perk.\n\nAfter spending some time at each, I found that the resorts offered completely different experiences.\n\nWhile both were extremely luxurious, the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón was centered on golf, while the Ritz-Carlton, Naples was on the beach. The former was quieter and seemed to cater to an older crowd, while the latter felt busier with a wide range of ages.\n\nI appreciated being able to spend the day at the bustling beach resort and retiring to the calmer Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón.\n\nI've never held a putter outside mini golf, so I wasn't expecting to be at all interested in the hotel's two courses. Then I learned that they host three pro tournaments every year, according to the company's website.\n\nEven though golf isn't my thing, I instantly got excited for guests who love it. As a baseball fan, I thought about how elated I'd be by the opportunity to play at a major league stadium. So I ended up really appreciating the golf courses at the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón.\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón isn't just for golfers. The hotel has a small water park next to the pool area with tall, winding slides and a lazy river.\n\nI'd stayed at hotels that had water slides before, but I'd never even heard of one with a lazy river. I'm not much of a thrill seeker, so I was excited to partake in a leisurely water activity. I hopped into an inflatable tube and looked up at the palm trees swaying in the breeze as I floated around the shady loop.\n\nOn my second day in Naples, I took the shuttle to the hotel chain's other location on the beach. When I stepped inside, I was stunned by the most beautiful bar I'd ever seen in a hotel lobby.\n\nRenovated in 2023, RITZ Lobby Bar was designed to feel celebratory, according to the hotel's website. And I think they nailed it.\n\nDainty light fixtures dangled from the ceiling above, arched windows flooded the room with light, and gold accents brought the room together.\n\nAs a lover of boutique hotels and unique stays, I didn't expect to be blown away by the Ritz-Carlton. But since two locations in the same city offered completely different experiences, I'm intrigued to see what other Ritz-Carlton resorts are like.",

    "description": "Ina Garten's ravioli en brodo is a delicious Italian twist on chicken noodle soup. It's one of the best Barefoot Contessa recipes I've ever made.",
    "fullText": "Ravioli en brodo appears in Garten's most recent cookbook, \"Go-To Dinners.\" She said the key to its flavor is \"rich homemade chicken stock.\"\n\nI usually take the quicker option because, as the Barefoot Contessa herself says, \"store-bought is fine!\" But since the broth is clearly the star of this dish, I decided to try her homemade chicken stock instead.\n\nTo make Garten's homemade chicken stock, you'll need:\n\nPlace all the ingredients in a 16- to 20-quart stockpot, add 7 quarts of water, and bring to a boil. Then, lower the heat and simmer your stock uncovered, skimming off any foam that comes to the top, for at least four hours. (I let it simmer for about six.)\n\nLet the stock cool, then strain through a colander and discard the solids.\n\nTo make Garten's ravioli en brodo for a serving of 4-6, you'll need:\n\nI chopped the onions, peeled and sliced the carrots, and diced the celery and fennel.\n\nI added ¼ cup of olive oil to a pot placed over medium heat. Then, I threw in the onions, celery, carrots, and fennel and cooked them for 15 minutes, making sure to stir occasionally until they had softened.\n\nI also threw in 2 cups of water, per Garten's instructions.\n\nOne thing I've learned in my soup-making season is that a Parmesan rind can add so much extra flavor to your broth.\n\nAs explained by Food & Wine, the Parmesan rind — which is completely edible — releases a \"savory and nutty\" depth as it begins to melt and also helps give soups a \"silky consistency.\"\n\nYou can store Parmesan rinds in a Ziploc bag in your freezer for up to a year, so it's always on hand whenever you need to add a little more umami to your dinner.\n\nGarten says you should let the soup simmer partially uncovered.\n\nI grated my Parmesan cheese and minced some dill for the soup toppings.\n\nI cooked my ravioli in a pot of boiling water with two tablespoons of salt for about four minutes.\n\nEvery pasta is different, so make sure to follow the specific directions on the package of your ravioli.\n\nI started with four raviolis but quickly realized I wanted more.\n\nThere's something about this soup that just looks so elegant and impressive. The broth has such a lovely golden hue, and the pops of color from the carrots and dill give it a rustic charm.\n\nAnd did I mention it smelled phenomenal?\n\nI've made nearly 50 Barefoot Contessa dishes over the past few years, and her ravioli en brodo soup is one of the best. The broth is so rich and full-bodied that it really blew me away. I made this for my fiancé for dinner one night, and he couldn't resist getting seconds (and thirds).\n\n\"A lot of broths are kind of bland or lacking, but this broth alone was just exploding with flavor,\" he told me.\n\nThe dill and lemon also add some lovely brightness to the soup, which pairs perfectly with the cheesy pasta. I opted for a cacio e pepe ravioli and would highly recommend it, as I loved that extra kick of pepper.\n\nMy only complaint about Garten's ravioli en brodo is that it has forever ruined store-bought chicken stock for me. However, an extra day of work is absolutely worth it for this soup, which I know I'll be making again and again.",

    "description": "\"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are,\" Susie Wiles said of Elon Musk Musk. \"You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\"",
    "fullText": "One of President Donald Trump's top aides has some thoughts on Elon Musk.\n\nIn a series of interviews with Vanity Fair published on Tuesday, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles weighed in on Musk's time as the de facto leader of DOGE, her thoughts on the Musk-led shuttering of USAID, and Musk's personality quirks.\n\n\"The challenge with Elon is keeping up with him,\" Wiles told the outlet, calling Musk an \"avowed ketamine\" user who \"sleeps in a sleeping bag\" in an office building adjacent to the White House during the daytime. \"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are. You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\"\n\nAsked about a meme Musk had reposted and later unshared about public sector workers murdering people under the dictatorships of Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong, Wiles said: \"I think that's when he's microdosing.\"\n\nIn June, Musk denied being a current ketamine user, writing on X that he was \"NOT taking drugs.\" He said he'd had a prescription for the drug \"a few years ago\" but hadn't taken it since then.\n\nReached for further comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson for Musk's xAI told Business Insider: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"\n\nIn a separate interview on Monday with the New York Times, Wiles denied commenting on Musk's drug use, saying she \"wouldn't have said it and I wouldn't know.\" But the Times reported that the journalist Chris Whipple, who interviewed Wiles for Vanity Fair, played a tape for the Times in which she could be heard making the comments.\n\nOne of the most notable features of Musk's White House tenure was the sudden dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n\n\"I was initially aghast,\" Wiles told Vanity Fair. \"Because I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work.\"\n\nWiles said the dismantling of USAID was \"not the way\" she would do it, and that she told Musk that he \"can't just lock people out of their offices.\"\n\n\"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"\n\nMusk left the White House in the spring and had a falling-out with Trump over the \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" though the two men appear to have mended their relationship in recent months.\n\nWiles wrote on X on Tuesday morning that the Vanity Story was a \"disingenuously framed hit piece,\" and that \"significant context was disregarded\" in order to \"paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"\n\nAsked about Wiles's comments, the White House sent Business Insider a supportive statement from Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n\"Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history,\" Leavitt said. \"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie. The entire Administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her.\"",

    "title": "Meet the world's 5th-richest person: Oracle founder Larry Ellison's net worth hit massive highs and lows in 2025",
    "description": "Meet Larry Ellison, the world's fifth-richest man. He cofounded Oracle in 1977 and is still one of Silicon Valley's top dogs.",
    "fullText": "Larry Ellison is the founder and chief technology officer of the software giant Oracle.\n\nNow, he's also the world's fifth-wealthiest man, with a net worth of $238 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nEllison's 2025 was marked by big financial gains and losses. Ellison briefly claimed the title of the world's richest person when his net worth soared to $393 billion that September. Oracle shares surged after the company reported quarterly results and delivered a blockbuster outlook for its AI-powered cloud business. Later that month, his wealth had nearly doubled during the year.\n\nHowever, his fortune took a $25 billion hit toward the end of 2025 after Oracle's shares fell by more than 11% based on weaker-than-expected earnings results. December 12 marked one of the largest single-day drops in net worth this year. Tesla chief Elon Musk then resumed his place as the world's wealthiest man.\n\nOracle, like other tech giants, is betting big on artificial intelligence, and Ellison is leading the charge at the company. His latest focus is on building data centers for companies such as OpenAI.\n\nEllison started Oracle in 1977. Decades later, despite living in Hawaii, he's still one of the top dogs in Silicon Valley.\n\nHere's a look at Ellison's life and career so far.\n\nEllison was born in the Bronx on August 17, 1944, to a single mother, Florence Spellman. Raised in Chicago's South Side, he attended the University of Illinois but dropped out after his adoptive mother died. He later attended the University of Chicago for a semester, but also dropped out.\n\nIn 1966, at the age of 22, he moved to Berkeley, California, near the emerging tech hub of Silicon Valley. He worked a series of jobs, including at Wells Fargo and mainframe maker Amdahl, where he picked up programming skills.\n\nOracle was founded in 1977 with $2,000, inspired by IBM scientist Edgar F. Codd's revolutionary idea of relational databases. Its first product was dubbed Version 2. After briefly rebranding as Relational Software Inc., the company became Oracle Systems in 1982 and went public in 1986 with $55 million in revenue.\n\nGrowth was rapid, but in 1990, Oracle nearly went bankrupt after revenue miscalculations led to losses and layoffs. By 1992, the launch of Oracle7 put the company back on track. Throughout the '90s, Oracle sparred with rivals like Informix and benefited from the dot-com boom, supplying databases to countless startups.\n\nFlush with cash, Oracle went on an acquisition spree, buying PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in 2005 and Sun Microsystems in 2010, gaining control of key technologies like MySQL. That same year, Ellison recruited Mark Hurd alongside Safra Catz, who later became co-CEOs.\n\nEllison stepped down as CEO in 2014, assuming the roles of chairman and chief technology officer.\n\nEllison, Oracle's largest shareholder, has used his fortune to fuel a life of high-profile investments, philanthropy, and headline-making purchases.\n\nHe races yachts, sails, and partially financed the BMW Oracle USA team that won the 2010 America's Cup.\n\nHe has also built a collection of Richard Mille watches worth hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each. In 2009, he purchased the Indian Wells tennis tournament for $100 million.\n\nIn 2012, he bought 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, where he later moved full-time, developing real estate and a wellness retreat, and backing a farming startup. His real estate portfolio also includes mansions in Malibu, Palm Beach, and Rhode Island.\n\nHe has been an active investor for a long time. An early backer of Salesforce, he also invested in Leapfrog and the ill-fated Theranos.\n\nOne of his most lucrative bets was NetSuite: A $125 million stake in 1998 turned into a $3.5 billion windfall when Oracle acquired the company in 2016.\n\nEllison also served on Apple's board in the late 1990s and joined Tesla's board in 2018 before stepping down in 2022.\n\nEllison's daughter, Megan, is an Oscar-nominated film producer and the founder of Annapurna Pictures. The company has produced films like \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"American Hustle.\"\n\nEllison's son, David, is also in the film business. His company, Skydance Media, has produced movies like \"Terminator: Dark Fate\" and films in the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise.\n\nAfter months of discussions in 2024, Skydance Media and Paramount agreed to a deal, which created Paramount Skydance. David is the CEO. Ellison and David, who own a controlling stake in Paramount and were outbid by Netflix for Warner Bros. Discovery, launched a hostile $30-per-share offer for all of WBD in December 2025.\n\nParamount Skydance oversees Paramount Pictures, the streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV, as well as CBS and cable networks, including Comedy Central and MTV.\n\nEllison signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, vowing to give away 95% of his fortune.\n\nHe has donated millions, including $200 million to a USC cancer center in 2016, which was eventually renamed the Ellison Institute of Technology. The EIT announced an Oxford campus in 2023.\n\nHe's also been visible during Donald Trump's second term as president.\n\nEllison appeared alongside Sam Altman of OpenAI and Masayoshi Son of SoftBank at Trump's press conference the day after the president's inauguration in January 2024 to announce Project Stargate, a joint venture that would see up to $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure in the US.\n\n\"He's sort of CEO of everything. He's an amazing man,\" Trump said as he introduced Ellison, who is seen as his longtime ally.",

    "description": "When hosting for the holidays, etiquette experts suggest avoiding mistakes like not having enough seating for guests or over serving alcohol.",
    "fullText": "Although hosting friends and family for the holidays can be fun, there's no denying that doing so also comes with its fair share of stress. Without proper planning, things can even get chaotic.\n\nTo avoid making etiquette mistakes in the process, Business Insider asked two experts to share the top mistakes they see people make when hosting. Here's what they said.\n\nDiane Gottsman, a national etiquette expert and the owner of the Protocol School of Texas, told BI that hosts should never reprimand a guest for bringing an unexpected plus-one.\n\nIf this happens, she said to address the issue later — not in front of others.\n\n\"You don't want to reprimand the guest or the guest's guest in front of anyone. Later on, you can say, 'Sally, I wasn't expecting a plus one because it kind of put me in an awkward position with other people.' But you can say that privately at another time, not that night,\" Gottsman said.\n\nWhen it comes to seating, it's important to double check your head count and ensure everyone has a place to sit. Gottsman said this should also be done for more casual events like cocktail or dinner parties.\n\n\"You want to have enough seating for people,\" Gottsman said.\n\nEtiquette and hosting expert Carla Shellis said another common mistake hosts make is not considering how they want their event or home to feel.\n\nGottsman shared similar thoughts, telling BI, \"When the doorbell rings with your first guest, you should not still be in your hair rollers, or lighting candles, or racing around talking about how busy you are.\"\n\nTo combat a chaotic situation, Shellis likes to play music, light candles, and clean the space before her guests arrive. She also gives herself plenty of time to get everything done so she doesn't have to rush.\n\nShellis told BI that serving too much alcohol is an easy way to create unnecessary issues at a party. That's why it's important to ensure everyone is enjoying themselves in moderation.\n\nFor instance, Shellis said when people ask her if she has any more wine, she'll say no and redirect them by offering other beverages like iced tea or soda.\n\n\"For 30 years, I've been hosting parties, and I'm going to tell you there's nothing that will kill a beautiful environment quicker than somebody that's hammered and acting foolish,\" Shellis told BI.",

    "fullText": "Newly captured satellite imagery shows the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone attack that targeted a Russian submarine at a naval base on the Black Sea.\n\nThe new imagery, captured on Tuesday by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and obtained by Business Insider, shows damage to a section of a quay at the port of Novorossiysk next to a Kilo-class submarine.\n\nUkraine's internal security agency said on Monday that it used underwater drones to strike a Russian submarine at the port in a first-of-its-kind attack. Kyiv published footage of the operation, which caused a large blast in the port, and said it damaged and disabled the boat.\n\nRussian state media, citing the Black Sea Fleet, said later on Monday that the attack failed to damage a submarine.\n\nThe satellite imagery does not appear to reveal any visible damage to a submarine; however, there could be some beneath the surface, making it difficult to determine the success of the operation.\n\nRussia's Kilo-class submarines — diesel-electric boats that have been in service since the 1980s — are used to carry out Kalibr cruise missile strikes against Ukraine, making them a high-value target for Kyiv.\n\nThe new imagery also reveals floating barriers at the entrance of the port, a tactic that Russia has used to protect its warships and infrastructure from Ukrainian naval drone attacks. However, this kind of defense is primarily aimed at surface threats, as the underwater drone was still able to enter the port and cause an explosion.\n\nUkraine has used its fleet of explosive-packed naval drones and long-range missiles to damage and destroy dozens of Russian warships and vessels since the start of the full-scale invasion.\n\nThis asymmetric campaign has forced Russia to relocate its Black Sea Fleet away from its long-held headquarters in the occupied Crimean peninsula to Novorossiysk, on the other side of the region. However, Ukraine continues to demonstrate that it can also target this port.\n\nThe attack, the latest against the Black Sea Fleet, appears to signal a new chapter in drone warfare. Ukraine has mainly relied on surface naval drones to target Russian warships.\n\nThe use of an underwater drone, compared to a slow-moving mine or torpedo, suggests a significant expansion of Ukraine's capabilities that could pose a new threat to the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nConflict analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, wrote in a battlefield assessment on Monday that Russia had docked its Kilo-class submarines in Crimea but moved them to Novorossiysk several years ago because of Ukraine's strike campaign.\n\nThe recent underwater drone attack \"shows that Ukrainian forces continue to modernize and optimize their unmanned capabilities such that Ukraine can strike Russian military targets at a range that Russian forces previously thought safe,\" the analysts said.",

    "fullText": "Dallas' local government just made it harder to vape in shared spaces, and that's good news for community health, reported FOX 4 News.\n\nThe city is widening its smoking rules to include e-cigarettes starting December 11, prohibiting vaping indoors, near building doorways, and throughout parks.\n\nCity council members approved the policy change late last year after health organizations urged action. The American Heart Association and Dallas County Medical Society were among groups pushing for new rules.\n\nFines for vaping in off-limits areas can reach $500 for each violation. Officials said they will respond to complaints and hand out citations after confirming reported incidents.\n\nSome exceptions apply to private homes, theatrical performances, licensed cigar lounges, smoking-permitted hotel rooms, and certain outdoor spaces including patios at restaurants and courses at golf clubs.\n\nWhen someone vapes, the device produces a mist carrying tiny particles that drift toward others nearby. Health professionals informed lawmakers that secondhand vapor exposure has ties to cancer and respiratory problems resembling asthma. The city's Office of Environmental Quality noted that PM2.5 particles emitted by e-cigarettes have been linked to birth defects.\n\nIn addition to negative impacts on air quality, the boom in disposable vaping has added another stream of hard-to-recycle waste to an already strained system. Disposable vapes have become a top contributor to plastic waste and electronic trash, and each device contains lithium batteries that pose fire hazards when tossed in regular garbage.\n\nMillions of these single-use products end up in landfills each year, where they leach toxic chemicals into soil and water.\n\n\"As we know, vaping is a serious public health matter impacting our youth and most vulnerable,\" said Kathy Stewart, a council member. \"I am pleased about the vote to enact these amendments.\"\n\nRenee Roberson, a nurse at a local school who serves as District 8 environmental commissioner, shared what she's witnessed firsthand.\n\n\"It rewires the kids into something negative,\" she said. \"Kids who are bright, then their focus becomes the vaping.\"\n\nDo you think cigarettes should be illegal?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Popular twin pandas at a Tokyo zoo are set to return to their homeland in China in late January, officials said Monday, leaving Japan without a panda for the first time in about half a century.\n\nProspects for their replacement are not favorable either as ties between the two countries have deteriorated.\n\nThe twins, Xiao Xiao and his sister Lei Lei, were born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens in 2021, and raised, but they remain on loan from China and have to be returned by February.\n\nTheir parents Shin Shin and Ri Ri returned home last year after China loaned them for breeding research in 2011.\n\nThe last day of public viewing for the 4-year-old twins will be Jan. 25, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government.\n\nJapan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said pandas have long been loved by Japanese people and he hoped friendship through panda diplomacy between the two countries will continue.\n\n“Exchanges through pandas have contributed to improve the public sentiment between Japan and China, and we hope the relationship will continue,” Kihara said. He noted that a number of local municipalities and zoos have expressed hope that new pandas will to be loaned soon.\n\nChina sent the first pair of pandas to Japan in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Since then, Japan has never been left without a panda.\n\nGiant pandas are native to southwestern China and serve as an unofficial national mascot. Beijing lends them to other countries as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over them and any cubs they produce.\n\nRelations between Japan and China have worsened since Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in early November that its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nChina has since restricted tourism to Japan, and cultural events and exchanges between local governments have been canceled. The row escalated this month when Chinese drills involving an aircraft carrier near southern Japan prompted Tokyo to scramble fighter jets. It also protested that Japanese aircraft were targeted by repeated radar-locking — a move considered as possible preparation for missile firing.",

    "fullText": "The University of Michigan is not firing the woman involved in the \"inappropriate\" relationship with Sherrone Moore.\n\nMoore, the program's football coach, was fired for having an \"inappropriate\" relationship with a female staff member. He was later arrested on criminal trespassing and stalking charges, after learning of his firing. Michigan said in a statement last Wednesday night, December 10, that Moore was being fired immediately.\n\n“When the findings of a university investigation into Coach Moore’s behavior were presented on Wednesday, we immediately terminated his employment,” Grasso wrote in a letter to the university,\" the school's president said.\n\n“There is absolutely no tolerance for this conduct at the University of Michigan. None.”\n\nBut while Moore was fired for having the \"inappropriate\" relationship with the staff member, the woman - who also hid the relationship from the school for months, if not longer - is not being fired.\n\nThe University of Michigan announced that the woman is still employed by the university.\n\nThe school's policy does not apply to her. It only applied to Moore, since he was the person in power, according to USA TODAY.\n\n“Recognizing that Intimate Relationships exist or may develop in the workplace that are not initiated by a Supervisor and are free from coercion and abuse of power, immediate disclosure of the relationship by the Supervisor is required,” the policy states. “Failure of the Supervisor to disclose an Intimate Relationship is a serious offense and cause for discipline, up to and including dismissal from employment.”\n\nThe woman was technically encouraged to share news of the relationship with the school, though she wasn't required to do so.\n\n“Although encouraged, Supervisees have no obligation to disclose,” the policy states.\n\nThe school recognizes that the person in the relationship who has more power at the school has the opportunity to abuse said power. The person without it has less.\n\n“Intimate Relationships initiated by a Supervisor are at high risk of being unwelcomed and experienced by the Supervisee as harassment,” the policy states. “Supervisors are therefore responsible for understanding how their statements and conduct may reasonably be interpreted by persons who do not share their same level of power.”\n\nThe school clearly outlines its rules in Policy No. 201.97.\n\nIt states that a supervisor may not “implicitly or explicitly, initiate or attempt to initiate an intimate relationship with a supervisee.”\n\nSo it was Moore, who has been married for 10 years with three children, that was the one at fault.",

    "title": "Trump’s reaction to Reiner’s murder is indefensible — but America has been here before",
    "description": "Of course, President Donald Trump doubled down on his tasteless social media post about murdered Hollywood director Rob Reiner.",
    "fullText": "Of course, President Donald Trump doubled down on his tasteless social media post about murdered Hollywood director Rob Reiner.\n\nTrump never second-guesses himself, no matter how heinous his actions or words.\n\nHe’s played this game for years, wielding insults and the consequent outrage as a tool of power that solidifies his outsider status and seeds new feuds — which his supporters adore — against political and media elites.\n\nSo the question arising from his diatribes about the “When Harry Met Sally” director is not whether they are grossly offensive. They are. Nor is the fallout likely to destroy Trump politically. Outlandish behavior has never brought him down. And his compulsion to make the tragedy all about himself by declaring Reiner died because of anger he stirred over “Trump Derangement Syndrome” will surprise no one.\n\nBut Trump’s latest assault on decency came at an unprecedented moment in his political story. He’s suffered unheard of revolts from Republicans: in Indiana over his midterm redistricting drive; in the House of Representatives over the Epstein files. He’s out of touch with voters over high prices for groceries, health care and housing. Trump’s approval ratings have also crashed. And some Republicans are envisioning a future freed from all the baggage their president brings.\n\nMaybe his disdain for Reiner, a vocal Trump critic and Democratic fundraiser, was another one of his frequent attempts at deflection. Perhaps it was just an outlet for his ever-boiling lust for vengeance, even against deceased adversaries. (He accused Reiner of being one of the instigators of the Russia controversy during his first term.)\n\nTrump’s first outburst on Truth Social was so offensive, it was necessary to check it was real, and not the work of some AI imposter. But his refusal to repudiate his sentiments later in the Oval Office was a window into his current mood, his diminished political state and his deteriorating public conduct after recently calling a female reporter “piggy.”\n\nHistory suggests that Trump will ride out the controversy over Reiner, who was found dead along with his wife Michele Singer Reiner at their Brentwood, California, home on Sunday. Many MAGA supporters in the social media swamp Monday seemed to regard his comments as truth-telling and a mark of authenticity.\n\nBut this uproar could underscore Trump’s lost connection with most of the country. It reinforces a sense that he remains obsessed with his own grievances rather than focused on working for all Americans.\n\nAnyone in a position of authority in business or the media who’d publicly lambasted Reiner hours after his death would probably have been fired. Trump has no such worries. But ahead of midterm elections next year, Americans may begin to balk at a head of state who injects such poison into the public square ruling unchecked by his pliant party in Congress for a further two years after 2026.\n\nThese are grim times. Reiner’s horrific murder came on the same weekend as a campus shooting at Brown University and an antisemitic massacre in Australia. People are scared and demoralized. In such circumstances, presidents are counted upon to offer consolation, not political bile. Voters may look for an antidote in 2028.\n\nTrump’s outbursts also undercut weeks of complaints by his supporters and conservative media about people who celebrated or politicized the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, as CNN’s Aaron Blake reported.\n\nBut there’s also a more sinister possibility teased out by his comments about Reiner. Across Washington, Trump is being regarded as a lame duck whose power is ebbing, like almost every other term-limited second-term president. But his behavior may be an omen that his eclipse will, as it was in 2020, be marked by abuses of power and acrimony rather than acceptance.\n\nTrump’s power base in Washington has eroded, but not crumbled, as shown by a closing of ranks in the GOP last week over controversial strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats off Venezuela.\n\nStill, there are members of the GOP now willing to condemn Trump.\n\n“Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,” conservative Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, a now-frequent Trump critic, wrote on X. “I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they’re afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.”\n\nAnother MAGA dissident, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, wrote on X that the tragedy of the Reiners was “not about politics or political enemies” and that the proper response should be empathy. The Los Angeles Police Department said that the couple’s son Nick, who struggled with addiction and mental health issues, is “responsible” for their deaths.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz posted a generous tribute to Reiner on X. He told reporters later he was “grieving” for the Hollywood director’s family but that the president could “speak for himself.”\n\nLouisiana Sen. John Kennedy is known for his turns of phrase. But he advised the president to speak less. “A wise man once said nothing. Why? Because he’s a wise man. President Trump should have said nothing,” Kennedy told CNN’s Manu Raju.\n\nSeveral House members also criticized Trump. New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said, “I don’t think it was a proper thing to say at this time. It was a tragedy, and I don’t think he should bring politics into it. It was unfortunate.”\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson, who owed his swift rise from the backbenches to Trump, displayed a classic case of GOP fence-sitting. “I don’t do ongoing commentary about everything that’s said by everybody in government every day,” he said.\n\nA decade ago, Trump caused similar revulsion with his slander of Republican Sen. John McCain, a true American hero who spent years in the infamous “Hanoi Hilton” prison during the Vietnam War. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said. “I like people who weren’t captured.”\n\nTrump’s success in riding out a controversy that might have ended anyone else’s presidential campaign became a symbol of how he’d changed the GOP and the laws of politics.\n\nThe Reiner episode shows Trump hasn’t changed. But it’s the latest data point in a growing test case over the tolerance of his party and the country for his antics.",

    "fullText": "A High Court judge has thrown out a legal claim from a man who claimed to represent a Saudi prince in an alleged sale of Reform UK treasurer Nick Candy’s penthouse.\n\nMichael Brown brought “hopeless” legal action against Mr Candy and a group of eight others, including One Hyde Park, the Knightsbridge complex that contains Mr Candy’s penthouse, Judge Neil Cadwallader said.\n\nMr Brown, who represented himself at a Tuesday hearing but left halfway through citing medical reasons, appeared to be seeking £659 million over an alleged fraudulent valuation of the penthouse and an alleged breach of contract, the judge said.\n\n“The nature of the claim is extremely difficult to discern from the brief details given in the claim form and the witness evidence of the claimant, while expanding these details somewhat does not make the matter any clearer,” the judge said.\n\nHe added: “Not only were these claims hopeless, they were misconceived and baseless and bound to fail.”\n\nDavid Lascelles, for Mr Candy, said in written submissions that Mr Brown had contacted Mr Candy’s representatives in 2016, saying that a Saudi prince was interested in buying the penthouse at One Hyde Park.\n\nIn July of that year, Mr Candy provided a letter from the estate agency Savills which showed an estimated value of £160 million and that a full valuation could be given if negotiations progressed.\n\nMr Lascelles said that two days later, however, Mr Brown sent an email saying he had received racist abuse at the hotel next to One Hyde Park, the Mandarin Oriental.\n\nHe said that he could not recommend the sale of the penthouse, meaning the sale was off.\n\nIn 2018, Mr Brown brought legal action at the High Court against Mr Candy, his company Candy Capital, and One Hyde Park, attempting to claim £1.5 billion, but this was thrown out by a judge.\n\nMr Lascelles said: “The claimant now seeks to resurrect the claims already found to be totally without merit.”\n\nHe continued: “It is a reasonable inference that the claimant is seeking to deploy these proceedings to exert pressure and to generate publicity by scurrilous allegations, rather than to pursue any properly arguable legal claim.\n\n“He has wasted significant public resources, including the time of numerous judges, masters and employees of HM Courts and Tribunals Service, against whom he has also made serious and wholly unfounded allegations of wrongdoing.”\n\nMr Brown was made bankrupt following the previous litigation after he failed to pay legal costs.\n\nAt the hearing on Tuesday, he said he was made bankrupt as a result of fraud.\n\nHe said: “Any reasonable person would say that is a kangaroo court. This is the basic principle, I am entitled to have a fair trial and a completely fair fight.\n\n“How can it be a fair fight if I am outnumbered?”\n\nHe also asked the court to allow his case to continue because he was “hoping to get the backing of Elon Musk”.\n\nIf that happens, the case “will be all over”, he added.\n\nMr Brown also claimed that lawyers for Mr Candy had “cheated” by confirming a witness statement as true when they knew it to be false.\n\nHe said that this amounted to contempt of court, but it was refused by Judge Cadwallader, who described Mr Brown’s claims as “incoherent”.\n\nThe judge said: “Mr Brown attempted to suggest that the lawyers acting for the defendants were clever people and used to the exercise of working out what the claim means, but that is no answer.\n\n“They are entitled not to have to guess.”\n\nHe continued: “Accordingly, I will make an order dismissing the claimant’s claim on all these grounds against all the defendants.”\n\nJudge Cadwallader also ordered a civil restraining order to prevent Mr Brown from bringing further legal action about the same issue and ordered him to pay costs.",

    "description": "These little dongles are actually pretty versatile.",
    "fullText": "Chromecasts were one of the most useful little gadgets that Google ever made, so of course it decided to ditch the product line. The Google Cast functionality lives on in the Google TV Streamer and Google TV devices and televisions, but sadly we won't see another Chromecast go on sale.\n\nIf you've got an older Chromecast hanging around, it'll still work fine for now. However, you might soon be moving on to a newer streaming device—or perhaps you already have—and that's left you wondering what to do with your older hardware. In fact, these small dongles are more versatile than you might have realized.\n\nWhile streaming content from the likes of Netflix and Apple TV is going to be the primary use for these devices for most people, you can do plenty more with them—thanks to the casting support that Google and other developers have built into their apps.\n\nIf you've got a Chromecast-compatible security camera (including Google's Nest Cams), you can see a live feed on your Chromecast, making it easy to set up a mini security monitoring center if you have a smaller monitor or television somewhere to spare.\n\nGetting the feed up on screen is as easy as saying \"hey Google, show my...\" followed by the camera name (as listed in the Google Home app). On the Chromecast with Google TV, you can also open the Google Home widget that appears on the main Settings pane.\n\nSomething else you can throw to a Chromecast in seconds: any tab you happen to have open in Google Chrome on your laptop or desktop. Just click the three dots in the top right corner of the tab, then choose Cast, Save and Share > Cast.\n\nThis means you can use the monitor or TV that your Chromecast is hooked up to as a second screen, with no cables required—just a wifi network.\n\nWhen it comes to slinging content to your TV screen, you're going to think about movies and shows first and foremost, but the Google Cast standard works with audio apps as well—including the likes of Spotify, Pocket Casts, and Audible.\n\nThis is especially worth looking into if you've got a soundbar or a high-end speaker system connected to your television, because it means you can enjoy your audio streams at a much higher volume and a much higher level of quality, compared to your phone.\n\nThis one needs a Chromecast with local storage installed, so I'm primarily talking about the Chromecast with Google TV. That device supports local apps, which means it also lets you set up games to play with the remote or a connected Bluetooth controller.\n\nSee what you can find by browsing the Google Play Store, but Super Macro 64 showcases 25 different titles you can play easily, while the folks at XDA Developers have put together a full guide to creating a retro game emulator with the help of RetroArch.\n\nChromecasts work great as a way to add some ambience to a room when you're not actually watching something on a TV or monitor. You can show your own personal pictures, or a selection of nature shots, or pretty much anything you want.\n\nEither cast via Google Photos (open an album, tap the three dots in the top right corner, then Cast), or set up a screensaver through the Google Home app. Select your Chromecast, tap the gear icon (top right), then choose Ambient mode.\n\nTrying to hold video calls—whether with family over the holidays or colleagues during a meeting—isn't always easy on a phone screen or even a laptop screen, so why not take advantage of a larger monitor or TV with a Chromecast plugged into it?\n\nFor this to work you need to be using Google Meet in a web browser on a computer. You can either choose the \"cast this meeting\" option before it starts, or click the three dots during the meeting (Google has full instructions online).",

    "title": "Use the Eight Elements of the ‘Flow State’ to Be More Productive",
    "description": "Being in a \"flow state\" is way more than just some corporate lingo.",
    "fullText": "You hear people talk about working in a “flow state,” but what does that even mean? before you start thinking of it as one of those corporate jargon phrases that gets tossed around so much it loses any meaning it ever had, it's worth knowing that it's a \"real\" thing, backed up by a whole lot of psychological research. In essence, being in a flow state enables you to work more efficiently and effectively at whatever you're focused on.\n\nPsychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi came up with this theory in 1970, suggesting a flow state is similar to when someone is floating along, being carried by water: Their brains are working so efficiently they’re moving straight ahead on a task with no issues, almost as if they are being propelled forward.\n\nHe spent his time interviewing artists and athletes at the top of their game to understand when and how they performed optimally—and how everyday people can tap into a “flow” state, too. He wrote several books on the topic, but for our purposes here, you don't need to ingest all of them. What's most important is to understand the eight main traits of flow theory.\n\nCsíkszentmihályi’s work ultimately describes eight clear characteristics of being in flow:\n\nYou’re completely concentrated on your task.\n\nYou have clarity around goals in your mind and can get immediate feedback.\n\nTime feels like it's transforming, either speeding up or slowing down.\n\nThe work is intrinsically rewarding.\n\nThere is a sense of effortlessness or ease.\n\nThe work is challenging, but you have the skills for it.\n\nYou are not self-conscious; actions and awareness are working together.\n\nYou feel you have control over the task.\n\nThis may remind you of the concept of “deep work,” which is author/professor Cal Newport’s definition of doing demanding tasks when you’re fully engrossed in them and not distracted. The two concepts are similar, but to achieve either, there are a few things you need to do. It’s clear from the list of flow characteristics above that mastery and resources play a big role in whether you'll feel you’re in a flow state when you're working. Obviously you’ll likely only hit this state if you’re doing something you’re completely prepared for, so don’t aim for it if you’re going to be doing something that requires contributions from other people, resources you don’t have, or skills you don’t possess. You can be ripped from it quickly if, say, you're waiting around for a colleague to email you something you need for the project, which can destabilize your whole day. (For a better understanding of that, it's worth familiarizing yourself with the difference between downtime and idle time.)\n\nWhen you are trying to hit a flow state, plan around when you need to do a major, demanding task. For instance, when planning your 1-3-5 to-do list for the day, your one big task should be one you’re fully prepared and have all the resources for. Keep Carlson’s Law—the idea that any work you attempt to do while distracted will be suboptimal—in mind, too; you can’t work, let alone flow, if you’re being pulled in multiple directions, so schedule the time you’re going to take on your big task to coincide with a time when you have nothing else going on and can give it your full attention. Use timeboxing to allocate this time in your schedule, minute by minute, and, if you can, make your calendar publicly visible so people in your organization know you’re not available.\n\nWhen I explored adopting this mindset in my own life, I found that my biggest blocker was dealing with distractions, especially from my phone (no surprise there). Almost counterintuitively, I found two apps to be helpful: Steppin, which blocks my access to distracting apps unless I trade time I've banked by walking around in the real world; and Focus Pomo, which blocks all other apps whenever I'm in a \"focus session.\"\n\nSo, if you’re working hard on something but don’t feel like you’re achieving any kind of flow state, refer back to the list of characteristics to see what’s missing. Are you distracted? Do you not have the option to get immediate feedback? Are you lacking a necessary resource? Is the work too challenging for your skills or maybe even not challenging enough to keep your attention? Identifying which characteristic you’re lacking most will help you fix the problem and get you closer to flowing your way to major productivity.",

    "title": "This Ridiculously Detailed Spreadsheet Has Helped Me Stick to My New Year’s Resolutions for Five Years",
    "description": "I track every book read, every mile run, and every beer crushed (I only ballpark that last one).",
    "fullText": "New Year's Eve is my favorite holiday. I love a designated time to look forward and to reflect back, ideally while getting tipsy with friends. The turn of a new year is also a time when I’m grateful for my habit of writing down every little thing—and I don’t just mean getting my thoughts and feelings down in a journal. I’m talking about tracking every book read, every mile run, and every beer crushed (approximately). So if you’re interested in documenting your life—and you should be!—I highly recommend using a wonderfully detailed spreadsheet.\n\nI’m not talking about bullet journaling (which can be cool, but which I find too artistically daunting). I simply create a Google sheet full of different color-coded tabs so that I can track any number of ways to measure a year. From the most thorough travel plans to your fitness journey, if you have a goal, that goal needs a spreadsheet tab.\n\nIt’s a fun, slightly nerdy technique that helps me visualize my life in a way that traditional journaling can’t. Here’s why I think this year, you should start your own spreadsheet to track all the little things in your life.\n\nThe spreadsheet journal is perfect for us freaks who like to combine sentimentalism with statistics. Whatever metrics you choose to jot down, you can frame them around a sense of accomplishment. Your smart watch can track how many steps you’ve taken. A spreadsheet journal, however, is where you can appreciate how many steps you’ve achieved. From there, you can have fun with the numbers, converting those steps into miles or finding patterns over time or in whatever suits your nerdy brain.\n\nGo wild. Create different tabs dedicated to different areas of your life, so you can appreciate how much you have going on. I’ll throw around some ideas below, but at the end of the day, this technique is really about recognizing the value in every little number that defines your life. It sounds counterintuitive, but please, don’t get too caught up in the details.\n\nThe foundation of my system comes down to three main principles:\n\nRadical honesty without shame. Every entry is data, not a judgment. Missed a week of workouts? Log it. The spreadsheet reveals patterns—maybe you always skip exercise when work gets stressful—which lets you plan around obstacles instead of feeling guilty about them.\n\nMicro-goals over macro-dreams. Break each resolution into the smallest possible action. \"Write a book\" becomes \"write 250 words daily.\" These micro-goals are easy to track, hard to rationalize away, and create momentum through small wins.\n\nWeekly reviews, monthly adjustments. You'll spend 10 minutes every Sunday reviewing your data and 30 minutes at month's end analyzing trends and tweaking your approach. This prevents the \"check back in December\" trap where you discover too late that nothing worked.\n\nFirst things first: Choose your spreadsheet software. I opt for the ease of Google Sheets, but I understand you might have some privacy concerns there. Or maybe you’re simply a master at Excel. The main takeaway is to create one master file with as many different tabs as you see fit. Include tabs tracking your health/fitness goals, books/movies/TV you’ve consumed, your finances/budgeting, and whatever else is significant to you:\n\nMake sure you include a column for adding notes to your entries—some personal commentary to spice up the statistics.\n\nI've created a barebones template you can download here. It has some starter tabs to get started: a resolution dashboard, daily habit tracker, and weekly review template. Following these templates, you could add a monthly deep dive, or even more detailed activity logs.\n\nThe resolution dashboard is your command center, providing an at-a-glance view of all goals. My sample columns include:\n\nResolution Name: Be specific. Your goal may be to \"get healthy,\" but somewhere you need to write down a specific action item, like \"complete 150 workouts this year.\"\n\nCategory: Physical, Professional, Financial, Personal, Social, Creative.\n\nTarget Metric: The number you're chasing (150 workouts, 24 books, $10,000 saved).\n\nCurrent Progress: Updated weekly with your actual numbers.\n\nCompletion %: A simple formula dividing current by target, if applicable.\n\nWeekly Average Needed: Calculates how much you need to do weekly to hit your annual goal.\n\nStatus: On Track (green), At Risk (yellow), Behind (red)—use conditional formatting.\n\nFor example, if your resolution is \"Read 24 books this year\" and you're in week 15 with 8 books completed, your completion percentage is 33%, you're reading 0.53 books per week, and you need 0.43 books weekly to finish on time. The status would show green because you're ahead of pace.\n\nThis is where consistency lives. For 2026, I start my timeline on Jan. 5, since it's the first Monday of the new year. In a grid with dates across the top, I have daily habits going down the left side. Each habit gets a row where you mark completion with an X, checkmark, or the actual number achieved.\n\nDaily habits should be small and specific: \"10 minutes meditation,\" \"2 liters of water,\" \"no phone before 9am,\" \"practice Spanish for 15 minutes,\" \"write 250 words.\" Don't track more than 5-7 habits here—this is about sustainable daily practices, not overwhelming yourself.\n\nUse color coding: green for completed, red for missed, yellow for partial completion. At the end of each row, you could create columns for weekly streaks, longest streak this year, and completion percentage. These metrics gamify the process and make patterns visible. If you notice you always miss meditation on Wednesdays, you can investigate why and adjust.\n\nEvery Sunday, spend 10 minutes completing this structured reflection:\n\nWins This Week: List 3-5 specific accomplishments, no matter how small. \"Worked out Monday and Thursday\" counts. \"Saved $50 by cooking instead of ordering out\" counts. This section fights the negativity bias that makes us forget progress.\n\nChallenges Faced: What obstacles came up? \"Too tired after work for gym\" or \"Got distracted by social media during writing time.\" Be honest and specific.\n\nPattern Recognition: After a few weeks, you'll notice trends. \"I always skip workouts when I have early meetings—need to switch to evening gym sessions.\" These insights are gold.\n\nAdjustments for Next Week: Based on challenges and patterns, what will you change? Maybe you'll prep gym clothes the night before, or set a social media blocker during writing hours.\n\nEnergy and Motivation Level (1-10): Track your overall state. If you notice motivation plummeting, you can proactively adjust expectations or seek support before completely derailing.\n\nBeyond these three main tabs, I've also included even simpler activity trackers with the drop-down menus and color-coding I personally use to track my travel, books read, and running.\n\nYou can dedicate a column in each tab for jotting down miscellaneous notes, but for the sake of tidiness, make sure not to overfill your boxes with text. It also helps to stay consistent with your formatting—e.g. bolding the header of each metric. I color code at whim. For instance, as a stand-up comedian, I keep track of all my shows with a specific color to mark how I felt about them: Shades of green mean the show went well, and shades of red mean the show...did not go well. In times where it looks like everything in my life is red, it’s nice to be able to shift my gaze to all the green, too. Perspective!\n\nI recommend getting started with just one sheet: a weekly habit tracker for 3-4 habits you genuinely want to build. Commit to tracking honestly for four weeks without judgment. At the end of the month, review your completion rates and patterns. This low-stakes beginning helps you learn the rhythm without overwhelming yourself.\n\nAt the end of the year, you’ll be able to use all that data to visualize both the big and the little things in your life over the 12 months prior. At a glance, you’ll be able to pat yourself on the back for how successfully you cut back on caffeine, or upped your time outdoors, or improved your books-started to books-completed ratio. Ultimately, my own spreadsheet is about appreciating all the little things in my life, even if I do so in one of the nerdiest ways imaginable.",

    "description": "Meta is testing an Instagram TV app, starting with Amazon devices.",
    "fullText": "As I write this, I'm coming off a lunch break that lasted a little too long because I couldn't stop watching YouTube Shorts on my TV. And if Instagram Reels are your own vertical video poison—and you own an Amazon Fire TV device—you can now do the same. Starting today, you can download the new Instagram for TV app to watch Reels on your big screen via a dedicated interface that should be way more natural than simply casting the mobile app from your phone.\n\nCurrently exclusive to Amazon devices, the Instagram for TV app supports up to five accounts and comes with full functionality for searching for Reels and profiles, as well as liking Reels and browsing comments or reactions (although text posts and photo posts are not included). Unlike on the standard mobile feed, Amazon says \"Reels are organized into channels tuned to your interests,\" which you can see from a horizontal home screen.\n\nThese channels are somewhat similar to the YouTube Shorts interface that's baked into the standard YouTube TV app, showing you a small selection of shorts you can choose from based on a thumbnail. Examples include \"For you\" and \"Popular with Friends,\" but you're also still able to swipe past any Reel to your heart's content, and let the algorithm take you for a ride. A post from Meta also says channels could include Reels tailored to a specific topics that match your interests, like \"sports highlights\" or \"hidden travel gems,\" although the company hasn't provided any screenshots or videos showing this off quite yet.\n\nAccording to Meta, the new app is currently \"an early test.\" It's starting with U.S.-based Amazon devices, and the company says it will \"expand to more devices and countries\" as it learns more (Amazon also says it's the \"first\" company to get the app, implying others will get their own versions in the future).\n\nCurrently, the Instagram for TV app is available in the Amazon Appstore for the following devices:\n\nFire TV Stick 4K Max (1st and 2nd Gen)\n\nIn addition to adding channels to the Reels experience, Meta says that future updates may also add ways to use your phone as a remote, share feeds with friends, and explore \"a more intuitive way to channel surf.\"\n\nInstagram for TV leaves TikTok as the last major short form video platform without a dedicated TV app, although The Information reported earlier this Summer that TikTok is looking to catch up soon.\n\nWhile official Instagram for TV support is currently limited to Amazon devices, that doesn't mean you're out of luck if you don't have a Fire TV stick or display. To watch Instagram Reels on your TV without using the Instagram for TV app, open Instagram Reels on your phone and start browsing. Next, pull up your phone's quick settings menu by swiping down from the top-right corner.\n\nOn iOS, search for the screen mirroring button (which looks like two overlapping screens), and on Android, search for a button that says something like \"Cast\" (it will vary depending on your device). Tap it to see any compatible wireless screen mirroring devices nearby, which will let you view the mobile Instagram app on a TV screen, and even send audio over with it. It's not foolproof—my LG OLED TV works with iOS Screen Mirroring but not Pixel casting—but it's worth a shot.",

    "description": "Ben...",
    "fullText": "The late actor and director leaves behind a roster of classic films—and a much safer and juster California.\n\nThe horrific news from Los Angeles Sunday night, that filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Reiner, 70, were found murdered in their Brentwood home and that their own son, Nick, stood charged with their deaths capped a weekend of violent news. A shooter at Brown University killed two and wounded nine. The violence at a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach in Australia left 15 dead and 40 injured. In an ambush in Syria, two American soldiers and a translator were killed by an ISIS terrorist.\n\nAll of it is awful, but in the case of the Reiner murders, America lost a voice that had been part of our pop culture and political conversation since the late 1960s. On our TV and movie screens, Reiner came to represent a friendly face of the American liberal left. Reiner rose to stardom in the 1970s on the blockbuster sitcom All in the Family. It happened alongside that of actors like Alan Alda on M*A*S*H, Bea Arthur on Maude, Esther Rolle on Good Times, and Bonnie Franklin on One Day at a Time—all during a run of topically minded primetime TV programming that amplified liberal politics at a moment unlike any other in our pop culture.\n\nThe son of writer-director-comedian Carl Reiner, he began his career writing on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, a leftish music and sketch comedy program, and appearing on shows like Gomer Pyle, USMC as a flower child. In All in the Family, he played liberal college student Mike Stivic, in near-constant opposition to his father-in-law, blue-collar Queens conservative Archie Bunker (Carroll O’Conner), who usually addressed him as “Meathead.” Stivic lived in his in-laws’ house while he studied at Columbia University, and their wives, Gloria Stivic (Sally Struthers) and Edith Bunker (Jean Stapleton), were often caught in the middle between their bickering and staunchly ideological husbands, and often unwittingly shut Archie down. That combustible, close-quarters family setting created some of the best confrontational political satire ever put on television. Stivic almost always had the moral and ideological upper hand when it came to his arguments with Archie, but Reiner always played him with just enough hectoring pomposity and smug overconfidence to help us understand why Archie found him so insufferable. Half a century later, Reiner could still be found arguing daily on social media with another loudmouth oaf from Queens, President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump gloated over Reiner’s murder, the way he did about Stephen Colbert’s show getting canceled and Jimmy Kimmel’s getting suspended—as if Reiner’s murder were another media victory for him. Trump said the murders were “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS. He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump…” Trump’s glee—which inadvertently seemed to justify the rage of his own MAGA devotees spurred on to lethal political violence—only gave more credence to Reiner’s frequent claim that Trump is “mentally unfit to be president.” Asked to clarify—or perhaps temper—his callous and narcissistic outburst at an Oval Office press conference, Trump instead doubled down on it.\n\nDespite his liberal politics, Reiner remains so beloved that even Republicans challenged Trump’s pathetic attack. “This is wrong,” New York Republican Representative Mike Lawler replied to Trump on X.com. “Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.” Prominent Trump critics on the right like Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie and Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who have no MAGA cred to lose anymore, also chastised the president.\n\nWhen Reiner turned his focus to directing, he released a stellar run of films, beginning in 1984 with This is Spinal Tap. His films covered a wide array of genres and subjects, but several stand as classics: Stand By Me (1986) The Princess Bride (1987), When Harry Met Sally… (1989), and A Few Good Men (1992). From there, he helmed a string of political dramas like Ghosts of Mississippi (1996) and LBJ (2016). In 2015, Reiner and his son Nick also made a semi-autobiographical movie, Being Charlie, about a father and son’s turbulent relationship and the son’s addiction issues.\n\nReiner had no signature visual style. He was not an “auteur” in the heavy-handed sense—a director advertising that what you are watching is being directed at all times. He belongs more in a category of filmmakers focused on the emotional themes shaping their films—conveyed in plot and characters—more than the style of the storytelling itself. His best work belongs alongside films directed by Robert Redford, Mike Nichols, and studio-era directors like George Stevens, William Wyler, and Fred Zinneman. Reiner had a perfect sense of the dramatic core of a scene and a perfect eye for casting. It’s why, even though he did not write most of the films he made, you will never forget lines like “These go to 11” or “I’ll have what she’s having” and “You can’t handle the truth!” or Wallace Shawn’s “Inconceivable!”\n\nPerhaps most important for residents of California, Reiner never lost sight of his true sense of activism. He played the comical flower child and liberal know-it-all on sitcoms or the boorish Marxist Sheldon Flenner in Woody Allen’s 1994 film Bullets Over Broadway, but became incredibly effective, along with wife Michele, as a fundraiser and organizer in state politics. In 1998, he co-organized a campaign to pass California Proposition 10, the California Children and Families Initiative. It put a 50¢ tax on cigarettes and tobacco products to fund First 5 California, a series of health programs for children in the preschool age range. He spent eight years as its chair, and his success lead to a lot of talk about his running for public office.\n\nReiner chose not to do it, and arguably remained more effective in his role as an activist with an outsize pop-culture platform. He and Michele later cofounded the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which successfully challenged California’s Proposition 8—a voter initiative that banned same-sex marriage. She was the group’s treasurer. Vital to its success was recruiting conservatives like George W. Bush’s solicitor general to the Supreme Court, Theordore B. Olsen, and former RNC chair Ken Mehlman. As strident as Reiner could be on social media, he understood the importance of bipartisan activism. They got Proposition 8 overturned in 2013.\n\nReiner used his influence and fortune in the entertainment industry to sound strategic effect as a political organizer. He was born into privilege, and all charges of nepo-babyism certainly apply—both All in the Family and This Is Spinal Tap were backed by his father’s friend Norman Lear. Reiner took all that he had been given as both a personal and civic challenge—a platform with which he paid back all those breaks. Just as important, he knew what to do with the influence it bestowed. That is both his legacy as an artist and as a key figure in making the state of California a far better place to live for millions of its citizens. These achievements speak far more powerfully to us—and even, it seems, to a growing cohort of GOP legislators—than the petty, vindictive, self-serving politics of Donald Trump.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

    "description": "Sasha...",
    "fullText": "Every day, Trump is saying and doing things that would get most elementary school children suspended.\n\nFirst off, let me say that today, I mourn. I mourn for the death of Rob and Michele Reiner, for the unfathomable tragedy of a mentally troubled young man killing both of his parents in cold blood. I mourn because in ways both big and small, Rob Reiner made the world a better place. I mourn because there are few people on earth whose work made me belly laugh even when I was feeling down—and because now every time I watch an episode of All in the Family, or catch another screening of The Princess Bride, or When Harry Met Sally…, or Spinal Tap, I will know the infinite cruelty of the ending.\n\nI mourn, too, for the beyond-gross way in which Donald Trump, the public face of America, responded to this awful event—and for what it says about where this country is right now.\n\nIf you are the president of the United States, it’s really not very hard to say the right thing in response to such a tragedy. Even if you didn’t personally like the victims, you can say something generic about how you send condolences to the family, how your thoughts and prayers are with the victims, how you hope that in this moment we can put politics aside and grieve as a nation for the loss of a cultural icon.\n\nAnd yet, in his malignant senescence, Trump flubbed it. Astoundingly, he took to Truth Social to post that Reiner’s murder was “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS. He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights.… May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\n\nWhen, hours later, journalists gave Trump a chance to walk back this ghastly statement, he doubled down. “Well, I wasn’t a fan of his at all. He was a deranged person. I thought he was very bad for our country,” he sneered.\n\nI have written literally hundreds of columns over the years on Trump, and in many of those I have explored how his language, his tone, is overtly fascist. In his dehumanization of his political opponents, even after their murders, we are, indeed, seeing the quintessential fascist bloodlust in play. But, really, this is more akin to the mad Roman emperor Caligula; this is the language of a man fed equal parts lead and mother’s milk as an infant and then told by every be-toga’ed body of sycophantic elites that he is a deity whose every mad impulse is actually part of a divine plan.\n\nSeriously, though, we are now witnessing a full-flowering malignancy on the American body politic. Every day, Trump is saying and doing things—attacking journalists, calling entire races of humans “garbage,” signing off on a national security strategy that urges America to help far-right nationalist parties seize power in Europe, demanding that commentators who write things he doesn’t like be tried for treason, mocking the murder of a political opponent—that would get most elementary school children first suspended and then, if they didn’t make a good-faith effort to shape up, expelled.\n\nI can almost see the letter from the principal to Donald’s disappointed parents:\n\nDear Mr. and Mrs Trump,\n\nIt is with great reluctance that my colleagues and I have come to the conclusion that your son is no longer a good fit for our school. We are deeply concerned that he is demonstrating profoundly antisocial tendencies, and while we have repeatedly urged your family to seek professional help for your son, it appears that our suggestions have gone unheeded. The situation has, unfortunately, now reached a breaking point.\n\nAs you know, when Donald began insulting girls out on the schoolyard by calling them “piggy,” “stupid,” and “ugly,” we explained to him that this was not how a little boy is supposed to talk to other people. He responded sullenly and seemed particularly angered by the fact that it was one of his female teachers who tried to impart some manners.\n\nNot long afterward, your son began lashing out at students of Somali-American heritage, going so far as to call all members of that group “garbage” and demanding that they leave the school and return to the “shit hole” country that their ancestors left. We hope you will agree that this is simply shocking language, and that a child of Donald’s age should know better than to talk about other human beings in this disparaging way. He has, after all, been at school for six years by now, more than enough time to learn that talking like this is unacceptable.\n\nOur dismay at Donald’s crude language has, however, recently morphed into a more active concern for the safety of his fellow pupils and our staff. When the school counselor tried to suggest that he might benefit from some anger management counseling, Donald lashed out in an objectively intimidating manner. In a long, meandering social media post—apparently written in the middle of the night—that was flagged and referred to local law enforcement, he declared that anyone who dared to question his emotional or physical well-being ought to be tried for sedition and treason; he also let it be known that in the olden days the penalty for such crimes was death.\n\nThat was followed up by what can only be described as a poisonous response to a homework assignment asking how America should interact with its closest political allies. Donald’s 29-page answer was, we are sorry to say, one of the most racist texts we have ever read from a child of his age. Donald urged America to ally with fascist parties throughout Europe to “save Western civilization from erasure,” declared that America’s enormous military might should now be turned against immigrants, and sided with extremist Christian nationalists who do not respect the separation of church and state that is a fundamental part of the United States’s identity. Worried about what sorts of materials Donald was reading online, we referred the text to our district headquarters; the district replied that it was deeply alarmed that Donald was accessing extremist websites and pointed out numerous sentences that could have been lifted whole-cloth from Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik’s “manifesto,” penned shortly before he killed 77 teenagers at a political summer camp.\n\nThe last straw, however, was your son’s extraordinarily callous response to the recent murder of cultural icon Rob Reiner. Three months ago, when the far-right activist Charlie Kirk was gunned down, Donald’s classmate little Stevie Miller made a fiery speech quite literally calling down the wrath of God on anyone who didn’t mourn the killing vociferously enough. Stevie and Donald joined together to attack other students who they deemed insufficiently upset by the murder, even demanding that some of the teachers in this school be fired. We didn’t like how Stevie and Donald acted, but we understood their impulse: someone had been killed, and they wanted everyone to say that that was a bad thing.\n\nToday, however, when news broke that Rob Reiner had been stabbed to death, many students, who can quote large parts of The Princess Bride from memory, were heartbroken. We expected Donald to show the same concern about Reiner’s murder that he had shown for Charlie Kirk. Instead, we discovered to our horror that he had gone onto his Truth Social account immediately after he heard the news and penned a vicious screed mocking the killing and saying it had been caused by Reiner’s dislike of Donald. In fact, in a stunningly narcissistic display, your son announced to the world that Reiner had been killed because his “TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME” had driven others to anger. This was both bizarrely illogical and also deeply offensive to many members of our community.\n\nWe trust you will agree with us that these are entirely inappropriate behaviors from an 11-year-old boy and, taken as a whole, warrant our decision to expel your son from the school. Like any other community, we believe that our school has to be a safe space for its students, and we no longer have confidence in our ability to provide that safe space if your son continues to attend this institution.\n\nWe urge you both to seek whatever services you can to help your son. Our concern is that unless his behavior—which our school psychologist has warned verges on the sociopathic—is checked now he will, as he reaches maturity, almost certainly run afoul of the law.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Trump’s behavior would, indeed, get him expelled from an elementary school. And, I suspect, if my readers—of all political persuasions—were honest with themselves, they would come to the same conclusions. Yet, today, armed with his vicious tongue and his online troll’s persona, he is the most powerful man on earth, his finger on the nuclear trigger, his cabinet meetings obscene, sycophantic displays. Will any of Trump’s cabinet resign in disgust at his vicious remarks about Rob Reiner? Don’t hold your breath. Will any of them seek to invoke the 25th Amendment? Not in a million years.\n\nAnd so, America’s Caligula will continue his mad reign. And all of us will continue to be debased by his grotesqueries.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F.

    "description": "Whatever the Jaguars have needed, Cole Van Lanen has delivered. He might just be the team’s future at left tackle.",
    "fullText": "When most teams lose their starting offensive tackle, chaos ensues. Who replaces him? How much help do you provide? Does the play calling have to change to help alleviate pressure?\n\nJust ask the Los Angeles Chargers who have lost both starting offensive tackles and are struggling mightily in pass-protection. Luckily, Jim Harbaugh has Justin Herbert at quarterback.\n\nDespite losing Anton Harrison for parts of the season and most recently Walker Little, Cole Van Lanen has stepped in and performed admirably.\n\nWhatever the Jaguars have needed, Van Lanen has delivered. He’s the only player in the NFL to play four positions across the offensive line, playing 46 or more snaps at every spot aside from center.\n\nNot only is he playing anything and everything for the Jaguars, he’s doing so at a pretty high level. While the metrics aren’t really there to measure run-blocking, we can take a look at pass-protection data provided by Pro Football Focus.\n\nOn 437 pass-block snaps, Van Lanen has allowed 11 pressures and one sack. Don’t worry, I’ll do the math for you. That’s good for a 4.91% pressure rate and a 0.45% sack rate. Among the top-80 offensive tackles, those figures rank 26th and 21st respectively. That’s insane production from the Jaguars’ sixth offensive lineman and a guy who has played four positions.\n\nWhen looking at left tackle specifically, he’s performing even better. Van Lanen has a total of 77 pass-block snaps at the blindside, allowing just one pressure and zero sacks. What more can you really ask for?\n\nFor some additional context, let’s compare him to the Jags’ other tackles, Anton Harrison and Walker Little. Harrison’s 5.42% pressure rate and 0.21% sack rate rank 32nd and 12th, while Little’s 8.26% pressure rate and 1.91% sack rate rank just 69th and 77th.\n\nThose numbers are pretty hard to look at for Little. But to be fair, much of his pressures and sacks allowed came in just a few games. At the same time, those tough games are when you need your blindside protector to perform at his best. Seven of his nine sacks allowed on the season came in a four-game span from weeks 6-10. Four sacks alone came against the Seahawks.\n\nIt should be noted that Little has ranked among the NFL’s top-20 tackles in run-block win % via ESPN analytics for much of the season, however, he recently fell just outside. His run-blocking, in addition to his next door neighbor Ezra Cleveland, have been huge for the Jags’ ground game this season.\n\nPass-protection has noticeably improved the last two weeks with Van Lanen at left tackle as the unit has allowed just two hits and zero sacks, however, keep an eye on the rushing attack.\n\nJaguars’ running backs are averaging just 3.3 yards per carry the last two weeks, despite significant early leads and advantageous rushing situations.\n\nRegardless, the Jaguars should have zero complaints about the play of Cole Van Lanen. He’s been a quiet hero for this team and an offense that has seven straight games of 25 or more points. Whatever the Jaguars need, Van Lanen is ready to deliver and do so admirably. He might just be the team’s future at left tackle.\n\n>>> STREAM ACTION SPORTS JAX 24/7 LIVE <<<\n\n[DOWNLOAD: Free Action News Jax app for alerts as news breaks]\n\n[SIGN UP: Action News Jax Daily Headlines Newsletter]",

    "fullText": "Will Drake London return in Week 16? Latest injury update on Atlanta Falcons WR originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons haven't had wide receiver Drake London on the field for four straight games now.\n\nLondon suffered a PCL strain in Week 11 and hasn't played or practiced since then. The Falcons have been in no rush to get him back, either, as the team is out of playoff contention.\n\nAs we turn the page to Week 16, here's what we know about London's chances of returning to the field for the Falcons on Sunday.\n\nWhen asked about London's status for Week 16, Falcons head coach Raheem Morris said he's \"very hopeful\" his top wide receiver will return.\n\n“Obviously, got to get to the practice week. I’m very hopeful he can go out there and play for us,\" Morris said, per The Athletic's Josh Kendall.\n\nWe would say London has a better chance to return than not given the fact that he was not placed on injured reserve, which means the Falcons didn't expect him to miss more than three games.\n\nOf course, London has now missed four in a row, but we also have to remember that the Falcons had a short week in Week 15, so that could've played a role in London's absence and maybe he would have been available on a normal week.\n\nLondon has also been day-to-day for multiple weeks now, so he appears to be very close to a return, although his lack of participation in practice last week was not a great sign for him.\n\nThe Falcons do have a decision to make in terms of whether or not to even bring London back. After all, the Falcons are out of playoff contention and might opt to avoid risking London getting hurt again and potentially impacting next season.\n\nThat said, Morris might be fighting for his job over the final three weeks of the season, so it stands to reason he'll want his best player out there.\n\nWe'll get our next update on London on Wednesday, when the Falcons release their first injury report of the week. Even a limited practice would be a good sign for London's chances of suiting up.\n\nWhat Patrick Mahomes tearing 2 ligaments means for recovery timeline\n\nMike McDaniel gives bizarre answer for lack of late-game urgency\n\nMatt Prater injury update leaves Bills in precarious spot at kicker\n\nMicah Parsons' dad weighs in on Packers superstar's return timeline\n\nJaguars offense in midst of streak not seen in NFL this season",

McDavid has cashed the Over in points in five of his last six appearances, putting up 3+ in three of those outings.\n\nWhile McDavid only had one point last time out against the Montreal Canadiens, he scored twice and had a helper the night before against the Toronto Maple Leafs. He’ll face the Pittsburgh Penguins tonight, and McDavid compiled three assists in two meetings with them in 2024-25.\n\nNathan MacKinnon is leading the NHL in numerous categories, and he’s emerged as the early frontrunner to win the Hart Trophy. He’s top dog in goals, netting 26 already, while also sitting first in points with 55. The Avs star is doing it all offensively.\n\nMacKinnon has four goals in his last five appearances, and he’s scored in back-to-back games. Overall, he already has six goals in December to go along with five helpers. Colorado is visiting the Seattle Kraken tonight, and the veteran has 12 goals in 17 road outings.\n\nWe’ll stick with the Avalanche for my last pick. Martin Necas has been a wonderful addition to this roster after being acquired from the Carolina Hurricanes last season. The 26-year-old has scored 11 goals and provided 17 assists in the 2025-26 season.\n\nNecas has been setting up goals left, right, and center this month, already tallying nine helpers in December, cashing the Over in five of his last six outings. Saturday, he failed to register a helper, but he had four assists between the two games before that.\n\nNecas has 13 helpers in 16 road contests this season, and he put up two assists in two matchups with the Kraken last season.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "PDC World Darts Championship: Glen Durrant - Price can rival the two Lukes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nYou might be forgiven for thinking all the conversation in the run up the PDC World Championship has been about the two Lukes: Littler and Humphries and to a large extent you would be correct. There are other names that some fancy to test the most recent two World Champions.\n\nWhen Darts World talked to Glen Durrant, three-time Lakeside (WDF) champion and winner of the PDC's Premier League, he agreed that at least one other player should be in the mix:\n\nLet's talk about Gerwyn Price - can he keep up with the two Lukes and compete?\n\nHe can absolutely still cut it at the top of the sport. His A game is as good as any player in the world right now. He’s super fit, so fatigue isn’t coming into it. I’d like to see him be 3-0 down in a match and come back to win it 4-3.\n\nIt’s almost like he needs that great match early doors to get his belief back. He had that at the World Matchplay where he seemed to be 5-0 down after the first break, but it’s part of his game now, to know he can come back from the jaws of defeat. The only thing I think Gerwyn Price needs is to show that resilience. He needs to show that grit. But right now, he can be as good as anybody when he is at the top of his game.\n\nTHE PDC WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN FACTS AND FIGURES: Arm yourself on dartsdatabase.co.uk\n\nIs his 11 world ranking representative of how good he is or do you think he should be higher than that?\n\nHe’s at No. 3 in the world in my eyes. I think the two Lukes are just a little bit ahead of him. There are some great players around at the moment. Stephen Bunting looks like he’s just searching for that little bit extra at the moment. James Wade has had an unbelievable season so far. If I had to give you my top 10 right now, Price would definitely be at three.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS! Gerwyn Price wins PDC World Darts Championship\n\nPrice v Littler. If it were to happen, if those guys were to meet in the quarterfinals, would that be one of the best quarterfinals of all time?\n\nI’ve done the draw, done the little league table, the fantasy of how it plays out. I’ve got it down that they will meet in the quarter-finals, that seems like a match-up we can anticipate.\n\nThere have been some epic games at Alexandra Palace. Sometimes as a commentator you get to watch some mouthwatering ties, and I think that this is a tie that would excite the players, but the crowd would love it too. It’s what we want.\n\nI think it’ll happen, I think they are the two standout players in that section, and I think it’s going to be an absolute belter.\n\nGLEN DURRANT WINS PREMIER LEAGUE: Watch Duzza's 2020 Moment of triumph\n\nAs a former player turned pundit Glen also look for value in the betting market and was talking via 10Bet . Does he see one of those fairytale runs that Ally Pally is famous for happening this year:\n\nBack to the PDC World Championships. Who could rattle a few cages?\n\n“I don't really think it's been the year of the underdog with the domination of the two Lukes. I've struggled to get value for people. You know, I'll give you a couple of names here:\n\n“ I think Martin Schindler can go on and run this year. I think Jermaine Wattamina is in the form of his life. I think there's a couple of young players too who could do well like Van Veen and Manby. I'm a big fan of the North American scene. Adam Savada, etc... . But I don't see them going deep because the elite players just look so good.\n\n“Also, I don't see, for example, a Scott Williams reaching the semi-final like a couple of years ago. I think the cream will rise to the top.\n\n\" So looking up and down the draw, I mean, as we said, you think the top eight could potentially be your quarter-final, and there's every reason why we can say that.\n\n“ Everyone's writing off Rob Cross… at 175 to 1. Rob Cross is not a 175 to 1 shot. I hope he finds his form there.\n\n“It's intriguing. It's exciting. It's going to be the place to be. It's what everyone's going to be watching. And if seeds go, then great. But I'd be surprised if we don't see one of those real top elite players picking up that million quid.”\n\nGet \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "fullText": "One former scout says that it’s inevitable that one Chelsea player will depart the club very soon, as things heat up for January.\n\nLeeds United are among a number of Premier League clubs weighing up a move to sign Raheem Sterling.\n\nSterling could join other players such as Tyrique George and Axel Disasi, who are also not really in the plans at Chelsea now or in the near future, in departing the club in the January window. Surely none of them will want to wait until the summer window and miss a whole season of basically not playing any first team football?\n\nWe don’t expect much more to be happening at Chelsea in the January window, however, we will of course always be hearing about yet another teenager that Chelsea are interested in signing and interestingly, there was one today that came out.\n\nAnd there also appears to be a lot of noise about Chelsea’s interest in Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who will surely depart his club in the January window due to not playing hardly at all right now.\n\nRaheem Sterling in action for Arsenal. (Photo by Jan Kruger/Getty Images)\n\naccording to former Man United and Blackburn chief scout Mick Brown, who remains very well-connected within the game, Leeds are keen on Sterling.\n\n“It’s inevitable Sterling will leave Chelsea,” he told Football Insider.\n\n“When was the last time he played for Chelsea? He hasn’t been involved at all this season and he’s not a part of the manager’s plans there.\n\n“So there’s no reason for him to stick around, he needs to get out and start playing again.\n\n“I understand Leeds and other Premier League teams are looking at potentially taking him.\n\n“They’re in need of attacking players, and at his best he would be an improvement on what they’ve got, it’s just a question of whether he is at his best these days.\n\n“He went on loan to Arsenal last season and really struggled, barely played, and the amount of playing time he’s had over the last year is a major concern.\n\n“If his legs have gone and it’s something were he’s declined physically, then he will struggle wherever he goes, and I hope that isn’t the case.\n\n“But the clubs will know, they’ll assess what his issues have been, and then decide whether to take the gamble on him because he’s still regarded very highly.”",

Boston probably needs to trade away either Jarren Duran or Wilyer Abreu from its outfield logjam, likely for pitching.

    "fullText": "Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo revealed that he has received three citizenship offers since his success in Paris in 2024, with Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Tunisia putting “offers on the table”.\n\nTebogo won Botswana’s first ever medal at the Olympics with his 200m triumph, and later secured a silver medal in the 4x400m relay in Paris. He was subsequently rewarded with a newly built three-bedroom house by his country’s government, with the relay squad – himself included – all given two-bedroom flats.\n\nHowever, the 22-year-old claimed that Qatar, the UAE and Tunisia had tried to buy his citizenship, and he suggested that he had considered a change, with each country likely able to promise far more if he continues his success.\n\n“I’ve got three offers on the table, from Qatar, Abu Dhabi [UAE] and Tunisia,” the sprinter told Duma FM, a radio station based in his home country.\n\n“Those are the three offers that are there on the table, and we are still trying to see. We told them what we are worth, and they are promising to up their game, so that’s how it is,” he added.\n\nWhen pressed on whether he is going to consider the change, Tebogo replied: “It’s something on the table. [They said] ‘on a yearly basis, this is how much we can give you’. The offers came, but they were all rejected.”\n\nThe Olympic champion, who also won gold in the 4x400m at the World Championships this year, was quick to highlight that he would be required to take a break from the sport if he were to change nationality, suggesting that that might not be right for him at this stage in his career.\n\n”We had to be considerate, being out of the sport for I think four years, before you can migrate into the other country. So, for now there is no offer on the table,” added the 22-year-old.\n\nUnder current regulations, athletes must wait three years after their last competition for the original country before they can compete for another nation, except for in cases with exceptional circumstances. Earlier this year, Nigerian sprinter Favour Ofili confirmed a nationality switch from Nigeria to Turkiye citing “negligence” from the Nigerian Athletics Federation and Olympic Committee.",

    "fullText": "Scottish middle-distance runner Josh Kerr is among the biggest creditors owed by Grand Slam Track after the league filed for bankruptcy last week, with the Briton owed $218,750.\n\nDocuments filed to the bankruptcy court in Delaware on Monday included a list of the 20 creditors with the largest unsecured claims, with Kerr and six other athletics stars collectively owed millions by GST.\n\nAmerican sprint star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone is owed $356,250, with compatriots Gabby Thomas – the Olympic 200m champion – and Melissa Jefferson-Wooden – who won gold in the 100m and 200m at this year’s World Championships – still owed $249,375 and $190,625 respectively. Each athlete won individual events as well as one or more of the Slams, with Kerr having won the Miami Slam and the 1500m race in Miami, with a total prize of $150,000 across those two meets alone.\n\nOne broadcast company is owed over $3m, with the total amount owed to the top 20 creditors nearing $10m. The documents show that there are between 200 and 999 creditors, with the total amount owed between $10m and $50m.\n\nGST, which was founded and launched by multiple Olympic champion Michael Johnson in 2024, filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a US court last week following months of financial issues.\n\nThe league’s first event had taken place in Kingston, Jamaica in April of this year, though a major financial backer withdrew its support after the event, with attendance having been poor.\n\nSubsequent meets took place in Miami and Philadelphia, with the latter cut from three days to two, but the final event of the season, which was scheduled for Los Angeles in June, was cancelled.\n\nJohnson later admitted that GST could not afford to pay its athletes, despite the league having promised up to $12.6m in prize money.\n\nThe Chapter 11 filing gives GST the chance to reorganise and “stabilise its finances” rather than go through liquidation, with a statement from GST explaining that the league also wants to use the process to “ implement a more efficient cost and operating model, and position GST for long-term success”.",

    "description": "Ime Udoka was not a fan of the way the officials called Monday's game vs. the Nuggets.",
    "fullText": "Houston Rockets coach Ime Udoka lost a game Monday, and it's going to cost him a fair amount of money Tuesday. Udoka will almost surely be fined by the NBA after he went off on the officials following an overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets, calling the contest the \"most poorly officiated game I've seen in a long time.\"\n\nThat wasn't all Udoka had to say. While he didn't name the members of the officiating crew, he took aim at each person on the team, adding, \"Two have no business being out there and the crew chief was acting star struck.\"\n\nIme Udoka with his thoughts on the #Rockets OT loss to the Nuggets\n\nIt's a must listen.@HoustonRockets play Denver again on Saturday pic.twitter.com/jzY0qff5mV\n\n— Space City Home Network (@SpaceCityHN) December 16, 2025\n\nIt was a chippy game, as officials issued a number of technical fouls during the 128-125 Rockets loss. Udoka was the recipient of one of those techs after arguing for a foul call in the second quarter.\n\nUdoka also took issue with a tripping call that allowed Denver to tie the game up with just seconds to go in the fourth quarter. Udoka challenged the call, which was upheld. The play allowed Jamal Murray to hit a game-tying free throw, sending the contest into overtime.\n\nWhile foul distribution was even between both teams — with the Nuggets actually having more fouls called against them — Udoka was not happy with the way officials treated Nikola Jokic and Murray, both of who turned in big performances against the Rockets. Jokic led the Nuggets with 39 points. Murray wasn't far behind, adding 35.\n\nA big chunk of Murray's points came via free throws. Murray hit on 14 of 15 attempts, which Udoka called out after the contest. The Nuggets had 33 total free-throw attempts in the close win. Houston had 26 free throws. While that's not a huge disparity, the figure stands out more in a tight game that went to overtime.\n\nThe loss drops the Rockets to 16-7 on the season. After a breakout season last year, Houston is out to another strong start. The team's decision to trade for superstar Kevin Durant has paid off, as he leads the team with 24.8 points per game.\n\nThe Rockets will be fine following the loss, though Udoka's wallet will be lighter. The NBA typically takes action when coaches criticize officials, and Udoka took his comments further than most. He should expect to receive a hefty fine before the team plays its next game Thursday.",

Queues snaking around here and there. People don't know where to queue. Not enough stewards using the scanners to make it faster. Those with bags taking an age to check. Main Stand turnstiles today were a mare!\"\n\nFan Peter Connolly wrote: \"I was 10 minutes late getting to the ground but got in 30 minutes later than usual at turnstile T and didn't get to my seat until four minutes had gone.\"\n\nNeil Atkinson of The Anfield Wrap, posted on 3 December before Liverpool faced Sunderland: \"Queues ridiculous outside the ground again.\"\n\nFan Paul Senior, who also contributes to The Anfield Wrap, posted: \"The only time I feel unsafe at Anfield is in them queues. They're there to prevent a terror incident and you're congregating hundreds/thousands of people outside. Backwards.\"\n\nThe added measures have not been put in place because of any individual incident and Liverpool say that they align with security approaches at other major events.\n\nOn emails to ticket holders, the club has asked fans to arrive 10 minutes earlier than usual. More resources have also been allocated at turnstiles.\n\nIn November, the club explained the changes to fans, stating: \"Fans are advised to arrive early at Anfield, with turnstiles opening two hours before kick-off for general admission and three hours before for hospitality, allowing enough time for the necessary checks before entry.\n\n\"More resources have been allocated at turnstiles to ensure this important safety and security update will have minimal impact on fans' overall match experience.\"\n\nGiven the complaints, the process is still unsettling some fans and remains relatively new for stewards and staff to oversee.\n\nBBC Sport have approached Liverpool FC to see if the club are looking into ways of making the process more efficient.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nAsk Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.\n\nWe want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.\n\nThe team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.\n\nWe will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.\n\nOur coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.\n\nWhy Newcastle and Sunderland don't have away fans pitchside\n\nWhy have managers stopped wearing suits?\n\nWhen is the Carabao Cup semi-final draw?\n\nAll you need to know about Sports Personality of the Year 2025",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain have been ordered by a Paris labour court to pay Kylian Mbappe €60 million in unpaid salary and bonuses, bringing an end to a prolonged legal dispute between the club and their former forward.\n\nThe ruling, delivered earlier today, follows months of proceedings after Mbappe claimed PSG withheld wages and contractual bonuses in the final months of his deal before his free transfer to Real Madrid in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe France captain argued that payments for April, May and June of that year were never made, despite being stipulated in his contract.\n\nJudges ruled in Mbappe’s favour, concluding that PSG failed to pay three months of salary as well as an ethics bonus and a signing bonus.\n\nThe court noted that these outstanding sums had already been recognised by the French Professional Football League in decisions taken in September and October last year, strengthening the player’s case.\n\nPSG attempted to argue that Mbappe had agreed to forgo the payments as part of an informal arrangement linked to his reintegration into the squad during the 2023-24 season.\n\nHowever, the court stated that the club was unable to provide any written agreement proving that the player had waived his contractual rights, leading to that defence being dismissed.\n\nMbappe’s lawyer, Frederique Cassereau, welcomed the ruling and described it as a predictable outcome under French labour law. She said the decision simply reflected the fact that salaries and bonuses written into a contract must be paid in full.\n\nWhile Mbappe succeeded in securing the €60m award, the court rejected several additional claims made on his behalf.\n\nAllegations of moral harassment, concealed work and breaches of the employer’s duty of care were all dismissed, and the court declined to reclassify his fixed-term contract as a permanent one, which limited the scope for further compensation.\n\nPSG had also accused Mbappe of acting disloyally by concealing his intention not to renew his contract, arguing that this deprived the club of the chance to secure a significant transfer fee.\n\nThe judges ruled that such considerations were not relevant to the core issue of unpaid remuneration and therefore had no bearing on the outcome.\n\nMbappe spent seven years at PSG after initially joining from Monaco in 2017, winning six Ligue 1 titles and 15 major trophies. He left as the club’s all-time leading scorer with 256 goals in 308 appearances.\n\nThe verdict closes a contentious chapter in the relationship between PSG and their former talisman and confirms the club’s obligation to settle the outstanding payments in full.",

    "description": "WORLD CUP 2026: Comment: Fifa’s extortionate prices have led to accusations of ‘betrayal’ and Miguel Delaney argues that The FA must flex its power now to save fans and potentially enhance England’s chances on the pitch",
    "fullText": "The Fifa leadership travel to Doha on Monday, for a series of meetings around “The Best” awards, where certain sources are anticipating at least some tension. And not over who wins.\n\nA number of national associations remain aggravated by the astronomical World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and want to directly raise it. The Football Association says it will relay fan concerns to Fifa, but the Football Supporters’ Association expects more. They expect the FA to actually push on this, and display proper support.\n\nIf it doesn’t, there will be uproar and potential escalation of the latest controversy surrounding Fifa and the World Cup.\n\nThe story should already be bringing much more scrutiny on the conduct of the FA – and other major federations – in football’s power structure.\n\nSources within such federations generally insist that they must maintain a diplomatic stance when dealing with the top brass of Fifa and Uefa, due to the risk of political ostracisation, given that both federations are top-down executive president models with little scope for dissent.\n\nSo, they generally say very little that is challenging, as they attempt to keep some influence.\n\nExcept, what is the point of any of that if you say nothing and have absolutely no influence when it matters most?\n\nThe FA’s first obligation, after all, is to the football public of England. To its constituents.\n\nYou may as well be politically ostracised if you can’t serve them in something like this.\n\nAnd what is going to happen anyway? It’s not like Fifa or Uefa are going to cut off Forward or HatTrick funding.\n\nBoth federations absolutely love Wembley, knowing how much more lucrative it is than any other European stadium. That means little to no risk of losing major fixtures.\n\nFA lobbyists may point to the bid for the Fifa Women’s World Cup 2035, but there’s no competition there.\n\nAnd, in any case, do they really have a mandate to secure a tournament at any cost – like that to their fans?\n\nThe refusal to publicly speak on this would be utterly spineless.\n\nSuch an approach is all the more surprising right now, given that there is constant tension between football’s various stakeholders – from the Premier League to European Football Clubs (the new name for the European Club Association) – and you need sharp elbows to secure your space in the calendar. You need a sense of fight.\n\nMany of those same stakeholders often declare themselves shocked at the meekness of the major federations, from the FA to the associations of France, Germany and Spain. There’s a feeling that they absolutely waste their potential power, and that they should be moral guardians of the game.\n\nInstead, various sources describe them as “the most complicit in the preservation of football’s system” due to the refusal to flex their greater muscle and, worse, “patsies”.\n\nFifa and Uefa have allowed the game to be taken over by greater power, with virtually no challenge. And this has far greater future risks.\n\nThe great frustration with this ticket crisis – even though you could have said this about any of Fifa’s controversies over the last few weeks – is that a potential outlet for dissent is so obvious and powerful.\n\nIf the 10-15 wealthiest federations coordinated action, or even put out a joint statement, it would “rattle” Fifa president Gianni Infantino on this, according to insiders. It would be dissent he is not used to.\n\nSo simple, so potentially effective in this controversy.\n\nIf Fifa still doesn’t budge on prices, and a position in this patronage system is apparently so valuable to the federations, there is another option.\n\nThe national associations can use the ample money they receive from Fifa and Uefa to subsidise the tickets of regular match-going fans.\n\nMany of the latter are already talking of having to make very hard decisions on whether to attend next summer’s tournament. It could be reasonably argued that full support is all the more valuable, given that this looks like England’s best chance of winning a World Cup in decades.\n\nBut, really, there is something deeper here.\n\nThere is a moral and political argument.\n\nThe member associations, most of all the FA, should do much more for their constituents. As was reported on these pages on Saturday, FA chair Debbie Hewitt is ideally placed as Fifa chair.\n\n“I’m not known for being a silent observer,” she said on taking that role.\n\nThere’s never been a more important moment to prove that.",

    "description": "ReScript 12 introduces a completely new build system that brings intelligent dependency tracking, faster incremental builds, and proper monorepo support.",
    "fullText": "ReScript 12 introduces a completely new build system that brings intelligent dependency tracking, faster incremental builds, and proper monorepo support.\n\nReScript 12 comes with a completely new build system. Internally, we call it Rewatch, though you will not need to invoke it by name (it is now the default when you run rescript build). If you have been working with ReScript for a while, you will know the previous build system (internally called bsb) as a reliable workhorse. As projects grew larger and monorepos became more common, however, its limitations became increasingly apparent.\n\nThe new system addresses these limitations directly. It brings smarter compilation, significantly faster incremental builds, and proper support for modern development workflows.\n\nThe previous build system worked well for single-package projects, providing efficient incremental builds and avoiding unnecessary recompilations when module interfaces didn't change. For many projects, it was perfectly adequate.\n\nHowever, as the ReScript ecosystem matured and teams began adopting monorepo structures with multiple interdependent packages, specific limitations became apparent.\n\nThe most significant pain point was watch mode. While bsb could build monorepos, its watch mode only tracked files within the current package. If you had Package A depending on Package B, changes to Package B would not trigger rebuilds in Package A's watch mode. Developers had to manually rebuild or run separate watchers for each package.\n\nYou can see this issue discussed in detail here.\n\nWhen building multiple packages, bsb processed them sequentially rather than in parallel. In a monorepo with five packages, they would build one after another, even when some could build simultaneously. This meant unused parallelization opportunities.\n\nEach package ran in its own Ninja process with no shared understanding across the monorepo. This meant no cross-package optimization opportunities and multiplied process startup overhead.\n\nTo understand why the new build system represents such a significant improvement, it helps to understand what the old build system actually was.\n\nThe previous build system was a wrapper around Ninja, a generic build system originally created by Google for building Chrome. It would scan your ReScript source files, generate a build.ninja file describing all compilation rules, and Ninja would execute the builds in parallel.\n\nThis architecture served ReScript well for years, providing solid build performance for single-package projects.\n\nNinja was designed for C++ compilation and had no native understanding of concepts crucial for modern ReScript workflows:\n\nMonorepo package boundaries and inter-package dependencies\n\nCoordinated watching across multiple packages\n\nParallel builds across package boundaries\n\nCross-package optimization opportunities\n\nThe wrapper approach meant every ReScript-specific feature had to be translated into Ninja's generic model. This translation layer worked well for single packages but became limiting as monorepo adoption grew.\n\nRewatch started at Walnut, where Jaap Frolich and Roland Peelen built it to solve real problems they were facing with large ReScript codebases. It is now part of the official ReScript compiler distribution.\n\nWritten specifically for ReScript in Rust, the new build system has native understanding of ReScript's compilation model. There is no translation layer. It directly understands:\n\nReScript's compilation phases (parsing, type checking, code generation)\n\nThe meaning and role of CMI, CMT, and CMJ files\n\nModule dependency graphs spanning multiple packages\n\nPackage boundaries and monorepo structures\n\nWhen and how to coordinate builds across packages\n\nThis deep integration enables features that were difficult or impossible with a wrapper around a generic build system:\n\nUnified watch mode that tracks changes across all packages in a monorepo\n\nParallel package builds instead of sequential processing\n\nExplicit hash-based interface checking that's more reliable than timestamp-based mechanisms\n\nIntegrated formatter that works seamlessly across package boundaries\n\nBetter error messages with full context about where in the build pipeline issues occurred\n\nThe rewrite also opens doors for future improvements that require tight integration: incremental type checking, distributed build caching, and better language server integration.\n\nThe new build system takes a fundamentally different approach to building your code. At its core is a sophisticated understanding of what actually needs to be rebuilt when files change.\n\nReScript's compilation model differs from many other languages in important ways.\n\nReScript compiles one file at a time, in complete isolation. When you compile Button.res, the compiler does not maintain any shared state with other modules. Each file produces its own self-contained set of artifacts: the JavaScript output (.mjs or whatever extension you specified in your rescript.json), the module interface (.cmi), the typed tree (.cmt), and optimization metadata (.cmj). There is no separate linking phase like in C/C++, and no whole-program analysis like in many bundlers.\n\nCompilation happens in two phases: first, the file is parsed into an abstract syntax tree, then that tree is type-checked and compiled to JavaScript. This two-phase approach gives the build system fine-grained control over what work to skip. If a file has not changed at all, both phases can be skipped. If a dependency's public interface did not change (even though the file was modified), dependent modules can skip recompilation entirely.\n\nAdditionally, ReScript's module system enforces a strict constraint: dependency cycles are not allowed. Module A cannot depend on Module B while Module B also depends on Module A. This means the module graph is always a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).\n\nMost languages compile like cooking a complex dish where all ingredients affect each other. ReScript compiles like an assembly line where each station produces a complete, independent part. This makes it straightforward to parallelize, cache, and optimize.\n\nWhy this matters for build performance:\n\nPerfect caching: Since files compile independently with no global state, cached artifacts are always safe to reuse\n\nTrivial parallelization: No coordination needed between parallel compilations since they do not share state\n\nPrecise incremental rebuilds: Changes propagate predictably through the DAG with clear stopping points\n\nFoundation for future optimizations: This model enables possibilities like distributed compilation and build caching across CI runs\n\nThe trade-off: This approach limits some whole-program optimizations, but the gains in predictability and speed are substantial. More importantly, this clean, constrained model is exactly what makes the sophisticated optimizations possible. The CMI hash checking, wave-based compilation, and early termination strategies all build on these fundamental properties.\n\nA specific artifact is central to the build system's optimizations: the CMI file.\n\nCMI stands for Compiled Module Interface. When the compiler processes your ReScript code, it always generates several output files:\n\nThe .cmi file is automatically generated for every module. It acts as a contract or table of contents that describes what other modules can see and import from your module. It contains your type definitions and function signatures, but only the public ones.\n\nIf you do not write an explicit interface file (.resi), the compiler infers the interface from everything you export in the .res file. If you do write a .resi file, that becomes the explicit interface instead.\n\nHere's a concrete example with an explicit interface file:\n\nThe .cmi file for this module will contain:\n\nBut it will not contain internalHelper because it is not listed in the .resi file, making it truly internal to the module.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for build performance. If you change internalHelper, the .cmi file stays exactly the same because the public interface did not change. But if you add a parameter to make or change the size type, the .cmi file changes because the public contract changed.\n\nTip for React developers: Using .resi files for your components has an additional benefit. When you modify a component's internal implementation without changing the interface, React's Fast Refresh can preserve component state more reliably during development, creating an exceptionally smooth development experience.\n\nTo detect whether a module's interface has changed, the build system computes a hash of the .cmi file before and after compilation. If the hashes match, dependent modules can skip recompilation.\n\nThe previous system used timestamp-based detection through Ninja's restat feature, which worked well for single packages. While both approaches aim to avoid unnecessary recompilation, the explicit hash-based method provides more predictable behaviour, especially when dealing with timestamp issues across filesystems or in containerized environments. It also provides consistent behaviour across package boundaries in monorepos.\n\nThe build system employs another optimization for module resolution. When building your project, it copies all source files to a flat directory structure in the build output. Instead of maintaining the original nested directory structure, every module ends up in one place.\n\nThe old approach scattered modules across multiple directories, like books spread across multiple rooms and floors. Finding a specific module required checking each location. The new approach places all modules in one location, making lookups instant.\n\nModule lookup becomes a single directory operation\n\nThe filesystem cache is more effective when files are adjacent\n\nCross-package references are as fast as local references\n\nThe compiler spends less time searching and more time compiling\n\nThe small cost of copying files upfront is paid back many times over through faster compilation.\n\nNote that filesystems can struggle when there are too many files in a single directory. Since the build system controls the output layout, it can transparently shard files into subdirectories as a future optimization if needed, without any changes required from users.\n\nCompilation is organized into waves based on dependency order, similar to an assembly line where some stations can run in parallel while others must wait for earlier stations to complete.\n\nConsider this dependency structure:\n\nWave 1: Compile A (no dependencies)\n\nWave 2: Compile B and C in parallel (both depend only on A, which is done)\n\nWave 3: Compile D and E in parallel (their dependencies are satisfied)\n\nWave 4: Compile F (waits for both D and E)\n\nThe key insight: within each wave, all modules compile simultaneously. The build system identifies which modules are ready (all their dependencies are compiled) and processes them together.\n\nCombined with CMI hash checking, this becomes even more powerful. If module A's interface does not change, modules B and C might skip actual compilation even though they are queued in Wave 2. They pass through the wave without doing unnecessary work.\n\nThis approach emerged naturally from solving the problem of maximizing parallel compilation while respecting dependencies. The solution corresponds to a classic computer science algorithm: Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting.\n\nThe build system was designed from the ground up with monorepos in mind. It automatically detects the parent-child relationship between your monorepo root and its packages by examining rescript.json files and package dependencies.\n\nThis detection means commands work intuitively wherever you run them:\n\nBuilding from the root builds all local packages\n\nBuilding from a child package builds just that package, with full knowledge of the parent for resolving dependencies\n\nClean and format commands follow the same pattern: operate on all packages from the root, or on a single package from a child\n\nFile watching works correctly across all packages, detecting changes wherever they occur. This works with npm workspaces, yarn workspaces, pnpm, and other package managers that use symlinking for local dependencies.\n\nBeyond the build performance improvements, ReScript 12 brings a completely redesigned command-line interface. The new system consolidates everything into one cohesive tool:\n\nSmart defaults: Running rescript without arguments builds your project.\n\nConsistent interface: All commands follow the same patterns and use the same help system.\n\nBetter error messages: Clear, contextual errors instead of multi-layer stack traces.\n\nReliable process handling: Ctrl+C in watch mode always cleans up properly.\n\nIntegrated formatting: Format your entire project, specific files, or use check mode for CI, all with parallel processing.\n\nThe build system works with the major package managers: npm, yarn, pnpm, deno, and bun.\n\nNote on Bun: Recent versions of Bun (1.3+) default to \"isolated\" mode for monorepo installations, which can cause issues. If you are using Bun, you will need to configure it to use hoisted mode by adding this to your bunfig.toml:\n\nWe are continuing to test compatibility across different environments and configurations. If you encounter issues with any package manager, please report them so we can address them.\n\nFor projects that need it, the legacy build system remains available throughout the v12 release cycle through the rescript-legacy command. This is a separate binary, not a subcommand. We expect to remove it in v13, so we encourage migrating to the new system when possible.\n\nYou can add these to your package.json scripts:\n\nThe legacy system might be needed temporarily for compatibility with specific tooling or during migration. However, we strongly encourage moving to the new build system to take advantage of the performance improvements and better monorepo support.\n\nThe default rescript command now uses the new build system. If you have been using rescript build or rescript -w, they will automatically use it.\n\nReScript 12's new build system brings together intelligent dependency tracking, proper monorepo support, and a unified developer experience. The improvements are most noticeable in monorepo setups, but all projects benefit from faster module resolution, integrated formatting, and more reliable build orchestration.\n\nOur deep appreciation goes to Jaap Frolich and Roland Peelen for creating Rewatch. What started as solving their own build challenges at Walnut has become a fundamental improvement for the entire ReScript community. The research and engineering effort they invested in understanding compiler internals and reimagining dependency tracking has made a real difference for every ReScript developer. Thank you to Walnut for supporting this work and sharing it with the community.\n\nIf you are upgrading to ReScript 12, you will get the new build system automatically. We are excited to hear how it works for your projects. As always, feedback and bug reports are welcome. You can reach us through the forum or on GitHub.",

    "fullText": "While SaaS and IoT devices are increasingly popular vectors of intrusion, server-side attacks remain a serious threat to organizations worldwide. With sophisticated vulnerability scanning tools, attackers can now pinpoint security flaws in seconds, finding points of entry across the attack surface. Human security teams often struggle to keep pace with the constant wave of newly documented vulnerabilities and patches.\n\nDarktrace recently stopped a targeted cyber-attack by an unknown attacker. After the initial entry, the attacker exploited an unpatched vulnerability (CVE-2020-0618), granting a low-privileged credential the ability to remotely execute code. This enabled the attacker to spread laterally and eventually establish a foothold in the system by creating a new user account.\n\nFigure 1: Overview of the server-side attack cycle.\n\nThis blog breaks down the intrusion and explores how Darktrace’s Autonomous Response technology took three surgical actions to halt the attacker’s movements.\n\nAt a financial firm in Canada with around 3,000 devices, Cyber AI detected the use of a new credential, ‘parents’. The attacker used this credential to access the company’s internal environment through the VPN. From there, the credential authenticated to a desktop using NT LAN Manager (NTLM). No further suspicious activity was observed.\n\nNTLM is a popular attack vector for cyber-criminals as it is vulnerable to multiple methods of compromise, including brute-force and ‘pass the hash’. The initial access to the credential could have been obtained via phishing before Darktrace had been deployed.\n\nFigure 2: The credential was first observed on the device five days prior to reconnaissance. The attacker performed reconnaissance and lateral movement for two days, until the compromised devices were taken down.\n\nFive days later, the ‘parents’ credential was seen logging onto the desktop. The desktop began scanning the network – over 80 internal IPs – on Port 443 and 445.\n\nShortly after the scan, the device used Nmap to attempt to establish SMBv1 sessions to 139 internal IPs, using guest / user credentials. 79 out of the 278 sessions were successful, all using the login.\n\nFigure 3: New failed internal connections performed by an initially infected desktop, in a similar incident. The graph highlights a surge in failed internal connections and model breaches.\n\nThe network scan was the first stage after intrusion, enabling the attacker to find out which services were running, before looking for unpatched vulnerabilities.\n\nNmap has multiple built-in functionalities which are often exploited for reconnaissance and lateral movement. In this case, it was being used to establish the SMBv1 sessions to the domain controller, saving the attacker from having to initiate SMBv1 sessions with each destination one by one. SMBv1 has well-known vulnerabilities and best practice is to disable it where possible.\n\nThe desktop began controlling services (svcctl endpoint) on a SQL server. It was observed both creating and starting services (CreateServiceW, StartServiceW).\n\nThe desktop then initiated an unencrypted HTTP connection to a SQL Reporting server. This was the first HTTP connection between the two devices and the first time the user agent had been seen on the device.\n\nA packet capture of the connection reveals a POST that is seen in an exploit of CVE-2020-0613. This vulnerability is a deserialization issue, whereby the server mishandles carefully crafted page requests and allows low-privileged accounts to establish a reverse shell and remotely execute code on the server.\n\nFigure 4: A partial PCAP of the HTTP connection. The traffic matches the CVE-2020-0618 exploit, which enables Remote Code Execution (RCE) in SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).\n\nMost movements were seen in East-West traffic, with readily-available remote procedure call (RPC) methods. Such connections are abundant in systems. Without learning an organization’s ‘pattern of life’, it would have been near-impossible to highlight the malicious connections.\n\nCyber AI detected connections to the svcctl endpoint, via the DCE-RPC endpoint. This is called the 'service control' endpoint and is used to remotely control running processes on a device.\n\nDuring the lateral movement from the desktop, the HTTP POST request revealed that the desktop was exploiting CVE-2020-0613. The attacker had managed to find and exploit an existing vulnerability which hadn’t been patched.\n\nDarktrace was the only tool which alerted to the HTTP connection, revealing this underlying (and concluding) exploit. The AI determined that the user agent was unusual for the device and for the wider organization, and that the connection was highly anomalous. This connection would have gone otherwise amiss, since HTTP connections are common in most digital environments.\n\nBecause the attacker on the desktop used readily-available tools and protocols, such as Nmap, DCE-RPC, and HTTP, the device went undetected by all the other cyber defenses. However, Cyber AI noticed multiple scanning and lateral movement anomalies – triggering high-fidelity detections which would have been alerted to with Proactive Threat Notifications.\n\nThe next day, the attacker connected to an SNMP server from the VPN. The connection used the ‘parents’ RDP cookie.\n\nImmediately after the RDP connection began, the server connected to Pastebin and downloaded small amounts of encrypted data. Pastebin was likely being used as a vector to drop malicious scripts onto the device.\n\nThe SNMP server then started controlling services (svcttl) on the SQL server: again, creating and starting services.\n\nFollowing this, both the SQL server and the SNMP server made a high volume of SSL connections to a rare external domain. One upload to the destination was around 21 MB, but otherwise the connections were mostly the same packet size. This, among other factors, indicated that the destination was being used as a C2 server.\n\nFigure 5: Example Cyber AI Analyst investigation into beaconing activity by a SQL server.\n\nWith just one compromised credential, the attacker was now connecting to the VPN and infecting multiple servers on the company’s internal network.\n\nThe attacker dropped scripts onto the host using Pastebin. Darktrace alerted on this because Pastebin is highly rare for the organization. In fact, these connections were the first time it had been seen. Most security tools would miss this, as Pastebin is a legitimate site and would not be blocked by open-source intelligence (OSINT).\n\nEven if a lesser-known Pastebin alternative had been used – say, in an environment where Pastebin was blocked on the firewall but the alternative not — Darktrace would have picked up on it in exactly the same way.\n\nThe C2 beaconing endpoint – dropbox16[.]com – has no OSINT information available online. The connections were on Port 443 and nothing about them was notable except from their rarity on the company’s system. Darktrace sent alerts because of its high rarity, rather than relying on known signatures.\n\nAfter another Pastebin pull, the attacker attempted to maintain a greater foothold and escalate privileges by creating a new user using the SamrCreateUser2InDomain operation (endpoint: samr).\n\nTo establish persistence, the attacker now created a new user through a specific DCE-RPC command to the domain controller. This was highly unusual activity for the device, and was given a 100% anomaly score for ‘New or Uncommon Occurrence’.\n\nIf Darktrace had not alerted on this activity, the attacker would have continued to access files and make further inroads in the company, extracting sensitive data and potentially installing ransomware. This could have led to sensitive data loss, reputational damage, and financial losses for the company.\n\nThe organization had Antigena in passive mode, so although it was not able to respond autonomously, we have visibility into the actions that it would have taken.\n\nAntigena would have taken three actions on the initially infected desktop, as shown in the table below. The actions would have taken effect immediately in response to the first scan and the first service control requests.\n\nDuring the two days of reconnaissance and lateral movement activity, these were the only steps Antigena suggested. The steps were all directly relevant to the intrusion – there was no attempt to block anything unrelated to the attack, and no other Antigena actions were triggered during this period.\n\nFurthermore, unusual service control attempts performed by the device would have been halted, minimizing the damage to the targeted destination.\n\nAntigena would have delivered these blocks directly or via whatever integration was most suitable for the customer, such as firewall integrations or NAC integrations.\n\nThe threat story above demonstrates the importance of controlling the access granted to low-privileged credentials, as well as remaining up-to-date with security patches. Since such attacks take advantage of existing network infrastructure, it is extremely difficult to detect these anomalous connections without the use of AI.\n\nThere was a delay of several days between the initial use of the ‘parents’ credentials and the first signs of lateral movement. This dormancy period – between compromise and the start of internal activities – is commonly seen in attacks. It likely indicates that the attacker was checking initially if their access worked, and then re-visiting the victim for further compromise once their schedule allowed for it.\n\nThis compromise is reflective of many real-life intrusions: attacks cannot be easily attributed and are often conducted by sophisticated, unidentified threat actors.\n\nNevertheless, Darktrace managed to detect each stage of the attack cycle: initial compromise, reconnaissance, lateral movement, established foothold, and privilege escalation, and had Antigena been in active mode, it would have blocked these connections, and even prevented the initial desktop from ever exploiting the SQL vulnerability, which allowed the attacker to execute code remotely.\n\nOne day later, after seeing the power of Autonomous Response, the company decided to deploy Antigena in active mode.\n\nThanks to Darktrace analyst Isabel Finn for her insights on the above threat find.",

    "title": "The Hottest Data Centers",
    "description": "In 21 countries, all data centers are located in climates that are too hot.",
    "fullText": "On paper, Singapore is a terrible location for a data center. With average temperatures hitting 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees Fahrenheit) and relative humidity levels of above 80%, the country is also considered to be one of the most densely populated places in the world.\n\nData centers, meanwhile, can sprawl over vast areas, and operate most efficiently in cool climates. They contain servers, graphics processing units, and other equipment that needs large amounts of power and gives off intense heat. Cooling that equipment in hot climates raises costs, strains the electricity grid, and adds to emissions. Despite all that, Singapore is one of the densest data center clusters in the world, with more than 1.4 gigawatts of capacity. That makes it the fifth biggest market in the Asia-Pacific region — and the country plans to add 300 more megawatts of capacity.\n\nAcross the world, countries with hot climates are investing millions of dollars in building data centers to meet the growing demand for generative artificial intelligence while also storing data within their own borders. That’s why data centers are peppered around the world, rather than being concentrated only in cooler countries like Norway or Sweden.\n\nRest of World set out to document how many data centers globally are located in regions that are too hot for optimal operations. The industry standard for that range is 18 C to  27 C, recommended by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, or Ashrae. Cooler temperatures improve server operation efficiency; in hotter temperatures, data centers face significant challenges in cooling their facilities.\n\nWe plotted temperature data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store, a project organized as part of the European Union’s efforts to open-source climate data against locations from Data Center Map, a widely referenced resource and marketplace for data center-related services. We found that of the 8,808 operational data centers worldwide as of October 2025, nearly 7,000 are located in areas outside the optimal range. The vast majority are in regions with average temperatures that are colder than the range. Only 600, or less than 10% of all operational data centers, are located in areas where average annual temperatures are above 27 C.\n\nHowever, our analysis, conducted with the help of nonprofit Climate Central, showed that in 21 countries— including Singapore, Thailand, Nigeria, and the United Arab Emirates — all data centers are located in areas with average annual temperatures of above 27 C. Nearly all data centers in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are in regions that are too hot. Nearly half of Indonesia’s 170 data centers are in hot places, while in India — a key market for big tech and social media companies — about 30% are located in overly hot regions.\n\nMeanwhile, all data centers in Norway and South Korea, and nearly all data centers in Japan, are in regions with temperatures below 18 C.\n\nHigh and very high temperatures are among the biggest risk factors to data centers, and can impact two-thirds of data center hubs by 2040 — including all hubs in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East — according to risk intelligence firm Verisk Maplecroft. Poh Seng Lee, who oversees the Sustainable Tropical Data Centre Testbed in Singapore, grapples with the logistics of running a data center in a challenging environment. The 0.5-megawatt data center is located on the campus of the National University of Singapore, with more than 20 industry players including Dell, Intel, and Meta working with academia to develop cooling solutions specifically for hot and humid climates.\n\n“In thermal terms, Singapore is almost ‘permanent peak summer’ for a data center,” Lee told Rest of World. “Cooling is both technically harder and structurally more energy-intensive here than in most other data center hubs. That is why Singapore has to radically improve efficiency rather than just build more of the same.”\n\nThe rise of data centre investment in hotter and more water-scarce locations like India, Singapore, and the UAE in part reflects a diversification beyond the previous investment concentration in North America and Europe, Laura Schwartz, senior Asia analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, told Rest of World. “Cooling data centres is particularly challenging in the hottest parts of the world, home to many growing data centre hubs.”\n\nExtreme heat not only places a heavier burden on cooling systems, it also reduces the efficiency of power transmission, raising the risk of outages. Data centers’ electricity consumption totaled 415 terawatt hours, or about 1.5% of total global consumption in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. That will likely more than double by 2030, with the U.S. and China leading the expansion.\n\nIn Singapore, data centers accounted for about 7% of electricity consumption in 2020, and that share could rise to about 12% by 2030 “without intervention,” Lee said. The government has mandated that data centers in the country must reduce their consumption of power and water.\n\nGlobally, the data center industry is largely air-cooled, and is moving toward a liquid-based solution, which is “energy efficient and can reduce water consumption,” Shaolei Ren, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, told Rest of World.\n\n“In hotter places, hybrid cooling — using air cooling when appropriate and evaporative cooling when needed — may be more suitable to yield maximum combined benefits of energy saving and water conservation,” said Ren, who studies data centers’ resource use.\n\nAt the test bed, Lee and his team are experimenting with direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersion cooling, which can reduce energy use by up to 40% and water use by 30%–40%.\n\n“The old model of unconstrained, air-cooled growth is simply unsustainable,” Lee said. These two technologies are already commercially viable for adoption, and in the next two to five years, “I expect these will become standard features rather than exotic add-ons,” he said. Over the next five to 10 years, “more radical approaches,” such as large-scale seawater cooling, will move from pilots to commercial deployment.\n\nIn China, nearly two-thirds of 361 operational data centers are in cooler temperatures, and the country is constructing one beneath the surface of the ocean to test better cooling efficiency. While in the Middle East, long-term solutions could include using nuclear energy and hydrogen fuel cells, and building data centers underground to handle extreme heat.\n\nBig tech firms are also looking for solutions to cool their data centers more efficiently. By applying DeepMind’s machine learning to its own data centers, Google claims to have reduced the amount of energy used for cooling by up to 40%. Microsoft’s newest data centers are designed with in-chip microfluidic cooling systems. Tiny channels are etched directly on the back of the silicon chip, creating grooves that allow cooling liquid to flow directly onto the chip and remove heat more efficiently. Amazon also has a direct-to-chip liquid cooling system that can reduce mechanical energy consumption by up to 46% during peak cooling without increasing water usage.\n\nDeploying new technologies, however, is often costly and easier to implement in new centers rather than in retrofits, “meaning that resilience and sustainability risks around existing data centre capacity in hotter and more water-scarce markets continue to be a concern,” said Schwartz.\n\nAshrae already recommends operating temperatures of up to 45 C for newer classes of data processors. For Lee, the goal is to have the technologies being piloted in the test bed working in the real-world environment, and adopted by others.\n\n“Singapore’s situation is extreme but not unique,” he said. “Many of the world’s fastest-growing digital economies — such as Jakarta, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City, and Mumbai — share similar hot and humid conditions.”\n\n“If we can show that data centers can run reliably, efficiently, and with low water and carbon footprints in Singapore’s climate, then there is no reason they cannot be adapted to the rest of the tropics and other climatic zones,” he said.",

    "title": "Is the Article Dead?",
    "description": "Personalization is coming to journalism. The question is: who controls it?",
    "fullText": "But the real question isn’t whether the article survives. It’s whether it remains the primary way people encounter journalism.\n\nThe written article — linear, static, and designed for a broad audience — was optimized for a world of scarce publishing space and shared attention. That world is disappearing. Referral traffic is collapsing. Homepages matter less than they once did. Increasingly, people encounter journalism through feeds, summaries, notifications, and recommendations shaped to their individual context.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the article is obsolete. But it does mean we shouldn’t assume it will stay the same forever.\n\nAlthough the article has been with us for thousands of years, publishing is continually evolving. Just as the invention of the web changed who could publish and find an audience (from a small group of people privileged by an even smaller group of publishers to, well, everyone with an internet connection), the software and services available today can enable new features like personalization and new kinds of interactivity.\n\nThis isn’t technological determinism. If these features succeed, it won’t be because of the technology itself, but because that technology served an existing need that was previously harder to meet. If new tools help us to create a new iteration of the article that resonates with readers, it won’t be because they themselves bring success; it will be because they helped us create something to serve readers in a way that was previously unreachable.\n\nPersonalization is one clear example: it’s a feature newsrooms are beginning to talk more about, particularly in the context of LLMs and how they might make new capabilities possible. As Gina Chua, executive editor at Semafor, framed the need for it in this year’s NiemanLabs Predictions for Journalism:\n\nThis framing deserves scrutiny — not least the claim that a young parent in Florida isn’t or shouldn’t be interested in debates over diversity — but it’s also important to highlight that Gina thinks this isn’t appropriate for every kind of article:\n\nThis suggests that personalization matters most for what we might think of as “information as infrastructure”. These are articles that provide actionable answers to practical questions: What did the planning commission decide about that development proposal? When does early voting start? What routes are closed for road work? With that caveat in mind, I find it easier to accept that personalization is desirable: I’m interested in whether my city council member voted to collude with ICE, or when the dangerous intersection on the way to daycare is finally getting a stop sign, or which candidates my precinct will see on the ballot, in a way that isn’t necessarily one size fits all.\n\nIf we accept that this is desirable, we need to ask: who is personalizing the article, and how?\n\nIt’s worth coming back to Gina’s generalization about a young parent in Florida. We may hold that opinion about that broad category of person, but it doesn’t necessarily match reality; everyone is different. Real personalization means going beyond abstracted personas and ensuring that the information any given individual is receiving is tailored to their needs.\n\nThat, in turn, means we need to know what their needs are. We have some choices here, and not all of them are compatible with the values of a service-oriented newsroom.\n\nEach of these approaches carries very different implications for privacy, agency, and trust.\n\nThe first option violates fundamental privacy principles and should be ruled out for public service journalism. Determining a person’s needs and interests via third-party trackers outsources the engine of personalization to opaque surveillance networks that violate reader privacy and likely have their own business priorities.\n\nInferring needs through reader activity has clearer ethical boundaries, but practical challenges remain. For one thing, there may not be enough signal to build an accurate profile. For another, there’s a catch-22 cold-start problem: personalization requires reading activity, but reading activity may never materialize if the content isn’t compelling because it hasn’t been personalized yet. Finally, we’re still profiling the user without their express consent, and those profiles could be revealed via subpoena, putting readers at risk.\n\nThe third option aligns with journalistic values but creates friction. Letting them tell us what they care about, consensually and overtly, is ideologically clean but in practice may be awkward and interruptive and risks user abandonment.\n\nBoth viable approaches share a fundamental challenge: they require newsrooms to build, secure, and maintain a detailed, persistent profile for each reader as a part of the publishing stack. That’s not something that most CMS platforms offer today, and is a lot to ask of smaller newsrooms in particular. It’s expensive and technically demanding, and the technology will continue to evolve: LLMs as we know them today are not AI’s final form, and new changes will require ongoing development resources. And even beyond the technical considerations, there are legal requirements that may create significant overhead.\n\nFor these reasons, I don’t think newsrooms should attempt to build or host personalization engines.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean personalization won’t happen and isn’t valuable. The problems I’ve identified — cost, technical change, privacy implications — shift considerably if personalization moves from publisher-controlled systems into reader-controlled tools like their browsers and RSS readers. In this model, the article remains universal, but the experience of encountering it becomes personal.\n\nIf personalization happens in the browser, a few important things become possible:\n\nWe can also solve an implied problem with publisher agency. The way we often talk about personalization today, for example in the context of AI agents and chatbots that rewrite or summarize content, requires that publishers lose control over the presentation of their work, and that their relationship with their readers is intermediated. But if we built it as an open standard — with transparent algorithms, user control, and no central data collection — the publisher remains fully in control.\n\nPublishers could expose lightweight semantic signals, using HTML tags, that describe what different sections of an article are about: for example, whether a passage concerns local governance, public safety, elections, or education. These signals wouldn’t change the article itself; they would simply make its structure and subject matter legible to readers’ tools.\n\nA browser or reader could then use those signals, combined with locally held preferences, to decide how prominently to surface, summarize, or emphasize different sections. Some browsers might use LLMs to interpret semantic signals and generate summaries — Chrome seems likely to take this path, given their AI investments — while privacy-focused browsers like Firefox might use simpler, transparent rules. If a browser doesn’t support personalization or a reader switches it off, all the content would be displayed. Those differences would become part of how readers choose between browsers, and the standard itself would be a progressive enhancement rather than a replacement for how we structure articles today.\n\nThere’s a long history of developers trying to build semantic signals into HTML. To be clear, I’m not arguing for what we used to call the semantic web. Instead, just as RSS succeeded as a standard because you could get something up and running in an afternoon, this new standard needs to be incredibly lightweight and easy to build into both a CMS and a browser.\n\nOne embodiment might be to use existing schema.org vocabulary to describe content semantically — what places, topics, and government actions are mentioned — without making assumptions about reader demographics. In this version, a section about Oakland’s city council vote on ICE collaboration would be tagged with areaServed=\"Oakland, CA\" and about=\"immigration enforcement policy\", not with assumptions about which type of person cares about it. The browser, informed by the reader’s own expressed interests and location, decides what's relevant.\n\nYou might disagree that schema.org is the right markup, and that’s fine. Those are implementation details. I think the most important facets of personalization markup are:\n\nOf course, AI agents will continue to summarize and rewrite journalism regardless of the existence of any standards. But for readers who want unmediated access to journalism while still getting personalization, and for publishers who want to maintain direct relationships with those readers, this approach offers a path forward that neither requires publishers to build complex systems nor surrenders control to platforms. It also makes blocking AI agents a clearer choice, because the same personalization can take place in less extractive, publisher-friendly environments.\n\nBrowsers can also use this as a way to compete with vendors like OpenAI. The web is already compelling, and this proposal brings more of the personalization that AI enables into that more familiar environment. It’s a way for Mozilla and even Google to use their pre-existing web-first stance as an advantage. And because it’s all web-based, it’s easy to create a shim using a browser extension even before browsers themselves choose to adopt it.\n\nSo, no. The article isn’t dead. But how it lives on is in question.\n\nPersonalization is coming whether newsrooms build it or not. What's in question is where it lives, and who controls it. Built around surveillance and intermediaries, it erodes trust and weakens journalism’s public role. Built into reader-controlled tools on the open web, it can do the opposite: make journalism more relevant without making it more extractive.\n\nAt its core, the question isn’t really about AI, browsers, or markup. It’s about agency. Who decides what’s relevant? Who holds the data about what readers care about? And who controls the relationship between journalists and the people they serve?\n\nThose choices will shape not just the future of the article, but the future of journalism itself — and with it, how all of us learn about the world.",

    "fullText": "What we can learn from a great American city’s refusal to bend to Trump’s invasion.\n\nThis article is part of a special Nation package devoted to LA’s bold stand against the Trump administration’s assaults on the city.\n\nThe New York Nation, as some called this magazine in its early years, has always kept one eye on Los Angeles. Even if the magazine suggested in an 1869 essay on “The New West” that “not everything is lovely there,” our writers have over the past century and a half been drawn to the sprawling city—with all its energy and possibility, along with its share of sordid realities and inequalities—and the broader story of what would come to be known as the Left Coast.\n\nWe return again with this issue, which features a multifaceted examination of LA’s bold resistance to the Trump administration’s assault on the city itself, and on the rich diversity and democratic promise that Los Angeles represents. Bill Gallegos, a veteran Chicano activist who is a member of The Nation’seditorial board, sets the stage with his examination of the remarkable coalitions that pushed back against Trump’s decision to send federal troops to the city last spring. LA Mayor Karen Bass offers her perspectives on resisting Trump and Trumpism. And author and music-­industry veteran Danny Goldberg contributes a moving reflection on the linkages between the racial-justice protests of the past and our current struggles.\n\nThis package begins an expanded focus by The Nation on Donald Trump’s assault on the blue zones of a nation he is bent on tearing apart. Beginning with the resistance in California makes sense because The Nation has so frequently turned to the state for political inspiration.\n\nIn 1934, when the socialist novelist Upton Sinclair ran as the Democratic nominee for governor there—under the slogan “End Poverty in California,” or EPIC—The Nation’s editor and publisher, Oswald Garrison Villard, hailed him for building a grassroots movement of unemployed and working-class voters who were desperate for change during the Great Depression. Sinclair’s campaign fell short, but its advocacy for state-run cooperative industries and relief for the poor struck a chord in a state—and a nation—that was seething with labor unrest and economic discontent.\n\nTwo years later, the novelist John Steinbeck brought the conditions of California’s agriculture workers to national prominence in a Nation article. “It is fervently to be hoped,” wrote the author of The Grapes of Wrath, “that the great group of migrant workers so necessary to the harvesting of California’s crops may be given the right to live decently, that they may not be so badgered, tormented, and hurt that in the end they become avengers of the hundreds of thousands who have been tortured and starved before them.”\n\nDuring World War II, the magazine denounced the internment of Japanese American citizens—who were overwhelmingly from California, as well as Oregon and Washington—as a national catastrophe. Portraying the detention of patriotic citizens as “mass hysteria,” The Nation observed: “Discrimination against citizens because of their racial lineage cuts straight across the American tradition.”\n\nCarey McWilliams, the LA writer who published one of the first books decrying the mistreatment of Japanese American families during the war, edited The Nation from 1955 to 1975. One of California’s greatest historians, writing books like Factories in the Field and Southern California: An Island on the Land, McWilliams chronicled the state’s transformation from an agricultural frontier to an economic powerhouse, exposing the human cost of its sunshine image.\n\nDuring the 1950s Red Scare, when loyalty oaths and blacklists rocked Hollywood and much of the rest of the country, McWilliams and The Nation defended LA writers, directors, and artists who’d been accused of subversion. The magazine’s exposés of the House Un-American Activities Committee’s witch hunts provided a platform for voices that would otherwise have been silenced, in a fight that another Nation editor, Victor Navasky, chronicled in his remarkable 1980 book Naming Names.\n\nIn 1965, Hunter S. Thompson told the story of California’s motorcycle gangs for The Nation and expanded that article into his bestselling book Hell’s Angels—ushering in the era of “gonzo journalism.” Mike Davis, the great California-based historian and social critic, also began to contribute groundbreaking essays to The Nation. Writing in the mid-1990s, Davis chronicled the dire effects of racial capitalism in Compton, called out California’s mass incarceration crisis, and explained the origins and consequences of the state’s “natural disasters”: the fires, earthquakes, and floods that raised profound questions about everything from overdevelopment to climate change. Davis, like so many other great Nation writers on the California experience (Robert Scheer, Amy Wilentz, Jon Wiener, and Rebecca Solnit among them) treated the state not as a sun-drenched exception, or as an American West of Eden, but as its truest self—a place where the nation’s inequalities, contradictions, and possibilities have been laid bare.\n\nThis month’s package of articles on resistance and coalition-building in our second-most-populous city continues in this great Nation tradition of looking west—of searching not only for the sources of this country’s turmoil but also for clues to how we might yet forge a progressive future in which another LA, another California, and another America are possible.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F.

It could mean more royalties – but many are worried\n\nThis was the year that AI-generated music went from jokey curiosity to mainstream force. Velvet Sundown, a wholly AI act, generated millions of streams; AI-created tracks topped Spotify’s viral chart and one of the US Billboard country charts; AI “artist” Xania Monet “signed” a record deal. BBC Introducing is usually a platform for flesh-and-blood artists trying to make it big, but an AI-generated song by Papi Lamour was recently played on the West Midlands show. And jumping up the UK Top 20 this month is I Run, a track by dance act Haven, who have been accused of using AI to imitate British vocalist Jorja Smith (Haven claim they simply asked the AI for “soulful vocal samples”, and did not respond to an earlier request to comment).\n\nThe worry is that AI will eventually absorb all creative works in history and spew out endless slop that will replace human-made art and drive artists into penury. Those worries are being deepened by how the major labels, once fearful of the technology, are now embracing it – and heralding a future in which ordinary listeners have a hand in co-creating music with their favourite musicians.\n\nAI music platforms analyse huge amounts of recorded music in order to learn its sounds, structures and expressions, and then allow users to create their own AI-generated music via text or speech prompts. You might ask for a moody R&B song about a breakup sung by a female vocalist, and it will come up with a decent approximation of one, because it’s absorbed hundreds of such songs.\n\nArtists and labels initially saw AI as the biggest existential threat since Napster-fuelled piracy: if not a replacement for human creativity, then certainly a force that could undermine its value. Gregor Pryor, a managing partner at legal firm Reed Smith, says background music for things such as advertising, films and video games, where you’re not relating to a personality as you would in pop music, “is where the real damage will be done” first of all. “People will ask: why would I pay anyone to compose anything?”\n\nAware of the scale of the shift, last year the Recording Industry Association of America, representing the three major labels, initiated legal action against AI music companies Suno and Udio for copyright infringement, alleging they had trained their AI platforms on the labels’ artists without their permission. But then there was an extraordinary about-turn. They didn’t just settle the matter out of court – Universal Music Group (UMG) then partnered with Udio, and Warner Music Group (WMG) with Udio and Suno. They also have deals in place with AI company Klay, the first to get all three major labels on board, adding Sony Music (discussions with indie labels are ongoing). WMG chief executive Robert Kyncl has said these recent deals are to ensure the “protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters” and to fuel “new creative and commercial possibilities” for them, while UMG chief Lucien Grainge heralded “a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish and create incredible experiences for fans”.\n\nKyncl made another bold statement as to why these deals are taking place: “Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. The democratisation of music creation.”\n\nAnnouncing its Universal tie-in, Udio chief executive Andrew Sanchez has said Udio users will be able to “create [music] with an artist’s voice and style”: so not just create the aforementioned moody R&B song, but one with a specific existing artist’s voice. He also says Udio will allow users to “remix and reimagine your favourite songs with AI … take your favourite artists, songs or styles and combine them in novel ways. In our internal experimentation, the team has gotten some truly remarkable and unusual results that will definitely delight.”\n\nKlay meanwhile states that “fans can mould their musical journeys in new ways”, but it’s essentially the same offering: a subscription service where you can manipulate the music of others, or create your own from it. Ary Attie, Klay’s founder and chief executive, says his company will properly compensate artists whose work is used, and won’t supplant the work of human musicians: “This technology is not going to change any of that.”\n\nKlay is a rarity in that it signed up all three major labels before it started training its AI system on their music: “A core part of our philosophy,” Attie says. He argues that rival AI companies – he doesn’t name names – have been “acting in a way that doesn’t respect the work of artists, and then being forced into a corner”. Suno did not respond to an interview request; Udio claimed its executives were “extremely swamped” and therefore unable to answer questions. The current, and synchronised, messaging from labels and gen AI companies with licensing deals is that they all respect both art and artists and that their deals will reflect this.\n\nThey are also positioning gen AI as the single biggest democratising leap ever in remix culture, effectively enabling everyone to become musically creative. The counterargument is that, by lowering all barriers to entry and by allowing the manipulation of a song or a musician’s character at scale, it vastly devalues and negates the creative act itself.\n\nBut what do musicians actually think of the prospect of their work being used to train AI, and reworked by the general public? “Everybody should be selling or licensing their voice and their skills to these companies,” Dave Stewart of Eurythmics argued to me this week. “Otherwise they’re just going to take it anyway.” That view is directly countered by the major labels and AI companies, who have insisted artists and songwriters get to opt in to have their music made available, and if they do, get royalties when their music is used to train AI, or manipulated by users on platforms such as Udio, Suno and Klay.\n\nOthers take a grimmer view about how these companies might reshape the industry. Irving Azoff, legendarily forthright artist manager and founder of the Music Artists Coalition in the US, responded to the Universal/Udio deal with biting cynicism. “We’ve seen this before – everyone talks about ‘partnership,’ but artists end up on the sidelines with scraps,” he said. In the wake of the same deal, the Council of Music Makers in the UK accused the major labels of “spin” and called for a more robust set of artist-label agreements. And the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance says there is a disturbing “lack of transparency” around the deals (though more detail is likely to emerge on what users can do with any music they create, and any potential commercial uses of it).\n\nCatherine Anne Davies, who records as the Anchoress and also sits on the board of directors at the Featured Artists Coalition (FAC), has many reservations here. “Most people don’t even want their work to be used for training AI,” she says. “I’m on the dystopian side, or maybe what I call the realist side of things. I’m interested in the way that AI can be assistive in the creative process – if it can make us more efficient, if it can streamline our processes. But generative AI for me, in terms of creative output, is a big no-no at the moment. I’m yet to be convinced.”\n\nMusician Imogen Heap feels that AI itself is not to be feared as a tool – she uses an AI she calls Mogen to listen to every aspect of her life, with a view to it being a creative partner (as explored in a recent Guardian article). To help address some of the issues, she has created Auracles, an artist-led, non-profit platform she hopes will be the place where the rights and permissions around AI are set out. It’s not enough to say you’re happy with your music being used by AI, she says – instead, what’s needed are “permissions that grow and evolve over time”.\n\nOther companies are cropping up with similar offers. “We must protect the artists at all costs,” says Sean Power, chief executive of Musical AI, who aims to give musicians “an exact portion of the influence they’re having on all the generative outputs” – meaning compensation every time even a tiny bit of one of their songs is used by a user of Udio et al.\n\nTerms of these deals are undisclosed, but labels are likely to be seeking settlement for any past use of their artists’ copyrights as well as an advance on future use, plus an equity stake in the platform. And while artists will be able to opt out of including their work, they probably won’t be consulted on these partnerships going ahead, with this lack of consultation being something that artist representative bodies such as FAC have been particularly critical of. “The big artists, the labels need to be nice to; those who have a platform will be consulted to some degree,” says a music licensing expert, speaking anonymously. “The very few, who as individual artists are able to make a dent on share price, will have approval.”\n\nI approached Universal, Sony and Warner about the specific concerns raised by artists here: namely limited transparency around the deals, their commercial terms and how opt-ins work; if there is a risk of gen AI undermining existing revenue sources; and if there is significant artist refusal to assign their works for gen AI training. None of the companies would comment on the record about the specifics. Though in an internal Universal memo about AI deals, sent to all staff earlier this year and seen by the Guardian, Grainge said “we will NOT license any model that uses an artist’s voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist’s existing songs without their consent.”\n\nThe Guardian understands that labels are currently having discussions with artists and their managers to better explain how these deals will work and why they believe they can bring in additional revenue, although they will need to convince artists that gen AI will not damage other sources of income, notably from streaming.\n\nBut it isn’t clear whether consumers will actually pay to play around with music in the way Udio and others hope they will. AI is the single biggest hype category in Silicon Valley right now, with an average of $2bn of venture capital investment going into AI companies every week in the first half of this year. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet (parent company of Google), recently warned of the catastrophic domino effect across the tech sector if this AI bubble bursts, a concern the Bank of England also recently raised.\n\nReed Smith’s Gregor Pryor argues that AI music could, counterintuitively, end up being positive for human musicians. “By its nature, AI is derivative and cannot create new music,” he says. “Some investors in music catalogues that I speak to say it’s good for artists, because music ‘verified’ as created by humans will have greater value.”\n\nArtists will frame their work as having an invaluable human essence, their music speaking entirely from the heart, but it will become incrementally more difficult for the casual listener to distinguish between music created by a human and that created by AI. The Guardian understands that radio stations and DJs are currently extremely nervous about AI-powered music slipping through their quality filters, effectively hoodwinking them and hanging question marks over how their playlists work. The example of Papi Lamour might force them to do much greater due diligence on what they put forward for airplay consideration. Or they could be the first trickles of a flood that roars through radio and streaming services as the boundaries between AI and human-created music crumble.\n\nDavies is especially worried about artists not thinking through the long-term implications of licensing to AI services. “We cannot think of ourselves selfishly as entities that will be unaffected, because the entire ecosystem will experience a knock-on effect financially. What about your fellow composers and creators? But also what about the generations to come after? Are we fucking this completely, just to make sure that we can pay our mortgages now?”\n\nAI’s current level of sophistication means it is really producing composites of existing music, creating a Frankenstein’s monster of melodies. However, when AGI (artificial general intelligence) finally arrives, with Anthropic co-founder Dario Amodei suggesting that could happen as soon as next year, we will be catapulted into an exhilarating and terrifying realm of uncertainty for the future and the purpose of human-created art.\n\n“It’s literally happening under our noses,” warns Davies. “We should be so much more concerned than we are.”",

    "fullText": "Liz Kendall faces pressure from campaigners as she tells parliament there is no clear consensus on issue\n\nA campaign fronted by popstars including Elton John and Dua Lipa to protect artists’ works from being mined to train AI models without consent has received a boost after almost every respondent to a government consultation backed their case.\n\nNinety-five per cent of the more than 10,000 people who had their say over how music, novels, films and other works should be protected from copyright infringements by tech companies called for copyright to be strengthened and a requirement for licensing in all cases or no change to copyright law.\n\nMinisters subsequently dropped that preference in the face of a backlash. Artists who have opposed any dilution of their copyright include Sam Fender, Kate Bush and the Pet Shop Boys. Campaigners to protect artists’ copyright have voiced fears that ministers have paid too much attention to US tech companies’ interests.\n\nThe US president, Donald Trump, has said: “We have to allow AI to use that [copyrighted] pool of knowledge without going through the complexity of contract negotiations,” and warned international governments not to “make rules and regulations that … make it impossible” for AI companies to do business.\n\nLast month Paul McCartney stepped up the campaign to protect copyright by releasing a new recording, which was almost entirely silent save for some ambient clattering in the studio as a protest against copyright theft by AI companies.\n\nLiz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament on Monday there was “no clear consensus” on the issue and the government would “take the time to get this right”, and promised to make policy proposals by 18 March 2026.\n\n“Our approach to copyright and AI must support prosperity for all UK citizens, and drive innovation and growth for sectors across the economy, including the creative industries,” she said. “This means keeping the UK at the cutting edge of science and technology so UK citizens can benefit from major breakthroughs, transformative innovation and greater prosperity.\n\n“It also means continuing to support our creative industries, which make a huge economic contribution, shape our national identity and give us a unique position on the world stage.”\n\nBut campaigners for copyright holders said the consultation response set a clear course for the government to take.\n\n“This is an overwhelming show of support for the commonsense position that AI companies should pay for the resources they use, and a total rejection of the government’s ‘preferred option’ of handing AI companies the work of the UK’s creatives for free,” said Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for copyright fairness.\n\n“Liz Kendall should listen to the people and rule out changing copyright law to benefit AI companies.”\n\nOwen Meredith, the chief executive of the New Media Association, urged Kendall to rule out any new copyright exception and end the uncertainty created by “this prolonged process”.\n\n“This will send a clear message to AI developers that they must enter into licensing agreements with the UK’s media and creative copyright owners, unlocking investment and strengthening the market for the high-quality content that is the most valuable ingredient in producing safe, trustworthy AI models,” he said.\n\nLast month, Kendall indicated she was sympathetic to artists’ demands not to have their copyrighted works scraped by AI companies without payment and wanted to “reset” the debate. “People rightly want to get paid for the work that they do,” she said, and “we have to find a way that both sectors can grow and thrive in future”.",

    "fullText": "Region struggling with drought now threatened by energy-hungry facilities – but some residents are fighting back\n\nThe sign outside Tom Hermes’s farmyard in Perkins Township in Ohio, a short drive south of the shores of Lake Erie, proudly claims that his family have farmed the land here since 1900. Today, he raises 130 head of cattle and grows corn, wheat, grass and soybeans on 1,200 acres of land.\n\nFor his family, his animals and wider business, water is life.\n\nSo when, in May 2024, the Texas-based Aligned Data Centers broke ground on its NEO-01, four-building, 200,000 sq ft data center on a brownfield site that abuts farmland that Hermes rents, he was concerned.\n\n“We have city water here. That’s going to reduce the pressure if they are sucking all the water,” he says of the data center.\n\n“They’re not good, I know that.”\n\nTwo years ago, the company said it would invest about $202m on a “hyperscale” data center that would employ 18 people and dozens \n\nAll the while, a 10-minute drive north, the shoreline of Lake Erie hasn’t been this low in years.\n\nWater levels across all five Great Lakes have begun to drop in recent months as part of a long-term fall. Since 2019, the Great Lakes have seen water-level decreases of two to four feet. While experts say this is a natural decrease given the record highs the lakes have experienced since 2020, it’s happening at a time when a huge new consumer of water has appeared on the horizon: data centers.\n\nThe source of the largest single deposit of freshwater on the planet, the Great Lakes, in particular Lake Erie, are already struggling with the fallout of drought and warmer water temperatures that, at this time of year, fuel major lake-effect snowstorms, and greater than normal levels of evaporation due to the absence of ice cover.\n\nWith major cities such as Chicago, Toronto, Detroit and Pittsburgh all within a few hundred miles of each other, small, under-resourced communities around the Great Lakes have become hugely attractive for data-center companies.\n\nIn Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, Microsoft is building what it calls the “world’s most-powerful AI data center” that is set to open early next year and expected to use up to 8.4bn gallons of municipal water from the city of Racine every year. Racine gets its water from Lake Michigan. Similar stories are playing out in Hobart, Indiana, where AWS is planning to build a data center two miles from Lake Michigan’s shoreline, and in Port Washington, Wisconsin.\n\nIn Benton Harbor, Michigan, locals are concerned that a proposed $3bn data center would contribute to environmental pollution and traffic.\n\nForty miles west of Aligned’s under-construction data center in Ohio, in Woodville Township, hundreds of people showed up to a public meeting last October to voice concern about another proposed data center project in their rural community.\n\n“The Great Lakes region, especially in states such as Illinois and Ohio, [is] among the most data-center dense states in the region. In addition to the high volumes of water used on site for cooling, our recent research found that even more water may be consumed to generate electricity to power data centers’ energy needs,” says Kirsten James, senior program director for water at Ceres, a nonprofit headquartered in Boston.\n\n“These impacts can conflict with communities’ water-resource planning efforts.”\n\nThe Great Lakes Compact, a 2005 accord signed by the governors of eight US states and two Canadian provinces, means that Great Lakes Water must only be used within the regional basin.\n\nResearch by Purdue University found that data centers on average consume about 300,000 gallons of water a day. Water used by data centers is warmed significantly and for those that do not use a closed loop system, that heated effluent water, just 20% of the initial amount, is often discharged back into local wastewater systems or the environment, with potentially serious consequences for flora, fauna and human consumers. Even closed-loop systems that reuse the same water repeatedly need millions of gallons of water.\n\nWhile many new data centers are drawing water from local municipalities that, in turn, get their water from groundwater, much of that supply comes from the Great Lakes watersheds.\n\nSome communities are fighting back. Last month, residents of Fife Lake, Michigan, were overjoyed after hearing a plan for a data center in their town of 471 residents would be scrapped due to local opposition.\n\nSimilar stories of successful opposition have played out in Indiana and elsewhere.\n\nBut the data centers are fighting back.\n\nPrivate firms representing data center companies have often successfully sued community authorities, accusing them of illegally excluding certain types of developments, making small towns powerless in the battle to keep out giant water-guzzling corporations.\n\nIn Michigan’s Saline Township, a community of about 400 people outside Ann Arbor, OpenAI and Oracle used a representative company to successfully sue the local authority to overcome opposition and build a massive facility that would use 1.4 gigawatts of electricity – roughly the equivalent of powering 1.4 million homes.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press editorial board assailed the move, calling it a “a fait accompli, hammered into this tiny Washtenaw county community over the objections of residents, the elected board that represents them, and Michigan’s attorney general, absent expert or outside testimony save a cursory public hearing held over Microsoft Teams”.\n\nData companies and their backers, however, say their presence is a net gain for Great Lakes communities by providing jobs and investment over the course of years.\n\nAligned has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Perkins Township, the local school system and a career center. In return, it gets a 15-year tax exemption from local authorities. A representative declined to respond to questions from the Guardian asking how much water it intends to use at the data center and from where it originates.\n\nLocal municipalities that support these facilities claim that the data centers will increase tax revenue and help rebuild ageing infrastructure such as water delivery systems that, in some places, are in significant need of upgrading. Calls, emails and messages left with Erie county commissioners asking if local authorities plan to supply the Perkins Township data center with water were not responded to.\n\nSome Perkins Township residents say a number of local companies have been hired during the construction phase, bringing work to the area.\n\nBut many argue those investments are not worth the long-term price the community may pay.\n\nAmanda Voegle, who works at a heating business now directly facing the data center, is concerned about water and many other issues.\n\n“A couple of years ago, there was a water pollution issue at the site. I’m very concerned. Is this [water] going back into the lake?”\n\nTwo years ago, the construction site upon which the data center is being built was found to be the source of contamination of a river that flows into Lake Erie, with the remediation company responsible cited by the Ohio EPA for unauthorized discharges into state waters.\n\n“I don’t understand why they built it so close to the street, because it’s an eyesore,” says Voegle.\n\nShe says there have been other unusual incidents at her workplace recently, including power surges.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s related [to the data center]. It’s probably almost weekly that we lose power and have to fully reboot everything. There was a couple of things we actually had to replace because [the power surge] fried it.”",

    "fullText": "Pledge to invest billions in UK paused, with Washington citing lack of progress on trade barriers across pond\n\nThe US has paused its promised multi-billion-pound investment into British tech over trade disagreements, marking a serious setback in US-UK relations.\n\nThe £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, hailed by Keir Starmer as “a generational stepchange in our relationship with the US” when it was announced during Donald Trump’s state visit, has been put on ice by Washington.\n\nAs part of the deal, US tech companies pledged to spend billions in the UK, including a £22bn investment from Microsoft and £5bn from Google. But Washington has paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nBritish officials sought to downplay the development, which was first reported by the New York Times. The newspaper said Trump’s administration was unhappy about the UK continuing to levy a digital services tax on American tech companies and its food safety rules, which bar the export of certain agricultural products.\n\nOne British government source said it was “the usual bit of hardball negotiations by the Americans” and said that the deal to allow tariff-free British pharmaceutical exports to the US was on and off before it was finalised.\n\n“[The US commerce secretary] Howard Lutnick is a tough guy. We understand that the Americans negotiate incredibly hard but we’ll stand our ground. They want what’s best for their country, we want what’s best for ours,” the source said.\n\nA second government source said the development was “part of the shape of the negotiations” with Washington.\n\nThe prosperity deal included the creation of an artificial intelligence “growth zone” in the north-east of England, which UK officials said could bring in up to £30bn and create 5,000 jobs.\n\nBut the text of the agreement stated that it only “becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement” it.\n\nThe decision to put it on hold is a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president.\n\nStarmer has resisted US pressure to scrap or amend the digital services tax, a 2% levy on the revenues of tech companies including Amazon, Google and Apple that raises about £800m a year. Trump has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against countries with digital taxes, including the UK.\n\nThe Guardian revealed that during trade negotiations in the spring, the government drew up proposals to reduce the amount paid by US tech companies and by applying the tax to a wider range of companies without reducing its total take. But so far the tax has remained unchanged.\n\nThe US has also exerted pressure over the UK’s online safety rules, with officials promising to review their enforcement during the talks.\n\nA third area of contention has been the UK’s food safety regime, with ministers admitting that the US has raised objections to it. As part of the trade deal the government agreed to lower tariffs on some US agricultural products including beef, but it has stood by its manifesto commitment not to water down farming standards.\n\nAny decision to weaken these could open the door to American chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef being sold in Britain, a prospect that has long been highly controversial with farmers and consumer groups.\n\nAt a press conference at Chequers in September, where he unveiled the tech prosperity deal, Starmer said it had “the power to change lives” and “renewed the special relationship for a new era”.\n\n“It’s our chance to ensure that technologies like AI, quantum and others amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer, strengthen democracy not tyranny,” the prime minister said. “This is the territory on which the future will be won.”\n\nTrump at the time said the deal would help the US and UK “dominate” in the world of artificial intelligence and “ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side”.\n\nPeter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, was in the US last week for negotiations with Lutnick, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Their discussions touched on whisky and steel tariffs and collaboration on critical minerals. Kyle’s department said talks were due to continue in January.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hard-working people in both countries.”\n\nThe Guardian reported at the weekend that Starmer was poised to choose his new ambassador to Washington after interviewing the three finalists last week. The three shortlisted candidates are the prime minister’s business adviser, Varun Chandra, who was central to negotiating the prosperity deal; Christian Turner, the incoming ambassador to the UN; and Nigel Casey, the ambassador to Russia.",

    "description": "Interpretation of numerous MRI data may be incorrect: blood flow is not a reliable indicator of brain activity.",
    "fullText": "40 percent of MRI signals do not correspond to actual brain activity\n\nFor almost three decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been one of the main tools in brain research. Yet a new study published in the renowned journal Nature Neuroscience fundamentally challenges the way fMRI data have so far been interpreted with regard to neuronal activity. According to the findings, there is no generally valid coupling between the oxygen content measured by MRI and neuronal activity.\n\nResearchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) found that an increased fMRI signal is associated with reduced brain activity in around 40 percent of cases. At the same time, they observed decreased fMRI signals in regions with elevated activity. First author Dr. Samira Epp emphasizes: “This contradicts the long-standing assumption that increased brain activity is always accompanied by an increased blood flow to meet higher oxygen demand. Since tens of thousands of fMRI studies worldwide are based on this assumption, our results could lead to opposite interpretations in many of them.”\n\nPD Dr. Valentin Riedl, now Professor at FAU, and his colleague Epp examined more than 40 healthy participants during their time at TUM. Each was given several experimental tasks – such as mental arithmetic or autobiographical memory recall – which are known to produce predictable fMRI signal changes in distributed brain regions. During these experiments, the researchers simultaneously measured the actual oxygen consumption using a novel quantitative MRI technique.\n\n Depending on the task and the brain region, the physiological results varied. Increased oxygen consumption – for instance in areas involved in calculation – did not coincide with the expected rise in blood flow. Instead, the quantitative analyses showed that these regions met their additional energy demand by extracting more oxygen from the unchanged blood supply. Thus, they used the oxygen available in the blood more efficiently without requiring greater perfusion.\n\nAccording to Riedl, these insights also affect the interpretation of research findings in brain disorders: “Many fMRI studies on psychiatric or neurological diseases – from depression to Alzheimer’s – interpret changes in blood flow as a reliable signal of neuronal under- or over-activation. Given the limited validity of such measurements, this must now be reassessed. Especially in patient groups with vascular changes – for instance due to aging or vascular disease – the measured values may primarily reflect vascular differences rather than neuronal deficits.” Previous animal studies already point in this direction.\n\n The researchers therefore propose complementing the conventional MRI approach with quantitative measurements. In the long term, this combination could form the basis for energy-based brain models: rather than showing activation maps that depend on assumptions about blood flow, future analyses could display values indicating how much oxygen – and therefore energy – is actually consumed for information processing. This opens new perspectives for examining aging, psychiatric, or neurodegenerative diseases in terms of absolute changes in energy metabolism – and for understanding them more accurately.\n\nSamira M.

    "description": "Their influence and momentum offer a window into the future Fortune 500 corner office.",
    "fullText": "Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter.\n\nThe CEO role is being remade in real time. A collision of geopolitical instability, economic volatility, investor pressure, and rapid technological advancement has permanently altered what it takes to lead a Fortune 500 company.\n\nThe velocity of change alone, says Constantine Alexandrakis, CEO of Russell Reynolds Associates, is unlike anything he has seen in his nearly twenty years at the executive recruitment firm. “Our clients are moving at a frenetic pace,” he says. “Every company is driving transformation to either meet the moment or take advantage of it.” The issues aren’t new—trade, geopolitics, technology—but the intensity and overlap are. “The convergence of all these forces has made transformation ubiquitous and urgent,” Alexandrakis says.\n\nThis shifting reality is reflected in the second Fortune Next to Lead list, published this morning, which spotlights 25 influential executives inside the Fortune 500 whose track records and ascent signal they’re credible, near-term contenders for a CEO seat, regardless of whether they’re actually seeking it. Some are operating just one level below the top job; others are reshaping entire divisions or industries. Collectively, they embody what CEO readiness now requires.\n\nThat readiness looks markedly different from what it once did. A decade ago, companies sought deep industry experience, strong financial performance, and the ability to lead change. Those capabilities remain indispensable—boards still expect leaders to generate growth and deliver strong financial results—but there is now an added expectation that CEO candidates can drive transformation.\n\n“A CEO may not be a technologist,” Alexandrakis says, “but they must understand the levers to pull to use technology to drive change.”\n\nBoards want CEOs who can “speak the language,” even as they recognize that technological revolutions rarely unfold at the pace of their hype cycles. Still, Alexandrakis notes that CEOs are now spending far more time in sustained discussions with their chief technologists and, crucially, with their full leadership teams about technology’s role across the business. AI, in particular, is pushing CEOs into a leadership model defined by judgment, adaptability, and orchestration.\n\nEqually important, the next generation of CEOs will not succeed as lone architects of transformation. Alexandrakis describes a recent CEO transition at a large company reinventing its value proposition. Instead of directing the effort from the top, the CEO prioritized empowering each member of his leadership team to own a critical piece of it. Those leaders, not the CEO, became the public faces of the initiative. “They created a change ecosystem rather than a change-agent model,” he says.\n\nDespite the moment’s complexity, Alexandrakis rejects the idea of a return to command-and-control leadership. CEOs are engaging more deeply on issues, especially technology, to signal urgency and model the commitment required from their teams. This shift is also redefining which roles become pathways to the corner office. While CFOs, COOs, and division presidents still dominate, AI is subtly elevating leaders such as CMOs and chief people officers who can harness it to reshape productivity, customer experience, or workforce strategy. Kraft Heinz’s chief growth officer, who made this year’s list, exemplifies this shift.\n\nCross-disciplinary experience is also rising in value. Boards want leaders who know their industry inside out but who have absorbed and applied innovation models from adjacent sectors.\n\nThis evolving blend of skills signals a new reality for leaders rising through the ranks. The future Fortune 500 CEOs are technologically conversant, adaptive, and results-oriented. They orchestrate teams, ecosystems, and cultures rather than dictating from above. And they understand that being CEO-ready no longer means waiting for the corner office. Increasingly, it means performing at that altitude long before the title follows.\n\nRuth Umoh\nruth.umoh@fortune.com\n\nStealth stumbles. The silent, subtle mistakes that take executives out of the CEO race\n\nGraceful departures. Art of the exit: is there a right way for CEOs to quit?\n\nCalendar revolt. Meetings are not work, says Southwest Airlines CEO—so he blocks his calendar every afternoon from Wednesday to Friday\n\nCircle CEO Jeremy Allaire on the leadership benefits of his health journey : \"You can be a better person, connect and work better with people; you're more resilient, you can handle more stress, you can handle more complexity, you can be more attuned to people.”\n\nPresident Trump is weighing Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh for Fed chair, with a decision expected by Christmas or early next year. Here’s what to know about them. Fortune\n\nFord is axing the F-150 Lightning and other large EVs and taking a $19.5 billion write-down as it overhauls its electric-vehicle strategy. Fortune\n\nThe U.S. has offered Ukraine a security guarantee and will seek Senate backing for it, aiming to break the deadlock in peace talks. WSJ\n\nBig Tech is offloading the costs and risks of AI data centers onto outside partners, shifting much of the AI  boom’s burden to eager upstarts. NYT\n\nMeta’s push for speed and efficiency has accelerated innovation but also ignited internal turmoil, from AI-team clashes to morale damage after layoffs. BI\n\nPresident Trump filed a $5 billion defamation suit against the BBC, alleging a documentary falsely portrayed him and sought to sway the 2024 election. BBC\n\nKraft Heinz has named Steve Cahillane as its new CEO ahead of the company’s planned split. WSJ",

    "description": "An upgraded Gemini 2.5 Native Audio model across Google products and live speech translation in the Google Translate app.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this week, we introduced greater control over audio generation with an upgrade to our Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash Text-to-Speech models.\n\nBut generating expressive speech is only one side of the conversation. Today, we’re releasing an updated Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio for live voice agents. This update improves the model’s ability to handle complex workflows, navigate user instructions, and hold natural conversations.\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio is now available across Google products including Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and has also started rolling out in Gemini Live and Search Live, bringing the naturalness of native audio to Search Live for the first time. This means you can more effectively brainstorm live with Gemini, get real-time help in Search Live, or build the next generation of enterprise-ready customer service agents.\n\nBeyond powering helpful agents, native audio unlocks new possibilities for global communication. We’re introducing live speech translation, a capability that enables streaming speech-to-speech translation for headphones. It preserves the speaker’s intonation, pacing and pitch. This beta experience is rolling out in the Google Translate app starting today.\n\nTo enable the breadth of use cases across surfaces and products, we have improved Gemini 2.5 Native Audio in three key areas:\n\nThe updated Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio’s performance against previous versions and industry competitors on ComplexFuncBench\n\nGoogle Cloud customers are already using Gemini’s native audio capabilities to drive real business results, from mortgage processing to customer calls.\n\nGemini now natively supports new live speech-to-speech translation capabilities designed to handle both continuous listening and two-way conversation.\n\nWith continuous listening, Gemini automatically translates speech in multiple languages into a single target language. This allows you to put headphones in and hear the world around you in your language.\n\nFor two-way conversation, Gemini’s live speech translation handles translation between two languages in real-time, automatically switching the output language based on who is speaking. For example, if you speak English and want to chat with a Hindi speaker, you’ll hear English translations in real-time in your headphones, while your phone broadcasts Hindi when you’re done speaking.\n\nGemini’s live speech translation has a number of key capabilities that help in the real world:\n\nStarting today, you can try it in a new beta experience in the Google Translate app for real-time translation in your headphones by connecting them to your device and tapping “Live translate.” This experience is rolling out to all Android devices in the US, Mexico and India with support for iOS and more regions coming soon.\n\nBased on feedback, we will continue to iterate on this experience and bring it to more Google products including the Gemini API in 2026.\n\nStart building voice agents today with Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio, now generally available on Vertex AI and as preview in the Gemini API. Try it out in Google AI Studio.\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash and 2.5 Pro text-to-speech models are also available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio. Get started with the speech generation docs, explore the prompting guide, or check out the Gemini API Cookbook to get started.",

    "title": "A brief history of Times New Roman",
    "description": "Typography for Lawyers",
    "fullText": "Times New Ro­man gets its name from the Times of Lon­don, the British news­pa­per. In 1929, the Times hired ty­pog­ra­pher Stan­ley Mori­son to cre­ate a new text font. Mori­son led the project, su­per­vis­ing Vic­tor Lar­dent, an ad­ver­tis­ing artist for the Times, who drew the letterforms.\n\nEven when new, Times New Ro­man had its crit­ics. In his ty­po­graphic mem­oir, A Tally of Types, Mori­son good-na­turedly imag­ined what William Mor­ris (re­spon­si­ble for the open­ing il­lus­tra­tion in page lay­out) might have said about it: “As a new face it should, by the grace of God and the art of man, have been broad and open, gen­er­ous and am­ple; in­stead, by the vice of Mam­mon and the mis­ery of the ma­chine, it is big­oted and nar­row, mean and puritan.”\n\nBe­cause it was used in a daily news­pa­per, the new font quickly be­came pop­u­lar among print­ers of the day. In the decades since, type­set­ting de­vices have evolved, but Times New Ro­man has al­ways been one of the first fonts avail­able for each new de­vice (in­clud­ing per­sonal com­put­ers). This, in turn, has only in­creased its reach.\n\nOb­jec­tively, there’s noth­ing wrong with Times New Ro­man. It was de­signed for a news­pa­per, so it’s a bit nar­rower than most text fonts—es­pe­cially the bold style. (News­pa­pers pre­fer nar­row fonts be­cause they fit more text per line.) The italic is mediocre. But those aren’t fa­tal flaws. Times New Ro­man is a work­horse font that’s been suc­cess­ful for a reason.\n\nYet it’s an open ques­tion whether its longevity is at­trib­ut­able to its qual­ity or merely its ubiq­uity. Hel­vetica still in­spires enough af­fec­tion to have been the sub­ject of a 2007 doc­u­men­tary fea­ture. Times New Ro­man, mean­while, has not at­tracted sim­i­lar acts of homage.\n\nWhy not? Fame has a dark side. When Times New Ro­man ap­pears in a book, doc­u­ment, or ad­ver­tise­ment, it con­notes ap­a­thy. It says, “I sub­mit­ted to the font of least re­sis­tance.” Times New Ro­man is not a font choice so much as the ab­sence of a font choice, like the black­ness of deep space is not a color. To look at Times New Ro­man is to gaze into the void.\n\nThis is how Times New Ro­man ac­crued its rep­u­ta­tion as the de­fault font of the le­gal pro­fes­sion—it’s the de­fault font of every­thing. As a re­sult, many law­yers er­ro­neously as­sume that courts de­mand 12-point Times New Ro­man. In fact, I’ve never found one that does. (But there is one no­table court that for­bids it—see court opin­ions.) In gen­eral, law­yers keep us­ing it not be­cause they must, but be­cause it’s fa­mil­iar and en­trenched—much like those ob­so­lete type­writer habits.\n\nIf you have a choice about us­ing Times New Ro­man, please stop. You have plenty of bet­ter al­ter­na­tives—whether it’s a dif­fer­ent sys­tem font or one of the many pro­fes­sional fonts shown in this chapter.",

    "description": "Ford is scaling back its large electric vehicle production and prioritizing hybrid vehicles, a move that is expected to cost nearly $20 billion.",
    "fullText": "Ford is switching gears, away from some electric vehicles.\n\nIn a news release on Monday, the company announced several changes to its EV production, saying it is deprioritizing fully electric large vehicles, which were not making it money.\n\n\"Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,\" Ford said in the release.\n\nThe company also plans to stop the production of electric commercial vans it had planned to release in the US and Europe.\n\nInstead, it's boosting its hybrid car pipeline.\n\n\"By 2030, about 50% of Ford's global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and electric vehicles, versus 17% today,\" the company added.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in a Monday Bloomberg interview: \"It was really the customer changing their decision.\"\n\nFarley said that in November, Ford saw a 30% increase in its hybrid sales. On the flipside, it saw a slump in its more expensive EVs, while its more affordable EVs performed better.\n\n\"The EV market in the US went from 12% of the industry to only five, and that really, in the end, was the big decider for us,\" he said to Bloomberg.\n\nInstead of large EVs, the company said it will produce a \"high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable electric vehicles,\" starting with a midsize pickup truck in 2027.\n\nFord estimates that changing EV production plans is going to cost the company about $19.5 billion. The company said it will take a majority of the hit this quarter.\n\nFord's stock price remained largely flat after the announcement. It's up about 38% since the start of the year.\n\nThe Trump administration has rolled back incentives that boosted the EV sector, such as ending the $7,500 tax credit for EVs in September.\n\nThe change in Ford's EV plans comes less than two months after the company announced in October that it would double down on its F-150 pickup truck production. The company said that it wanted to increase production of the F-150s by 50,000 units in 2026, and would move some of its EV workers over to meet this goal.\n\nFord also said that it would pause the production of the F-150 Lightning — the electric counterpart of its bestseller truck — to prioritize gas and hybrid vehicle production.",

    "description": "Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said that reframing stress as positive can have a \"huge impact on your ability to manage it.\"",
    "fullText": "Some call stress the silent killer. Evan Spiegel likes to reframe it as a gift and opportunity.\n\nThe Snap CEO has been in his fair share of stressful situations. He led Snapchat from its founding through a 2013 acquisition offer from Meta (he ended up rejecting it) and a 2017 IPO.\n\nOn the \"Grit\" podcast, Spiegel explained that he has come to take a more positive view of stress.\n\n\"How do we approach stress in our minds?\" Spiegel asked. \"Do we call it out as stress and something that's bad, or do we say, 'Actually, this is a gift, this is a learning opportunity, this is a growth opportunity.'\"\n\nSpiegel referenced research that suggested reframing stress as positive can have a \"huge impact on your ability to manage it.\"\n\nStanford's Kelly McGonigal has led this line of research, publishing her book \"The Upside of Stress\" in 2015 about \"getting good at\" the condition.\n\nA high-intensity job like the CEO of Snap isn't for the faint of heart. In September, Spiegel wrote in a letter to employees that company would restructure into smaller, startup-like \"squads\" as it faced a \"crucible moment.\"\n\nSpiegel said that being CEO for a long time made him \"better at managing\" the stress.\n\n\"Once you're just in a rhythm of dealing with stressful events all the time, it becomes very normal, and stress is about a response to something unusual,\" he said.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the job had a different psychological effect: anxiety. On a recent episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" Huang said that he was driven by a \"fear of failure.\"\n\n\"I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,\" Huang said, adding that he's \"always in a state of anxiety.\"\n\nDustin Moskovitz, the Facebook cofounder and former CEO of Asana, told Stratechery that he found the top leadership gig \"exhausting.\"\n\n\"I had to just kind of put on this face day after day, and then in the beginning I was like, 'Oh, it's going to get easier, the company will get more mature,'\" Moskovitz said. \"Then the world just kept getting more chaotic.\"\n\nFor Spiegel, stress isn't just a response to reconsider; it's a part of his job description. On the podcast, he said that part of his role was absorbing the team's stress — and not unloading it on the people around him.\n\n\"I've tried to find my own ways, whether that's exercising or going in the sauna or just taking time to meditate,\" he said. \"But, in my family and in my job, I want to absorb that stress, right? I don't want to unload that onto people that I care about, whether that's our team or family or my wife.\"",

    "description": "The Oaktree cofounder sees echoes of past bubbles in the current AI frenzy and urged investors to focus on durable, profitable tech giants.",
    "fullText": "Legendary investor Howard Marks has seen enough manias to know when a bubble is brewing.\n\nOn the \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast last Saturday, the billionaire and cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management said he is alarmed by how many investors are piling into speculative startups in hopes of landing the next trillion-dollar winner.\n\n\"Do you want to have a novel entrepreneurial startup pure play which has no revenues and no profits today, but could be a moonshot if it works?\" he asked.\n\n\"Or do you want to invest in a great tech company, which is already existing and making a lot of money where AI could be incremental but not life-changing? It's a choice.\"\n\nToo many investors, he said, are treating AI like a lottery where the slim chance of a jackpot overshadows the far greater likelihood of failure.\n\n\"People say, 'Well, they have a low probability of success, but maybe a big payoff, so I should buy it.' That's what I call lottery-ticket mentality,\" he said.\n\nMarks has been sounding this warning for months.\n\nIn a 2023 conversation with financial historian Edward Chancellor on Oaktree's \"Behind the Memo\" series, he put it bluntly: \"AI will change the world,\" he said, predicting that most of the companies that people are investing in today for AI purposes \"will end up worthless.\"\n\nOn the \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast, Marks said he sees echoes of the dot-com era: a groundbreaking technology, sky-high expectations, and a growing assumption that early movers will inevitably dominate.\n\n\"Most bubbles are around something new,\" he said, pointing to the growth-stock boom of 1969, the subprime-mortgage mania of 2006, the dot-com bubble in 1999, the 1720 South Sea Bubble, and even the Tulip Craze of 1636 in the Netherlands.\n\nSuch moments, he added, arise because \"the imagination is untrammelled, and it can go off in a flight of fancy.\"\n\nIn reality, he said, most early-stage companies don't survive the transition from promise to profitability.\n\n\"On the AI, I'm led to believe that you can make binary bets in companies that have nothing else going on, which will be sink-or-swim bets, or you can invest in pre-existing great tech companies, which will get moderate benefits from AI if they're successful.\"\n\nRather than gamble on moonshots, Marks said he'd rather own stocks in established tech titans that are already generating profits — companies that can integrate AI as an incremental advantage rather than a life-or-death proposition.\n\nHe contrasted those firms with the fragile AI startups drawing hype, saying that Big Tech is positioned to reap some benefits from AI, even if the technology rolls out more slowly or unevenly than hoped.\n\nBut a breakthrough in productivity doesn't automatically translate into investment gains.\n\n\"Change the world and investors making money are not the same thing.\"\n\nMarks echoed a warning Warren Buffett issued at Berkshire Hathaway's 2000 annual meeting, when Buffett warned that the internet stock mania had detached valuations from underlying profit potential — a mistake he believes investors are repeating with AI.\n\n\"I think the same is true of AI,\" he said.",

    "description": "Companies like AT&T, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Instagram have a RTO problem: there's not enough places for workers to sit.",
    "fullText": "Your mileage may vary on Instagram's recent corporate culture updates (to the extent you care at all). Fewer meetings: excellent. Faster decisions: great. Return-to-office five days a week: woof, but such is life. Return-to-office five days a week when there aren't enough places for people to sit: What??? At least Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is aware of the issue — in a memo to staff, he said New York employees get a pass on the butts-in-seats mandate until the company figures out where all those butts will go. The timeline is TBD.\n\nAfter the pandemic-driven wave of remote work, many employees are being dragged, kicking and screaming, back into the office. For workers at companies such as Amazon, JPMorgan, and Starbucks, the perpetual workday-in-your-pajamas party is over. The odd wrinkle is that in some cases, it's not just employees who aren't ready to be back at work every day. Their employers aren't ready for it, either, at least logistically. They're telling people to come to the office without having the actual space for them to be there. So, workers are competing for desks, setting up shop in common areas, or refusing to show up altogether until their employers have a more well-thought-out plan. It's emblematic of the broader issues surrounding RTO mandates: Many companies are implementing them without a solid logic as to how or why and alienating their employees — intentionally or not — in the process.\n\nMultiple big-name companies have had some small-time whoopsie daisies on back-to-office space constraints.\n\nIn late 2024, AT&T acknowledged in a memo to employees that they would not offer \"one-for-one seating per employee\" as they were called back in. At the time, employees told Business Insider that workers were filling up hallways or hanging out in the cafeteria in order to check the attendance box. Around the same time, Amazon wound up delaying its RTO ask for some employees because their spots weren't ready. Not only were there not enough desks, but workers also complained that offices and meeting rooms were lacking in chairs.\n\nEarlier this year, JPMorgan employees required to come back found themselves in a sort of Hunger Games situation for spots, showing up extra early and leaving behind possessions to mark their spots and signing on from vacation to try to book scarce desk space. On Reddit, some employees described the situation as \"pure chaos,\" and complained of being unable to accomplish work because \"half the morning is spent on desk f***ery.\" One JPMorgan employee told me that they often find themselves seated far away from the rest of their team because someone else reserved their regular spot, and there are often lines for the women's bathroom at the New York office where they work.\n\nHow much office space is needed and what to do with it is a perpetual conundrum. Just look at all the hate for open-office floor plans. But the pandemic added more complications to an already complicated situation. As the RTO wave has picked up momentum, space has become a significant issue at many companies, both large and small, including giant federal agencies. So what gives?\n\nSome of it is simply a result of poor planning, explains Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Decisions are made at the executive level without proper consultation with facilities personnel, who have detailed information on desks and seating. \"It's not as easy as adding up people and comparing to desks, as it matters which cities and offices they are in,\" he says in an email. \"Kind of like airlines that some flights may be overbooked and others half-empty.\"\n\nSome of the shortages may be on purpose. Strict RTO mandates are often viewed, at least in part, as a soft layoff — companies expect some level of attrition when they force people back, even if they won't openly admit it. \"Having insufficient seating is all part of the plan,\" Bloom says. \"If you want a 10% head count reduction, you only need seating for 90% of the folks.\"\n\nBrian Elliott, the CEO of Work Forward, a future of work think tank and consultancy, says that when executives started to think about bringing people back to the office in about 2021, many were surprised to learn how low the percentage of their workforce actually showing up on a given day had been pre-2020, because of sick time, vacations, workers visiting customers, etc. \"So your average CFO looks at this and goes, 'It's a 60% utilized asset on average. Why am I doing assigned seating? Why not go to hoteling and hot desking?'\" Elliott says. Add in the belief that at least some sort of remote work would stick around (especially as companies offered it as a perk to attract workers in a tight labor market), and many companies decided to downsize their overall office footprint to save some cash. Now, as businesses decide they want everyone back in full-time, they're realizing they axed too many desks.\n\nSome companies are moving in the other direction, and are on the hunt for more spacious offices. But that process takes time, and economic uncertainty has leaders nervous to go too big. Commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE says economic jitters, high interest rates, and slow growth in in-person jobs has been somewhat of a drag on office leasing activity this year, but the overall trend is up: A growing majority of its office occupants expect to maintain or expand their space over the next three years, while the share anticipating downsizing is steadily decreasing.\n\n\"Companies are taking more spaces, so clearly, they are very comfortable in expansionary mode,\" says Henry Chin, global head of research at CBRE.\n\nThat doesn't mean employees should expect to be drowning in spacious offices anytime soon — businesses are driving toward higher people-to-desk ratios, not lower. So instead of a single assigned desk for every person, there are multiple people sharing. Per CBRE, the most common ratio today is 1-1.49 employees per seat, and the plan is to up it. \"Ultimately, they want to have the higher ratio, that two or three people share a desk,\" Chin says.\n\nIn other words, however you feel about hotel desking, you might want to get used to it.\n\nThe RTO battle in America is proving to be quite the push-and-pull. Remote work is falling, but it hasn't gone away: According to Bloom's tracker, about 25% of work is being done from home in the US, compared to 62% in the spring of 2020, the height of the pandemic, and well under 10% prior to the lockdowns. And just because companies ask workers to come back doesn't mean they're all complying — there's a delta between what employers are asking, and employees are giving, RTO-wise. As the job market weakens, employees may be inclined to give in and commute more. You want your boss to see you enough that they at least feel a little guilty when they fire you.\n\nThese space-related headaches are reflective of broader questions about where and how it's best for people to work, and what sort of planning needs to be put into it. Some executives seem to be knee-jerk demanding people come back in without considering whether that's how their teams work best, or whether the infrastructure can handle it. A five-day-a-week office mandate isn't super helpful if teams are located all over the country and everyone's just sitting on video calls all day. Some companies are discovering they need more small meeting rooms, not just a few large ones, so people can gather if they are in the same place. And some are falling short on basic blocking and tackling — having working WiFi, or supplying sufficient monitors and equipment. In the internet age, it's a little tough to get work done when you don't have the internet itself, or a keyboard or a mouse.\n\nEmployers may be \"conflating productivity and effectiveness with proximity\" in insisting people show up full-time, explains Melissa Daimler, a corporate culture consultant. \"If I can see you and I know that you're working, then I feel good about how productive we are as a company.\" Much of the issue comes down to trust — businesses feeling confident that their people will get the work done when they're in the office collaborating and when they're at home for the day. \"It takes an extra kind of set of planning skills and a system that you put in place as a company and a team,\" she says.\n\nThe space problem is one that companies should fix, whether they actually will is another question. Your employees aren't going to love the return of long commutes and sad salad desk lunches, whatever you do, but they're probably going to be even more annoyed if, at the end of that commute, they find themselves eating that sad salad on the floor in the hallway, seated next to their laptop.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "title": "I developed AI at IBM. Here's how to not become intellectually dependent on tools.",
    "description": "Sol Rashidi worked in the AI space for 15 years, and said it's important to make a conscious effort not to outsource your thinking.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sol Rashidi, a former tech executive at IBM, AWS, and Estée Lauder, who is based in Miami. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the last 15 years, I have built and scaled AI capabilities, and I have over 200 deployments under my belt.\n\nI went from being an individual practitioner to running IBM's enterprise data management practice. I was the chief data officer at Sony Music, the chief analytics officer at Estée Lauder, and the head of technology for AWS's startup division in North America.\n\nAll my experiences from 2011 on have led me to realize there's a real chance people will develop a codependency on AI. So I'm focused on workforce preparation and educating the masses.\n\nNow I have my own company where I'm working on solving the problem of AI in the workforce by teaching enterprises how to prepare their workforce for the future, and how to use AI and automation to amplify the workforce instead of eliminating it. If you're going to use AI in your day-to-day, great — but you have to be conscientious, to outsource tasks and not your critical thinking. You need to avoid intellectual atrophy.\n\nIntellectual atrophy is when you lose your cognitive ability to think critically because you're outsourcing that thinking to tech. Just like our muscles atrophy if we don't use them, so does our brain. The big thing that you've got to be careful of is making sure that generative AI doesn't make your thinking become generic, because everyone else is also using ChatGPT. You maintain your edge by using cognitive power.\n\nAs an individual, I use six to eight AI tools every day. I use AI a lot for data processing, so I can think about the patterns and insights and, from there, observe and spotlight frameworks and models.\n\nBut when using the tools, I always ask myself, \"Am I using this to accelerate work I have to do, or am I using it to do the work for me?\" It needs to accelerate the work so that the thinking is left to me. \"This is making me faster, but is it making me more capable? This is making me more productive, but is this making me more valuable?\" I use the tools to expedite and facilitate versus doing the work for me.\n\nPart of what I do is communication, and I don't ever want to lose that edge. I don't use AI to write emails, keynotes, or personal interactions.\n\nIt's really important for me to be able to understand whether or not what I'm communicating is being perceived in the way I intended. That takes practice. Anything that comes from the heart or mind has to be sincere, expressive, and communicate the right messaging. It has to be organically generated by me — no exceptions.\n\nWe live in a society right now that values convenience over competition and speed over substance. But the key to keeping up is actually slowing down, because there is no shortage of information coming to us. We're ingesting so many gigabytes of data every day through WhatsApp, Slack, email, LinkedIn, and Instagram. The way we used to handle the workload of the past cannot be replicated to handle the speed of today.\n\nSo we have to develop our discernment muscles, which is the ability to spot a signal from noise. A large percentage of content worldwide right now is AI-generated, and we have AI-generated content that is being cannibalized to retrain itself.\n\nMoving forward, we're going to get to the point of diminishing return. Problem-solving skills are going to be so important, and it will be super important to discern, validate, and verify AI responses. You can use AI to author the first draft, but maybe don't copy and paste the output because it's often inaccurate. Think of it as a first draft always.\n\nThe last team that I managed was a data science team at a Fortune 500 company. I tasked my junior and senior data scientists to come up with an approach for the CMO for a new product. My junior scientist produced the same deliverable as the senior scientists but it took them less than half the time because they took the word of ChatGPT.\n\nIt sounded great, but they short-circuited the process of research and verification, so I had to make a new mandate that they cannot use AI to do the work for them, but only to help facilitate and accelerate the research.\n\nI told my junior scientists and anyone highly codependent on AI, \"I'm paying for your brain and uniqueness. I'm not paying you to copy and paste, because, quite frankly, a license for enterprise API from OpenAI is a lot cheaper than you.\"\n\nIt's so easy to ask ChatGPT a question and get an answer that sounds really good. But if you don't use critical thinking and depend on yourself to solve problems, you could be outdated within a few years.\n\nHow is AI affecting your work?

    "fullText": "Copper prices have exploded to record highs again, not because the world is running out of the metal, but in part because the United States is scooping up so much of it that everyone else is scrambling for what's left.\n\nBenchmark three-month copper hit an all-time high of $11,952 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange on Friday. It's now trading around $11,655 per ton, up roughly 33% so far this year.\n\nThe US has been aggressively stockpiling metal ahead of potential tariffs, pulling huge volumes out of the tradable global system and tightening supplies everywhere else.\n\n\"US inventory is effectively 'trapped',\" analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a report on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the global copper market is expected to post a 300,000-ton surplus next year.\n\nThe latest copper price surge caps a volatile year for the red metal used in construction, electrical grids, and electronics.\n\nEarly this year, traders rushed copper into the US in anticipation of President Donald Trump's steep import tariffs.\n\nBut months later, the administration unexpectedly excluded refined copper from those duties, leaving importers sitting on piles of metal.\n\nEven so, the market isn't convinced the reprieve will last.\n\nGoldman's analysts wrote that they now expect the White House to announce a refined copper tariff in the first half of 2026 for implementation in 2027. Such a delay would likely encourage further US stockpiling, as expectations of future tariffs keep domestic buyers pulling copper out of the global market.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world faces a growing supply squeeze, with Goldman expecting a 450,000-ton deficit next year.\n\nFurthermore, the world's copper supply has been rattled by real disruptions.\n\nProduction setbacks at big miners in Indonesia, Congo, and Chile have squeezed output in recent months.\n\nThat dynamic has helped drive high copper premiums across the rest of the world.\n\n\"Producers plan to impose record premiums on European and Asian customers next year, effectively compensating for profits they could earn selling to the US,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, last week.\n\nAdding to the upside pressure, speculation has flooded the market as traders are piling into positions tied to AI infrastructure and energy transition themes, treating the metal almost like a tech-linked asset.\n\nInvestors are piling into bets linked to data-center construction — a speculative trend Goldman's analysts warn has left prices open to a sharp reversal.\n\nThat makes copper vulnerable to any wobble in AI stocks, particularly if the hype around data center buildouts fades.\n\n\"The copper price rally in December is becoming highly speculative, which makes it vulnerable to a rapid reversal,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman's copper price forecast for 2026 is $11,400 per ton — lower than current levels.",

    "description": "Adtech company Fluency uses automation, and now AI agents, to run digital ad campaigns across the web, Meta, Google, TikTok, and more.",
    "fullText": "Adtech company Fluency has built a platform that helps brands and agencies automate their campaigns across Meta, TikTok, Google, and other platforms. Now, it aims to introduce AI agents to the mix.\n\nLarge brands and agencies typically manage campaigns across multiple platforms and ad buying tools, known as demand-side platforms, each with separate logins and interfaces.\n\nFounded in 2017 in Burlington, Vermont, Fluency created what it describes as a digital advertising operating system. It connects to the various platforms' application programming interfaces (APIs) and lets its customers manage their digital ads using a single workflow.\n\n\"It takes a lot of people, and hours, and button clicking to be able to effectively execute your advertising,\" Fluency CEO Mike Lane said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nHe added that Fluency wanted to \"help simplify and streamline that, much like HubSpot or Salesforce\" did in the customer relationship management (CRM) space. Fluency's competitor set includes other campaign management and ad automation tools, such as Hootsuite, Smartly, and Sprinklr, though these companies tend to cater to larger advertisers and agencies.\n\nThe company said it manages around $3 billion in annual ad spend for brands and agencies, including Cox Automotive, Innocean, and The Johnson Group.\n\nFluency is set to announce on Tuesday that it has raised a $40 million Series A investment round, led and fully funded by Integrity Growth Partners.\n\nFluency said it plans to invest the funds in enhancing its agentic AI capabilities, which can autonomously oversee marketers' digital ad campaigns. This could mean AI agents automatically swapping out ad creatives or copy with better-performing versions, for example.\n\nFluency mostly uses Amazon's Bedrock generative AI models, as well as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, the company said.\n\nLane said that for agentic AI to work effectively for a marketer's digital advertising, the AI needs robust frameworks and structures to operate within, connections to all major media platforms, and for everything to be integrated into a single system.\n\nHe said these factors make Fluency well-positioned to be \"the premium platform for agentic\" AI in the digital ads space.\n\nCheck out the pitch deck Fluency used to secure its $40 million Series A investment, shared exclusively with Business Insider. Some of the slides have been omitted or redacted.\n\nFluency says marketers often use \"point solutions\" that don't interact with each other, which can also bring in issues around compliance and performance.\n\nFluency says ad strategists often have to cobble together several different tech solutions to handle tasks like targeting or reviewing campaign performance.\n\nFluency's platform aims to address these concerns as a kind of \"one-stop shop\" across various channels.\n\nThose attributes include a blue-chip client base and high customer-retention rates.\n\nThere's been a shift in budgets from big agency holding companies to independent agencies, though smaller firms have constrained resources, Fluency says.\n\nFluency says its \"serviceable addressable market\" is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11%, reaching $6.4 billion by 2028.\n\nFluency says its platform serves agencies and brands better than agency-developed tech, in-house channel management, legacy omni-channel tools, and point solutions.\n\nThe slide showcases how the Fluency platform integrates a marketer's own data, big media platforms, and DSPs using AI automation to manage campaigns and assess their performance.\n\nFluency says its tools can save customers time, improve ad performance, and boost their revenue.",

    "fullText": "What are the biggest themes investors are watching right now?\n\nThat's a question Morgan Stanley sought to answer at its first Thematics Conference earlier this month. The bank hosted business leaders from various industries to talk about key long-term economic drivers and compiled some of the key takeaways in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nHere are four of the biggest trends the bank highlighted.\n\nIt's hard to ignore how dominant a force the AI capex cycle has been in markets. However, if the energy needs of datacenters outpace supply, the AI trade could face some roadblocks ahead.\n\n\"We believe investors may be under-appreciating the challenges to providing high-quality power to data centers,\" the bank said in the report.\n\nThat's why the energy build-out trade could be one of the next AI plays to watch.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) and Solaris Energy (SEI) are \"well-positioned to capitalize on this trend,\" Morgan Stanley said.\n\nPeople are living and working longer, and that could be a trend that helps propel economic growth, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n\"Longevity is creating a large and under-recognized market opportunity as the 60+ population hold one-third of global buying power,\" the report said.\n\nThe bank added that older cohorts are becoming more tech-savvy and are spending more on lifestyle-driven products.\n\n\"Keeping older adults engaged in the workforce and consumer economy can help offset growth pressures from simultaneous retirements, while technology is narrowing the gap between lifespan and health-span and reshaping assumptions about aging's impact on productivity and consumption.\"\n\nThe bank said tokenization — which allows for assets to be digitalized and traded on a blockchain — promises to \"modernize the financial system plumbing and infrastructure.\"\n\n\"Tokenization allows recording ownership of almost any asset on digital ledgers that participants can independently verify. We see firms experimenting in the space, with asset mgrs launching digital money funds on blockchains, while some alternative asset mgrs are experimenting with distributing private market funds on blockchains,\" the bank said. \"While it remains early days, there's potential to further democratize private markets and expand use of borrowing.\"\n\nTokenization has already come to the stock market, and crypto bulls says it could revolutionize ownership of everything from real estate to commodities.\n\nWhile brain computer implants are still in their early stages, the industry will eventually be worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\n\"Patient demand is strong, evidenced by Neuralink's ~10,000- person waitlist, and success will ultimately be measured by hundreds of thousands of lives improved through safe, scalable, and wireless implant systems,\" the report said.\n\n\"This theme sits at the intersection of healthcare, AI, and advanced manufacturing, signaling a long-cycle growth opportunity with profound societal impact.\"",

    "title": "I founded Bala after a burnout recovery trip — but burned out again. Here's how I cope now.",
    "description": "Burnout recovery inspired Bala, but founder Natalie Holloway found lasting relief through lifestyle changes, self-kindness, and using a life coach.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Natalie Holloway, a 37-year-old cofounder of Bala, based in Los Angeles. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe first time I recognized I was experiencing burnout, my husband and I left our advertising jobs and traveled without any set plans. This trip got me out of the nonstop grind mindset I'd functioned in for too long.\n\nI came back to corporate work refreshed and inspired in October 2016. Our company, Bala, was supposed to be a side hustle, creating cute wrist and ankle weights inspired by our travels. We never imagined it would take off the way it did. I went full-time on Bala in 2019, and my husband joined in 2020.\n\nAfter building the business for five years, we had to lay off our entire team due to the post-COVID-19 fitness industry downturn. I felt immediate burnout knowing the work that was ahead of me, but this time, I couldn't take a year off to recover.\n\nHaving experienced burnout in multiple stages of my career, I now understand what it looks like, and I can navigate it effectively with the right tools and tactics.\n\nAfter college, I landed a job in advertising and fell in love with that career path. As my career progressed, I would often stay at the office late into the night and miss 9 p.m. dinner reservations. I felt creatively inspired by what I was doing, but the hours were so long that I began to wonder what the point was.\n\nMy husband, whom I had met at work and just started dating, suggested that we quit our jobs to recover and travel, and I said yes. We were both experiencing burnout, and I didn't even realize how bad it was until that moment.\n\nWe spent several months saving money and planning before leaving our jobs in March 2016.\n\nIt was so freeing to leave with no real plan, but also scary. We didn't have jobs, we didn't have an income, and our résumés were not being built. But we did finally have the mental space to slow down, look around, and feel inspired.\n\nOne day, we were taking a yoga class in Indonesia, and the class was too easy; we wanted to work up a sweat. After the class, my husband, Max, had the idea for wrist and ankle weights that look like cute bracelets. We decided to try creating them when we returned.\n\nThis trip taught me that detachment is what helps the most when I'm feeling burned out, and that's the easiest to achieve through time away from the source of my stress.\n\nWe got back and both got new jobs in advertising, but started working on Bala on the side. We never thought it would be our full-time jobs, but it started growing.\n\nOnce we were carried in stores and had enough orders coming in, we felt we couldn't keep up with both our corporate jobs and Bala. I left my advertising job first, and my husband followed a few months later.\n\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic happened, and the fitness industry experienced a surge in demand. However, after the pandemic, the fitness industry experienced a decline, and we had to lay off our entire staff.\n\nI was pregnant and felt like I didn't have enough stamina to take on the work of 30 people. It was a really demoralizing time, and the burnout hit me immediately because all of our hopes and dreams were on the line.\n\nI was determined not to let burnout destroy my health during my pregnancy. This time, I focused on and learned the value of how I speak to myself.\n\nDuring my second experience with burnout, I learned that giving myself a mantra helps ground my anxiety. Sometimes it's something like 'I'm calm, present, and have an abundance of time.' Repeating this helps when I'm feeling overwhelmed and burned out.\n\nI can't control when stress creeps in, but I can control how I talk myself through it because my head is my reality, and I'm trying to create a positive one.\n\nWhen we started rebuilding the business, my husband and I decided that no matter how long it took for the company to recover, we were determined to see it through to the end. We had to prepare for a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nWe've started regrowing our team back to its original size.\n\nI started working with a life coach, and that's really helped. They're helping me understand what's on my to-do list that aligns with my values, which will give me energy, and what doesn't align with my values, which will deplete my energy.\n\nAlthough we can't travel to cure burnout as we once did, I now take mini recovery trips, either for a weekend, a week, or a month, when I can. We sometimes visit Joshua Tree as a family to escape from LA, unwind, and mentally reset.\n\nWe also spend every July in Lakeside, Ohio. We don't make any plans. It's just our kids and us. We still do some work, but we're able to meaningfully downshift our lives in a way that recharges us.\n\nI always have my mantras going now, and I've learned how to feel comfortable being kind to myself. I realized that burnout is inevitable, but it's about how I handle it. I try to prevent it by reminding myself that I'm working toward the long game.",

    "description": "Archer, Beta, and Joby are developing autonomous, gas-electric hybrid air taxis in hopes of clinching defense contracts.",
    "fullText": "US tech companies are hoping soon to gain clearance for flying taxis that make short commercial hops like Manhattan to LaGuardia Airport. Eyeing defense dollars, they're also equipping air taxies for the battlefield.\n\nAir taxis have wings and propellers, allowing them to take off and land like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. You can't yet hail a flying taxi anywhere in the US, though those futuristic flights could be coming in the next couple of years.\n\nPentagon leaders have shifted their focus to the tech industry, arguing that traditional defense contractors can't deliver new weapons fast or cheaply enough to meet today's fast-changing global threats. The Pentagon has pledged to pour billions of dollars into new technology and has issued requests for information on hybrid, autonomous air taxis, also known as vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, or VTOLs.\n\nFlying-taxi makers including Archer Aviation, Joby Aviation, and Beta Technologies say that gas-electric hybrid vehicles reminiscent of \"The Jetsons\" could carry military cargo more cheaply and quietly than helicopters. Some of the designs under development for the battlefield incorporate autonomous technology that could detect and avoid threats. The aircraft could be used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or moving supplies and equipment, these companies say.\n\nAmerican air-taxi makers are racing to develop cutting-edge technology as Chinese companies like EHang do the same. The VTOL industry is still young, and China hasn't yet cornered the air-taxi market as it has for smaller, aerial combat drones.\n\n\"When we can fundamentally go further and faster than a helicopter, then we have a tool that's more powerful than what the Chinese are going to bring to the fight,\" said Beta's CEO, Kyle Clark.\n\nCommercial air-taxi designs are typically electric. Swapping the electric battery for a hybrid engine will help the aircraft carry more weight and travel farther, a key consideration for the Pentagon, executives from Joby and Beta told Business Insider.\n\nArcher, Joby, and Beta are all developing military VTOLs that can fly autonomously. In Beta's battlefield version, a human must plug in destination coordinates for the aircraft, and artificial intelligence can help it navigate to the destination, said Clark. Configuring the aircraft to operate without a pilot makes it lighter than a commercial air taxi, since it doesn't require seats or the safety and avionics systems that are necessary when transporting people, Clark added.\n\nClinching coveted contracts from the Pentagon would add air-taxi manufacturers to a growing list of dual-use companies that sell to commercial clients as well as to the government. Joby is collaborating with traditional defense firm L3Harris on a military VTOL and test-flew a prototype in November. Archer is developing one with Anduril Industries for the US, according to Archer's CEO, Adam Goldstein. Anduril is also developing a military VTOL called Omen in a joint venture with Emirati defense giant Edge Group.\n\nOne of the air-taxi makers' biggest hurdles to commercial adoption is securing Federal Aviation Administration certification, though the Trump administration is attempting to make it easier. In September, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an FAA program that permits VTOL companies to test-fly piloted and unmanned aircraft before receiving federal certification.\n\nJoby is leading the pack in the certification race, having cleared four of the five stages for commercial clearance. Archer and Joby hope to fly commercially as early as 2026.\n\nFor defense adoption in the US, the companies would need the Defense Department to deem their VTOLs ready to fly, Goldstein said.\n\nTaylor Rains contributed to this story.",

    "description": "Shiloh Luckey faces SEC charges for using VC funds to pay for her home, Super Bowl tickets, trips to Aspen, and a wedding. The FBI is also investigating.",
    "fullText": "Shiloh Luckey, founder and former CEO of ComplYant, a Los-Angeles-based tax-compliance startup that raised more than $13 million from top venture capitalists, is under federal criminal investigation for alleged securities and bank fraud, according to court filings.\n\nIn a civil complaint, the SEC has charged Luckey with violating securities laws for using millions of dollars of company funds to pay for her home, Super Bowl tickets, and a destination wedding in the Caribbean. The SEC alleges she painted a rosy picture of the company's booming revenue when ComplYant never brought in more than $620 in monthly revenue.\n\nReached by telephone, Luckey said, \"I don't have anything to offer you,\" and hung up.\n\nStartups face far less regulatory scrutiny than public companies, and founders sometimes present overly optimistic growth stories while VCs rush to fund hot companies with limited diligence. After high-profile scandals like Theranos and FTX, regulators have taken a tougher line.\n\n\"Startup founders cannot fake it until they make it by falsifying revenue metrics,\" SEC regional director Monique Winkler warned in a statement. Recent cases, including the seven-year prison sentence for Charlie Javice and fraud charges against Mozaic Payments' former CEO Marcus Cobb, show that regulators are increasingly willing to pursue criminal and civil penalties for these founders.\n\nLuckey, who formerly went by Shiloh Johnson, founded ComplYant in 2019 to help small businesses navigate the labyrinth of tax regulations from state to state. In 2022, the company closed a $5.5 million seed round led by Craft Ventures, the San Francisco venture firm cofounded by the investor and White House advisor David Sacks.\n\nA spokeswoman for Craft did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI and SEC declined to comment.\n\nLuckey hired more than 50 employees, and when ComplYant abruptly shut down last year, she severed contact with them. It took seven weeks for all employees to get their final paychecks and some discovered 401(k) contributions were missing, as Business Insider previously reported. Luckey was informed in April of this year that she was under federal criminal investigation by the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office for securities and bank fraud, according to a recent petition she filed to pause the civil case against her.\n\nIn that case, filed in October, the SEC alleges Luckey routinely misled investors.\n\n\"Luckey painted a rosy picture for investors of ComplYant's business performance, allegedly telling investors that ComplYant's monthly revenues had grown from around $2,500 in November 2020 to over $250,000 by September 2022, and that the company was bringing in dozens if not hundreds of new paying subscribers each month,\" the SEC said in a statement. \"However, ComplYant only generated on average monthly revenues of about $250 during roughly the same time period and averaged fewer than four new subscribers each month.\"\n\nLuckey also represented herself as a CPA, but there is no record of her ever having the accreditation, according to the complaint.\n\nThe SEC says she allegedly siphoned off $2.2 million for trips to Aspen, Miami Beach, Turks and Caicos, and Lisbon, and used the funds to pay for her Caribbean wedding, her car, and house.\n\nLuckey, who is representing herself in court, has not responded to the SEC allegations.\n\nSince ComplYant shut down last year, Luckey has continued to post instructional videos with advice for taxes and accounting on her TikTok channel with nearly 24,000 subscribers.\n\nIn October, records show, she launched a new startup called HabitLoop, which she describes as a digital financial assistant to help people manage their money.\n\n\"I grew up with very poor financial habits,\" Luckey said in a video introducing her latest company as inspired by a lifetime of spending beyond her means.\n\n\"This is something I built on hard lessons,\" she said.",

    "description": "JPMorgan's mid-cap chief explains how investment banking works beyond Wall Street, and why the middle market has become a billion-dollar opportunity.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan took a bet to build an investment banking machine outside Wall Street, and it tapped John Richert to do it.\n\nUnder Richert's watch, the business that serves founder-run companies with deep ties to their local economies has grown from four people to nearly 300 bankers, collectively generating more than $1 billion annually. After completing their junior analyst years — most often in New York — bankers on his team can relocate to any of the 13 offices the group operates across the country.\n\nIt's a model that challenges the traditional idea of investment banking as a strictly New York endeavor. What's far less visible is what it looks like to build and run a franchise in places like Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, or across the Southeast.\n\nMid-cap investment banking deals generally fall within the range of roughly $2 billion and below, with the group's sweet spot for deal transaction value of about $500 million to $1.5 billion. Under Richert, who serves as the team's head, coverage sectors have expanded to encompass industrials, consumer retail, healthcare, media and communications, and more.\n\nWall Street rivals have taken note. Goldman Sachs launched its Cross Markets Group in 2019 to target founder-led and mid-sized companies, and UBS stood up a middle-market effort during the pandemic, dispatching bankers to the same cities where its wealth managers operate. What's more, the pipeline between capital markets teams and wealth advisers is become more intertwined, creating lucrative referral opportunities as founders seek to invest the wealth created from major IB transactions.\n\nRichert spoke to Business Insider from his office in Atlanta about what it's like to build a national investment-banking operation far from New York — and why he's optimistic about where the middle market is headed in the coming year. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow are you feeling about the mid-cap M&A environment heading into next year?\n\nI think we're pretty optimistic on 2026. We have our highest backlog sell-sides that we've ever had.\n\nWe have a lot of private equity funds that need to return capital to their LPs. They need to sell assets. You have a lot of funds that aren't going to be able to raise another fund but have a bunch of portfolio companies that they're going to need to sell. You've got aging baby boomers and founder-owned businesses that children are not wanting to take over the business.\n\nWhy does being local matter so much in your business, and how does that shape the way your team is built across the country?\n\nA dinner, bumping into a CEO on a Saturday on the soccer field or at kids' events. Like being in the communities, commercial banking is a local business. You've got to be in front of your clients. I once had a CEO tell me, \"The reason we like having you local is we like bumping into you and seeing you in the community. When you come and visit us, you're just paying a visit. You're not flying in from New York.\"\n\nWe don't chase fees or transactions, we chase relationships. Over time, if you do that, when that client decides that he has a transaction he needs you to work on, you've built that relationship over months and years. Local matters in our opinion.\n\nWhat's the allure of working outside of New York, and how can bankers who do stay plugged in with clients?\n\nI do think that analysts and associates should start out in New York to be in the center and the nexus of where it's happening. But then when you're tired of Manhattan or tired of commuting in from the tri-state area, there's a lot of great places you can work.\n\nCome to New York or LA, the two big concentrations for us. Do your two years there, and then once you get promoted to associate, if you're from the Southeast or the Midwest or Texas or the West Coast, we have these offices you can go work in.\n\nTake us back to the beginning. How did JPMorgan's mid-cap banking group start, and why was it created?\n\nI was at Barclays when I got a call from Doug Petno, now our CEO of JPMorgan's corporate investment bank. The firm asked me to move to Atlanta when we started this business about 12 years ago. Doug's first question was: What's our investment banking market share? And it was a low single digits compared to high single digits for the overall investment bank at JPMorgan. His first question was, 'Why is that?'\n\nI'm originally from Tennessee, so they said, \"You're the southerner. Would you like to go to Atlanta?\" We started in New York, Dallas, Chicago, and Atlanta.\n\nWhat challenges did you face as you built the business from the ground up?\n\nWe needed to find the right mix of talent who were both highly skilled and, critically, excited to help build something new and enduring in the industry — and that isn't easy. Hiring is a full time job.\n\nWe looked for individuals who saw the opportunity to innovate and grow, and who were willing to take a leap of faith with us. This endeavor was and continues to be very entrepreneurial. We are here building something brand new within JPMorgan, which is incredibly exciting but also incredibly hard work.\n\nHow is AI changing the work your bankers do today and do you think it will change who gets into banking or affect the number of jobs?\n\nWe have an internal LLM that summarizes information and makes us smarter when we talk to clients. Tasks that used to take a day to do, you can now do in an hour using AI.\n\nBut we are not doing anywhere near as much as we should be. Drafting S-1s, drafting confidential information memoranda, drafting communications — all of that we should be using AI to create efficiencies for the analysts' and associates' work.\n\nAI will allow us to cover more clients, which requires more people. Nobody likes staying up all night writing an S1. But if you can do an S1 in six or seven hours by using AI and leave the office at 8, that's not eliminating people. It's just making it a better lifestyle business.\n\nWhat part of running this business keeps you up at night?\n\nMy focus is always on ensuring our team is set up for success and that we maintain our drive for excellence.\n\nThere are myriad macro factors causing uncertainty across the market, and we are of course monitoring them all closely. Our priority is to stay agile and proactive so we can continue delivering outstanding results for our clients, no matter the environment.\n\nHow would you describe your leadership style and the culture you've built?\n\nLead by example. There's nothing I would ask anybody on my team to do that I have not done or would not do myself.\n\nI tell everyone, 'This is just a job. Family comes first. Treat everyone you meet with respect.'\n\nI'm trying to make this team the best it can be. Everyone from the top to the bottom matters. The MDs can't be successful without the analyst, and the analyst can't be successful without the MDs. Culture is not transferred over Zoom.\n\nIt's pretty easy. Just go give good advice to your clients. The rest of it will work out.",

    "description": "An advertising professional turned her contract job into a full-time offer by creating a dating-app-inspired website to pitch herself to the company.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shari Williams, a 41-year-old social media strategist based in Chicago. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2017, my four-month contract at an advertising agency was wrapping up with no word of a job offer or extension. I thought to myself, \"I have to do something crazy to catch their attention.\"\n\nMy husband and friends were skeptical when I told them of my plan to create a dating-app style website to pitch myself as \"the perfect match\" for the company, but something told me it was going to work.\n\nA few weeks later, I posted my website on LinkedIn and even passed out custom candy hearts with the URL to my coworkers. My post gained traction, even catching the attention of the company's creative director, and I was extended a full-time offer.\n\nI learned it's always worth a shot to be bold.\n\nI had been working as a web developer for several years when I ended up pregnant and realized it wasn't the career path for me. I transitioned into social media and later went the freelance route, landing the four-month contract job at Burrell Communications to help with a campaign.\n\nThe office location was convenient, the people were cool, and the work was fun. I really liked working there and didn't want it to end.\n\nI figured if I created my own website as a way to pitch myself to the company, it could be easily shared online to garner attention and get noticed by the company. My original inspiration was Nina Mulfeh, who was actually featured in Business Insider, for creating a website to land a job at AirBnB. Since I was working in advertising, I wanted to do something creative and attention-grabbing, so I decided to make mine have a dating-app look and feel.\n\nIt probably took a few weeks to build ShariLovesBurrell.com, but most of that time was spent gathering information and planning out how I wanted it to look. The site had a pink background with hearts — it was one of those sites where content floats as you scroll.\n\nI created a dating \"profile\" for Burrell and one for me, and wrote things like \"I've never felt this way about a company before\" and \"I think we have something special.\"\n\nThen I added a few sections including a portfolio of everything I had done at Burrell during my contract period, testimonials from coworkers, and an \"about me\" section for anyone who just happened to stumble onto the website.\n\nAt the end of the page, it said something like \"I think we're a perfect match\" and there was a Tinder-like graphic of Burrell and me \"matching.\"\n\nI shared my website on LinkedIn and created custom conversation heart candies with my website's URL to pass around the office. If the company didn't come across the website online, they'd see the URL printed on this little package. I'm pretty sure I put those conversation hearts on everyone's desk.\n\nPeople seemed to think it was super cute and creative, but they also were like, \"Why are you doing all this for a job?\"\n\nGetting an advertising job is not easy, and there's a lot of competition. I knew it was a place I liked working, so I wanted to give it a shot. I just felt like I didn't have anything to lose. Even if they didn't hire me, my hope was that people would see it, share it, and something could come of it.\n\nThe creative director at Burrell shared my LinkedIn post about my website with the caption \"Shari, we hear you loud and clear,\" and Burrell later ended up extending me a full-time offer as a social content manager.\n\nI took the job but ultimately didn't stay at the company for much longer. However, having a full-time role on my résumé helped me to land other jobs and escape the \"contractor only\" trap. Now I work at Northwestern Medicine as a lead social media strategist, and I learned a lot that I use now from my role at Burrell.\n\nMy experience taught me that there are ways to stand out in the job market and compensate for a lack of experience, awards, or big company names on your résumé.\n\nJobseekers don't need to take my exact approach, but if there's a role you really want, it's worth a shot to be bold and put yourself out there to get noticed. If you're good at something, find a way to let people know.",

    "description": "A portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds says market bubbles come in the form of either valuations or earnings. AI isn't either kind of bubble just yet.",
    "fullText": "You're either in one camp or the other as 2025 comes to a close: you think AI is a bubble or that AI is not a bubble.\n\nBut for those wondering where they stand, there's nuance in the debate to be aware of, specifically, what kind of bubble might AI be?\n\nWell, there are two kinds, according to a portfolio manager at $35 billion Gabelli Funds. John Belton says stock market bubbles are either earnings-driven or valuation-driven.\n\nLike many finance pros, he compared the current AI landscape to the dot-com era, noting that prices for top tech stocks today are high relative to profits but not overly so. For that reason, he maintains that the AI market likely hasn't entered a valuation bubble.\n\n\"It is very difficult to argue we are in a valuation bubble currently. As an example, median 'Mag 7' (seven largest tech co's) forward P/E was close to 90x at YE99 vs. ~25x today,\" he said. \"Valuations seem to simply reflect strong fundamentals without obvious excess. Are we in an earnings bubble? Time will tell.\"\n\nThe portfolio manager shared two reasons he doesn't think AI has fallen into an earnings bubble at present, though. The biggest reason is that while AI capex spending is high, the bulk of it is being used to strengthen already-profitable businesses.\n\nThe second is that the list of use cases for AI is growing.\n\n\"Second biggest reason to feel confident we are not in an earnings bubble: additional large-scale use cases are beginning to present themselves. Autonomous driving, robotics, life sciences, other scientific discovery, agentic software. We do need at least some of these use cases to become commercial — early, but there is promise.\"\n\nBelton pointed to concerns surrounding Oracle and Broadcom, which have both seen recent declines as investors question high capex spending and returns on AI investments. However, Belton added that he thinks both stocks have the potential to shake off the current volatility, and that Broadcom is among the top chip stocks to own right now.\n\nThe portfolio manager is bullish on the AI trade's continued strength in the near term, but said investors are right to be cautious about massive spending from OpenAI.\n\n\"Like any infrastructure cycle this too will be a cycle (question is not if we reach a peak, but when and how high the peak is),\" he said.",

It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been in a caretaking role for most of my life. We lost my dad when I was 11, and my mom had a stroke soon after. As the only girl in a Latino immigrant family, I grew up carrying responsibility early. That early experience of taking care of my family members, coupled with my take-charge personality, has shaped every stage of my life, including my decision not to have children.\n\nIn the town I come from, it's really common to stay here, fall in love, get married, and start a family. But it was never a path I saw for myself, partially because my upbringing had provided me with very strong lessons about what it takes to raise kids. In high school, when everyone was dating, I remember thinking marriage and kids weren't interesting to me.\n\nThen, in my mid-20s, I had a spinal injury that left me learning how to walk again. The chronic pain that followed, combined with severe menstrual issues I'd spent years normalizing, made me unsure whether my body could handle pregnancy and birth. I was already living with so much pain that the idea of adding more felt like too big a sacrifice.\n\nI didn't consider motherhood until my mid-30s, when I finally fell in love. For the first time, I considered building a family of my own. But going off to start my own family felt like leaving my family behind in some sense. Then my mom got really sick, and that was the crux moment for me.\n\nI ended my personal relationship, initially telling myself it was because my mom needed me. However, I quickly admitted the truth to myself: Being a mother wasn't what I wanted for myself. I wanted to live a life where I could be there for my immediate family and their needs, especially my mom. While I could have chosen to rise to the occasion and try to carry this double load like many other women do,  I didn't want to.\n\nLooking at the circumstances and being truly honest with myself showed me that becoming a mother wouldn't let me show up at my best in this life. For me, being responsible meant making a different decision from starting a traditional family. It meant caring for my current one.\n\nLater, I learned that my former partner had a child. The amount of relief I felt after learning that told me I had made the right decision for both of us. I knew this person should be a father, and that I couldn't provide that kind of life for him. I'm so glad he has found his path, and that I'm on mine.\n\nIt amazes me the capacity women have to care for their children, and there are times when I don't fully feel like I'm meeting the measure of a woman in society. But I watched my mom make sacrifices for us, and while I admire her deeply, I know that I couldn't live that way. Instead, my fulfillment comes from making sure the person who raised me can age with support and love. These days, I live with my mom and family members, not out of financial necessity but because this is where I'm needed and where I feel most fulfilled.\n\nChoosing not to have children isn't always about not wanting them. Sometimes it's about opting for a different kind of family, or protecting your health, or recognizing where you're most needed. While it's easy to judge women who don't have kids, we have no idea what experiences in life led to this moment. Even if we are on different paths in life, my hope is that we can all offer each other compassion in our choices.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with estate settlement company founder Alexandra Mysoor. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was primarily raised in Minnesota, and on the first day we moved there, our next-door neighbor Carol arrived with a pie, like out of a movie. Her daughter Katie is still my best friend to this day.\n\nCarol died a few years ago (her husband had passed before her), and I was at Katie's house for the funeral. There was a to-do list fixed to the freezer door. I told Katie, whatever is on the list, I've got you.\n\nI did not know how generous I was being, because that list was full of estate settlement tasks. I truly thought it would be easy. However, it took me 18 months and 900 hours to complete, which is an average amount of time for a simple estate.\n\nMost people don't have wills. And it's not based on socioeconomic status; people just forget to do it. Even if you have a well-formed trust, many people don't update it. A trust or a will is like a map. However, you still have to fill up on gas, get in the car, and prepare everything. It's a long journey.\n\nEstate planning is important, but no matter how much planning you have in place, someone will have to take the journey.\n\nMost people don't even know the phrase \"estate settlement.\" People's minds go directly to planning. Many people are unaware that we're authoring the first Wikipedia entry about it. Most people don't know how time-consuming a settlement is or how expensive. It takes an average family $30,000 to settle an estate.\n\nI think that's surprising because everyone talks about the great wealth transfer that is expected to happen in the next decade and a half. It's $100 trillion. It sounds like a great windfall, and it is. However, many people are aware of the net worth of celebrities like Hailey Bieber or Elon Musk, but not their own parents. The first step is discovering what was in this loved one's estate.\n\nEverything in estate settlement is a point solution. You call a lawyer. Then a CPA. No one makes the whole thing easier. I was surprised by that. So, I created a solution. My company, Alix, helps people settle loved ones' estates during such a vulnerable time.\n\nAt Alix, the 900 hours of administrative work are handled by agentic AI and humans. We forward mail, review bills, scan documents, handle life insurance, clean out the fridge, adjust the thermostat, park the car in the garage, cancel Netflix, make calls to financial institutions, return the cable box, and complete the necessary forms.\n\nThe families we work with have almost 24/7 access via the app or by calling, texting, and emailing. That was one of the most frustrating things about helping Katie; it was hard to get a call back. We can give families peace of mind about the process being more efficient. It's like having a team of administrators, akin to a family office of the ultra-high net worth, to handle the complex work of settlement.\n\nThe holidays offer an interesting opportunity to increase situational awareness as a family. Perhaps that's as simple as knowing where the account information is located. Parents often feel uncomfortable talking about money with their adult children; money and grief are very potent emotions. You can start the conversations now.",

    "description": "Meta has given employees access to Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-5 alongside its own AI tools to help boost productivity.",
    "fullText": "In its push to create an \"AI-first\" workplace, Meta is expanding employees' access to tools from rivals such as Google and OpenAI, Business Insider has learned.\n\nThe social media giant has been encouraging employees to integrate AI tools into nearly everything they do, according to multiple internal documents and posts seen by Business Insider.\n\nOne of the company's priorities is to \"make AI core to how we work,\" Meta's chief information officer, Atish Banerjea, told employees in a June memo outlining a plan to use Meta's own models — which use the naming convention \"Llama\" — alongside products from other firms.\n\nIn November, a Meta engineer said in an internal post that all employees have access to Google's Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's ChatGPT-5. The post included a list of AI tools Meta employees have access to, including their use cases. Business Insider has recreated the list below.\n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the revamped suite of AI tools and pointed to an earlier comment shared with Business Insider about AI adoption, stating: \"It's well-known that this is a priority, and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work.\"\n\nThe social media giant opened the floodgates to rival AI models in June.\n\nAmong those is an internal coding tool called Devmate that uses Anthropic's Claude, Business Insider previously reported. Google's Gemini and NotebookLM Pro are also available across the company to help employees \"work smarter and have more impact,\" Banerjea told employees in the June memo.\n\nMeta has invested tens of billions into its own consumer-facing AI models, and employees have access to an internal AI assistant called Metamate, which is built on its Llama models.\n\nAfter Meta struck a deal over the summer the startup Midjourney to weave its AI-image generator into its products and models, the company made the tool available to employees in October for \"concept and production uses\" to speed up design work and creative prototyping, according to an internal post ahead of the rollout, seen by Business Insider.\n\nGemini isn't the only Google tool Meta is embracing. The company migrated its internal productivity suite over the summer to Google Workspace — including Chat, Gmail, Docs, and Drive — describing the move in a June memo as a way to \"unlock AI-driven capabilities\" and better integrate with its expanding toolset.\n\nOn the engineering side, Meta has expanded access to agentic coding systems, adding Google's Gemini 3 Pro and exploring new integrations with tools like OpenAI's Codex CLI and Google's Gemini CLI. \"Rather than focusing on specific solutions, our strategy centers on outcomes: increasing productivity, accelerating development, and ensuring you have access to the best agentic coding experiences,\" Reality Labs executive Maher Saba told employees in a November memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nTo encourage adoption and experimentation, Meta has gamified the use of AI, Business Insider previously reported. Earlier this year, it launched an internal game called \"Level Up,\" which rewards employees with badges for using AI in different ways. Leaders are also tying performance to results achieved through AI, rewarding those who can prove \"AI-driven impact\" this year, and including it as part of performance reviews in 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has revealed the White House’s domestic priority, and it’s not bringing down costs or addressing the looming healthcare crisis.\n\nSpeaking at a holiday party on Sunday, the president described his aspirations for a triumphal arch in Washington, D.C., as White House Domestic Policy Council head Vince Haley’s “primary thing.”\n\n“It’s something that is so special. Uh, it will be like the one in, in Paris, but to be honest with you, it blows it away. Blows it away in every way,” Trump said. “And Vince came in one day and his eyes were teeming. I mean, he couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. He saw it and he wanted to do that. That’s your primary thing.”\n\nHaley previously served as a speechwriter for Trump and as a longtime aide for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\n“Vince is unbelievable on policy. And we have a policy thing that’s going to be unbelievable happening,” he said of the proposed arch.\n\nTrump has spent months attempting to remake D.C. in his MAGAfied image, including paving over the White House Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing, breaking ground on a $300 million ballroom, and announcing plans for other new construction around the nation’s capital—none of which has undergone the necessary legal reviews.\n\nIn October, he announced he wanted to build a knock-off of the Arc de Triomphe that would rival the Lincoln Memorial in scale. Sources say Trump has been presented with three different designs, but unsurprisingly he is reportedly most excited about a $100 million white-and-gold monstrosity.\n\n“We’re building an arc, like the Arc de Triomphe, and we’re building it, uh, by the Arlington Bridge, the Arlington Cemetery, uh, opposite the Lincoln Memorial. You could say Jefferson, Washington, everything, ’cause they’re all right there,” Trump described the project on Sunday.\n\nThe president has solicited private donations for the project, which would ostensibly commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States, and has doubled down on the idea even as his approval ratings have cratered over his administration’s failure to rein in the cost of living.\n\nThe president’s own voters increasingly blame him for high prices, and last week, Trump launched a national tour to try to convince voters his economic policies are working—despite the fact that many Americans are cutting back on buying gifts this holiday season.\n\nThen there’s the fact that Republicans still don’t have a plan for bringing down healthcare costs after the latest GOP spending bill cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending and failed to extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealthcare premiums for about 22 million Americans will skyrocket next year after the ACA credits expire, with the average recipient seeing their premiums double.\n\nBut to Trump, the more pressing issue is apparently that Washington is “the only city in the world that’s of great importance that doesn’t have a triumphal arch,” he said Sunday.\n\n“This one is gonna blow ‘em all away. The one that people know mostly is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France. And, uh, we’re gonna top it by I think a lot,” he said.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Monday slapped sanctions on five businessmen linked to Russian state-owned oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft and targeted companies accused of circumventing sanctions on Russian oil by running ships for Moscow's shadow fleet of aging oil tankers.\n\nOil revenue is a key part of Russia’s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the war effort against Ukraine without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.\n\nMember countries, notably France, have vowed to crack down on the sanction-busting shadow fleet which experts estimate numbers over 400 ships. They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nEU headquarters said the businessmen “control vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products, originating in Russia or being exported from Russia, concealing the actual origin of the oil, while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe four shipping companies targeted are based in the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Russia. A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY (AP) — A judge sentenced a Sydney taekwondo instructor on Tuesday to life in prison without possibility of release for murdering a 7-year-old student and the boy’s parents.\n\nKwang Kyung Yoo, 51, sat with his head bowed as Justice Ian Harrison said he would never be eligible for parole.\n\nHarrison said Yoo has been motivated by the jealousy he felt for the family’s financial success.\n\n“I’m satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of these offenses is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence,” Harrison told the New South Wales Supreme Court.\n\nHarrison said Yoo had no reason to murder the boy or his parents in February last year.\n\nState law prevents child victims of crime from being identified, so the boy’s parents also can’t be named.\n\nYoo and his victims were all born in South Korea.\n\nYoo had pleaded guilty to the three murders at an earlier court appearance. He had no prior criminal record.\n\nYoo had strangled the boy and his 41-year-old mom in his Lion’s Taekwondo and Martial Arts Academy in western Sydney. He owed tens of thousands of dollars at the time and was behind in rent on the academy.\n\nHe took the mother’s Apple watch and drove her luxury BMW car to the family home where he stabbed the boy’s 39-year-old father to death.\n\nYoo was injured in the struggle in the home and drove himself to hospital where he told medical staff he had been attacked in a supermarket car park. Police arrested him at the hospital.\n\nAfter his arrest, Yoo could not explain how he intended to get the family’s money and later detailed his remorse.\n\nThe former instructor, whose students called him Master Lion, did not look at the victims’ family and other supporters as they sobbed in the court’s public gallery after the sentence was handed down.\n\n“These killings were horrific and violent acts, senselessly cruel and cynical, perpetrated without a trace of human compassion,” the judge said.\n\nWhile the crimes were planned — with Yoo surveilling the family’s home beforehand — he made no attempt to conceal his crimes from the CCTV cameras in his academy or try to conceal the bodies.\n\nAt a sentence hearing in November, the judge heard Yoo had lied about meeting the wealthiest Australian, Gina Rinehart, qualifying for the Sydney Olympics in 2000, owning a Lamborghini luxury car and living in Sydney’s wealthy eastern suburbs.\n\nTo impress his own wife, he would send emails to himself, pretending to be important people. He sometimes used the title professor.\n\nHarrison noted that Yoo had told a psychologist his lies became bigger and bigger as his wife and students asked more questions.\n\nThe judge noted Yoo had been burdened since childhood with unrealistic expectations from his parents and South Korean culture about the level of success he needed to achieve.\n\nYoo was handed a box of tissues as the judge described his deep remorse for the hurt and pain that he had caused.\n\nIn a letter to the judge, Yoo said he was “held captive by sin” and that he wanted to give himself to Jesus Christ.\n\n“I wish I could turn back time so this didn’t happen,” Yoo wrote. “I pray every day for the people I have hurt.”\n\nYoo’s lawyers had argued that he should be given a minimum nonparole period rather than a life sentence without possibility of release. The maximum penalty for someone convicted of murder in New South Wales is life imprisonment, with a standard nonparole period of 20 years for the murder of an adult and 25 years for the murder of a child.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reportedly grew bored of being warned about his policies and dire polling numbers and instead shifted the conversation to golf.\n\nMark Mitchell, head pollster at the conservative polling firm Rasmussen Reports, spoke with the president at the White House and warned Trump that he is losing support among his MAGA base during his second term.\n\nMitchell was invited to the White House by Vice President JD Vance in the hope that he would offer Trump an outsider’s perspective on how the public views his presidency, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe invitation came as polling has repeatedly shown Trump recording bleak numbers and record-low approval ratings, amid growing concerns that the 79-year-old is not focused on improving the lives of tens of millions of Americans, who are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and abandoning his “America First” agenda.\n\nMitchell told the Post that while Trump initially listened to his concerns and asked questions, the president eventually changed the subject to golf. That included praising two of his golf buddies—South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Fox News host Bret Baier—and bragging about how much money he had just raised at a golf fundraiser for Graham.\n\n“To the extent that we were talking about the economic populism message, he wasn’t as interested as I would have hoped,” Mitchell said.\n\nPolling has consistently suggested that Trump is facing backlash from voters for downplaying—or outright denying—that millions of Americans are experiencing financial hardship during his second term. Last week, Trump appeared at a rally in Pennsylvania to try to convince voters that his economic policies are working, but instead once again labeled concerns about “affordability” a Democratic “hoax.”\n\nDays later, an AP-NORC poll found that just 31 percent of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, a record low for the president and a nine-point drop since March.\n\nEven the latest survey from the Trump-friendly Rasmussen Reports shows that a majority of likely voters (51 percent) disapprove of the president’s job performance.\n\nThere are growing fears that Trump’s erosion of support among his base could have devastating consequences for Republicans in next year’s midterms, where the GOP already faces an uphill battle to retain control of the House and possibly the Senate.\n\nSpeaking to the Post, Mitchell said he told Trump he had lost the momentum and goodwill he gained from supporters following the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024.\n\n“You said, ‘Fight, fight, fight.’ But nobody ever clarified what that means,” Mitchell said, referring to the defiant fist-raising gesture Trump made in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. “And right now, you’re fight-fight-fighting Marjorie Taylor Greene, and not actually fight-fight-fighting for Americans.”\n\nMitchell added that he warned Trump during the November White House meeting that many supporters believe he has failed to “drain the swamp” in Washington, and that his base wants to see the 79-year-old “smash the oligarchy, not be the oligarchy.”\n\n“Building billionaire-funded ballrooms, jet-setting around the world, and touting trillion-dollar investment deals looks a lot like oligarchy stuff,” Mitchell said.\n\nConservative commentator and Turning Point USA contributor Savanah Hernandez also suggested that Trump is becoming overly focused on foreign policy, particularly his desperate efforts to secure a Nobel Peace Prize, during his second term.\n\n“When Americans see billions of dollars going overseas to any country, it really feels like a betrayal when we’re struggling here at home,” Hernandez told the Post.\n\nTwo senior White House officials told the newspaper that Trump receives feedback on his performance, including criticism from MAGA-aligned voices, on a “near-daily” basis.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described Trump as the “proud founder and undisputed leader” of MAGA and “the greatest political movement in American history.”\n\n“President Trump is delivering on his core campaign promises across the board, keeping his word to the nearly 80 million patriots who elected him in a landslide, and fighting every day to make America greater than ever before,” she said.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Vance’s office for comment.",

    "title": "Tackle Your Biggest Projects With a Daily 'Power Hour'",
    "description": "Just one hour a day can change a lot.",
    "fullText": "When you think of “power hour,” you might think of a drinking game, but what we’re about to discuss is kind of the opposite of that—sorry! \"Power Hour\" is also a specific productivity hack. It comes from Adrienne Herbert’s book, Power Hour: How to Focus on Your Goals and Create a Life You Love and asks you to devote an hour a day to working hard on your biggest task—or the thing you care about the most. I'm skeptical of self-help and productivity books in general, but I do recommend this one because its insights are valuable and novel. Don't have time to read it right now? No big deal. The need-to-know concepts are below.\n\nAt its core, the Power Hour is about reclaiming part of your daily time and devoting it to something intentional. The author uses flowery language here, saying you should do this in the first hour of your day “before the rest of the world needs your love, attention, and energy,” and suggests using the Power Hour for a task that is meaningful to you. You can adapt it, however, to be for productivity, even on tasks that are more necessary and boring than your passion projects. I am not a particularly saccharine person, so I don't relate to all this stuff about the world needing my \"love,\" but I have found that since I started devoting the first hour of my day to something that matters to me—namely, a strictly scheduled Pilates class that benefits my personal fitness and lifestyle goals, undertaken before my friends are even awake—I have become more productive and, generally, happier. In my experience, this idea works.\n\nHerbert suggests using the first hour of the day for this, but you can also use a time of day that makes most sense for you. Everyone is different and has different “peaks” of productivity, largely determined by the time of day and something called the Yerkes-Dodson Law, which shows that you’re likely to be most productive when you have a little stress (like a deadline) but not too much (like a deadline that’s in 15 minutes). Use time tracking software and a daily journal to figure out when you generally have your most productive moments, then shape your Power Hour around those. For the most part, this is a habit you should try to build and stick to, so putting the Power Hour at a predetermined time every day is advisable; but if something like a big project crops up, you have some wiggle room to move it around to suit your needs.\n\nTo keep using myself as an example, my morning workout Power Hour works because I book my class two days in advance, so there is no question about whether or not I have to wake up at 5 a.m. that day; I simply do. But it can still be a little flexible as long as you are committed to getting the Power Hour in there somewhere on days your typical approach falls short. This weekend, something came up that forced me to cancel my morning class, but you better believe I was in there in the afternoon because I know this method works and I owed it to myself. That mindset will take you far with this.\n\nOnce you’ve decided where in your day the Power Hour should go, it’s time to get started. You’ll be engaging in deep work here, or uninterrupted work that is solely focused on one task. Your first step to getting there is to block the Power Hour off in a way that both holds you accountable and lets other people know you’re busy. Be sure to mark it in your calendar and stick to it, but also try to include it on public-facing calendars, whether they’re ones you use with your family or with your colleagues.\n\nNext, you have to get into the deep work, which means focusing for a straight hour. A few things can help you do this:\n\nSoftware that limits distractions, like Steppin, which blocks pre-determined apps at all times but unblocks them in exchange for banked time you earn by walking around in the real world, or Focus Pomo, which blocks all your apps when you're in a \"focus session.\"\n\nA Pomodoro-style timer to count down the hour so you aren’t watching the clock. (Just make sure it has a full 60-minute option; some of them don’t.)\n\nOr, do what I do and engage in your chosen task in a way that makes it impossible to do anything else. When I am in my morning workout classes, I can't touch my phone or do anything but focus on what I'm being instructed to do; it's just one of the many reasons I've opted for group fitness over solo gym trips lately. If your Power Hour is dedicated to reading, put your devices in another room while you do it. Take meaningful steps to ensure you are only focused on your task, whatever that looks like for you.\n\nDepending on how you usually work, a Power Hour could take some time to get used to, especially if you’re someone who usually multitasks or loses focus. Once you get the hang of it, though, you can use it to blast through all kinds of tasks, whether those include work-related activities, cleaning your house, budgeting, or anything else you lack the time and attention to pull off in a typical day. Communicating that you’re busy and sticking to the schedule are key, so make sure to plan for this before you try it.",

(AP) — A judge on Monday disbarred Hunter Biden in Connecticut for violating the state's attorney conduct rules, a decision that comes after complaints were made about the federal gun and tax charges Biden was convicted of before being pardoned last year by his father, former President Joe Biden.\n\nIn an agreement with the state office that disciplines lawyers, Hunter Biden consented to being disbarred and admitted to attorney misconduct, but he did not admit to any criminal wrongdoing. He was disbarred in Washington, D.C., in May.\n\nHunter Biden did not speak as he and his lawyer, Ross Garber, appeared via video at a virtual court hearing before Judge Trial Referee Patrick L. Carroll III in Waterbury.\n\nHunter Biden was convicted last year in Delaware federal court of three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when, prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.\n\nHe had been set to stand trial in September 2024 in a California case in which prosecutors accused him of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes. He agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges hours after jury selection was set to begin.\n\nThe Connecticut judge found that Hunter Biden violated several ethical rules for lawyers, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" In a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment.\n\nPaul Dorsey, one of the two people who filed the complaints about the former president's son, told the judge during Monday's hearing that he objected to the agreement because Hunter Biden did not admit to committing crimes. But Leanne Larson, an attorney with the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, cited the pardon.\n\nHunter Biden was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.",

Coral reefs thrive in the darkness, harboring life that often appears otherworldly.\n\nEntering the twilight zone “feels like landing on the moon,” says Rocha, who has dedicated his career to studying fish and coral reefs there. “More often than not, one of the first things we see is a species that is unknown to science.”\n\nFor these “aquanauts” the mission is clear: retrieve three autonomous reef monitoring structures, or ARMS, that they placed at the bottom of Blue Hole eight years prior. The structures act as artificial reefs collecting marine life from a zone that is too deep for conventional scuba divers and too shallow to attract submersibles or remotely operated vehicles. As a result, this area remains largely unexplored and seldom sampled. Rocha hopes the ARMS will offer rare insight into life at these depths. And though he has made this plunge before, that doesn’t make the day’s dive any less dangerous.\n\n(These creatures of the 'twilight zone' are vital to our oceans)\n\nTo get to the twilight zone, Rocha is relying on a device known as a rebreather. Unlike regular scuba diving systems, which supply divers with a set amount of breathable air that they exhale in streams of bubbles, rebreathers recycle the air that a diver exhales. That allows a diver to go deeper and stay longer, but it comes with increased risks. A malfunction can skew the mix of gases—too little oxygen, too much oxygen, or too much carbon dioxide—any of which would incapacitate a diver.\n\nIf anything goes wrong at depth, divers can’t rush to the surface for rescue: a rapid ascent can flood their blood vessels with nitrogen bubbles, triggering decompression sickness, a painful and life-threatening condition. Rebreather diving is considered five to ten times more dangerous per dive than conventional scuba diving, with estimates suggesting it claims around 20 to 25 lives worldwide every year.\n\n“I think Luiz is crazy for doing this,” says Susanne Bähr, a postdoctoral researcher at Cal Academy who is aboard the expedition. But to Rocha, such dangers are well worth the tantalizing treasures that await him below.\n\n“I’ve wanted to be an explorer ever since I was a kid,” he says, “and there's nothing better for an explorer than going to a place that nobody has ever been, finding a species that nobody has ever seen before.”\n\nOnly a few dozen scientists have the necessary training into the mesophotic, between about 130 and 490 feet deep. Only a fraction of them have ever reached its deeper portions. The journey requires immense practice, can be extremely dangerous, and isn’t comfortable by any means.\n\nWith the last strap secured, Rocha takes a deep breath from his rebreather mouthpiece. “Seventy-five percent helium!” he squeaks, his voice high-pitched like a cartoon character.\n\nAt the depths he’s going, air becomes toxic. His rebreather feeds him a special combination of gases, the most abundant of which is helium. This cocktail prevents nitrogen and other gases from reaching lethal levels in a diver’s blood, but it cannot support them at great depths for long.\n\nThough it will take Rocha less than 10 minutes to reach the destination, once he is down there, he will have only about 15 minutes to work before he has to start a slow and controlled ascent to the surface—a process that can take four to five hours.\n\nDespite the hazards ahead, Rocha was eager to begin. On the boat, Bell rattled through the final questions on their safety checklist:\n\n“Are you mentally and physically prepared to dive?” Bell asks.\n\nAfter one last gear check and review of emergency protocols, they hop in the water.\n\nScientists once thought that the deeper one dove, the drabber and more lifeless a reef would become. But over the past few decades, they’ve learned that reefs in the twilight zone are wildly biodiverse and harbor colorful creatures.\n\nAlthough scientists have significantly increased their understanding of these mysterious ecosystems over the past few decades, “our knowledge of deep reefs is still in its infancy,” says Carole Baldwin, the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. “Most places still have not been explored.”\n\nFor over a decade, scientists have been attempting to bridge this gap by placing ARMS on deep reefs around the world. Used and deployed widely by researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), ARMS are stacks of plates, about one cubic foot in size, that mimic the complex structure of the seafloor.\n\n(Why this deep-sea explorer thinks diversity is so important for science)\n\nIf coral reefs are underwater cities, then ARMS are apartment buildings offering free rent. Vacant real estate is hard to come by on coral reefs, so when an ARMS shows up, corals, sponges, worms, anemones, and other organisms waste no time moving in. Eventually, everything from fish to crabs will set up shop. The longer an ARMS sits on a reef, the more local critters make use of it.\n\nIn 2018, Rocha and his team placed four ARMS in Blue Hole and several more on Guam's other deep reefs and in the shallows. Studying the reef this way is more efficient than going down there and collecting individual specimens by hand, Rocha says.\n\n“Instead of sampling for five minutes,” he says, “we're sampling for eight years.”\n\nAfter retrieving the ARMS, Rocha places them in sealed containers supported by a small float. Now he and Bell begin their hours-long ascent. They pass the time by taking photos, playing rock-paper-scissors, and briefly slipping off their mouthpieces to slurp on applesauce pouches.\n\nA few hours after the pair disappeared into Blue Hole’s cavernous maw, a second team of divers sets off to rendezvous with them. The two teams meet at around 100 feet, where Rocha and Bell hand off the ARMS to the second team to bring up to the surface. With the ARMS safely secured, the second team hauls the structures on board and puts them in bins filled with seawater—then the scientists gathered around, eager to get a glimpse of their biological bounty.\n\n‘Wows’ erupted from every scientist aboard as they removed the first ARMS from its container. Each plate looked like the work of an abstract artist; their surfaces decorated with bulbous orange sponges, winding white worm casings, and ruby red tunicates. On its edges hang branching corals as big as the ARMS’s plates. Hot pink fish no bigger than a paper clip darted through the bin’s murky water, experiencing direct sunlight for the first time.\n\nThe researchers rush the ARMS to the Guam Center for Biodiversity Research at the University of Guam, where another team of scientists waits to take the devices apart and inspect every organism. They photograph each plate, move out the large creatures, and then scrape them so the crusts and blobs sticking to the plates can be genetically sequenced to determine their identities.\n\nAmong the marine organisms found on the ARMS is a new species of dottyback fish that looks like someone put googly eyes on a slice of persimmon; a new species of sea slug whose body is peppered with yellow polka dots and tree-shaped protrusions; and a potentially new species of goby whose skin is so transparent you can see each one of its bones.\n\nThere were some familiar faces too.\n\n“This is an interesting and unusual hermit crab,” says Daniel Eisenhauer, a research associate at the University of Guam, holding up a petri dish. “It carries a bivalve shell rather than a usual snail shell. We’re quite pleased with this.”\n\nDuring their expedition, Rocha and his colleagues collected 2,000 organisms. At least 20, Rocha thinks, are new species.\n\n“Once we get the DNA that number will increase tenfold,” he predicts.\n\n(These deep-sea animals are new to science—and already at risk)\n\nFor Robert Lasley, a curator of invertebrates at the Guam Center for Biodiversity Research, witnessing the dramatic biodiversity from the depths was hard to process. He and his colleagues survey Guam’s shallow reefs every week in search of interesting specimens. But what they found on the ARMS was unlike anything he had seen.\n\n“I never really cared too much about learning how to do these deep dives, but after seeing the new records and even new species,” he says, “I really want to start training so I can get to those depths.”\n\nFor those who want to explore the unknown, Rocha says, there is no better place than the mesophotic.\n\nBähr, the Cal Academy postdoc who questioned Rocha’s sanity for diving to such depths, is completing her own deep diving rebreather certification.\n\n“We’re [both] crazy,” she says, “We’re just blinded by the work.”\n\nBähr’s research focuses on deep-dwelling crabs and corals. She dreams of studying them in their natural habitat: “I cannot imagine anything better.”\n\nScientists who similarly aspire to venture below without the help of a submersible or ROV are in short supply. It is one of the reasons most mesophotic reefs in the twilight zone remain unexplored and, as a result, unprotected.\n\n(Anya Brown is investigating microbes’ critical role in coral reefs)\n\n“People tend not to protect the deep reefs,” says Rocha. “They don’t know they exist or don’t know what’s [living] there.”\n\nHe says the best way to get people to protect these places is to bring the reefs to them. He does this by publishing scientific papers, doing underwater photography, and hosting community events where people can see his specimens. The Steinhart Aquarium at the California Academy of Sciences currently has several fish on exhibit that he and his team collected in the mesophotic zone and brought back alive.\n\nAfter the last ARMS had been recovered and the specimens preserved, Rocha and his colleagues gathered in a classroom at the University of Guam to bring what they’d seen in the edge of the twilight zone to light.\n\nWide-eyed students marveled at photos of a see-through shrimp, a yellow crab whose legs dwarfed its body, and a sunset-colored sea slug whose front and rear were indistinguishable. Their colors boggled the minds of both the students and scientists. The deeper you go, the fewer colors are visible, and yet these reefs contain every color of the rainbow. “We're trying to find out why,” says Rocha.\n\n(Want to survive in the dark ocean? Use a stinging shield.)\n\nThe students passed around jars containing the colorful creatures, discussing their contents and snapping pictures with fervor. Just days prior, no one on Earth knew some of these animals existed.\n\n“I think that these new species might help us protect the region,” Rocha says.\n\nAs the last student filed out, he reflected on the twilight zone expedition. He had braved the depths, uncovered its secrets, and lived to tell the tale. Or as he describes it, “just another day at the office.”",

One proposal is to use some of the tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe.\n\n“The aggressor must pay,” Zelenskyy told the Dutch parliament earlier Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, he attended peace talks in Berlin with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he told journalists. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nThirty-five countries backed the International Claims Commission, but they now must ratify the treaty, a process which usually requires legislature approval. That level of support is unprecedented for the start of a Council of Europe treaty.\n\nThe commission will assess claims made to the already operational register of damages, which was launched during a Council of Europe summit in 2023. Some 80,000 claims have already been filed with the register, which is based in The Hague.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told a press conference the bloc would give one million euros ($1.1 million) to finance the commission's operation. An estimated 3.5 million euros ($4.1 million) are needed overall.\n\nMany of the same countries have also backed a new international court, also under the umbrella of the Council of Europe, to prosecute senior Russian officials for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday unveiled a new family of open-source artificial intelligence models that it says will be faster, cheaper and ​smarter than its previous offerings, as open-source offerings from Chinese AI labs proliferate.\n\nNvidia ‌is primarily known for providing chips that firms such as OpenAI use to train their closed-source models and ‌charge money for them. But it also offers a slew of its own models for everything from physics simulations to self-driving vehicles as open-source software that can be used by researchers or by other companies, with firms such as Palantir Technologies weaving Nvidia's model into their products.\n\nNvidia ⁠on Monday revealed the third ‌generation of its \"Nemotron\" large-language models aimed at writing, coding and other tasks. The smallest of the models, called Nemotron 3 Nano, was being released ‍Monday, with two other, larger versions coming in the first half of 2026.\n\nNvidia, which has become the world's most valuable listed company, said that Nemotron 3 Nano was more efficient than its predecessor - ​meaning it would be cheaper to run - and would do better at long tasks ‌with multiple steps.\n\nNvidia is releasing the models as open-source offerings from Chinese tech firms such as DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and Alibaba Group Holdings are becoming widely used in the tech industry, with companies such as Airbnb disclosing use of Alibaba' s. (BABA) Qwen open-source model.\n\nAt the same time, CNBC and Bloomberg have reported that Meta Platforms is considering shifting toward closed-source ⁠models, leaving Nvidia as one of the most prominent ​U.S. providers of open-source offerings.\n\nMany U.S. states and ​government entities have banned use of Chinese models over security concerns.\n\nKari Briski, vice president of generative AI software for enterprise at Nvidia, said the company aimed ‍to provide a \"model that ⁠people can depend on\", and was also openly releasing its training data and other tools so that government and business users could test it for security and ⁠customize it.\n\n\"This is why we're treating it like a library,\" Briski told Reuters in an interview. \"This is ‌why we're committed to it from a software engineering perspective.\"",

    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Sarah Pflugradt, Ph.D., RDN, CSCS\n\nThe morning habit that can spike your cholesterol levels over time is skipping breakfast.\n\nIt can throw off your circadian rhythm, decrease your diet quality and cause overeating.\n\nGo for a breakfast high in fiber and protein, move your body and minimize stress daily.\n\nYou might think your mornings are healthy—but certain daily rituals could quietly raise your cholesterol over time. We interviewed heart health experts to reveal the surprising morning habit that can affect your heart, plus simple swaps to protect it. Turns out, it’s something about 15% of US adults do on any given day!\n\nWe’re talking about skipping breakfast. Studies consistently show that skipping breakfast is linked with higher cholesterol levels, even when it leads to modest weight loss. There are a few reasons for this, which we’re diving into below.\n\nSkipping breakfast can throw off your circadian rhythm—your body’s internal clock. One of the many things that your circadian rhythm controls is lipid metabolism. When your body’s internal clock is thrown off, it may alter some genes and enzymes that regulate your cholesterol. “Without that morning meal, the liver’s HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, which controls the rate of cholesterol production, becomes more active, producing more LDL and total cholesterol,” says Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES, CDN.\n\nEating breakfast, on the other hand, can help prevent cholesterol spikes that typically happen when you wake up. “Normally, cholesterol synthesis peaks in the early morning, but eating breakfast provides nutrients that help buffer this process,” says Routhenstein.\n\nIf you find yourself mindlessly snacking on high-carb or high-fat foods throughout the day, skipping breakfast may be the underlying cause. “Skipping breakfast can trigger metabolic shifts that increase cholesterol production and may also cause overeating later in the day,” says cardiologist, Dr. Randy Gould.\n\nThis is in part because of shifts in hormones that regulate appetite. “Prolonged morning fasting can alter hormones like leptin and ghrelin, increasing hunger and promoting insulin resistance,” says Routhenstein. “This combination can impair your body’s ability to clear cholesterol from the blood, further contributing to higher LDL cholesterol,” she adds. Your body experiences rebound hunger because its nutrient needs were not met earlier in the day.\n\nThat said, research results are mixed as to whether skipping breakfast actually leads you to eat more throughout the day. Some studies have found that skipping breakfast leads to a lower overall calorie intake. Still, studies consistently find worse cholesterol levels in people who skip breakfast, whether or not they eat more calories throughout the day.\n\nDelaying your first meal of the day may also affect the overall quality of your diet. “Skipping breakfast often leads to larger, less nutrient-dense meals later in the day,” says Routhenstein. These meals may be higher in saturated fat and refined carbs, which “directly contribute to more LDL particle formation and reduce the protective effects of HDL cholesterol,” she adds.\n\nOne study found that kids who skip breakfast tend to eat more fat and sodium throughout the day than kids who eat breakfast. This is notable because eating excess saturated fat and sodium can harm heart health. Plus, skipping breakfast may make it harder to eat enough whole grains—sources of high-quality carbs, fiber and minerals—particularly in the U.S. where whole grain cereals are common breakfast foods.\n\nAnother study found that Australian adults who ate a big breakfast consumed more fiber, vitamins and minerals throughout the day than those who skipped it. They also consumed less added sugars, saturated fats and alcohol, which can all negatively affect heart health.\n\nBesides eating breakfast, there are a few things you can do to transform your morning routine into a tool to lower your cholesterol. The best part? They can be done in a relatively short amount of time! If you currently wake up and rush out the door with no self-care time, focus on adding one thing at a time instead of overhauling your morning routine overnight.\n\nDelay screen time. If you reach for your phone first thing in the morning, try to delay this as much as you can. It may seem unrelated to heart health, but Routhenstein notes how checking messages, notifications or the news can increase stress and start your day on a negative foot. “Taking 10 to 30 minutes screen-free to start your day helps reduce stress, improves mood and allows you to take control of your day and prioritize your health,” says Routhenstein.\n\nEat a balanced breakfast. Now you know that eating breakfast is important for heart health, but what you eat also matters. Experts recommend heart-healthy foods rich in fiber and low in added sugars and saturated fat. “Starting the day with a balanced breakfast—such as oatmeal, whole grains, lean protein and fresh fruit—helps stabilize energy and avoid the cholesterol-raising effects of sugary cereals and drinks,” says Dr. Gould.\n\nGet in some movement. “A brief period of movement, whether a brisk walk, stretching or light strength training, can improve circulation and support healthy cholesterol levels,” says Dr. Gould. In fact, physical activity is recommended as a first-line approach to managing high cholesterol. So go for a morning stroll, hit the gym or get in a quick stretch when you wake up.\n\nTake time to destress. Diet and exercise aren’t the only things that influence heart health—stress also plays a big role. “Stress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can raise cholesterol production, and it may also lead to unhealthy coping habits like overeating,” says Dr. Gould. Especially if you live a high-stress lifestyle, take a few minutes (or more!) in the morning to destress, whether through movement, breathwork, journaling or anything else that works for you!\n\nAs tempting as it may be to rush out the door without eating a balanced breakfast, this habit could silently raise your cholesterol. Heart health experts recommend eating a high-fiber, high-protein morning meal that’s low in added sugars and saturated fat. This helps stabilize your energy levels, buffer the liver’s production of cholesterol and prevent overeating later in the day. In addition to eating a nutritious breakfast, try to take time to move and destress at the start of your day instead of checking your phone to prevent cholesterol-raising cortisol spikes.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTexas quarterback Arch Manning will return to school and play for the Longhorns in 2026, ending months of speculation about whether he would declare for the 2026 NFL draft following his first season as a starter.\n\nESPN's Dave Wilson reported on Monday night that Manning’s father, Cooper Manning, confirmed the decision. “Arch is playing football at Texas next year,” he said.\n\nTexas officials also told ESPN the program fully expected Manning to return, even though the redshirt sophomore was eligible to enter the draft. Manning’s decision gives the Longhorns a boost at the game’s most important position as they look to build on a late-season surge.\n\nDuring a media event in Orlando, Florida, ahead of the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl against Michigan on Dec. 31, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said another year of college football would benefit Manning.\n\n“He’s a young man who’s gotten better as the season’s gone on, and not only physically, but mentally, maturity-wise,” Sarkisian said. “I would think he’s going to want another year of that growth to put himself in position for hopefully a long career in the NFL.”\n\nSarkisian added that Texas’ unfinished goals likely factored into the decision.\n\n“We left some meat on the bone with an opportunity to be SEC champs, national champs,” Sarkisian said.\n\nManning played his best football down the stretch as Texas went 6-1 late in the season and pushed for the College Football Playoff. Entering the bowl game, he has completed 227 of 370 passes for 2,942 yards, 24 touchdowns and seven interceptions, with only two picks over the final seven games.

    "fullText": "Dolphins can't keep handing Tua Tagovailoa the QB Job after Steelers loss originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf you were to just look at the stat sheet on Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers, you’d think Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa wasn’t the problem. But that’s what happens when you’re down two scores in the fourth quarter and allowed to pad the numbers.\n\nTagovailoa finished the night completing 22 of 28 pass attempts for 253 yards, two touchdowns and one interception, posting a passer rating of 113.4. Despite the inflated numbers, the Dolphins still lost 28-15 and were eliminated from playoff contention. Miami will now miss the postseason for the second straight year.\n\nAnd with that, Miami Herald columnist Barry Jackson believes it should be the last time the Dolphins simply hand Tagovailoa the starting job.\n\n\"After another stinker for three quarters in prime time, after another disappointment in less-than-pristine weather, there really is no justification for the Dolphins to play another game, let alone another season, with Tua Tagovailoa as the uncontested starter,\" Jackson wrote.\n\nJackson even went as far as suggesting the Dolphins at least give backup Quinn Ewers a look.\n\n\"No, let’s be clear: If the Dolphins have no better options in 2026 while they pay off the final guaranteed year of Tagovailoa’s contract, then play him. If Quinn Ewers gets a chance in December and flops, then go back to Tagovailoa.\n\n\"But never again should Tagovailoa simply be gifted a starting job. What, exactly, is there left for the Dolphins to learn about Tagovailoa?\"\n\nAs Jackson pointed out, numbers matter — but the most relevant ones continue to work against Tagovailoa.\n\nIn cold-weather games, long considered Miami’s kryptonite, the Dolphins have now lost 14 straight when kickoff temperatures are below 40 degrees, including Monday night in Pittsburgh. Tagovailoa has been part of six of those losses.\n\nIn prime-time games, he’s 2-8 over his last 10 appearances. Against teams with winning records, he’s 3-12 over his last 15.\n\nDuring last offseason, Tagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension following a Pro Bowl season. He has done little since to justify it.\n\nHis production dipped significantly last season, though injuries played a role, as he missed six games with multiple issues. He's healthier this season but the only teams he and the Dolphins can beat are those who have less wins than they do.\n\nStill, the contract is now the hinge point for Miami’s future decisions.\n\nTagovailoa is scheduled to earn $56.4 million next season. Financially, only a post–June 1 trade would offer meaningful relief — and that scenario appears unlikely. Even a post–June 1 release would leave Miami with $99.2 million in dead cap over the next two years, according to Spotrac.\n\n\"The biggest mystery is how McDaniel could have seen all of Tagovailoa’s limitations and still advocated for the Dolphins to give him the four-year, $212 million extension ($167 million guaranteed) that has left the franchise shackled,\" Jackson wrote.\n\n\"Who, exactly, was looking out for the franchise when a handful of people running it thought it was a good idea to extend a quarterback who was injury-prone, athletically limited, and had failed multiple times against stout defenses?\"",

He has represented five teams throughout his time in the league, looking forward to having a solid role in Detroit’s success this year.\n\nGreen’s highlight against White took place midway through the fourth quarter. He stole the ball from Payton Pritchard then went on the fast break, leaping in the air as he threw down the one-handed dunk over White.\n\nHe was irate about the lack of a foul call and got hit with a technical foul.pic.twitter.com/QNZ1lctjn5\n\n— ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) December 16, 2025\n\nIt was a great highlight for Javonte Green to get against Derrick White, helping the Pistons get the 112-105 win over the Celtics.\n\nDetroit got off to a slow start, trailing 33-35 after the first quarter. They got back on track from there on, outscoring Boston by 15 points in the last three period of regulation.\n\nPerimeter shooting and ball movement made the difference in this matchup. The Pistons prevailed in both categories by knocking down 13 3-pointers and creating 21 assists. It wasn’t the same for the Celtics as they converted 10 triples and dished out 16 assists.\n\nFour players scored in double-digits for Detroit in the win. Cade Cunningham led the way with a stat line of 32 points, 10 assists, four rebounds, and a steal. He shot 11-of-21 from the field, including 6-of-10 from beyond the arc, and 4-of-4 from the free-throw line.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes continue to be a wide receiver factory.\n\nTheir latest developmental project may just be star wideout Carnell Tate. Through nearly three seasons thus far in Columbus, Tate has continued to improve leaps and bounds, catching the attention of NFL Draft analysts and other football personnel.\n\nOne of those is ESPN's Matt Miller who confidently gave Tate an eye-popping NFL comp: Minnesota Vikings star wideout Justin Jefferson.\n\nMiller was particularly impressed with the way both men play their spots when it comes to spreading the field alongside their ability to generate yards after contact (YAC).\n\n“I know, I know… this sounds wild. But it’s on point when comparing Tate to what Jefferson was at LSU – not what he is doing now in the NFL. Both are 6-foot-3 and around 200 pounds,\" Miller wrote. \"They each excelled as route runners while also being dominant on 50-50 balls thanks to vertical skills and body-adjustment ability. “I’m not predicting Tate will take the NFL by storm and become a top player as quickly as Jefferson did, but their skill sets are very similar when evaluating where they were entering the draft.”\n\nJefferson has caught 42 touchdowns thus far through nearly six NFL seasons. His best season statistically came in 2022 when the Vikings won the NFC North with a 13-4 record. Jefferson's season saw him hit a career-high 1,809 yards while catching eight touchdowns.\n\nThe Vikings would go on to lose in the NFC Wild Card Round to the New York Giants at home, 31-24.\n\nAlthough Tate has more time to grow and develop into a big-game receiver at the next level, it's a telling sign to see that those in the know see immediate benefit for whichever team decides to draft him.",

The guard is averaging 7.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.0 steals for the Braves.\n\n“Kestin has developed into a leader for our team this year. He has been asked to play in different roles this season and has taken them on, giving 100 percent with each one,” said North Summit coach Aaron Preece.\n\n“He has made shots when needed and also gets the ball to the open player when they have a better shot, which has helped his teammates look for the same. He loves the game and plays every game with heart and hustle, which in turn helps his team play the same.”\n\nRichins enjoyed his best performance of the season last Friday, scoring 22 points in North Summit’s dominant 65-35 win over Valley.\n\nJessica Maynard, Mountain Ridge (Sr.)\n\nJessica Maynard is tearing it up for Mountain Ridge early this season.\n\nThe senior is averaging 20.3 points this season to go along with averaging nearly 10 rebounds per game.\n\n“Jess is an amazing ball player. She can impact the game in a variety of ways on both sides of the ball. On offense she can score inside or space and stretch the floor shooting. Defensively she can defend the other teams best guard on the perimeter, or anchor the defense as our rim protector,” said Mountain Ridge coach Matt Montgomery.\n\nLast week she scored 15 points in a 51-41 win over Davis and then 23 points in a 45-38 win over Lehi.\n\nMontgomery said Maynard is all about the wins.\n\n“But what makes her special is she doesn’t care who scores, she just wants to win. If you leave her open she’ll shoot, if you double her she’s just as happy setting up a teammate. She’s the ultimate team player and leader, and she’s a joy to coach,” said Montgomery.\n\nSean Cannon’s dedication in the pool is paying big dividends this season.\n\nThe junior owns the best time in the entire state in two events this season and ranks in the top 10 in five other events.\n\n“Sean consumes all things swimming, all things made available to him. If there is something written, video, or spoken about swimming, Sean can make it part of his training and convert it into success,” said Canyon View coach Kirt Brown.\n\nA year ago, Cannon was the 3A champ in the 200 free and finished third in the 100 butterfly.\n\nFast forward to this season, and his time of 1:45.99 is the best mark in the entire state six weeks into this season. His time of 21.66 is also the top mark in Utah.\n\nHis other top statewide marks are in the 100 back (second), 100 fly (third) and 200 individual medley (fifth).\n\nLayleigh Turner, Syracuse (So.)\n\nA year after making a big splash as a freshman at Syracuse, Layleigh Turner has picked up right where she left off.\n\nSix weeks into the season, she owns the best time statewide in the 200 free (1:57.04) in addition to ranking in the top five in five other events.\n\nShe owns the second best time in the 500 free and 100 backstroke.\n\n“Layleigh is a dream to coach. She absolutely has the heart of a champion. She just simply refuses to lose and if she does happen to lose a race, she doesn’t let it get her down. She uses it as motivation and works that much harder for the next meet,” said Syracuse coach Kyle Cunningham.\n\n“Not only is she a great swimmer, she’s a great student too and it’s an honor for me to be her coach. I’m grateful to have a front row seat to watch this amazing young woman in action. I have no doubt that she will be successful in anything she decides to do in life”\n\nAs a freshman last year, Turner won the 6A title in the 200 individual medley and finished second in the 100 breaststroke.\n\nKaden Martineau enjoyed a sensational weekend at the Juab Winter Classic dual meets this past weekend.\n\nHe went 8-0 at the tournament at 150 pounds, winning three matches by fall and five by technical fall.\n\n“Kaden has always been a hard worker, but he is especially focused and motivated this year. This week he was able to see the results of his efforts, going 10-0 on the week. We anticipate more success for Kaden as the season progresses. We are grateful for example and leadership on our team,” said Juab coach Joel Holman.\n\nAs a freshman last season, Martineau finished with a 46-12 record and placed third at state at 144 pounds. He’s looking to take the next step this season and win an individual state title.\n\nAlexandra Gates, Cedar Valley (Sr.)\n\nAlexandra Gates ran her record to 9-0 with a great performance at the Corner Canyon Cup last weekend.\n\nGates went 5-0, winning all five matches by fall at 138 pounds. She was named the most outstanding wrestler at the tournament.\n\n“Alex has worked really hard the past year and a half by going to camps and traveling with her club, Champions Wrestling Club, to Western Regionals and nationals. Plus she is a former Teen Miss Eagle Mountain who is fierce on the wrestling ma,” said Cedar Valley coach Erik Gonzalez.\n\nGates is one of the top wrestlers in 6A this year as she looks to build on last year’s 135-pound state title in 5A as she finished the season with a 32-9 record.",

    "fullText": "The Denver Nuggets got a 39-point, 15-rebound, 10-assist triple-double from Nikola Jokic on Jokmas and the Nuggets held off the Rockets in overtime for a 128-125 win.\n\nJokic fouled out in overtime so it was on Jamal Murray and the Jokic-less Nuggets to close the game. They did just that.\n\nAlperen Sengun missed a game-tying 3 late in OT and the Nuggets held on for the win. Murray finished with 35 points.\n\nHere’s what else stood out from the game.\n\nJokic and the Nuggets starters came out a tad lackadaisical in the 1st quarter, but a wild bench lineup was there to jumpstart Denver‘s offense and defense. An early injury to Peyton Watson (right hip contusion) knocked him out of the 1st half, so it was Zeke Nnaji stepping in on the Nuggets’ second unit. And he held his own.\n\nJonas Valanciunas owned the paint in the 1st half, tallying 8 points on a perfect 4-4 shooting. Tim Hardaway Jr. was aggressive and accurate too. Hardaway finished the 1st half with 10 points.\n\nOverall, the Nuggets went +4 in the non-Jokic minutes in the 1st. They were only +1 in the Jokic minutes.\n\nDenver, behind the bench, shut down the Rockets offense in the 2nd quarter. The Nuggets held the Rockets to 21 points in the 2nd quarter.\n\nA couple no-calls also got the Rockets frustrated. It led to technical fouls on both coach Ime Udoka and Alperen Sengun. It’s what led to a double-digit 1st half lead for the Nuggets. Denver grabbed momentum and was able to lead 58-51 at the break.\n\nJokic and Alperen Sengun battled back and forth for most of the 4th quarter after Valanciunas fouled out around the 9-minute mark. Both bigs hit tough shot after tough shot.\n\nJokic got up to 37 points in the 4th quarter and had a straight-away 3 to win the game as time expired. His shot bounced off the back iron and to overtime we went.",

And they proved as much on Monday night when they defeated the Los Angeles Kings 4-1. However, the game was overshadowed a bit by an incident between Mikko Rantanen and Darcy Kuemper that left the Kings goaltender injured.\n\nDuring an offensive possession for Dallas, Rantanen battled Kings defenseman Brian Dumoulin in front of the net. After a shot on goal, Rantanen ran into Kuemper, sending him to the ice. Kuemper left the game after this, and he did not return to the ice.\n\nDarcy Kuemper has left the game after being bumped into by Mikko Rantanen 🤕\n\nThere was no call on the play besides Dallas' goal being waved off. pic.twitter.com/u2mIYIuZZb\n\n— Gino Hard (@GinoHard_) December 16, 2025\n\nAfter the game, Rantanen was asked about this incident. He told the media that he had no intention of hitting the Los Angeles netminder. And he hoped Kuemper wasn’t seriously injured as a result of their collision.\n\n“Yeah, it was unfortunate. I was just driving the net, and thought my route was top of the blue [crease]. Dumoulin was there kinda pushing me that way. I didn’t see he [Kuemper] was top of the blue. Unfortunate to see him go down. I told him right away, ‘my bad.’ Hopefully he doesn’t miss too much time,” the Stars star said, via team reporter Robert Tiffin.\n\nThis is not the first controversial moment Rantanen has been involved in this year. He delivered a hit that left New York Islanders defenseman Alexander Romanov injured earlier this year. Two games later, he also hit Calgary Flames forward Matt Coronato, causing him to briefly leave that contest.\n\nRantanen was suspended for the hit on Coronato. Whether any discipline comes as a result of this play remains to be seen. For now, the focus is on Kuemper’s health. Hopefully, Kuemper can return to the ice with no complications sooner rather than later.",

    "description": "Cameron Heyward explains the accountability culture fueling the Steelers after their dominant Monday night win over the Dolphins.",
    "fullText": "Steelers’ Cameron Heyward breaks down Pittsburgh’s accountability culture after MNF win appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers delivered a statement win on Monday Night Football, shaking off adversity and asserting control in a 28-15 victory over the Miami Dolphins (6-8) at Acrisure Stadium.\n\nAfter the game, veteran defensive leader Cameron Heyward appeared on SportsCenter with Scott Van Pelt, where he was asked about quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ leadership and what sparked the offensive turnaround.\n\n“I think there’s a level of accountability he brings to the group, the way he challenges guys, the way he communicates,” Heyward explained. “There’s a lot of stuff you see during practice, but then off the field, he’s working with guysmaking sure they’re, you know, it’s not just the offensive line, it’s the wide receivers, the tight ends, they all play a big role in what he wants to do. And he just keeps talking about it.”\n\nHeyward’s comments highlighted that Rodgers’ impact goes beyond what fans see on game day. Despite being new to Pittsburgh, Rodgers has embedded himself into every position group, reinforcing expectations and standards across the offense.\n\nPlaying in frigid conditions, Pittsburgh initially appeared headed for a conservative, grind-it-out contest. Instead, the game flipped dramatically just before halftime.\n\nBeginning with their final possession of the first half, the Steelers’ offense caught fire. That offensive surge turned a tight game into a commanding win and reinforced the Steelers’ identity as a team built on collective responsibility.\n\nVan Pelt followed up by asking whether Rodgers’ demanding style earns him leeway with teammates. Heyward made it clear that accountability runs in both directions.\n\n“I think that and then we can hold him [Aaron Rodgers] accountable too,” Heyward added. “We let him know when he’s playing like c*** too. “I think we all know we all have to play at a different level to games in this league and you know, it starts with myself…We all have to be accountable, we know we’re not running from that and we have a mature group that really talks about that.”\n\n\"Well, we let [Aaron Rodgers] know when he's playing like crap too.\"\n\nCameron Heyward talks about how the Steelers keep each other accountable 😂 pic.twitter.com/YDdNohXpJQ\n\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) December 16, 2025\n\nThat mindset was evident on the field. Rodgers delivered precise throws, including a key touchdown pass to DK Metcalf that effectively sealed the game. The veteran field general finished the game with 224 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, the Steelers’ defense overwhelmed Miami, punctuated by Heyward’s punishing sack of Tua Tagovailoa, he also recorded five tackles in this game. The win pushed Pittsburgh to 8-6 and strengthened its grip on the AFC North race, while Miami’s playoff hopes faded.",

    "fullText": "South Korea’s women added to the trophy cabinet twice in 2025, but underwhelming results in several international friendlies leave Shin Sangwoo and his squad with a point to prove at next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup.\n\nThe year started on a high note for the South Korean women’s national team with victory in February’s Pink Ladies Cup. Korea won all three of their matches and did so with a better goal difference than Russia to claim the title. Sure, it wasn’t the most glorious win, given the calibre of the teams involved and the status (or lack thereof) of the tournament itself, but it was a win nonetheless, and the squad returned from the UAE with a nice shiny platter to put in the KFA trophy cabinet.\n\nIn May, Shin Sangwoo’s warriors were off to Australia for a pair of friendlies against the hosts of next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup. Buoyed by large and enthusiastic home crowds, the Matildas proved tough opponents. The results — a 1-0 loss and a 2-0 loss — weren’t terrible, but did lay bare a weakness in Korea’s goalscoring department, the team’s inability to get across the line (or at least, to do so in the right goal) damaging their confidence.\n\nThere were two more friendlies in late spring, this time on home soil as Korea played host to Colombia. The first match in Incheon ended as a 1-0 loss; Korea did well to hold their own fast and physical opponents. Despite the frustrating lack of goals, the home fans were treated to a moment of elation as Kim Minjeong made a cracking save to deny Usme’s penalty. There was further joy a few days later in Yongin as Jung Minyoung finally put an end to the goal drought just two minutes into her international debut. An unfortunate own goal from Kim Jinhui brought the sides level before the final whistle, but on some level, the friendlies were a success. Manager Shin experimented with formations, and everyone in the squad got minutes on the pitch, with the exception of third goalkeeper Woo Seobin.\n\nIn July, South Korea hosted the EAFF E-1 Football Championship (East Asian Cup), with both men’s and women’s competitions happening in venues around Gyeonggi-do in what must have been a busy week for those guys who shake the giant Taegukgi. The tournament saw Korea’s women take on some of their toughest competitors in the region. Against China, the final score was 2-2; Ji Soyun’s dramatic injury-time equaliser earned her a nomination for the KFA’s goal of the year. Another late equaliser, this time from Jeong Dabin, made it 1-1 against fierce rivals Japan. As Japan and China faced each other on the final matchday, a win for either team would secure them the title, but yet another stalemate in that match opened the door for Korea to swoop in and claim the victory, which they did with an assured 2-0 victory over Chinese Taipei (Taiwan).\n\nThus, Korea’s women lifted the East Asian Cup for the first time in 20 years, proving in the process that they can still compete with the regional football powerhouses despite a relative lack of investment and development in the women’s game. More accuracy in front of goal could have helped deliver a more decisive victory, but a trophy is a trophy, not to mention a huge confidence booster.\n\nThere were no A matches in the October international window due to the National Sports Festival, the KFA electing to avoid clashes so that the squads of the eight WK League clubs wouldn’t be left depleted. The national team still made headlines in the autumn as it emerged that several players had demanded equal treatment with the men’s team, allegedly threatening to boycott A matches unless their conditions, including business class flights for international fixtures, were met. The news divided more reasonable fans and provided ammunition for keyboard warriors who seem to think that national pride would be better served by defunding and disbanding the women’s team than supporting the Taeguk Warriors in women’s competitions.\n\nIt remains unclear in which section of the plane the squad travelled for their latest excursion, a trip to Europe for friendlies against Wales and the Netherlands. Shin should have fancied his team’s chances in Malaga as they lined up against a Welsh team on an 11-match winless run (spoiler alert: now 12), but it was his side that conceded first; Kim Minji scored her international debut in the second half to bring things level. After appearing the weaker side for much of the match, Korea seemed to gain some momentum after the goal, but it was too late.\n\nThe Netherlands were always going to be difficult opponents for Korea. In fact, Korea could learn a thing or two from the Dutch model of rapidly developing the domestic women’s football environment with the explicit core aim of improving the national team. WSL all-time top goalscorer Vivianne Miedema completed a hat-trick within 35 minutes; her teammates made it 5-0 by half time. The second half was goalless, but the damage was already done. The scoreline in this match, and England’s 8-0 thumping of China in front of 74,611 fans at Wembley a few days earlier, serve as a stark reminder that the top teams in Asia still have catching up to do when it comes to the women’s game.\n\nConceding five goals in 45 minutes and scraping a draw against a lower-ranking team on bad form: these are not results that inspire confidence, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and this pudding — next year's Asian Cup — is still in the oven, raw in the middle.\n\nUnder Shin Sangwoo the women's national team is making progress. He has used this year's A matches to play around with the squad, trying out several formations and starting lineups. Goalkeeper Kim Minjeong has solidified her place in the first eleven. A much-discussed \"new generation\" of players has been welcomed into the fold, with 12 players receiving their first senior call-up and 17 making their international debut this year. More of Korea's squad than ever before are playing regularly for fully professional clubs in the top leagues of Europe and North America.\n\n(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)\n\nLooking ahead to the Asian Cup, there is still work to do (isn't there always?). South Korea's women need to be more effective in front of goal. Goals, especially early goals, will boost the squad's confidence as they progress through the tournament and face tougher opposition. Players need to avoid becoming downcast when chasing a result, and trust themselves and their footballing ability rather than resorting to messy tackles and avoidable fouls.\n\nMental toughness will be key in the group stage as Korea are set to face hosts Australia. The Matildas have beaten them twice in 2025, and the home crowd will only be more animated for this major tournament. They are also joined in Group A by Iran and the Philippines. The former didn't make it past the group stage in their Asian Cup debut in 2022, while the latter became the underdog story of that tournament, securing their first-ever qualification for the FIFA Women's World Cup by reaching the semi-finals; they were beaten to the final by South Korea.\n\nNext year's Asian Cup has been a clear driving force behind the women's national team activities in 2025. It's a natural focal point when reflecting on this year, and South Korea's performance at the tournament may well alter the 2025 narrative when looking back in a few months' time. With drastic changes coming to the WK League in 2026 and the national team undergoing a generational shift, women's football in Korea is at a crossroads — let's hope this year's trophies are a sign of things to come.",

    "fullText": "Rams vs. Seahawks prediction, odds, pick for Week 16 Thursday Night Football appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nFollowing a wild week of upsets and new storylines in Week 15, Week 16 of the NFL season will begin with this upcoming divisional tilt on Thursday Night Football. The Los Angeles Rams (11-3) will visit the Seattle Seahawks (11-3) as the two sides battle for the top of the NFC West. Check our NFL odds series for the Rams-Seahawks prediction and pick.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams continue their run atop the NFC standings with their latest 41-34 win over the Detroit Lions in Week 15. This tilt against the Seahawks will be their most critical remaining game in deciding the division, but they’ve already secured their berth to the playoffs.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks beat the Indianapolis Colts 18-16 in Week 15, marking their fourth-consecutive win. They’ve won eight of their last nine games with their lone loss during that stretch coming at the hands of Los Angeles. They’ll hope to even the rivalry as the home underdogs.\n\nNFL Odds courtesy of DraftKings\n\n*practice status as of 12/15/2025*\n\nLos Angeles: WR Jordan Whittington, Limited (back) / OL Alaric Jackson, Limited (ankle) / DE Braden Fiske, DNP (ankle) / WR Davante Adams, DNP (hamstring) / S Jaylen McCollough, DNP (illness)\n\nSeattle: LB DeMarcus Lawrence, Limited (quad) / WR Cody White, Limited (abdomen) / OT Charles Cross, DNP (hamstring)\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are 5-2 at home. The Los Angeles Rams are 5-2 on the road.\n\nThe Seahawks are 10-4 ATS overall, 4-3 ATS at home. The Rams are 10-4 ATS overall, 5-2 ATS on the road.\n\nThe Rams are 3-1 against NFC West opponents. The Seahawks are 2-2.\n\nThe Rams are 7-3 outright, 8-2 ATS in their last 10 games against the Seahawks.\n\nBoth teams are 7-2 ATS in their last nine games.\n\nSeattle is 0-5 ATS in their last five home games against the Rams.\n\nThe Rams are 11-2 ATS in their last 13 games on the road.\n\nThe most significant tidbit for either team will be the potential loss of Rams’ WR Davante Adams, who went down with a hamstring injury in Week 15. He leads the NFL in receiving touchdowns (14) and has been an integral part of the added success for QB Matthew Stafford and the busiest WR in football Puka Nacua. The injury to Adams will certainly benefit opposing defenses as they can key their efforts in on Nacua, but it was notably TE Colby Parkinson with a career day against the Lions. With all the weapons around him, Matthew Stafford and this offense are poised for a deep run in the playoffs.\n\nThe Seahawks, who fell to the Rams 22-19 five weeks ago, should rest easy knowing they lost by just a field goal despite QB Sam Darnold’s four interceptions. Their defense played well for the most part given how much time they spent on the field, so this second game at home should see a better showing from the Seattle offense. WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba is making his case for the NFC’s best offensive player as his connection with Sam Darnold has been great to watch all season.\n\nThis Rams’ defense, while solid all season, had a much more lenient effort against the Lions in Week 15. They allowed 30 or more points to their opponent for just the third time all season, the second occasion in the last three weeks. They’re 1-2 when allowing 30+ points on defense, so silencing this Seahawks’ dual-threat offense will be of utmost importance.\n\nWith the injuries seen on the Rams’ offense, expect both defenses to have a significant impact in this game. The Seahawks’ defense ranks fifth league-wide with 22 total takeaways, while the Rams are right behind them with 21 total takeaways. Neither quarterback has been perfect up to this point, so don’t be surprised if we’re in for a low-scoring game on the short week for both teams.\n\nThis matchup will have everything at-stake and while both teams are likely heading for the playoffs, their race atop the NFC West division has been the tightest we’ve seen in all the league. The Rams were the more impressive team in Week 15, but it came at a cost as several key players were banged-up in the process.\n\nThe Seahawks certainly didn’t look their best against Philip Rivers and the Indianapolis Colts, but it was a tough game to scheme against with the unpredictability of a new quarterback under center. I expect the Seahawks to look much better during this game as their defense rises to the occasion against Matthew Stafford. For our final pick, we’ll take the Seattle Seahawks to win a defensive battle at home in this one.\n\nFinal Rams-Seahawks Thursday Night Football Prediction & Pick: Seattle Seahawks +1.5 (-122); UNDER 44.5 (-115)",

Murray made 14 of his 15 free-throw attempts.\n\nThe win was the Nuggets’ fifth in a row and was their first home victory since Nov. 8.\n\nThe final 1:40 of regulation had four ties and four lead changes, a stretch capped off by a free throw by Murray that tied the game with 2.3 seconds remaining after an away-from-play foul on Houston’s Amen Thompson. Denver retained possession after the free throw, but a 3-point attempt by Jokic from the top of the key was long.\n\nThe Nuggets took a 124-117 lead after a Spencer Jones 3 with 2:59 remaining in overtime, but the Rockets clawed back, getting within three with the ball and 13 seconds remaining. Alperen Sengun missed a contested 24-foot 3 with 4.9 seconds remaining, allowing Denver to hold on for the victory.\n\nSengun paced the Rockets with 33 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first triple-double of the season. Kevin Durant added 25 points, seven assists, five rebounds and five blocks for Houston, which lost its third consecutive road game.\n\nA Nuggets team that was already down two starters in Aaron Gordon (hamstring) and Christian Braun (ankle) played much of the game without starting guard Peyton Watson, who left six minutes into the first quarter after suffering a right trunk contusion.\n\nRockets: At the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday.\n\nNuggets: Host the Orlando Magic on Thursday.\n\nAP NBA: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "description": "After an unlikely offensive explosion in Week 15, Mike Tomlin gives props to Steelers running back Kenneth Gainwell after MNF.",
    "fullText": "Steelers’ Mike Tomlin breaks down Kenneth Gainwell’s MNF breakout game appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nWhile the Pittsburgh Steelers had a number of heroes in their Monday Night Football win over the Miami Dolphins, from Aaron Rodgers, to Jonnu Smith, DK Metcalf, and their defensive line, one player who stepped up in a major way was one of the more unlikely members of Arthur Smith’s offense: Kenneth Gainwell.\n\nThat’s right, in a game where Jaylen Warren was active after being questionable right up to gametime, Gainwell exploded in a major way, amassing 126 yards between the ground and the passing game to lead the Steelers to their eighth win of the season.\n\nAsked about Gainwell’s huge game against a team teetering on the edge of playoff elimination, Tomlin celebrated the 2025 free agent addition for seemingly always bringing something to the table when his team needs it most.\n\n“When things are less than ideal, that’s what we’ve come to expect from him. Jalen missed Dublin, for example, and he played big out there,” Tomlin explained. “He brings that energy, man. He’s a football player, and we’re thankful to have him on our team.”\n\nOriginally drafted in the fifth round out of the 2021 NFL Draft out of Memphis, Gainwell was an instrumental part of multiple Philadelphia Eagles teams with Super Bowl aspirations, including the team that actually got it done earlier this year against the Kansas City Chiefs. Landing in Pittsburgh in free agency after the season, Gainwell has rapidly become a favorite of Rodgers, where his pass-catching abilities have allowed him to become a reliable outlet pass when his early reads are locked up.\n\nShould opposing teams put a little more respect on Gainwell’s name after his huge showing? Probably, as with a playoff push rapidly approaching, it’s clear Gainwell will only become a bigger part of the Steelers’ offense down the stretch.\n\n#Steelers Mike Tomlin.

    "fullText": "Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic posts eye-popping stat line despite fouling out vs. Rockets appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nIn a barnburner of a matchup between two of the best and most physically-imposing teams in the NBA in the Denver Nuggets and the Houston Rockets, it was the former that came out on top, 128-125, in overtime. It was a back-and-forth affair that saw incredible shot-making come from both teams, especially towards the end of regulation. But come overtime, the Rockets lost steam and the Nuggets did just enough to come away with the win.\n\nNikola Jokic was imposing his will all night long, finishing with yet another insane stat line (which is now getting pedestrian by his standards) of 39 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists. The Nuggets star fouled out in the end, but even foul trouble wasn’t enough to slow down the three-time MVP in his domination of the Rockets.\n\nJokic and Alperen Sengun were locked in a battle that seemed very personal. The Rockets star was looking to snatch Jokic’s crown, but the Nuggets star had every answer in the bag, as expected of a player as great as he is.\n\nSengun recorded a triple double of his own, putting up 33 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, and he’s closer to the caliber of player Jokic is than some would think. Nonetheless, the Nuggets star is arguably the best player in the league at the moment, and everyone saw why.\n\nThe good news is that Jokic and Jamal Murray are both healthy, so Denver has the foundational pieces of the two-man game that has been the cornerstone of their offense for nearly a decade. But with Peyton Watson having to exit early with a right trunk contusion, the Nuggets now have three key cogs in Watson, Christian Braun, and Aaron Gordon currently on the mend.\n\nThe Nuggets will now look to improve their 19-6 record when they return to action on Thursday night in a tussle against the Orlando Magic.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City were clinical in the final third in their 3-nil win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday. Erling Haaland’s brace and Phil Foden’s second-half strike saw Pep Guardiola’s side break open a tough fixture against a quality team. Crystal Palace had their chances at Selhurst Park but they failed to put any of them away. While at the other end of the pitch, City took their chances and left London with a valuable three points. Looking at Manchester City’s attack, they seemingly have a real point of difference to their rivals which could be crucial as this season unfolds.\n\nIt has emerged as this season has progressed which players form Manchester City’s best attack. Erling Haaland, Rayan Cherki and Jeremy Doku have been Pep Guardiola’s preferred front three. Phil Foden can also be added to this equation given the fact that he has scored 10 goals this season and his best attributes are often on display in the final third. What City have that their rivals do not is a blend of pace, power, guile and trickery. Each of Manchester City’s attacking players complements the other. It gives them a consistent weapon that their rivals seemingly do not.\n\nManchester City’s attack is even more dangerous when you factor in the runs made by Matheus Nunes and Nico O’Reilly from the full-back positions. Pep Guardiola’s side is also now scoring from set-pieces which completes the picture. What we saw in Manchester City’s win over Crystal Palace is that City’s attack can decide games ruthlessly.\n\nCrystal Palace had their chances at Selhurst Park. But they didn’t take them. Erling Haaland took his first chance against Crystal Palace. He headed home a superb Matheus Nunes cross to give City a first-half lead. Rayan Cherki drove at the Palace defence to set up Phil Foden’s second-half strike. Erling Haaland put away a penalty with ease in the 89th minute to wrap up three points for City. Although City didn’t create a host of chances at Selhurst Park, they ruthlessly put away those that came their way. It helped them pick up a crucial three points and showed that City have a quality that their rivals do not at this point of the season.\n\nAs of right now it does appear that Manchester City and Arsenal could be battling it out for the Premier League title. Aston Villa cannot be discounted at this stage. Whether or not they can sustain their impressive form remains to be seen.\n\nArsenal’s strengths are their defence and their prowess at set-pieces. Mikel Arteta’s side has them as the foundation of their play. They do have quality throughout their squad but it seems that those are their strongest attributes. Whether or not Arsenal’s set-piece prowess is sustainable across a full season remains to be seen. In contrast to the strength of Mikel Arteta’s side, you do sense that Manchester City’s attack can sustain their impressive form and efficiency. Erling Haaland’s goal-scoring prowess won’t fade. Jeremy Doku, as long as he isn’t injured, looks to have gone up a level. Phil Foden is an elite player and has returned to form this season. Rayan Cherki has adjusted to life at Manchester City quicker than expected. There is no reason why Manchester City’s attack cannot prove to be the difference across this season.\n\nThe Manchester City attack looks to be their point of difference this season. Pep Guardiola has a variety of weapons to unleash and it does seem that City’s attack could be key to them picking up extra points across this Premier League season. They did that against Crystal Palace and you do sense that it won’t be the last time that Manchester City’s attack helps them pick up points in tough matches this season.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca has given a blunt response to how his relationship is with the Chelsea board.\n\nIt all came out over the last few days and it has become the big story around Chelsea right now.\n\nAfter the Everton win on Saturday, Maresca went on a rant in his post match presser where he said he had just had the “worst 48 hours” since joining Chelsea.\n\nHe said he had had a lack of support, but didn’t reveal any more when pressed. So of course everyone wanted to know more.\n\nThe Blues boss doubled down on his comments yesterday in the press conference ahead of the League Cup game tonight. Or at least that is what we thought.\n\nIt seems he was pressed more about his relationship with the sporting directors and the owners in the embargoed section of the interview that was released late last night, and he decided to actually answer that question.\n\nPaul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart with Behdad Eghbali.\n\nAs cited by The Evening Standard, when sked how strong his relationship with the Chelsea co-owner Behdad Eghbali and co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart is, he replied: “It’s ok, it’s good.”\n\nPushed on whether it is as good as it has always been, he added: “I think so, yes.”\n\nMaresca was also asked whether he feels the head coach is the most important figure at Chelsea, or indeed at any football club.\n\n“I think the ones that put the money in are, not the manager,” he said. “It is the owner. I think they are the most important people in a football club.\n\n“The manager is an important part but is not the most important one.”",

    "description": "A fierce overtime battle saw Houston push Denver to the absolute limit. This clash showcased incredible offensive firepower and a controversial finish.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets opened their road trip in Denver on Friday night with a loss, but if this was meant to be a tone-setter for the next stretch, it did exactly that. This was the first of six straight road games, and it came against a Nuggets team sitting at 18-6 and second in the Western Conference, desperate to snap a four-game home losing streak. Houston entered at 16–6, third in the West, 8-4 on the road, and still leading the league in second-chance shots. Both teams had three days of rest. The building was packed. The energy was loud. And the game felt like it mattered from the jump.\n\nDenver may be a top-tier first-quarter team, but it was Houston that set the early tone. Alperen Şengün came out dominant, putting up 10 points and two assists by the halfway mark of the first quarter. The Rockets controlled pace, moved bodies, and forced Denver to work for everything. Despite Nikola Jokic and Şengün both being part of the rare group of centers averaging seven or more assists, it was Houston that finished the first quarter up six.\n\nThe second quarter is where momentum began to wobble. Denver rattled off an 8-0 run as Houston struggled to finish clean looks. Reed Sheppard started the night ice cold, going 0-for-6 before finally knocking down his first bucket- a three. The Rockets still controlled much of the half, but the final three minutes slipped away. At the break, Denver led 58-51, with both Kevin Durant and Şengün sitting at 14 points apiece. Ime Udoka picked up a technical arguing with officials, and the tone of the game was officially set: physical, emotional, and unforgiving.\n\nHouston responded the right way in the third. The Rockets came out hot, reclaiming the lead and marking the tenth lead change of the night. At that point, Durant had missed just two shots all game, sitting at 5-for-7, while Josh Okogie was a perfect 5-for-5. Bruce Brown’s reckless finish resulted in a flagrant foul on Durant, sending him to the line. Durant continued doing what he does best- drawing contact, living at the stripe, and knocking down that familiar midrange fadeaway. Okogie added an insane dunk and nine points in the quarter, and an 8-0 Houston run capped by a steal and Sheppard dunk swung momentum back again.\n\nThe fourth quarter turned into a grind. Bodies flying under the rim. Jokic living at the free-throw line. Things got personal between Jokic and Şengün. Leads changed hands possession by possession. With 1:30 left, it was tied at 109. Then 112. Then 115 with 20 seconds remaining. Shot-making reached absurd levels. Every seat in the building was standing.\n\nŞengün gave Houston a one-point lead with two seconds left after the Rockets went a perfect 5-for-5 on their final possessions. A controversial trip was called on Amen Thompson, Houston challenged, and lost. One free throw sent the game to overtime.\n\nIn OT, Jokic picked up his fifth foul on Şengün- both now at five- and Denver opened with a 3-0 run. Durant sent Jokic to the line again before Jokic fouled Reed Sheppard and was ejected after an unsuccessful Denver challenge. Houston called timeout down three with 6.8 seconds left. That was as close as it would get.\n\nJokic finished with his twelfth triple-double of the season: 39 points, 15 rebounds, 10 assists, shooting 48-percent from the field and 55.6-percent from deep. Jamal Murray added 35 points and five assists. For Houston, Şengün posted a monster triple-double of his own with 33 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, shooting just under 52-percent. Durant added 25 points, seven assists, and five blocks. Jabari Smith Jr. provided balance, knocking down four of six from three.\n\nHouston didn’t leave Denver with a win, but they left with proof. This road trip just started, and if this game was the bar, the Rockets aren’t backing down from anyone.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United played out a hugely entertaining 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in their Premier League game at Old Trafford on Monday.\n\nThe hosts should have won, considering they had taken the lead on three separate occasions, but Ruben Amorim’s confusing tweak at the back did not help the team, nor his young defenders.\n\nThe draw means the Red Devils are currently sixth in the league standings, two points off the top four. However, things will get trickier from here on in.\n\nThe head coach will be without his key attacking duo, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo, as both will depart for the Africa Cup of Nations. Noussair Mazraoui has already left, and both Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain sidelined.\n\nAnd in further bad news, Casemiro has also been ruled out of the match against Aston Villa next Sunday as he saw his fifth individual yellow against the Cherries.\n\nHe saw yellow for a foul on Marcus Tavernier in the second-half, who subsequently scored from the resultant free-kick to hand the visitors a 3-2 lead.\n\nFive yellow cards mean an automatic one-game suspension, and the Brazilian missing out against an in-form Villa means Amorim will have a mountain to climb at Villa Park.\n\nThe former Real Madrid superstar scored against the Cherries, and has generally looked much better as compared to last season, partly due to the team playing only once a week.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who the Portuguese tactician turns to in Casemiro’s absence. He does not seem to rate Kobbie Mainoo in a deeper role, and he has openly criticised Manuel Ugarte this season.\n\nThe Uruguayan has started three times in the league this season, and in all three occasions, the 20-time English league champions have come out on the losing side. He also has been linked with a January exit.\n\nWith Unai Emery’s side winning each of their last six games, Amorim will be hoping for an inspired showing from his available players.\n\nAfter his encouraging cameo, fans will be hoping Mainoo gets the nod in place of Casemiro.\n\nFeature image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Fabrizio Romano confirms that Liverpool have a 'genuine interest' in pushing for a £65m deal. The Reds are putting plans in motion.\n\nLiverpool's January plans are in motion with just a few weeks before the transfer window opens. It's one that they have to get right after struggling to put together a functional team over the summer.\n\nThe Reds spent an awful lot of money - record-breaking amounts - in an attempt to overhaul and improve a title-winning squad. However, they haven't really achieved that.\n\nMore work needs to happen, it seems, and they'll give that a go in the winter window. A centre-back almost certainly needs to arrive, for instance, after Giovanni Leoni's injury.\n\nBut that's not all. Liverpool also need to deal with the fact they never replaced Luis Diaz on the wing, while Mo Salah also doesn't have proper backup - a problem given he's off to the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nIt sounds as though the club may have chosen the answer to that problem, however.\n\nFabrizio Romano confirms that Liverpool do have ‘genuine interest’ in signing Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth. The Ghanian is expected to leave the Cherries in 2026 thanks to a release clause in his contract.\n\nThat clause is worth £65m, per the BBC, but drops down a bit next summer. Semenyo is very much available, then - but Liverpool are far from the only team keeping an eye on that.\n\n“[There’s] genuine interest but there are more clubs also keen,” says Romano to Give Me Sport. \"It’s going to be a race also with more sides, depending on what the player wants to do.”",

    "fullText": "Alperen Şengün vs. Nikola Jokic was exactly what it was supposed to be — and somehow still more than that. Two centers running offenses, bending defenses, and turning a regular-season game in December into something that felt personal by the fourth quarter.\n\nŞengün set the tone early. Ten points and two assists halfway through the first quarter, controlling pace against a Nuggets team that’s one of the best first-quarter groups in the league. Denver came in hot, winners of four straight on the road, but Houston punched first. And a big reason they could was Şengün’s comfort operating as a hub, not just a scorer. That’s the shared DNA here— both Jokic and Şengün are part of a rare class of centers averaging seven-plus assists, and the game flowed through them every possession.\n\nJokic answered the way Jokic always does. Scoring, rebounding, passing— all of it effortless and relentless. By the end of the night, he had his twelfth triple-double of the season with 39 points, 15 rebounds, and ten assists, shooting efficiently from everywhere on the floor. Şengün matched him punch for punch, finishing with a 33-point triple-double of his own on just under 52-percent shooting.\n\nAnd then it got physical. Fouls piled up. Trips to the line became inevitable. Things got personal under the rim. Both players picked up five fouls. Every possession mattered. Every touch felt loaded.\n\nThis wasn’t about flash. It was about control. About two centers dictating tempo, forcing decisions, and dragging entire defenses into uncomfortable places. The Nuggets survived it. The Rockets didn’t.\n\nBut if this matchup told us anything, it’s that Şengün belongs in these conversations",

Nashville continued its hot streak in the opening minutes of the period as Michael Bunting netted his ninth of the year to give the Predators the lead back, 2-1.\n\nOn a Dvorsky delay of game call, Forsberg took a wrist shot from the point and beat Hofer for his second goal of the night, on the power play, and to bump the lead to 3-1. Reid Schaefer scored his third career goal on a turnaround shot from the blue line to open up the game, 4-1.\n\nIn the third period, Dvorsky responded with his second goal of the game.

    "fullText": "Ben Roethlisberger walks back controversial Mike Tomlin take originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger clarified comments he made earlier this month regarding Mike Tomlin’s future with the Steelers. On his podcast, Roethlisberger seemed to suggest that it might be time for the Steelers to move on from Tomlin at the end of the current campaign.\n\nHowever, Roethlisberger claimed that he was simply saying that Tomlin has the right to move on if he wans to, not that the Steelers should move on from him.\n\n\"Just because I said there's a time for some new things, that's just saying that I think Coach Tomlin -- if he wants to move on, he has every right to move on, it's not they should,\" Roethlisberger said, via ESPN. \"It's up to him, and he's earned that right. If he wants to do something else, he can and he should and we should honor him whenever that time comes. Maybe he wants to coach here for another 10 years, that's fine too.\"\n\nRoethlisbereger’s initial comments came amid a wave of calls for the Steelers to part ways with Tomlin, who has been the head coach in Pittsburgh since 2007.\n\n“It’s being talked about around here a lot. Maybe it’s time,” Roethlisberger said at the time. “Maybe it’s ‘clean house’ time. Maybe it is. … And I like Coach Tomlin. I have a lot of respect for Coach Tomlin, but maybe it’s best for him, too. Maybe a fresh start for him is what’s best, whether that’s in the pros (or not).”\n\nThe Steelers have won two straight games since those original remarks, so perhaps that contributed to Roethlisberger’s decision to couch his comments. The Steelers currently hold pole position in the AFC North, and they have a 61 percent of qualifying for postseason play for a third consecutive season.\n\nBut, the criticism when it comes to Tomlin is based around his lack of postseason success as of late. The Steelers haven’t won a playoff game since 2016 when they lost in the AFC Championship to the New England Patriots. So, simply securing a playoff spot likely won’t silence Tomlin’s detractors. Only a postseason win, or two, will do that.",

    "fullText": "Australia have opted against recalling batter Usman Khawaja for the vital third Ashes Test – a match Ben Stokes has called the most important game in his time as England captain.\n\nEngland, 2-0 down after defeats in the first two Tests, must win in Adelaide to keep their hopes of regaining the urn alive.\n\nDefeat would mean a fourth successive series loss in Australia, extend England's run without winning the Ashes to at least 12 years and heap significant pressure on the tourists' management.\n\nThe positions of Stokes, head coach Brendon McCullum and managing director Rob Key would all come under significant scrutiny.\n\n\"Throughout my career I've been involved in quite a few big moments. This is another one and I'm really, really looking forward to it,\" Stokes told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I've enjoyed the build-up, I've enjoyed the pressure of what this game means. As it's come closer and closer, it's become a lot easier. That's how I deal with big things and big moments – look at it front on, take it on and deal with all the emotions that come with it.\n\n\"What else are you supposed to do? Don't let the moment overcome me or feel like it's going to control me. I'll go out, put all that stuff to one side and do what I need to do in every situation I get put in, and try my absolute best.\"\n\nPat Cummins will return to lead Australia after missing the first two Tests as he recovered from a back problem.\n\nPace bowler Cummins and off-spinner Nathan Lyon are added to the Australia team that won the second Test in Brisbane, replacing Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett.\n\nIt means no return for opener Khawaja, who missed the Test at the Gabba because of back spasms. Khawaja turns 39 on Thursday and may have played the last match of an 85-Test career.\n\nTravis Head and Jake Weatherald will continue as the opening partnership\n\nAustralia were 2-0 ahead in the last Ashes in the UK in 2023, only for England to fight back to draw 2-2.\n\nCummins said his team have learned a \"few lessons\" from that experience and was also adamant he is fit enough to bowl without restrictions in Adelaide.\n\nThe 32-year-old has not played since the tour of West Indies in July after scans detected the back issue.\n\nMatch fitness could be crucial in the high temperatures that are forecast for when the match starts on Wednesday (23:30 GMT Tuesday).\n\n\"I had 16 weeks completely off bowling, made sure the bone heals well and from there it's ramping up,\" said Cummins.\n\n\"Normally you ramp up over maybe three or four months, but that would have meant missing the Ashes.\n\n\"We set on a pretty aggressive plan to get up in six or seven weeks. I haven't had any hiccups. I'm feeling great, probably better than I would have thought. The back has healed well, so, here we are.\"\n\nAustralia XI for third Ashes Test: Travis Head, Jake Weatherald, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Pat Cummins (captain), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland.\n\nEngland XI: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (captain), Jamie Smith, Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Josh Tongue.\n\nListen to the Test Match Special preview podcast\n\nBarking out orders: Stokes wants England to 'show a bit of dog'\n\nIn the aftermath of the defeat in the second Test in Brisbane, Stokes said his dressing room is \"no place for weak men\".\n\nEngland have spent part of the time since that loss on holiday in Noosa, then had three days of training in Adelaide.\n\nThe tourists have made one change to their side, with Josh Tongue coming in for fellow pace bowler Gus Atkinson. Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir has again been overlooked in favour of all-rounder Will Jacks.\n\nAll-rounder Stokes took over as captain in 2022 and his partnership with McCullum yielded 10 wins in their first 11 matches in charge.\n\nAfter those first 11 games, England have won 16 and lost 15 of their next 33. They have not won any of their five-Test series against Australia or India.\n\nSince pace bowler Mark Wood was ruled out of the series with a knee problem, Stokes remains as one of only four members of the England squad to have been part of a previous Ashes tour.\n\nThe 34-year-old has suggested that some of the newcomers to Australia had struggled with the atmosphere of the series.\n\n\"I've got an understanding that quite a few guys in the dressing room won't have that to fall back on,\" said Stokes. \"What I feel like I've had to do is fall back on my own experiences, and voice that to the group.\"\n\nDefeats in Ashes tours often bring sweeping changes to England teams. A loss in Adelaide would not only heap pressure onto Stokes, McCullum and Key, but also raise questions about the international futures of a number of players.\n\n\"I've probably used my voice more than I have at any time in the past three and a half years,\" said Stokes.\n\n\"We are in a situation where we know we need to win three games. There are a few things I felt the group needed to hear, but also a few things I felt like I needed to say to be able to go out there with a very clear head about this week.\n\n\"I've definitely left no stone unturned in terms of the mental side of the game, and what we're going into.\n\n\"Expectations around what we want to see this week – I've spoken a lot about fight, determination and grit over the last couple of days. I hope we're going to see a completely different thing, purely because of the situation we find ourselves in here.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Poor start to the game set the tone; Predators were quicker to pucks most of the night; second period reared its ugly head again; Dvorsky's first multi-goal, point game of NHL career a positive, as was seeing Kelly Chase's inspirational speech",
    "fullText": "ST. LOUIS – Sometimes, there are greater things in life that a game.\n\nYes, the St. Louis Blues lost yet again, and they lost for the second time in five days to the Nashville Predators, 5-2, at Enterprise Center on Monday (and we’ll get into it in observations, of course), but on a night when the Blues honored Hockey Fights Cancer Night and if you missed Kelly Chase’s speech in the first period, you need to take a moment to see it, as it happened right after Blued captain Brayden Schenn and Nashville’s Nic Hague fought for that purpose alone:\n\nWe all stand with you, @Chasenpucks39.#HockeyFightsCancer | @SitemanCenter pic.twitter.com/XDeYfv0fsy\n\n— St. Louis Blues (@StLouisBlues) December 16, 2025\n\nAs for the game itself, the Blues (12-15-7) got goals from Dalibor Dvorsky, his first multi-goal and multi-point game in the NHL, but it was a tough night for Joel Hofer, who allowed four goals on 25 shots.\n\nThe Blues lost to the Predators (13-15-4) for the second time in five days and have been outscored 12-4.\n\nLet’s look at Monday’s game observations:\n\n* Kelly Chase is an inspiration – For those that want, or need, to be versed on what the former Blues enforcer has been dealing with, it’s acute myeloid leukemia, a form of blood and bone marrow cancer first diagnosed in 2023, and the amount of chemotherapy, stints in cancer treatment centers, hospitals, the whole gamut this man has had to go through, I can’t even imagine.\n\nSo when he spoke with his doctor, Dr. Ramzi Abboud, former Blues captains in Garth Butcher and Hall of Famer Bernie Federko, it was inspiring on this night:\n\nKelly Chase is an inspiration man. Guy just keeps fighting and fighting. With Bernie Federko and Garth Butcher. #stlblues pic.twitter.com/zKzwJ0O6zD\n\n— Lou Korac (@lkorac10) December 16, 2025\n\nBlues coach Jim Montgomery was a teammate of Chase’s with the Blues in 1993-94, and he had two positives from this game. One was Dvorsky, and the other?\n\n“And then the other real positive was seeing my old teammate Kelly Chase,” Montgomery said. ‘When you think about Blues players and why this city and the fans love Blues players, is because of the fight inside of players like Kelly Chase. I was incredibly lucky to be and I’m very thankful for the season I had to play with him where I could learn from someone that competes like him night in, night out for his teammates and to see him up there and the message he delivered, I got a little emotional listening to him, and how can you not because you’ve got to love the man.”\n\nSchenn, a fellow Saskatoon native like Chase, would obviously run through a brick wall if Chase asked him to.\n\n“Kelly’s been amazing to me, to my family, to my brother, to guys around this room, to the organization,” Schenn said. “I really mean it when I say it: he’s a guy that will literally do anything for anyone, and I think we all see that. He’s a guy that’s going through a battle of his own and he’s still trying to raise money and help people out. He has a mentality and a personality that he would do absolutely anything for anyone. I’ve learned so much from him, even before when I was with the Flyers, I knew him way back being a Saskatchewan guy, he’s taken care of me tremendously from a young age. I owe a lot to what I’ve learned on and off the ice to Kelly Chase.\n\nI’ve been to the Gozzer Ranch in the summertime in Idaho where he hangs out. He knows my parents well, he knows (Schenn’s brother) Luke well, he’s done fantasy hockey camps and different charity events in Saskatoon that we’ve attended. This guy, he’ll do absolutely anything for anyone. He raises a ton of money to help out people and I’ve heard him say it, it’s true when it comes to hockey players. He said, ‘Guys are an inch deep and a mile wide,’ with how they help out, which is true. You do anything you possibly can to help out everyone, but I think he’s a guy that really digs in and tries to help people as much as he can and he’s doing it nonstop.”\n\n* Dvorsky’s glimpse of youth shining – It was another first for Dvorsky, whose multi-goal and multi-point game was his first.\n\nBut the great sign of maturity is instead of gloating of his accomplishments on this night in a loss, the No. 10 pick in the 2023 NHL Draft only offered, “Obviously it feels good to score, but first of all, I’m disappointed that we lost. That’s the most important is the team win and it’s always nice, but a win would be better.”\n\nBut Dvorsky’s goals, each was set up well.\n\nThe first tied the game 1-1 at 10:06 of the first period on a setup by Hugh McGing, who stripped Nashville defenseman Nick Blankenburg of the puck after a Justin Faulk flip-in, then fed Dvorsky for a high slot wrister that beat Juuse Saros:\n\nDvorsky's all like \"this game is tied\" pic.twitter.com/xQuK2gO1kE\n\n— St. Louis Blues (@StLouisBlues) December 16, 2025\n\n“The positive is Dalibor Dvorsky, it was nice seeing him moving his feet, beat a goalie clean with his first goal,” Montgomery said.\n\nAnd on the second, with the game out of hand at the time, Dvorsky finished off a Jake Neighbours pass at the left post to cut the Blues’ deficit to 4-2 at 8:29 of the first period:\n\nDing dong Dvorsky scores again pic.twitter.com/nt2Iu1EE9b\n\n— St. Louis Blues (@StLouisBlues) December 16, 2025\n\nDvorsky, who finished with 17:07 of ice time and three shots on goal, said it’s the kind of game that can fuel his confidence after coming in without a point in 11 straight.\n\n“It’s a step forward for sure,” Dvorsky said. “It boosts my confidence. I feel like I always try and play with confidence, but the two goals are good.\n\n“First of all we need to focus on winning the next game, but it’s always nice to score. I would never do it without the help of teammates. Great pass from ‘Ginger’ on the first one, then the whole PP unit did a great job on the second one, so it’s always about the teammates.”\n\n* First shift set the tone – The Blues had their top players on the ice, the Predators had their top players on.\n\nIt’s essential to begin the game the proper way, and the Blues did not after Nashville won the opening draw with former Blue Ryan O’Reilly, getting the puck in deep and the Blues were scrambling.\n\nO’Reilly collected a puck behind the net and fed Filip Forsberg in a tight area, and it was the first of three goals for Forsberg when he beat Hofer high on the short side from a sharp angle 27 seconds in for a 1-0 lead:\n\nBING BING BONG pic.twitter.com/eL0O6pNB5d\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 16, 2025\n\n“It’s a great example of not being prepared to start on time,” Montgomery said.\n\n* Another poor second period – The Blues came in, no secret to anyone, porous in the middle 20 minutes, and it didn’t get any better.\n\nThey were outscored 3-0 and fell to a league-worst minus-20 (48-28).\n\nFrom chasing pucks to turnovers to getting hemmed in, it was another case of generating little to nothing on one end to being bombarded at the other.\n\n“Too many turnovers, especially at the offensive blue line,” Montgomery said. “The old saying, and it’s a Ken Hitchcock saying, ‘play to the goal line and work and go to work together as a five-man unit, stay connected.’ If you had that mentality, if you look at our Friday night’s win against the Hawks (3-2), our first shift in the second, we won the draw, D-to-D, we gain the red line and we put it in, and that Schenn line went to work and we gained momentum off it, and our second period last game was really good. And it’s starts. You’ve got to be ready to start that period on time, you’ve got to be ready to start games on time.”\n\nThe Blues weren’t for a second straight period when once again, Nashville got a puck in deep, behind the net, and Michael Bunting wrapped around a puck through Hofer, a shot he should stop at 1:23 to make it 2-1 and give the Predators the lead for good:\n\n\"I think I'll do a wraparound\"\n-Bunts (obviously) pic.twitter.com/fb5iQqUqW1\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 16, 2025\n\nDvorsky’s ill-advised flip of a puck into the crowd from his own zone was the result of playing the puck too slowly, and three Predators converged on him, causing a delay of game minor and one that Forsberg scored his second of the game on at 5:31 to make it 3-1, a wrister from the high slot:\n\nFILthy on the power play 🤯 pic.twitter.com/rVJLvcPc6l\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 16, 2025\n\nAnd to cap things off, Hofer gave up a really bad one to Reid Schaefer at 18:45 to make it 4-1, a shot from near the blue line where the forward just spun and whirled the puck to the net that Hofer just missed:\n\nHIT 'EM WITH THE SPIN MOVE 🤩 pic.twitter.com/FDu38eIiTr\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 16, 2025\n\n“Obviously it’s something we’ve got to focus on and make sure we dive into,” Blues defenseman Colton Parayko said of second periods. ‘We’ve got to be better and I’m confident we will. We’ve got a strong group in here. It’s something we can obviously learn from and moving forward try to get better in the second.”\n\n* Getting beat to pucks, looking slow – The Predators were hungrier, faster to pucks throughout, and the result was much the same as other losses this season.\n\nWhen Forsberg added an empty-netter at 16:09 of the third period to make it 5-2, it marked the 12th time this season already – it only happened nine times all of last season – the Blues were beat by three goals or more.\n\nTheir goal differential is minus-37, which is far and beyond the worst in the NHL (Vancouver Canucks next at minus-23) and the 123 goals allowed is nine more than the next worst team, the Edmonton Oilers at 114.\n\n“Yeah, they were the better team,” Montgomery said of the Predators. “They were more connected, they supported each other. We always talk about puck support and winning goal lines and net fronts and second quicks is a term we use as well. Unfortunately we didn’t meet the tasks tonight in those areas.”\n\n* Injuries no excuse – The Blues won’t use the injury bug as an excuse. They are missing Dylan Holloway (high ankle sprain), Jordan Kyrou (lower-body injury), Jimmy Snuggerud (wrist), Nathan Walker (upper body) and Nick Bjugstad (upper body).\n\nThey’ve had to call up McGing, who has two points in three games, Matt Luff, who scored against the Chicago Blackhawks, and now they’re bringing up Otto Stenberg, the 25th pick in 2023.\n\n“Obviously a lot of injuries and that’s the nature of the game,” Parayko said. “There’s probably every team with almost some injuries. For us, it’s a mindset. We’ve got to come together and whoever’s playing that night is ready. That’s the biggest thing. You’ve got to be prepared. It’s next-man-up. We have great players in our locker room. Every night no matter who’s injured, guys are stepping up and a lot of guys are playing extremely well. As a group collectively, we’ve just got to support each other, just get the job done.”\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "Manchester United were involved in an emotional rollercoaster of a game last night against AFC Bournemouth.\n\nIn an incredibly rare game, United had the lead three times but managed to only net a 4-4 draw with the Cherries.\n\nIt was a jaw-dropping attacking display, but they also demonstrated defensive frailties that would make a school team blush.\n\nNaturally, when The Peoples Person asked its readers to vote for player of the match, attackers dominated.\n\n37% of fans felt that Bruno Fernandes was the best player on the pitch, and his statistics once again backed this up.\n\nThe Portuguese midfielder has been in outstanding form this season, and he scored a world-class free kick to bring the scores to 3-3.\n\nFernandes also has the most assists in the league at seven and was on the money again yesterday as Casemiro headed in his corner.\n\nThe Brazilian has only recently come back from injury, but was incredibly lively versus Wolverhampton Wanderers last week and now Bournemouth.\n\nHe led the line as a false nine and almost spectacularly set up Bryan Mbeumo for what would have been a goal of the season contender, but the Cameroonian fired over.\n\nCunha drove his side forward in the second half in search of goals and grabbed United’s fourth, and just his second in a red shirt.\n\nWith Amad and Bryan Mbeumo going to the Africa Cup of Nations, Cunha will become even more important for the Red Devils over the Christmas period.\n\nIn a close third, Amad scored 28% of the vote.\n\nThe Ivorian was a live wire all evening and gave the Cherries’ full-back nightmares.\n\nHe scored the opening goal and showed everyone at Old Trafford what a miss he will be over the Christmas break as he goes on international duty.\n\nSince Halloween, the Englishman has been one of the club’s most consistent performers, and he led the charge brilliantly last night in the front press.\n\nHe has also found his scoring boots recently, with excellent strikes versus both Crystal Palace and Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nThree percent of fans voted for another player in the United side.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Andoni Iraola wasn’t sure if he wanted Bournemouth’s exhilarating encounter with Man Utd to end after coming away with a point at Old Trafford on Monday night.\n\nThe two sides traded the lead on five occasions in one of the entertaining contests of the season thus far, but the game ended four apiece to leave them with a share of the spoils.\n\nThe results means the Red Devils have jumped ahead of Liverpool into sixth place in the Premier League table, while the Cherries have moved up to 13th.\n\n“It had everything,” Iraola told Sky Sports after the full-time whistle. “Moments where you think it’s a loss. Moments where you think we have this one, we are comfortable.\n\n“Even at the end, at the last minute two clear chances, and I was thinking maybe win this one. It’s just a point, it’s not a lot in the standings, but I think we can take good and bad things from today.\n\n“We are two teams that play quite aggressively, quite open and probably today we attacked much better than we defended. I think the second goal is a cheap goal, it’s a cheap one for us to concede. The corner is not even a great header.\n\n“I think we finished really well the first half. When we scored the 1-1, and we were feeling comfortable and we were finishing the half much better. That’s why the goal we conceded just from the corner has hurt me because we were in a good moment.\n\n“You didn’t even know if we were happy finishing the game or give us one minute more.”\n\nRead – Amorim laments Man Utd inability to close out ‘fun’ Bournemouth draw\n\nRead More – Televised FA Cup third-round ties confirmed\n\nSee Also – 30 of the most iconic football photos ever taken\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "description": "Jansen will help shore up Texas' catching situation; Alexander brings left-handed pitching element to Rangers' staff.",
    "fullText": "Entering the 2026 MLB season, the Texas Rangers knew that they needed some help at the catcher's position. The club non-tendered Jonah Heim after the season ended, so Texas needed to do something.\n\nTherefore, the Rangers have picked up Danny Jansen, who played last season for the Tampa Bay Rays and Milwaukee Brewers. The ballclub also added left-handed pitcher Tyler Alexander to their pitching staff. Besides Alexander, there's been some reporting from MLB.com that Texas might be close to a deal with Alexis Díaz.\n\nJansen agreed to a two-year contract for a reported $14.5 million with an option for 2027. Alexander is joining Texas on a one-year deal.\n\nJansen's defense is something that the Rangers really must have liked a lot. Last season, Jansen had 14 blocks above average. Jansen, though, has spent time during his MLB career on the injured list. In 2025, though, he managed to appear in 98 games, hitting .215 with a .720 OPS.\n\nHe avoided going on the injured list last season, too. When hitting, Jansen is known for pulling the ball and putting it in the air. The Rangers hope that Jansen continues that trend next season, too.\n\nWe’ve signed C Danny Jansen to a two-year contract with a mutual option for 2028 and LHP Tyler Alexander to a one-year contract. pic.twitter.com/CjvnRpvioo\n\n— Texas Rangers (@Rangers) December 16, 2025\n\nAlexander will be a strong addition to the Rangers' bullpen. In seven MLB seasons, Alexander has a 4.63 ERA while playing for four MLB clubs. This also is a coming home of sorts for Alexander, who played high school ball at Southlake Carroll in Southlake, Texas, which is just miles away from Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\n\nAlexander played his college ball at TCU in Fort Worth, so that put him in close proximity to go and see Rangers games while he was in college.\n\nAs for Díaz, he played for three teams last season and put together a not-so-impressive 8.15 ERA. That happened on the heels of a pretty outstanding 2023, when Díaz was an All-Star, and posted a 3.99 ERA in 2024.\n\nTexas set a foundation for its bullpen last season. With Alexander and, hopefully, Díaz coming on board, that just adds some additional arms that Rangers manager Skip Schumaker can look at to bring in as needed.\n\nWhile at the Winter Meetings last week in Orlando, Fla., Rangers general manager Ross Fenstermaker talked about what type of pitching philosophy the team is taking at this time.\n\n\"Last year, we wanted to get back to dominating the strike zone, so we targeted pitchers with a historical track record of throwing strikes and attacking the strike zone,\" Fenstermaker said. \"I think it's going to be much of the same going forward. But that is kind of a fundamental truth and a through point for us in terms of our pitching philosophy.\"\n\nLook for these additions to the Rangers' roster to come through for Schumaker, Fenstermaker, and Rangers president of baseball operations Chris Young in 2026.\n\nRemember to join our RANGERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "description": "Former NBA star Paul Pierce didn't hold back when he described the Lakers' poor decision-making in the final minutes of Sunday's win over the Suns.",
    "fullText": "Late in the third quarter of their Sunday matchup against the Phoenix Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers started to play the type of winning defense that their fans have been practically begging for. During a stretch of roughly 10 minutes that extended into the fourth quarter, they scored 24 unanswered points and forced seven turnovers, allowing them to take a 95-77 lead.\n\nHowever, after that outstanding spurt, the Lakers fell back into their old bad habits on both ends of the floor. They started to walk the ball upcourt and milk the shot clock, as if they were merely looking to conservatively protect their lead rather than build on it and hold off Phoenix. That behavior played right into Phoenix's hands, and they ended up having to pull out a 116-114 victory by the skin of their teeth after the Suns made a couple of big mistakes in the final seconds.\n\nIt was another reminder that the Lakers still have a lot of work to do in order to seriously contend for the NBA championship.\n\nHall of Famer Paul Pierce went off on them during a recent episode of the \"No Fouls Given\" podcast for the way they gave up their lead in the last several minutes of Sunday's game. He said the Lakers — and the Suns — had very poor basketball IQ in the final minutes of that contest, and that neither team will be able to win a playoff series this spring as a result.\n\n\"This was one of the lowest IQ, last four minutes I've seen from both teams this season. And based on what I saw, neither one of these teams can win a playoff series.\"\n\nOf course, the Lakers are likely not as reckless and undisciplined as they looked in the final minutes of Sunday's game, nor are they as good a defensive team as they looked during that 10-minute stretch late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter. They do have an 18-7 record, which gives them an elite winning percentage, and are in third place in the Western Conference.\n\nBut Los Angeles hasn't played the Denver Nuggets, Houston Rockets or New York Knicks yet, and when it faced the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder a month ago, it lost 121-92, albeit with LeBron James still out due to sciatica. Continuing to put forth the same ineptitude they displayed late in Sunday's game will almost certainly result in decisive losses against the Nuggets, Rockets, Knicks and especially the Thunder.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Paul Pierce on Lakers' basketball IQ in crunch time of Sunday's game",

    "fullText": "The ATP men's tennis tour will introduce an extreme heat policy from 2026 after criticism from players who sweltered through some tournaments this year.\n\nThe move brings the ATP into line with the women's WTA tour, which has a long-standing policy, and sports such as Formula One which has its own measures to protect drivers.\n\nIn October, Danish tennis star Holger Rune called temperatures of more than 30C and humidity soaring past 80 percent at the Shanghai Masters \"brutal\".\n\n\"Do you want a player to die on court?\" Rune was heard to ask as he wilted in the fierce conditions.\n\nThe ATP has now acted, saying on Monday it was \"strengthening protections for players competing in extreme conditions\".\n\nThe new rules are based on the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), which measures air temperature, humidity, wind speed and other factors to estimate heat stress.\n\nUnder the measures, a player can request a 10-minute cooling break in best-of-three singles matches if the WBGT reaches 30.1 degrees or higher during the first two sets.\n\nPlay will be suspended when the WBGT exceeds 32.2 degrees.\n\n\"The new heat rule provides a structured, medically supported approach to managing extreme heat, with the objective of safeguarding player health,\" the ATP said.\n\nIt added it will \"also improve conditions for spectators, officials, ball persons and tournament staff\".\n\nThe rules do not apply to the four Grand Slams, which have their own policies.\n\nPreviously, decisions over weather conditions, including heat, were down to the on-site ATP supervisor in coordination with medical teams and local organisers.\n\nThe planet is on track to log its second hottest year on record in 2025, Europe's global warming monitor said last week.",

    "fullText": "A little boy faces the camera. He is pale and has no hair.\n\n\"I am seven years old and I have cancer,\" he says. \"Please save my life and help me.\"\n\nKhalil - who is pictured above in a still from the film - didn't want to record this, says his mother Aljin. She had been asked to shave his head, and then a film crew hooked him up to a fake drip, and asked his family to pretend it was his birthday. They had given him a script to learn and recite in English.\n\nAnd he didn't like it, says Aljin, when chopped onions were placed next to him, and menthol put under his eyes, to make him cry.\n\nAljin agreed to it because, although the set-up was fake, Khalil really did have cancer. She was told this video would help crowdfund money for better treatment. And it did raise funds - $27,000 (£20,204), according to a campaign we found in Khalil's name.\n\nBut Aljin was told the campaign had failed, and says she received none of this money - just a $700 (£524) filming fee on the day. One year later, Khalil died.\n\nAcross the world, desperate parents of sick or dying children are being exploited by online scam campaigns, the BBC World Service has discovered. The public have given money to the campaigns, which claim to be fundraising for life-saving treatment. We have identified 15 families who say they got little to nothing of the funds raised and often had no idea the campaigns had even been published, despite undergoing harrowing filming.\n\nNine families we spoke to - whose campaigns appear to be products of the same scam network - say they never received anything at all of the $4m (£2.9m) apparently raised in their names.\n\nA whistleblower from this network told us they had looked for \"beautiful children\" who \"had to be three to nine years old… without hair\".\n\nWe have identified a key player in the scam as an Israeli man living in Canada called Erez Hadari.\n\nOur investigation began in October 2023, when a distressing YouTube advert caught our attention. \"I don't want to die,\" a girl called Alexandra from Ghana sobbed. \"My treatments cost a lot.\"\n\nA crowdfunding campaign for her appeared to have raised nearly $700,000 (£523,797).\n\nWe saw more videos of sick children from around the world on YouTube, all strikingly similar - slickly produced, and seemingly having raised huge amounts of money. They all conveyed a sense of urgency, using emotive language.\n\nWe decided to investigate further.\n\nThe campaigns with the biggest apparent international reach were under the name of an organisation called Chance Letikva (Chance for Hope, in English) - registered in Israel and the US.\n\nIdentifying the children featured was difficult. We used geolocation, social media and facial recognition software to find their families, based as far apart as Colombia and the Philippines.\n\nWhile it was difficult to know for sure if the campaign websites' cash totals were genuine, we donated small amounts to two of them and saw the totals increase by those amounts.\n\nWe also spoke to someone who says she gave $180 (£135) to Alexandra's campaign and was then inundated with requests for more, all written as if sent by Alexandra and her father.\n\nIn the Philippines, Aljin Tabasa told us her son Khalil had fallen ill just after his seventh birthday.\n\n\"When we found out it was cancer it felt like my whole world shattered,\" she says.\n\nAljin says treatment at their local hospital in the city of Cebu was slow, and she had messaged everyone she could think of for help. One person put her in touch with a local businessman called Rhoie Yncierto - who asked for a video of Khalil which, looking back, Aljin realises was essentially an audition.\n\nAnother man then arrived from Canada in December 2022, introducing himself as \"Erez\". He paid her the filming fee up front, she says, promising a further $1,500 (£1,122) a month if the film generated lots of donations.\n\nErez directed Khalil's film at a local hospital, asking for retake after retake - the shoot taking 12 hours, Aljin says.\n\nMonths later, the family say they had still not heard how the video had performed. Aljin messaged Erez, who told her the video \"wasn't successful\".\n\n\"So as I understood it, the video just didn't make any money,\" she says.\n\nBut we told her the campaign had apparently collected $27,000 (£20,204) as of November 2024, and was still online.\n\n\"If I had known the money we had raised, I can't help but think that maybe Khalil would still be here,\" Aljin says. \"I don't understand how they could do this to us.\"\n\nWhen asked about his role in the filming, Rhoie Yncierto denied telling families to shave their children's heads for filming and said he had received no payment for recruiting families.\n\nHe said he had \"no control\" over what happened with the funds and had no contact with the families after the day of filming. When we told him they had not received any of the campaigns' donations he said he was \"puzzled\" and was \"very sorry for the families\".\n\nNobody named Erez appears on registration documents for Chance Letikva. But two of its campaigns we investigated had also been promoted by another organisation called Walls of Hope, registered in Israel and Canada. Documents list the director in Canada as Erez Hadari.\n\nWe asked Mr Hadari about his involvement in a campaign in the Philippines. He did not respond.\n\nWe visited further families whose campaigns were either organised by, or linked to, Mr Hadari - one in a remote indigenous community in Colombia, and another in Ukraine.\n\nAs with Khalil's case, local fixers had got in touch to offer help. The children were filmed and made to cry or fake tears for a nominal fee, but never received any further money.\n\nIn Sucre, north-west Colombia, Sergio Care says he initially refused this help. He had been approached by someone called Isabel, he says, who offered financial assistance after his eight-year-old daughter, Ana, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour.\n\nBut Isabel came looking for him at the hospital treating Ana, he says, accompanied by a man who said he worked for an international NGO.\n\nThe description Sergio gave of the man matched that of Erez Hadari - he then recognised him in a photo we showed him.\n\n\"He gave me hope... I didn't have any money for the future.\"\n\nDemands on the family did not end with the filming.\n\nIsabel kept ringing, Sergio says, demanding more photos of Ana in hospital. When Sergio didn't reply, Isabel started messaging Ana herself - voice notes we have heard.\n\nAna told Isabel she had no more photos to send. Isabel replied: \"This is very bad Ana, very bad indeed.\"\n\nIn January this year, Ana - now fully recovered - tried to find out what happened to the money promised.\n\n\"That foundation disappeared,\" Isabel told her in a voice note. \"Your video was never uploaded. Never. Nothing was done with it, you hear?\"\n\nBut we could see the video had been uploaded and, by April 2024, appeared to have raised nearly $250,000 (£187,070).\n\nIn October, we persuaded Isabel Hernandez to speak to us over video link.\n\nA friend from Israel, she explained, had introduced her to someone offering work for \"a foundation\" looking to help children with cancer. She refused to name who she worked for.\n\nShe was told only one of the campaigns she helped organise was published, she says, and that it had not been successful.\n\nWe showed Isabel that two campaigns had in fact been uploaded - one of them apparently raising more than $700,000 (£523,797).\n\n\"I need to apologise to [the families],\" she said. \"If I'd known what was going on, I would not have been able to do something like this.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, we discovered that the person who approached the mother of a sick child was actually employed in the place where the campaign video was filmed.\n\nTetiana Khaliavka organised a shoot with five-year-old Viktoriia, who has brain cancer, at Angelholm Clinic in Chernivtsi.\n\nOne Facebook post linked to Chance Letikva's campaign shows Viktoriia and her mother Olena Firsova, sitting on a bed. \"I see your efforts to save my daughter, and it deeply moves us all. It's a race against time to raise the amount needed for Viktoriia's treatments,\" reads the caption.\n\nOlena says she never wrote or even said these words and had no idea the campaign had been uploaded.\n\nIt appears to have raised more than €280,000 (£244,000).\n\nTetiana, we were told, was in charge of advertising and communications at Angelholm.\n\nThe clinic recently told the BBC it didn't approve filming on its premises - adding: \"The clinic has never participated in, nor supported, any fundraising initiatives organised by any organisation.\"\n\nAngelholm says it has terminated Tetiana Khaliavka's employment.\n\nOlena showed us the contract she had been asked to sign.\n\nIn addition to the family's $1,500 (£1,122) filming fee on the day, it states they would get $8,000 (£5,986) once the fundraising goal was met. The amount for the goal, however, has been left blank.\n\nThe contract showed an address in New York for Chance Letikva. On the organisation's website, there is another - in Beit Shemesh, about an hour from Jerusalem. We travelled to both, but found no sign of it.\n\nAnd we discovered Chance Letikva seems to be one of many such organisations.\n\nThe man who filmed Viktoriia's campaign told our producer - who was posing as a friend of a sick child - that he works for other similar organisations.\n\n\"Each time, it's a different one,\" the man - who had introduced himself as \"Oleh\" - told her. \"I hate to put it this way, but they work kind of like a conveyor belt.\"\n\n\"About a dozen similar companies\" requested \"material\", he said, naming two of them - Saint Teresa and Little Angels, both registered in the US.\n\nWhen we checked their registration documents, we once again found Erez Hadari's name.\n\nWhat is not clear is where the money raised for the children has gone.\n\nMore than a year after Viktoriia's filming, her mother Olena rang Oleh, who seems to go by Alex Kohen online, to find out. Shortly afterwards, someone from Chance Letikva called to say the donations had paid for advertising, she says.\n\nThis is also what Mr Hadari told Aljin, Khalil's mother, when she confronted him over the phone.\n\n\"There is cost of advertising. So the company lost money,\" Mr Hadari told her, without giving any evidence to support this.\n\nCharity experts told us advertising should not amount to more than 20% of the total raised by campaigns.\n\nSomeone previously employed to recruit children for Chance Letikva campaigns told us how those featured had been chosen.\n\nThey had been asked to visit oncology clinics, they said - speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"They were always looking for beautiful children with white skin. The child had to be three to nine years old. They had to know how to speak well. They had to be without hair,\" they told us.\n\n\"They asked me for photos, to see if the child is right, and I would send it to Erez.\"\n\nThe whistleblower told us Mr Hadari would then send the photo on to someone else, in Israel, whose name they were never told.\n\nAs for Mr Hadari himself, we tried to reach him at two addresses in Canada but could not find him. He replied to one voice note we had sent him - asking about the money he had been apparently crowdfunding - by saying the organisation \"has never been active\", without specifying which one. He did not respond to a further voice note and letter laying out all our questions and allegations.\n\nCampaigns set up by Chance Letikva for two children who died - Khalil and a Mexican boy called Hector - still appear to be accepting money.\n\nChance Letikva's US branch appears to be linked to a new organisation called Saint Raphael, which has produced more campaigns - at least two of which seem to have been filmed in Angelholm clinic in Ukraine, as the clinic's distinctive wood panelling and staff uniforms can be seen.\n\nOlena, Viktoriia's mother, says her daughter has been diagnosed with another brain tumour. She says she is sickened by the findings of our investigation.\n\n\"When your child is… hanging on the edge of life, and someone's out there, making money off that. Well, it's filthy. It's blood money.\"\n\nThe BBC contacted Tetiana Khaliavka and Alex Kohen, and the organisations Chance Letikva, Walls of Hope, Saint Raphael, Little Angels and Saint Teresa - inviting them to respond to the allegations made against them. None of them replied.\n\nThe Israeli Corporations Authority, which oversees the country's non-profit organisations, told us that if it has evidence founders are using entities as \"a cover for illegal activity\", then registration inside Israel may be denied and the founder could be barred from working in the sector.\n\nUK regulator, the Charity Commission, advises those wishing to donate to charities to check that those associations are registered, and that the appropriate fundraising regulator should be contacted if in doubt.\n\nAdditional reporting by: Ned Davies, Tracks Saflor, Jose Antonio Lucio, Almudena Garcia-parrado, Vitaliya Kozmenko, Shakked Auerbach, Tom Tzur Wisfelder, Katya Malofieieva, Anastasia Kucher, Alan Pulido and Neil McCarthy",

    "description": "Learn more about the top 10 countries the world can’t ignore in 2026 and find out how you can help.",
    "fullText": "For more than a decade, the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) annual Emergency Watchlist has accurately predicted 85-95 percent of the countries most likely to face a worsening humanitarian crisis in the coming year. The 2026 report highlights 20 countries and ranks the 10 at greatest risk, as a shifting world order leaves them to confront surging crises amid shrinking international support.\n\nThese countries are home to just 12 percent of the global population, yet account for 89 percent of global humanitarian need. In 2026, tens of millions of people are set to face deepening hunger, displacement and violence as international funding and political attention continue to decline.\n\nRead on to learn more about the 10 countries most likely to face a worsening humanitarian crisis in 2026 and find out how the IRC is responding.\n\nThe threat of renewed conflict between Israel and the Lebanese nonstate armed group Hezbollah is growing, even as approximately 80 percent of Lebanon’s population lives in poverty. Fighting between the two sides in 2024 displaced 1.4 million people in Lebanon and 96,000 Israelis. A return to large-scale conflict in 2026 would overwhelm Lebanon’s fragile public services and sharply escalate humanitarian needs.\n\nThe IRC has been working in Lebanon since 2012, delivering emergency and long-term support to Lebanese citizens and refugees. We offer legal services, protection, education and economic support, as well as mental, sexual and reproductive health services to people affected by and recovering from crises.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Lebanon.\n\nArmed groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda have engaged in an escalating campaign of kidnappings, forced recruitment and attacks on civilians in Burkina Faso for the past eight years. They have blockaded towns, cutting off more than a million people from food, water and health care. Recurring floods and droughts have also driven displacement and compounded the crisis. Pervasive insecurity has curbed the ability of humanitarians to reach the communities in greatest need.\n\nSince 2019, the IRC has been operating in Burkina Faso to address the humanitarian needs of populations affected by conflict and food insecurity. Its interventions span several sectors: water and sanitation, health, nutrition, economic recovery, protection, women's empowerment and governance. In close collaboration with authorities and local and international partners, the IRC works in accordance with humanitarian principles across seven regions to help communities survive, recover and rebuild their futures.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Burkina Faso.\n\nMali is facing escalating instability following changes in government, the withdrawal of French forces and the growing presence of the Russian Africa Corps. Armed groups—particularly Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM)—have expanded across central and southern Mali, attacking key trade routes and blocking the flow of fuel and goods into the capital, Bamako.\n\nThe IRC has been providing humanitarian assistance to crisis-affected populations in Mali since 2012, focusing on children, women and internally displaced persons. Our holistic approach integrates programming focused on health and nutrition, economic support, protection against violence and displacement, education, food security and equitable access to essential services.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Mali.\n\nConflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is growing despite a 2025 peace deal with Rwanda. Clashes involving the Rwandan-backed M23 armed group are escalating, as the group continues to expand its territorial control in eastern DRC and to exploit valuable rare earth and gold mining sites. Violence involving a number of local armed groups as well as forces from Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda is driving displacement, worsening food insecurity and increasing the risk of disease outbreaks.\n\nThe IRC has been operating in the DRC since 1996 to improve the well-being of crisis-affected communities, with a particular focus on women and children. In 2024, the IRC supported more than 305,000 people through its health, nutrition, WASH and education programs, while also strengthening child protection, advancing women’s empowerment and promoting community governance.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s DRC response.\n\nFive years after the military took power in 2021, the violent conflict in Myanmar between armed groups and the central military continues with no end in sight. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s humanitarian response remains severely underfunded, even after a major earthquake in 2025 escalated the crisis in the country, leaving a total of 16.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe IRC initiated an emergency response in Myanmar following Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The IRC has worked with local partners to expand its activities since then, serving people affected by the escalating conflict since February 2021, as well as marginalized and stateless communities. The IRC currently works across multiple sectors in six states, including providing emergency response to communities affected by the earthquake in March 2025.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s Myanmar response.\n\nHaiti has experienced political chaos since President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021, leaving the country without effective government or security. Armed gangs now control nearly all of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince. Internationally supported attempts to restore order have failed and the mandate of the Transitional Presidential Council, which currently rules Haiti, is set to expire in February 2026. Gangs could exploit this power vacuum, worsening the situation for civilians who are facing increasing violence, hunger and displacement.\n\nThe IRC has a history of providing humanitarian support in Haiti since 2010, working with a strong network of civil society organizations and local groups to respond to the needs of communities affected by internal displacement and longstanding gang violence. Since December 2022, our services have focused on cholera prevention for internally displaced people and support for survivors of violence, including gender-based violence.\n\nInterconnected domestic and regional dynamics are driving instability across northern Ethiopia that could tilt into widescale conflict. In addition, fighting perpetuated by armed groups continues to displace civilians. Climate shocks like droughts and floods worsen the humanitarian situation. With significant aid cuts, including a $387 million reduction from USAID in 2025, humanitarian agencies are ill-equipped to handle these overlapping crises.\n\nThe IRC began its operations in Ethiopia in 2000, providing support to refugees from neighboring countries as well as Ethiopians living in crisis-affected and underserved communities. The country continues to face recurring challenges, including conflict, natural hazards and climatic shocks, all of which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. We respond through multisectoral programming in health and nutrition, child protection, education, women’s protection and empowerment, economic recovery and development and environmental health.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s work in Ethiopia.\n\nSouth Sudan is at risk of sliding back into civil war, as the 2018 peace agreement collapses and the current government breaks down. Meanwhile, the civil war in neighboring Sudan has led to an influx of refugees, added to domestic tensions and disrupted vital oil exports, triggering economic turmoil and growing unrest among unpaid security forces. Relentless annual flooding is devastating food production and has trapped millions in a deepening humanitarian crisis.\n\nFor over three decades, the IRC has stood as a lifeline for communities across the region, responding to the urgent needs of those affected by conflict, displacement and disaster. As one of South Sudan’s largest humanitarian actors, we reach over a million people with health, protection, education and economic empowerment services. In an unstable nation, the IRC’s work is not only lifesaving, it is life-restoring, helping individuals and families rebuild with dignity and hope.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s South Sudan response.\n\nMore than two years of conflict have devastated Gaza and killed over 70,000 people, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. In October 2023, Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 200 hostages. The resulting military conflict between Israel and Hamas has systematically destroyed infrastructure, markets and essential food, water, shelter and health services across Gaza. Almost 80% of buildings have been damaged or destroyed and around 90% of the population have been displaced, often multiple times.\n\nA U.S.-led and regionally backed \"peace plan,\" including a ceasefire in October 2025, offers limited hope that external pressure may help reduce the intensity of conflict in 2026. However, there have been repeated violations of the October ceasefire in the weeks after it came into effect, and catastrophic levels of humanitarian need remain a certainty. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, escalating settler violence, financial restrictions and territorial fragmentation are eroding Palestinian security and daily life.\n\nThe IRC and our partners work to provide lifesaving services in the occupied Palestinian territory. In Gaza, that includes clean water, malnutrition treatment, protection and empowerment for women and children, early childhood development, psychosocial interventions, emergency reproductive health and other critical humanitarian needs. In the West Bank, the IRC and our partners continue to provide psychosocial interventions and early childhood development services, as well as build the capacity of community first aid workers.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s oPt response.\n\nFor the third year in a row, the IRC ranks Sudan atop the Watchlist as the country most likely to experience a deteriorating humanitarian crisis. Sudan’s catastrophic civil war, waged between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has killed over 150,000 people since April 2023 and is preventing lifesaving aid from reaching communities in need. The conflict has also triggered a devastating food crisis, forcing regions of Sudan into famine and causing deaths every single day.\n\nWhen the conflict began in 2023, the IRC adapted its programs and scaled up our response to address increased humanitarian needs. Despite operational challenges, the IRC continues to provide support in Blue Nile, Gedaref, Khartoum, River Nile, South Kordofan and White Nile states and is working on re-establishing its presence in Jazera state. We have an office in Port Sudan and are expanding our presence into other states, including Darfur.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s Sudan response.\n\nThe IRC’s Emergency Watchlist identifies the countries most likely to experience a deteriorating humanitarian crisis in 2026—but it also presents solutions. The IRC is on the ground in every single country on this list, delivering lifesaving aid to the communities most impacted.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee has over 90 years of experience helping people affected by crisis in more than 40 countries to survive, recover and rebuild their lives. We also help refugees and displaced people resettle and integrate into new communities in the U.S. and across Europe.\n\nOur ratings: We consistently earn top marks from charity watchdog groups for our efficient use of donor contributions and the effectiveness of our work.\n\nGet connected: Follow the IRC on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Bluesky and X.\n\nStay informed: Learn more about the world’s worst crises—and how you can help—in the full 2026 Emergency Watchlist.",

    "description": "The engineer behind Claude Code says vibe coding works for prototypes, but today's AI models still fall short for maintainable software.",
    "fullText": "The creator of one of the most popular AI coding tools says vibe coding can only go so far.\n\nBoris Cherny, the engineer behind Anthropic's Claude Code, said on an episode of \"The Peterman Podcast\" published Monday that while vibe coding has its place, it's far from a universal solution.\n\nIt works well for \"throwaway code and prototypes, code that's not in the critical path,\" he said.\n\n\"I do this all the time, but it's definitely not the thing you want to do all the time,\" Cherny said, referring to vibe coding.\n\n\"You want maintainable code sometimes. You want to be very thoughtful about every line sometimes,\" he added.\n\nClaude Code launched earlier this year as part of Anthropic's efforts to integrate AI more deeply into code development workflows.\n\nTop AI coding services like Cursor and Augment run on Anthropic's models, and even Meta uses Anthropic's models inside its coding assistant. Claude Code has also taken off with non-technical developers who want to build software with natural-language prompts.\n\nAnthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, said in October that Claude was writing 90% of the code in the company.\n\nFor critical coding tasks, Cherny said he typically pairs with a model to write code.\n\nHe starts by asking an AI model to generate a plan, then iterates on the implementation in small steps. \"I might ask it to improve the code or clean it up or so on,\" he said.\n\nFor parts of the system where he has strong technical opinions, Cherny said he still writes the code by hand.\n\nCherny said the models are still \"not great at coding.\"\n\n\"There's still so much room to improve, and this is the worst it's ever going to be,\" he said.\n\nCherny said it's \"insane\" to compare current tools to where AI coding was just a year ago, when it amounted to little more than type-ahead autocomplete. Now, it's a \"completely different world,\" he said, adding that what excites him is how fast the models are improving.\n\nAI-assisted coding has been gaining momentum across the tech world.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said last month that vibe coding is \"making coding so much more enjoyable,\" adding that people with no technical background can now build simple apps and websites.\n\n\"Things are getting more approachable, it's getting exciting again, and the amazing thing is, it's only going to get better,\" he said in a podcast interview with Logan Kilpatrick, who leads Google's AI Studio.\n\nPichai said during Alphabet's April earnings call that AI is writing over 30% of the new code at Google, an increase from 25% in October 2024.\n\nIt's \"fantastic\" how quickly developers can write software with AI coding tools, sometimes while \"barely looking at the code,\" said Google Brain founder Andrew Ng in May.\n\nFor non-technical developers, vibe coding has enabled them to automate parts of their jobs, prototype ideas, or build a creative product on the side, Business Insider reported last month.\n\nStill, leaders caution that the technology has limits. AI-generated code could contain mistakes, be overly verbose, or lack the proper structure.\n\n\"I'm not working on large codebases where you really have to get it right, the security has to be there,\" Pichai said in November.",

    "fullText": "Chris Hemsworth says his father's Alzheimer's diagnosis has reshaped how he thinks about family.\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of Jay Shetty's \"On Purpose\" podcast, the actor spoke about navigating his dad's diagnosis and filming \"A Road Trip to Remember\" with him, a documentary that follows their motorbike trip across Australia to revisit places from Hemsworth's childhood.\n\nHemsworth first found out he carries two copies of a gene that has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's while filming the National Geographic longevity documentary \"Limitless\" in 2022.\n\nOn the podcast, Hemsworth recalled how his father first reacted when the actor learned he was at high risk for Alzheimer's — and how things changed once his dad received his own diagnosis.\n\n\"I remember vividly that conversation of him sort of telling me not to be concerned about it. And then about two or three years later, my mom saying to me, 'I think we've got to get dad checked because there's these signs and things I'm concerned about,'\" Hemsworth told Shetty.\n\nTests revealed that both his parents also carried two copies of the same gene, and Hemsworth said he was \"immediately hit with the reality of what that meant\" for his dad.\n\nHe'd pushed aside his own results as a distant concern, but seeing his dad's diagnosis \"right in front of us\" was \"incredibly confronting,\" especially as his condition \"began to get worse.\"\n\nHemsworth said filming the documentary with his dad allowed them to have conversations that they hadn't had before.\n\n\"He says it in the documentary, but his biggest concern was being a burden. And that was heartbreaking to hear and consider,\" Hemsworth said. \"And I had never even, up until we shot the documentary, I didn't know even how he felt about it, you know, because I hadn't asked him.\"\n\nThe actor added that he was thankful for the chance to connect with his dad through the documentary, adding that it \"ignited something\" in his family to be more proactive, more present, and more connected because \"we're watching memories disappear in front of us.\"\n\nHemsworth said he and his brothers also try to offload the caretaking burden from his mom, adding that his dad's condition has prompted him to reevaluate his priorities in life.\n\nThe experience has forced him to slow down, and while he has films lined up for next year, he has \"turned down a lot of things\" so he can spend more time with his father, he said.\n\n\"I know I'm not going to get 10 years down the track and go, 'I'm glad I did those extra three or four films.' I'm going to say, 'I wish I spent more time with him, and with my mom, and with my brothers, and my wife, my kids, and family, and friends,'\" he said.\n\nThat has also reshaped his priorities as a father. Hemsworth has one daughter and twin sons with his wife, Elsa Pataky.\n\n\"It's attention, you know, they want your presence. They want your space. They want your focus,\" Hemsworth said of his kids. Regardless of the experiences and material things that money can offer, at the end of the day, kids \"just want your time,\" he added.\n\n\"And that for me has been terrifying at times, realizing how quick it's gone. I think I'll get to that, and then a year goes by, and I've done a couple of films or whatever and gone, 'Oh, wow, which part of their, you know, brief childhood have I missed?'\" Hemsworth said.\n\nHe added that he's become acutely aware of how quickly his children are growing up.\n\n\"They've taught me a greater awareness around the importance of this moment, because their personalities change every second and every day and every week and every month, and you kind of, you're mourning a version of that child every month because they're gone,\" he said.\n\nHemsworth isn't the only Hollywood star who has spoken about navigating a loved one's diagnosis.\n\nIn September, Emma Heming Willis said she mistook Bruce Willis' early symptoms for marital problems, and that his dementia diagnosis later gave her clarity.\n\n\"There was relief in understanding, 'Oh, okay, this wasn't my husband, it was that this disease was taking parts of his brain,'\" she told People. \"Once you hear that, I just softened.\"\n\nIn November, Jay Leno said caring for his wife amid her dementia diagnosis \"isn't work,\" but simply another chapter in their life together.\n\n\"There are going to be a couple of years that are tricky. So, the first 46, really great. But it's OK. It's not terrible. I'm not a woe-is-me person. I'm just lucky that I am able to take care of her,\" Leno told People.",

    "fullText": "Though the case is over, the video evidence that was to be presented in the harassment case against Rome Mayor Jeffrey Lanigan has been released — including an interview done by law enforcement.\n\nLanigan plead guilty to second-degree harassment on Dec. 12, stemming from an incident in the late afternoon of June 3 in the parking lot of Teugega Country Club in Rome between Lanigan and Brown.\n\nPer the sole charge, Lanigan stood accused of “pushing the victim against the rear passenger trunk area of a black Nissan, then restraining the arms of the victim before pushing the victim into a seated position in the front passenger seat of the above-mentioned vehicle.”\n\nIn a statement on June 4, Lanigan confirmed a verbal exchange between the two men, but said it had not turned physical. The statement describes Brown as having \"...flailed his arms and became verbally aggressive.\"\n\nIn the interview video, Lanigan can be seen speaking with a deputy with the Oneida County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"He had his hand up in the air when he saw it was me and was belligerently drunk,\" Lanigan said to a deputy. \"I brought his hand down and walked him over to the car and said 'sit down in the car and then I'll say my peace to you and then that's it and I'm done with it.'\"\n\nLanigan said the two \"...screamed at each other through the [car's] window\" and that was the extent of the altercation.\n\nWhen one of the deputies asked what his relationship with Brown was, Lanigan said the former mayor was a friend of 13 years who got him into politics. Lanigan alleges that things had been fine with Brown, up until Brown \"spoke badly\" about him on a podcast.\n\nArrests: Syracuse man arrested for car crash in Sullivan that left one dead\n\nCourt Proceedings: COs in Messiah Nantwi trial ask for separate trials\n\nSecurity: Law enforcement, mall officials talk security at Sangertown\n\n\"I called him when that happened, but he wouldn't take my calls,\" Lanigan said. \"We didn't talk again the whole winter. And then [June 2], he went on Talk of the Town and someone sent me the radio interview.\"\n\nOne of the deputies on the body-worn camera footage asks Lanigan if \"...that's what the text to him was about? That you wanted to talk to him?\"\n\nLanigan said yes and that he didn't threaten Brown.\n\nIn the footage, Brown could be seen talking to other individuals and getting into a car, only to get out when another individual approaches, whom he embraces. He can be seen talking across the parking lot to this individual, before Lanigan can be seen walking up behind Brown and placing a hand on his shoulder.\n\nThe two can be seen talking, but with every step that Lanigan takes, Brown takes one step back until he's positioned at the back of the car.\n\nBrown raises one arm and tries to push away and raises another above his head, but Lanigan grabs the second arm and guides Brown back to the car and into the passenger seat.\n\nFrom there, the two begin speaking to each other and gesturing. At one point, Lanigan starts to walk off, only for Brown to say something that makes Lanigan turn back around.\n\nThe two eventually separate and the car carrying Brown drives off.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Observer-Dispatch: Videos released after Rome Mayor Lanigan pleads guilty",

    "description": "Jillian Michaels called out NYT's Wajahat Ali for not doing a his homework after he incorrectly claimed she had referred to herself as a \"white nationalist\"",
    "fullText": "Fitness influencer Jillian Michaels called out New York Times opinion writer Wajahat Ali for not doing a “little homework” after he incorrectly claimed she had referred to herself as a “white nationalist” previously.\n\nTheir clash happened on Monday’s episode of Piers Morgan Uncensored, where Michaels and Ali debated violent attacks by radical Muslims after 16 people were slaughtered at a Hanukkah celebration in Australia last weekend.\n\nAli, after Michaels weighed in on the attack, said he had to deal with her saying a bunch of “hate-filled, stupid, reckless things” about Muslims.\n\n“You, by your own admission, are a white nationalist,” Ali continued.\n\n“I’m a white nationalist? You know I’m Arab, right? I’m Syrian and Lebanese and Turkish,” Michaels told him. “When did I say I was a white nationalist?”\n\n“You’re not a white nationalist?” Ali responded. “Oh, wasn’t there a clip saying you’re a white nationalist? So you’re not a white nationalist?”\n\n“Oh, interesting. Interesting to know,” Ali said.\n\nMichaels pressed him more on his claim, asking what mysterious clip he was referring to. Ali had no answer.\n\n“I’m under the mistaken impression you’re a white nationalist,” Ali said. “I’m glad you’re not.”\n\n“How about a little homework, Wajahat?” Michaels said, while chuckling over the whole thing.\n\nMichaels, a moment earlier, said it was fair to be concerned about Islamist attacks, after the shooting in Australia and an ISIS-inspired attack that killed three Americans in Syria this past weekend. She said that even if 1% of the world’s Muslim population is sympathetic to terrorist attacks, that is still 20 million people to be worried about.\n\n“I don’t think the alarm is about Muslims migrating to America,” she said. “I think the alarm is about assimilation. I don’t think that these two individuals in Bondi represent what I’ve been told is actually two billion Muslims.”\n\nAli bashed her a few minutes later.\n\nHe said ex-President George W. Bush’s War on Terror, following the 9/11 attacks, “caused immense chaos” based on “the same type of bullsh*t that Jillian’s saying right now.” Ali then branded her a “hate monger” who wants to “bring up Islamophobia” and  wants to “get rid of all Muslim immigrants.”\n\nMichaels was unmoved by Ali’s shot.\n\n“We have to call out the people who want to destroy the West,” she said.\n\nThe post ‘You Know I’m Arab, Right?’ Jillian Michaels Hits Back at NYT’s Wajahat Ali Calling Her a ‘White Nationalist’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "All life on Earth can be traced back to a Last Universal Common Ancestor, or LUCA—and it likely lived on Earth only 400 million years after its formation.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAll life on Earth can be traced back to a Last Universal Common Ancestor, or LUCA.\n\nA study suggests that this organism likely lived on Earth only 400 million years after its formation.\n\nFurther analysis also shows that this life form likely sported an early immune system, which means it was probably fighting off viruses.\n\nLife on Earth had to begin somewhere, and scientists think that “somewhere” is LUCA—or the Last Universal Common Ancestor. True to its name, this prokaryote-like organism represents the ancestor of every living thing, from the tiniest of bacteria to the grandest of blue whales.\n\nWhile the Cambrian Explosion kickstarted complex life in a major way some 530 million years, the true timeline of life on Earth is much longer. For years, scientists have estimated that LUCA likely arrived on the scene some 4 billion years, which is only 600 million years after the planet’s formation.\n\nBut a study from an international team of scientists pushes that timeline back even further to some 4.2 billion years ago, while also discovering some fascinating details about what life for LUCA might’ve been like. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.\n\n“The common ancestry of all extant cellular life is evidenced by the universal genetic code, machinery for protein synthesis, shared chirality of the almost-universal set of 20 amino acids and use of ATP as a common energy currency. As such, our understanding of LUCA impacts our understanding of the early evolution of life on Earth. Was LUCA a simple or complex organism? What kind of environment did it inhabit and when?”\n\nTo zero in on exactly when LUCA appeared on Earth, scientists had to work backward. First, the team compared genes in living species and counted the mutations that have occurred since sharing a common ancestor with LUCA. Using a genetic equation based on the time of separation between species, the team worked out that LUCA must’ve been mucking around on Earth as early as 400 million years after its creation, which puts this organism smack in the middle of the hellish geologic nightmare known as the Hadean Eon.\n\n“The evolutionary history of genes is complicated by their exchange between lineages,” University of Bristol’s Edmund Moody, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “We have to use complex evolutionary models to reconcile the evolutionary history of genes with the genealogy of species.”\n\nNot satisfied with just learning its age, the team took things a step further and retraced the physiological characteristics of living species to understand what LUCA must’ve been like 4.2 billion years ago—and the results gave some surprising answers. The scientists estimate that while LUCA was a simple prokaryote, it likely had an immune system, meaning it was already fighting off primordial viruses.\n\n“It’s clear that LUCA was exploiting and changing its environment, but it is unlikely to have lived alone,” University of Exeter’s Tim Lenton, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Its waste would have been food for other microbes, like methanogens, that would have helped to create a recycling ecosystem.”\n\nWhile LUCA is the oldest common ancestor we know of, scientists still don’t understand how life evolved from its very origins to the early communities of which LUCA is a part. Further studies will need to dive deeper into this primordial history and uncover exactly how you, me, and every other living thing, came to be.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

His retirement leaves a great void but the player has been plagued by injury in recent seasons.\"\n\n\"It is fitting that he leaves with a record haul of medals and since being appointed captain in 2022, he has always led by example and worn the county jersey with fierce pride and distinction,\" she concluded.",

    "description": "David Chung shares how his mother's immigrant journey inspired him to build a multimillion-dollar beauty business from the ground up.",
    "fullText": "David Chung is a serial entrepreneur and CEO of multiple beauty brands.\n\nFarmacy Beauty, which he founded in 2015, was acquired by Procter & Gamble for $350 million.\n\nHe isn't driven by money, and at 66, he can't envision retiring, he says.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chung, owner and chairman of Amare Global. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI couldn't believe there was a banana just sitting on the kitchen table. In Korea, having a banana was a big deal, but when I immigrated to New York City at 12, we had fruit and even M&Ms. Everything was so luxurious.\n\nMy mother immigrated to the US in 1963 with less than $100. When she arrived in New York, she started a small, mom-and-pop gift shop. She grew the business through and eventually got her green card. I joined her about eight years later, in the middle of a New York winter. I didn't speak the language, but I felt lucky to be in the US.\n\nMy mother continued to grow her store, expanding into a drugstore and pharmacy. By the early 2000s, she had a business worth tens of millions.\n\nShe was very, very entrepreneurial. Watching her journey inspired me and has carried over even today. I have a lot of her DNA when it comes to business. Now that I'm 66, I'll think, \"I'm just like my mother!\" It's scary.\n\nMy mom's business set the stage for mine. Working in her shop, I saw that beauty products provided a great business opportunity. The products are small, which reduces warehousing and shipping costs. They're consumable, so customers return again and again. And even if the economy is bad, people don't give up on their skin.\n\nI went to college, but I found it difficult to concentrate because I was always thinking about starting my business. Even today, I don't drive much because I get so distracted thinking about running my companies (instead, I use a driver). Eventually, I graduated with a degree in engineering.\n\nRight next to my school, there was a small video rental store. These were the days before Blockbuster. I bought that store when I was 23, and expanded it slowly to sell gifts and cosmetics.\n\nThat was my start in business. Other than my mom, I've never worked for anyone else. That meant I had to learn hard lessons about business structure, processes, and systems on my own.\n\nOver time, I pivoted from retail to research, design, and manufacturing. In 2018, I sold my shares in one company for $53.7 million. In 2021, I sold my company, Farmacy Beauty, for hundreds of millions (I'm not allowed to share the specific amount). I remember being at my computer on December 31st, watching the funds being deposited into my account. I didn't feel anything. I didn't think \"I'm rich now.\" I didn't even go out to dinner to celebrate.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about money for me. It's more about the accomplishment and excitement of building something. I remember the first time I was in a room with people who had more credentials than me. I came up with an idea they hadn't considered. That's the first time I realized that I had a different way of thinking about things.\n\nI have a huge amount of money now — I could never spend it all. And yet, when those funds hit my account, I didn't buy a Rolex or a fancy car. I went out and bought another company to run.\n\nRecently, I told an employee that I'm going to retire in three years. She laughed and said I told her the same thing 15 years ago.\n\nI don't think I will ever retire fully. God has given me a talent for being business-minded and good at what I'm doing. I want to utilize that as long as I'm able to.\n\nMy mother was very passionate about giving back, particularly to the Korean American community. I figure the more money I make, the more I can give back. So, why not use this skill?",

    "description": "\"Dizzying pace of drastic change.\"",
    "fullText": "A popular ski resort in California has taken drastic measures following warmer-than-average temperatures and a lack of natural snowfall.\n\nAs CBS News reported, Boreal Mountain, California, got off to a particularly warm start to its winter season at the end of November.\n\nIt had experienced above-average temperatures and a noticeable lack of substantial snowstorms for the region. As a result, officials at the ski resort turned to snowmaking machines to ensure that winter sports enthusiasts were able to enjoy their time.\n\n\"We've probably used 500 gallons of snow to put the product we have up on the hill,\" said Tucker Norred, Boreal's marketing director.\n\n\"It's just been a waiting game with temperatures. We blew as much snow as we could to make sure we could open safely for our guests.\"\n\nHowever, snowmaking machines can often require a high consumption of water, contributing to the depletion of nearby water supplies.\n\nThe snowmaking process can also be energy-intensive, often powered by polluting fuels such as gas or coal.\n\nWhile the resort has managed to keep the artificial powder flowing and its trails open for visitors, the weather is a departure from what the area is used to.\n\nOn average, Boreal Mountain can see around 400 inches of snow per season. That's enough to cover the 41 trails that are usually open to the public.\n\n\"To be honest with you, the last seven years I've been here, I've never seen this dirt. I've never seen these rocks,\" said Jackson Price, a longtime visitor to the ski resort, per CBS. \"It's been straight snow through the pasture.\"\n\nWould you like to have large solar farms in your state?\n\nDepends on how much it'll reduce my bills\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor, an overwhelming majority of the state was marked as free from drought as of early December.\n\nIn fact, less than 17% of California was experiencing even \"abnormally dry\" conditions on December 2. This marked a massive change from the \"3 Months Ago to Current\" data, which showed over three-quarters of the state was mired in abnormally dry or drought conditions.\n\nRising temperatures have greatly impacted historic climate patterns throughout many regions around the world. This has resulted in intensifying extreme weather events, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves. As seen in California, this can lead to unpredictability in weather forecasts.\n\nMany governments have begun to push legislation aimed at limiting reliance on planet-heating dirty fuels and promoting the widespread adoption of renewable energy, such as wind and solar power.\n\nFor example, in Poland, parliament officials have reduced barriers to delivering wind-energy projects.\n\nIn California, though, experts have recognized the importance of taking steps to mitigate the effects of a warming climate.\n\n\"The dizzying pace of drastic change underscores the need for California to invest in the resilience of Sierra-Cascade communities and landscapes, restoring forest health and economic vitality, so the Region can adapt and thrive in a changing climate,\" noted the Sierra Nevada Conservancy.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "Why Scientists Believe A Major Volcano Could Obliterate The Pacific Northwest",
    "description": "Scientists predict that a major volcano could wipe the Pacific Northwest off the map.",
    "fullText": "The Pacific Northwest has always carried an air of quiet menace — a region where breathtaking beauty overlaps with a geological time bomb ticking beneath the soil. For decades, scientists have warned that this postcard-perfect landscape sits atop one of the most volatile volcanic systems in the world. Now, new research and simmering seismic activity suggest the threat is far more immediate — and far more catastrophic — than most Americans realize.\n\nWhile locals joke about “the Big One,” volcanologists aren’t laughing. They’re tracking rising magma, mysterious ground swelling, ancient eruption patterns, and a supervolcano whose last major explosion altered the global climate. The unsettling truth? A single eruption could erase entire cities, disrupt global food chains, and plunge the world into a volcanic winter.\n\nHere’s why experts believe a major volcanic event could one day obliterate the Pacific Northwest — and why the rest of the country should be paying very close attention.\n\nYou might not be familiar with it, but the Cascadia Subduction Zone is a geological feature that should definitely be on your radar. This massive fault line stretches from Northern California to British Columbia and is capable of producing megathrust earthquakes and significant volcanic activity. A study published in the journal Science highlights that the geological pressures building up in this zone could eventually trigger a major volcanic event. So, while it might seem like just another scientific concern, the reality is that this subduction zone has the potential to cause a chain reaction of natural disasters.\n\nWhy does this matter to you? Well, if you’re living in or planning to visit the Pacific Northwest, it’s crucial to be aware of the geological dynamics at play. Knowing the risks can help you prepare and make informed decisions about earthquake and volcanic readiness. Plus, understanding the science behind these phenomena can make the concept less abstract and more a part of your everyday considerations. It's all about staying informed and prepared for what nature might throw your way.\n\nHistory has a way of repeating itself, especially when it comes to natural events like volcanic eruptions. Mount St. Helens’ 1980 eruption might be etched into public memory, but it’s just a part of a long history of volcanic activity in the region. Geological records indicate that the Pacific Northwest has been a hotspot for eruptions over millennia, each leaving a mark on the landscape and human history. By studying these past events, scientists can identify patterns and predict future activity with more accuracy.\n\nThis isn't just a theoretical exercise; it’s about learning from the past to protect the future. For people living in the area, this means understanding the very real possibility that another eruption could occur. It underscores the importance of having evacuation plans, emergency supplies, and community resources in place. After all, being prepared is about more than just peace of mind—it’s a practical step towards ensuring your safety.\n\nYou might think that technology would give us the upper hand against volcanic threats, and you'd be right—to an extent. Advances in\n\nmonitoring and satellite technology have dramatically improved our ability to detect early signs of volcanic activity. For instance, the US Geological Survey (USGS) regularly updates its Volcano Hazards Program to provide real-time monitoring and alerts. This means that scientists are more equipped than ever to provide early warnings, potentially saving lives and minimizing damage.\n\nHowever, technology isn’t a silver bullet. While it can offer crucial lead time, there's still an element of unpredictability in how a volcano might behave. For residents in the Pacific Northwest, this means remaining vigilant and responsive to official alerts and updates. Understanding that technology is a tool—not a guarantee—can help you remain proactive and prepared.\n\nAs cities expand and populations grow in the Pacific Northwest, the stakes of a volcanic eruption increase significantly. More people mean more infrastructure—homes, roads, and schools—that could potentially be affected by volcanic activity. Urban areas like Seattle and Portland are particularly vulnerable given their proximity to active volcanoes. The combination of dense populations and natural hazards is a recipe for complex emergency management challenges.\n\nFor you, this means that living in or near these urban centers requires a heightened awareness of both natural and man-made risks. While urban living offers convenience and opportunity, it also demands that you stay informed about local emergency plans and resources. The responsibility is twofold: enjoying the benefits of urban life while being mindful of the geological realities. After all, being aware is the first step towards being prepared.\n\nWhen you think of a volcanic eruption, economic implications might not be the first thing that comes to mind. But the financial consequences of such an event could be staggering. According to a report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a major eruption in the Pacific Northwest could result in billions of dollars in damages. From disrupted trade routes to destroyed infrastructure, the economic ripple effects would be felt far beyond the initial blast zone.\n\nThis isn’t just a concern for government officials or business owners—it's something that could impact you directly. Think about rising insurance premiums, increased cost of goods, and potential job disruptions. Understanding the economic stakes can help you make more informed financial decisions and encourage you to support policies that prioritize disaster readiness. In a way, being economically aware is just another form of preparedness.\n\nVolcanic eruptions don’t just alter landscapes—they can also have profound environmental impacts. The release of ash and gases can lead to short-term climate changes, affecting everything from air quality to agricultural productivity. For the Pacific Northwest, which is rich in natural beauty and biodiversity, a major eruption could pose significant threats to ecosystems. Understanding these potential consequences can help you appreciate the delicate balance between human activity and the natural world.\n\nThis isn’t just about preserving beauty; it’s about maintaining the health and sustainability of the environment you depend on. For people who live in the region, it means being mindful of how human actions can exacerbate natural risks. It’s a call to action to support environmental initiatives and policies that aim to protect and sustain the area's natural resources. After all, the environment is not just a backdrop to your life—it’s an integral part of it.\n\nWhile scientists and government agencies play a crucial role in disaster preparedness, community-level efforts are just as important. Programs focusing on public education and community drills are vital tools for ensuring that people know what to do in the event of a volcanic eruption. According to the National Academies of Sciences, investing in community preparedness can significantly mitigate the impact of natural disasters. This means that you, too, have a role to play in making sure your community is ready.\n\nCommunity preparedness isn't just about attending meetings or drills—it's about fostering a culture of readiness and resilience. It involves knowing your neighbors, understanding local resources, and having a clear plan for how to respond to emergencies. By participating in community efforts, you help create a network of support that can make all the difference when disaster strikes. After all, when it comes to facing natural threats, there’s strength in numbers.\n\nImagine receiving an alert on your phone that a volcanic eruption is imminent. That’s the power of early warning systems, designed to give people crucial lead time to evacuate and take protective measures. These systems utilize a combination of seismic data, satellite imagery, and other technological tools to provide timely alerts. For the Pacific Northwest, where the risk of an eruption is ever-present, these warning systems are a vital part of disaster management.\n\nBut early warnings are only as effective as the response they trigger. This means that you need to be ready to act quickly and decisively when an alert is issued. Familiarize yourself with the warning signs of volcanic activity and make sure you know the evacuation routes in your area. In doing so, you can turn a few moments’ notice into a potentially life-saving opportunity.\n\nThe field of geology is continually evolving, and that’s good news for anyone concerned about volcanic hazards. Ongoing research and technological innovations are providing new insights into the behavior of volcanoes. From advanced computer models to drone technology, scientists are developing tools that can help predict eruptions with greater accuracy. For the Pacific Northwest, this means a more robust understanding of the region’s volcanic threats.\n\nStaying informed about these scientific advancements can be both reassuring and empowering. It’s an invitation to engage with the science that’s shaping your world and to advocate for continued research and funding. Understanding the complexities of volcanic activity can transform fear into informed awareness. After all, knowledge is the best defense against the unknown.\n\nClimate change is altering weather patterns and environmental conditions worldwide, and its impact on volcanic activity is a growing area of study. Some researchers suggest that melting glaciers and shifting precipitation patterns could influence volcanic behavior. While the science is still evolving, it’s clear that climate change adds an extra layer of complexity to the already intricate dynamics of volcanism. For the Pacific Northwest, understanding these interactions is crucial for comprehensive disaster planning.\n\nFor you, this underscores the interconnectedness of environmental issues. It’s a reminder that addressing climate change is not just about reducing carbon footprints—it’s about understanding and mitigating its broader impacts. By supporting climate action, you’re contributing to a more stable and predictable natural environment. In a world of constant change, that kind of stability is invaluable.\n\nIn the event of a volcanic eruption, the effectiveness of emergency response infrastructure can be the difference between chaos and order. Robust communication systems, efficient transportation networks, and well-trained emergency personnel are all critical components. In the Pacific Northwest, efforts to strengthen this infrastructure are ongoing, but challenges remain. Understanding these efforts can help you appreciate the complexities of disaster management and the importance of supporting local initiatives.\n\nFor residents, this means being proactive in understanding the capabilities and limitations of local emergency services. Familiarize yourself with the resources available and how to access them in a crisis. By staying informed and engaged, you not only protect yourself but also contribute to a more resilient community. After all, successful emergency response is a collective effort.\n\nVolcanic eruptions don’t just reshape landscapes—they also impact the cultural and social fabric of affected areas. The Pacific Northwest, with its rich indigenous history and diverse communities, faces unique challenges and opportunities in this regard. Disasters can strain social bonds but also foster resilience and solidarity. Understanding the social dynamics at play can help you appreciate the human dimension of volcanic threats.\n\nFor you, this means recognizing the importance of community cohesion and cultural sensitivity in disaster preparedness. It’s about valuing the diverse perspectives and knowledge systems that can contribute to effective response and recovery efforts. By engaging with your community and honoring its cultural heritage, you help build a more inclusive and resilient society. In the face of natural threats, it’s this sense of community that often proves most enduring.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility for preparedness doesn’t just lie with scientists, government agencies, or community leaders—it’s a personal obligation as well. Having an emergency plan, maintaining a supply kit, and staying informed are crucial steps you can take. In the Pacific Northwest, where the risk of a volcanic eruption is ever-present, personal preparedness is not just advisable—it’s essential. By taking these steps, you not only protect yourself but also contribute to the safety and resilience of your community.\n\nThis isn’t about living in fear—it’s about living with awareness and intention. It’s about being proactive and empowered, understanding that preparedness is an ongoing process. In doing so, you not only mitigate the risks but also enhance your sense of control and peace of mind. After all, being prepared is not just about survival—it’s about thriving in the face of uncertainty.",

Now it's a ruin.\n\n\"It demolished their home and business. As it stands they have nowhere to live. They're trying to repair and rebuild,\" adds Williamson.\n\n\"The sports bar is gone, basically. It's washed away. It needs a full rebuild.\"\n\nThe hurricane struck Jamaica on 28 October as a category five storm, resulting in 28 confirmed deaths.\n\nApproximately 1.5 million people - more than half of the nation's population - have been impacted.\n\nLenders have together put forward up to $6.7bn (£5bn) over three years to support Jamaica's recovery from Hurricane Melissa, alongside wider international aid efforts.\n\nWilliamson himself has launched a fundraising campaign and already received donations - including £1,000 from the auction of a signed glove - to help cover basics like food, clothing and temporary accommodation.\n\nHis brother will fly out in December, and Williamson hopes to follow.\n\nBefore he can board that plane, Williamson must face Barnsley's unbeaten Simpson - a tough assignment at a testing moment in his own career.",

    "fullText": "Southern California is basking in sunshine and unseasonably warm temperatures this week, but forecasters say a holiday twist is on the way.\n\n“We’re still seeing fog for some coastal spots, but inland areas are warming up above average once again,” KTLA weather anchor Kacey Montoya said Monday, noting highs in the low 80s for the Los Angeles Basin. “It’s about 20 degrees above average today, even warmer tomorrow.”\n\nThe National Weather Service said highs will stay in the low 80s through Thursday before cooling into the 70s by the weekend. Air quality remains moderate for most of the region, with a mandatory wood-burning ban in effect through Tuesday for the South Coast Air Basin.\n\nThe NWS long-range forecast shows a Pacific storm could arrive as early as Dec. 22, with snow levels dropping in mountain communities – potentially complicating holiday travel.\n\n“There is a system that is very likely to bring us some widespread precipitation,” Montoya said. “Models don’t agree on when the rain begins or how much.”\n\nBut meteorologists caution that those hoping for a big boost to ski resorts may be disappointed.\n\n“Next week’s stormy pattern does not appear to be a big snowmaker for our area as the upper level trough will pull in moisture from the southwest initially, then a plume from the south joins in on the fun,” the Weather Service said in a bulletin. “Thus temperatures will remain too warm for any significant snow.”",

    "description": "A look at how the Cardinals split up their 66 offensive snaps against the Texans.",
    "fullText": "In the Arizona Cardinals' 40-20 loss to the Houston Texans on Sunday, 20 players participated in at least one of the 66 offensive snaps.\n\nQuarterback Jacoby Brissett, center Hjalte Froholdt, right guard Isaiah Adams and right tackle Kelvin Beachum played every snap. Left guard Jon Gaines II missed one snap, while tight end Trey McBride played all but five. Wide receiver Michael Wilson missed 10 and running back Michael Carter played all but 13 after Bam Knight was injured on the first Cardinals offensive snap of the game.\n\nRookie center/guard Hayden Conner played his first NFL offensive snaps with three.\n\nHow was the playing time divided up? Below are individual snap counts for every player who got in the game offensively, grouped by position.\n\nThe first number after each name is snaps and the second is the percentage. Players in bold were starters.\n\nActive, did not play: Kedon Slovis\n\nReserve/injured (eligible for return, but won’t): Kyler Murray\n\nBrissett had another 40-attempt game, completing 27 for 249 yards, three touchdowns, an interception and a 98.9 passer rating. He was sacked twice and ran three times for six yards.\n\nMichael Carter (53/80), Bam Knight (1/2), Emari Demercado (7/11), Corey Kiner (5/8)\n\nReserve/injured: Trey Benson, James Conner (eligible to return, but won’t)\n\nKnight was dropped for a loss of minus-2 yards on the Cardinals first offensive play of the game and was carted off after suffering an ankle injury. There was no further information on the severity of the injury.\n\nCarter had a productive game with 56 yards on 14 attempts, while adding 38 yards on three receptions. Active after missing the previous three games because of an ankle injury, Demarcado played only seven snaps and did little with one yard on one rush and no yards on two receptions because of one 5-yard loss. Kiner had two rushes for 11 yards on his five snaps.\n\nBenson’s 21-day practice window expired Thursday, so he will remain on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.\n\nMichael Wilson (56/85), Jalen Brooks (47/71), Trent Sherfield Sr. (14/21), Andre Baccellia (10/15)\n\nInactive: WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (injured), Xavier Weaver (injured)\n\nReserve/injured: Greg Dortch (eligible to return), Simi Fehoko (eligible to return), Zay Jones (eligible to return, but won’t)\n\nWilson had a quiet first half with one reception for six yards on four targets. However, he finished with five catches on 11 targets and an 11-yard touchdown. The only other wideout with targets was Brooks, who caught one of three for 19 yards.\n\nBaccellia played only 10 offensive snaps after suffering a neck injury returning a kickoff.\n\nTrey McBride (61/92), Elijah Higgins (46/70), Pharaoh Brown (11/17), Josiah Deguara (8/12)\n\nReserve/injured: Tip Reiman, Travis Vokolek (both eligible to return, but won’t)\n\nNo matter what defenses do to try and stop him, McBride continues to put up numbers. Targeted 13 times, he caught 12 for 134 yards and two touchdowns. It was his 16th consecutive game with at least five receptions, breaking Travis Kelce’s league record for tight ends.\n\nHe also has 105 receptions this season to become the first tight end in NFL history to register two consecutive 100-reception seasons. Kelce has hit the 100-catch barrier three times in his career, but never in consecutive seasons. The Cardinals overall record for receptions in one season in the 115 by DeAndre Hopkins in 2020. McBride also has 1,071 yards this season after having 1,146 last season. McBride needs 135 yards to pass Jackie Smith (1,205 in 1967) for the Cardinals record for most yards by a tight end in a season.\n\nWhen asked about the consecutive streak, McBride said, \"Sixteen games, for what? We've got to get more wins.\"\n\nHiggins had one catch for three yards Sunday and Brown had two for one yard.\n\nC Hjalte Froholdt (66/100), RG Isaiah Adams (66/100), RT Kelvin Beachum (66/100), LG Jon Gaines II (65/98), LT Josh Fryar (38/58), LT Demontrey Jacobs (37/56), G Hayden Conner (3/5)\n\nInactive: G Evan Brown (personal), LT Paris Johnson Jr. (injured)\n\nActive/did not play: T Christian Jones\n\nReserve/injured: RG Will Hernandez (eligible to return), RT Jonah Williams (eligible to return, but won’t)\n\nBrown was inactive handling a family matter for the second consecutive game. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said coaches wanted to see Fryar and Jacobs play and they shared snaps at left tackle while also being an extra blocker on run situations.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Stephanie Vaquer is still Women's World Champion, but she won her \"WWE Raw\" match against Judgment Day's Raquel Rodriguez by interference when WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella came through the crowd and caused a disqualification. Rodriguez had established herself as number one contender to Vaquer's title last week, when she took out Bella as she was attempting to demand her rematch after her loss to Vaquer at Survivor Series.\n\nRodriguez tried to overpower Vaquer to start off their match, and she got a lot of offense in throughout the bout. Vaquer went to the top rope to hit a flying cross body, but her challenger caught her and slammed her to the canvas. The champion tried to get Rodriguez in an armbar around the ropes, but before the referee could even begin a five count, Rodriguez had Vaquer up and hit a power bomb.\n\nVaquer hit the Devil's Kiss in the middle of the ring, causing Rodriguez to retreat to the corner where Vaquer hit her with a meteora. She tried to get Rodriguez up for the SVB, but couldn't. On the outside of the ring, Rodriguez caught a second Vaquer cross body and looked to throw her into the ring post, but Vaquer countered and sent Rodriguez face-first into the post.\n\nIt was then that Bella came out of the crowd to attack Vaquer. She connected with the Rack Attack 2.0 in the ring and later in a backstage segment, Bella said she demanded respect as a legend in the business from the other women.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Now that the 2025 college football regular season is over, we are going to continue to hear about postseason awards and various All-American teams. One of the biggest of those is the Associated Press All-American team, and we saw that announced on Monday, with a lot of Ohio State players involved.\n\nIn total, eight Buckeyes were named across the three teams, with four of those keeping their hope alive in becoming consensus first-team All-Americans. Safety Caleb Downs, defensive tackle Kayden McDonald, linebacker Arvell Reese, and wide receiver Jeremiah Smith were all named to the first team, with all four already being named to the Walter Camp First-Team as well.\n\nBut that wasn't all, because four more Ohio State players appeared on other teams, with linebacker Sonny Styles and wide receiver Carnell Tate being named second-team All-Americans by the Associated Press, while defensive end Caden Curry and quarterback Julian Sayin appeared on the third team.\n\nSmith, widely known as the best receiver in the game, was snubbed for the Biletnikoff Award on Friday. He's caught 80 passes for 1,086 yards and 11 touchdowns. You can bet that he'll make more All-American lists going forward. Smith has had back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons and still has his junior year to go.McDonald has flashed on the scene this year in the middle of the defensive line and is a potential first-round NFL draft pick come April. He clogs up the middle and has tallied 57 tackles with eight tackles for loss and three sacks.\n\nReese has also come out of nowhere to be considered one of the best linebackers in the country and also a potential first-round NFL draft pick. He has been used all over the field because of his ability to run and react to plays at several levels. He's had 62 tackles with ten tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks.Need a news break? Downs has already taken home the Jim Thorpe Award and is considered by many as the best defensive player in the game, though he did not win the Bednarik Award. Like Reese, he is one of the linchpins of the defense, often lining up at all three levels. He has registered 60 total tackles with five tackles for loss, two interceptions, and a sack so far this year.\n\n🥇Team AP All-Americans 🇺🇸 \n\n🏅 @caleb_downs2 \n🏅 @Jermiah_Smith1 \n🏅 @arvxll \n🏅 @KMac_DT pic.twitter.com/gpQQxNAAOb\n\n— Ohio State Football (@OhioStateFB) December 15, 2025\n\nThe announcement of All-American teams will continue on Tuesday when the AFCA team will be announced. If any of the four first-teamers appear, they will officially garner consensus All-American honors.

    "description": "Kentucky’s head coach believes shooting success is coming as the Wildcats adjust and find continuity.",
    "fullText": "Mark Pope isn’t panicking about Kentucky basketball’s offense, even if the results haven’t fully shown up yet. Instead, Pope remains confident that patience and adjustments will pay off as the season moves along.\n\nPope acknowledged this week that Kentucky has tweaked its style of play to better suit its current personnel, focusing on creating space where players feel most comfortable. While the offense has at times looked “mocked up” and physical, Pope views that as part of the growth process rather than a long-term identity.\n\n“I actually think our team really, listen, by the end of the year, I think we will be really dangerous shooting the ball,” Pope said. “I’ve never been on a team where the NOAH numbers don’t actually eventually transport their way into games. I just have never seen that. So with that history, our expectation is this team will be really dangerous.”\n\nKentucky’s shooting metrics in practice suggest better days ahead, even if the game results haven’t matched yet, although we have seen some great performances against cupcake teams. Pope emphasized that the biggest hurdle right now is continuity, learning how hard the Wildcats must play to win, and building confidence through small successes.\n\nAs that confidence grows, Pope believes the game will begin to open up offensively. At the same time, he likes that his team is learning how to survive and compete in rugged, defensive-minded games, something he believes will matter most in March.\n\n“If we do this right,” Pope said, “it’s going to bode well for us when we get to the latter part of the season and the post-season.”\n\nFor Pope, the vision is clear: a Kentucky team capable of winning ugly and exploding offensively when it matters most.",

Currently, the Buckeyes have seven committed players in the 2027 class, but that number could jump to eight very soon. Four-star linebacker Quinton Cypher is down to four schools, and OSU has made the cut.\n\nCypher hails from Raleigh, North Carolina, and is rated as the No. 11 linebacker in the class according to 247Sports composite rankings. Watching this young man on film, he is explosive, quick to the ball, and can catch players from behind. Recently, Cypher narrowed his choices down to four schools, which include Ohio State, Alabama, Georgia, and Miami.\n\nHowever, it seems that OSU may have the inside track. According to insiders, the Buckeyes and Bulldogs are in a battle for this one, but On3's Steve Wiltfong logged a crystal ball prediction for Cypher to choose the Scarlet and Gray shortly after the list was trimmed to four.\n\nNEWS: Four-Star LB Quinton Cypher is down to 4 schools, he tells me for @rivals⁰⁰The 6’3 215 LB from Raleigh, NC will announce his commitment this week \n\nWhere Should He Go?https://t.co/dNj283DNzJ pic.twitter.com/J0wBO6prGX\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) December 14, 2025\n\nIt sounds as if we'll have an answer sooner rather than later, as the 6-foot-3, 215-pound linebacker will make his announcement sometime this week.

    "description": "Kamari Ramsey, Makai Lemon, Ja'Kobi Lane, Lake McRee and Eric Gentry are among the players who will not be playing for USC against TCU in the Alamo Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Following Monday afternoon’s practice at Howard Jones Field, USC coach Lincoln Riley addressed the media for the first time since the Trojans’ victory over crosstown rival UCLA on Nov. 29.\n\nUSC (9-3), ranked No. 16 in the AP poll, is preparing to play Texas Christian (9-4) on Dec. 30 in the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio. USC finished 7-2 in its second season in the Big Ten and won four of its last five games, the only setback during that stretch being a 42-27 loss to Oregon, which is the No. 5 seed in the College Football Playoff.\n\nRiley announced that safety Kamari Ramsey, receivers Makai Lemon and Ja’Kobi Lane, tight end Lake McRee and linebacker Eric Gentry will not play in the Alamo Bowl. Lane declared for the NFL draft on Monday.\n\n“Anthony Lucas and Bishop Fitzgerald want to play in the game but are dealing with injuries and trying to get back ... we’ll see how that goes,” Riley said. “Kilian O’Connor and Elijah Paige and Jahkeem Stewart all had surgery and will be ready to roll.”\n\nAsked about signing the No. 1 recruiting class for 2026, Riley said: “It was a great day. We tried to keep the focus on building next year’s team. The amount of guys that we signed is a big portion of it and as we start to look ahead ... half of our day and maybe even more is pointing towards next year and coming years. Meanwhile, obviously getting ready for this bowl game. It was a lot of hard work to add talent and people who care about this place and starting to put next year’s team together has been exciting here these last few weeks.”\n\nRiley has a 35-27 record in his four seasons at USC and is hoping to improve his bowl record to 3-1. He guided the Trojans to wins in the 2023 Holiday Bowl and 2024 Las Vegas Bowl.\n\nRiley watched the CIF state Open Division bowl game between Santa Margarita (coached by former Trojans quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer) and De La Salle on Saturday and was impressed by the performance of USC commit Trent Mosley, who had 11 catches for 183 yards and two touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in the Eagles’ 47-13 win.\n\n“He was someone we targeted very early on,” Riley said. “I thought he was super impressive and it was important. He’s one of the best receivers in the country. He’s proven that and he just played out of his mind. It’s a great family and he’s a really smart kid.”\n\nAsked what advice he gives to players who are deciding what to do next in their careers, Riley said: “Yes, it’s an important decision. The guys that make the right decision no matter what it is get a leg up on the rest of their lives. Consequently, a wrong decision can be catastrophic. That’s the world we all live in. I just try to educate them on their options. I don’t like telling guys you should do this or you shouldn’t do that. It’s more about, here’s this option, this is what it would look like, here’s what you need to consider. Sometimes the decision’s pretty clear one way or another, other times it’s not. I try to give them as much guidance as I possibly can.”\n\nGiven that USC will be missing quite a few players who were key contributors throughout the season, Riley is not ruling out the possibility of younger players seeing action against TCU.\n\n“There’s gonna be guys all over the place who are going to have opportunities,” Riley said. “All sides of the ball, all position groups, maybe it’s some of the guys you saw a little bit during the season and in some instances you’ll see guys get some burn in this game that haven’t played at all or very little. Bowl games are great, but days like this are the most valuable part of it because we’re just pouring reps into all of these guys, it’s super competitive and the energy level is just different. All these guys feel it’s their time.”\n\nRiley admitted he and his staff had to make hard decisions based on the incoming freshmen, a majority of whom are spring enrollees.\n\n“It’s huge, it’s a high, high number that are going to be here and it’s important,” he said. “We’ve had to make a bunch of roster decisions in the last couple of weeks. We have a large number of players who have already signed and some of the decisions we had to make were based on knowing what we have coming in, and when you sign as many as we did, you’re going to have tough decisions to make.”\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

All my brothers did sports. So I’ve been doing them since third grade.”\n\nShe’s played numerous sports throughout the years, but truly found her stride in cross country, even setting a school record her freshman year. But before her season even started this year, she tore her ACL, an injury that can put athletes on the bench for more than 9 months.\n\n“It’s been an emotional journey because running is my big thing,” Harris said. “I didn’t know if I’d be able to run this season with my team and keep our streaks alive and just be there for my team because that’s what I love doing.”\n\nThrough her recovery process, she said she found out she might be able to compete this season.\n\n“I got told by my doctors that if I put in the work at physical therapy this summer, that I would be able to get back to running before surgery,” Harris said.\n\nSo that’s what she did, working every week to get better and better to overcome this injury while pushing her team to grow together through a difficult season.\n\n“In a strange way, the injury has grown us all because as a coaching staff, we’ve been able to see our kids rally around one another, and other kids got stronger and maintained that going into the season,” Girls’ athletic coordinator JB Littlejohn said.\n\nDuring this recovery, Harris became an inspiration to her teammates and peers.\n\n“She was our athlete of the Year last year as a freshman,” Littlejohn said. “Her competitive nature, combined with her work ethic, you put that with the natural talent, that’s why we’re seeing what she’s doing.”\n\nThrough determination and hard work, Landry and her team made it all the way to the state cross country meet.\n\n“It was very like congratulating, and I felt like my efforts and everything that I went through paid off finally,” Harris said.\n\nYou can now stream KETK and FOX51 News live 24/7 on your smart TV with KETK+, our brand-new app!

Celtics star Jaylen Brown also had 34 points on the night, but no other Celtic scored over 12 points.\n\nAs for the Pistons, star point guard Cade Cunningham dazzled with 32 points and a game-high 10 assists in 36 minutes. His consistent makes kept the Celtics at bay all game long.\n\nMonday marked the Pistons first win at TD Garden since 2022. They remain in first place in the East while the Celtics fall to fourth and have dropped back-to-back games for the first time since November 3rd.

    "fullText": "Orioles face massive Yankees and Red Sox challenge in Michael King pursuit originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles find themselves facing massive odds to sign free agent pitcher Michael King, as two other American League East teams have joined the race for the former San Diego Padres pitcher. The right-handed ace has reportedly narrowed down the list to these three AL East teams, and as per sources, a decision could come soon.\n\nAccording to MLB insider Ken Rosenthal, the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox are both interested in the proven commodity. The insider has suggested that for the Orioles to get their hands on King, they'll have to outbid both AL East competitors, which will be a massive task, given the big market status.\n\nKing actually has local ties with Boston, as he went to Bishop Hendricken High School in Rhode Island and pitched for Boston College. Meanwhile, the Yankees are also associated with the pitcher since they traded for him from the Miami Marlins in November 2017. Earlier, there were rumors that the Chicago Cubs were an interested party, but now it appears his free agency has settled down for an AL East competitor.\n\nThe right-hander is a proven commodity in the majors. He was part of the transaction that sent Juan Soto to the New York Yankees before the 2024 season, thereby landing with the Padres, where he became a reliable arm, posting a sub-3.00 ERA in 173.2 innings. Due to shoulder and knee inflammation this year, he could only make 15 starts, recording a 3.44 ERA with a 1.20 WHIP.\n\nThe Orioles have already shown signs of improvement this offseason as they added Pete Alonso on a five-year, $155 million deal. Adding a reliable arm like King to their rotation will enhance their rotation, which also includes established pieces such as Trevor Rogers and Kyle Bradish, and will help Baltimore get back to the postseason after missing it in 2025.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Orioles, despite the uphill task to outdo AL East giants, can get King to sign with them.\n\nOrioles' Pete Alonso shares heartwarming reason behind new jersey number\n\nOrioles get lackluster grade for $28 million Ryan Helsley signing\n\nOrioles' next roster move after Ryan Helsley $28 million deal is clear\n\nOrioles sign former Mets, Cardinals All-Star closer to two-year deal",

    "fullText": "MIAMI – The payoff for five days off? A fifth straight loss.\n\nWhether playing games in bunches or otherwise, it is not going well for the Miami Heat, this time falling 106-96 Monday night to the Toronto Raptors at Kaseya Center.\n\nStill without a victory since Dec. 1, the Heat this time could not overcome another injury absence from guard Tyler Herro.\n\nFactor in an ugly early tumble that left Heat forward Nikola Jovic with an elbow injury and the return from the five-day break seemingly only pushed Erik Spoelstra’s team further toward a breaking point.\n\nAs has been the case in recent games, the offense again sputtered, much of the early-season energy missing.\n\nSo while the Raptors snapped their four-game losing streak, the Heat’s moved to five.\n\nBam Adebayo led the Heat with 20 points and 10 rebounds, with Norman Powell also scoring 20. Otherwise, not nearly enough amid Herro’s absence.\n\nBrandon Ingram led the Raptors with 28 points.\n\nFive degrees of Heat from Monday night’s game:\n\n— Game flow: The Raptors led 23-22 after the first period, with the Heat then moving to a 52-46 halftime lead. From there, the Heat went into the fourth quarter up 77-74.\n\nThe Raptors swiftly moved to a 91-81 lead with 7:31 to play, putting the Heat in catch-up mode from that stage, as the offense stalled.\n\nFrom there, the Heat closed within 100-96 with 1:28 to play on a pair of Powell free throws, but the inability to get a defensive stop on the other and then the Heat’s 19th turnover effectively ended it.\n\n— No Herro: Having returned from a two-game absence in last Tuesday night’s NBA Cup loss in Orlando, Herro again was listed as out with a toe contusion, his third game missed with the ailment since Dec. 5. That is in addition to the 17 games he missed at the start of the season after September ankle surgery.\n\nWith guard Pelle Larsson out due to an ankle sprain, it resulted in the first Heat start for Simone Fontecchio, in an opening lineup rounded out by Adebayo, Powell, Andrew Wiggins and Davin Mitchell.\n\nThat gave the Heat their 11th lineup in their 26 games.\n\n— Jovic lost: Jovic left in the first period with his right arm in a protective brace after a hard fall.\n\nThe Heat listed it as an elbow injury, ruling him out for the night.\n\nJovic, who had been held out of the rotation in two of the previous three games, got the opportunity for the playing time with Herro and Larsson sidelined.\n\nJovic entered Monday night’s game with 3:50 to play in the opening period and was forced out 12 seconds later.\n\nBecause Jovic was unable to shoot the free throws from the foul on Toronto’s Collin Murray-Boyles, the Raptors were allowed to select the replacement shooter. They selected seldom-used forward Keshad Johnson, who entered 7 of 11 from the line, making both replacement free throws.\n\nJohnson then remained in the game, taking the minutes that would have gone to Jovic.\n\nA stretcher initially was brought to the court, with Jovic instead able to walk off the court while assisted.\n\n— Still struggling: For the first time in a week, Fontecchio hit a shot, after going 0 for 5 in last week’s loss in Orlando.\n\nBut the struggles remain ongoing, with Fontecchio closing 1 of 5 from the field Monday night, including 1 of 4 from beyond the arc.\n\n— Up next: It’s now out on the road for a three-game trip for the Heat after a two-day break, opening with a back-to-back set on Thursday and Friday nights against the Brooklyn Nets and then the Boston Celtics, with the trip concluding Sunday against the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Heat’s next home game also will be against the Raptors, on Dec. 23.",

    "fullText": "U.S. 131 Motorsports Park at Martin, Mich., will host its first NHRA national event as the opener to the six-race showdown in the Mission Foods Drag Racing Series.\n\nMaple Grove Raceway, near Reading, Pa., changed hands, effective Friday, from NHRA sanction to rival IHRA affiliation.\n\nReturn to Michigan for first time since 1960 U.S. Nationals buoys NHRA’s 2026 calendar.\n\nKoretsky family says move to IHRA satisfies “innovative, forward-thinking approach [that] this sport has been missing.”\n\nThe upcoming inaugural Great Lakes Nationals Sept. 18-20 at Martin, Michigan’s US 131 Motorsports Park represents more than a schedule change in the NHRA’s 2026 Countdown to the Championship.\n\nThe abrupt change in the NHRA’s 2026 calendar came with the rival International Hot Rod Association’s announcement Friday at the PRI Show at Indianapolis that it has acquired Maple Grove Raceway, marking a significant milestone for the sport of drag racing.\n\nThis 15th of 20 races during the NHRA’s 75th anniversary season—the first of six playoff races in the Mission Foods Drag Racing Series—signifies a major shift in power in the straightline sport. It exposes significant disagreement about management styles between the NHRA and a resurgent IHRA. Maple Grove Raceway, near Reading, Pennsylvania, has been one of the NHRA’s strongest pillars for a national spectrum of events.\n\nFrom the NHRA’s perspective, it’s a bit of a coup, too. The Great Lakes Nationals will mark the first major NHRA event in Michigan, the center of the US auto manufacturing industry, since the 1960 US Nationals at Detroit Dragway. And it will showcase one of the most updated and family friendly facilities in the country.\n\nThe Martin, Michigan, race has become one of four new racetracks on the NHRA schedule for 2026. Maryland International Raceway, South Georgia Motorsports Park, and Rockingham (North Carolina) Dragway already have joined the 20-race lineup.\n\nSo despite the IHRA’s rekindled rivalry with the NHRA, the latest move only indicates the overall health of the sport.\n\nBut Friday’s news was a blow to the NHRA, which announced this past September that it had a Saturday sellout crowd for the fourth-straight year at its Countdown to the Championship kickoff at Maple Grove Raceway.\n\nAlways one of the most popular dragstrips on the national tour, owner Kenny Koretsky and family raised the bar by sinking millions of dollars and tons of energy into customer service at the historic Eastern Pennsylvania venue since they purchased it in 2022.\n\nSo the so-called “House of Chaos”—nicknamed for former Pro Stock racer Kenny Koretsky’s reputation as “Captain Chaos”—plunged the NHRA into a bit of chaos for a few days. Unsuccessful repeated attempts to contact the NHRA since Friday produced a prepared statement Monday about the playoff opener’s move to Michigan.\n\nWhile the NHRA has moved on to its fresh affiliation with US 131 Motorsports Park, the IHRA takes over one of the NHRA’s biggest revenue-streaming facilities.\n\n“This is a track with deep roots and an even stronger future,” IHRA owner Darryl Cuttell said. “Maple Grove represents what racing should be: competitive, welcoming, and centered [on] racers and families. Bringing it under the IHRA umbrella is not just a business decision—it’s a commitment to strengthening the sport and investing in its long-term success.”\n\nThe Koretsky family emphasized the personal significance of this transition.\n\n“Maple Grove has always been more than a racetrack to our family—it is home, not just for us, but for generations of racers,” the Koretskys said. “Our mission has always been to preserve this facility and ensure it remains a premier racing destination. Seeing Maple Grove join the IHRA family feels like a natural and meaningful next step for the sport.\n\n“Meeting Darryl and Leah from the IHRA was truly eye-opening. Their vision, work ethic, and genuine passion for racers and fans are unmatched,” they said. “Their innovative, forward-thinking approach is exactly what this sport has been missing. The IHRA shares our values—making racing affordable, fun, and family-centered. This new chapter is about honoring Maple Grove’s legacy while elevating the experience for future generations.”\n\nThe Koretsky family said it looks forward to working closely with the IHRA throughout 2026 and beyond.\n\nAs for the NHRA’s new focus, President Glen Cromwell said Monday in a statement that the Martin, Michigan, event is “a[n] historic milestone for the facility, and it’s another terrific way to celebrate our 75th anniversary season, bringing the incredible action of NHRA drag racing to the passionate fan base in Michigan.” He said it “will be extremely meaningful during our 75th anniversary season, as it reflects NHRA’s continued commitment to growing the sport and bringing championship-level NHRA racing to outstanding venues. The track’s dedication to its racers and fans, and its enthusiasm as a new NHRA Member Track makes it an excellent addition to the national tour.”\n\nUS 131 Motorsports Park will also host a yet-to-be defined NHRA national open July 8-9, leading into a July 10-12 Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series (sportsman) divisional event.",

    "fullText": "I have said this before, but I always have the best intentions on writing when I go on vacation, but it never happens. Good news for you is that you get two weeks of updates of Bayern loanees all wrapped into one article! We will be looking back at the entire month of December so far. This includes the last round of Pokal (and other cup competitions), a European competition window, and two weekends of league play. Pertetz got back into action and Krattenmacher had a goal and an assist off the bench in the Pokal matches. Nübel allowed five goals against Bayern, but then had two great results since. Palhinha has been on a terrible streak without a shot attempt in four matches. Plus, Guzmán helped her team secure a league-cup double in the final match of the season.\n\nThere are nine players from on loan from the first team.\n\nThere are four players on loan to the German Bundesliga: Alexander Nübel, Ibrahimović, Daniel Peretz, and Armindo Sieb.\n\nNübel was on the bench for Stuttgart’s 2-0 win against Bochum in the DFB-Pokal.\n\nHe returned to the starting lineup against his parent club that weekend against at home against Bayern. Things did not go well for him. Although he saved five shots, he also conceded five goals — one of which was due to an error he made. He received no help from his offense and fell at home 5-0.\n\nNübel remained in the lineup for Stuttgart’s home match against Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Europa League. He only saved one attempt on goal in this match, but also conceded a goal. Luckily he did receive scoring support from his team in this match and Suttgart won 4-1.\n\nStuttgart travelled to face Werder Bremen on Sunday. Nübel was in goal again and saved all three shots on goal that he faced and earned the shutout for Stuttgart. His teammates were able to score four road goals to earn a 4-0 win far from home.\n\nStuttgart will host Hoffenheim on Saturday.\n\nIbrahimović was on the bench for the beginning of Heidenheim’s match against Freiburg. He came into the match at halftime with his team down 1-0. He did not have a shot attempt but created two chances for his teammates to shoot. Although he did not directly contribute to a goal, his teammates were able to score two goals and earn the 2-1 win at home.\n\nIbrahimović started for Heidenheim on the road against St Pauli in Hamburg. He had one shot — on goal — and created three chances for his teammates to shoot. This was not enough for Heidenheim to find more than one goal and they fell on the road 2-1.\n\nHeidenheim will host Bayern on Sunday in the final fixture of the calendar year.\n\nPeretz started for Hamburg against Holstein Kiel in the DFB-Pokal last Wednesday. The match was scoreless after 90 minutes and Peretz kept a shutout through 118 minutes. He had three saves in that time, but the one goal was enough to send the match to penalties. In penalties he only saved one attempt but he allowed four goals. They fell 4-2 in penalties and HSV were eliminated from the tournament.\n\nPeretz was on the bench for the next two matches: a 3-2 home win against Werder Bremen and a 4-1 road loss against Hoffenheim.\n\nSieb was not in the matchday lineup for Mainz’ 1-0 home loss against Borussia Monchengladbach. He was on the bench for Mainz’ 1-1 draw in Poland against Lech Poznan in the Conference League and a 2-2 road draw against Bayern in league play, but he did not get into either match.\n\nMainz will host Turkish side Samsunspur on Thursday in the Conference League. They will also host St Pauli on Sunday in the last league match of the year.\n\nThere are two player on loan to the English Premier League: João Palhinha and Jonah Kusi-Asare.\n\nPalhinha was on bench on 12/3 for Spurs’ 2-2 draw at Newcastle but did not get into the match.\n\nPalhinha was again on the bench last weekend at home against Brentford. He entered the match in the 65th minute up 2-0. He did not have a shot attempt nor did he create a shot for his teammates to shoot either. The score did not change while he was on the pitch as Spurs earned the 2-0 win at home.\n\nSpurs hosted Slavia Prague on Tuesday in the Champions League and Palhinha returned to the starting lineup. He again did not have a shot nor a chance created for his teammates to shoot, but Spurs were able to score three goals through an own goal and two penalties. Palhinha helped Spurs keep a shutout with three clearances, an interception, and five recoveries. Spurs earned a lackluster 3-0 home win.\n\nSpurs were away to Nottinham Forest on Sunday and Palhinha started back on the bench. He came into the match in the 59th minute right after Spurs went down 2-0. He again had zero shot attempts and zero chances created for his teammates to shoot. He helped back on defense again with two clearances and four recoveries, but this was not enough to keep Forest from scoring again. Spurs fell 3-0 on the road.\n\nTottenham will host Liverpool on Saturday.\n\nKusi-Asare started on the bench for Fulham as they hosted Manchester City on 12/3. He entered the match in the second half with his team down 5-3. He did not have a shot attempt and created one shot for his teammates to shoot. Fulham were able to score one more, but could not find an equalizer, falling 5-4 at home.\n\nFulham host cross-town rivals Crystal Palace last weekend. Kusi-Asare was on the bench, but did not make it into the match for their 2-1 loss. He was not in the matchday squad for the 3-2 road win against Burnley.\n\nFulham will go on the road to face Newcastle in the EFL Cup on Wednesday in their only match this week.\n\nBryan Zaragoza is the only player on loan to Spain’s La Liga.\n\nZaragoza was not in the matchday squad for Celta Vigo’s Copa del Rey match against second division Sant Andreu. Celta Vigo advanced to the next round after both teams scored in extra time, requiring penalties. They won the penalty shootout 7-6.\n\nZaragoza returned to the squad and started at Real Madrid last weekend. He did not have a shot attempt but assisted the opening goal in the 53rd minute to put his team up 1-0. Ten minutes later Madrid’s Garcia received two yellows within two minutes. Zaragoza was subbed off in the 71st minute and watched Madrid do the same thing in stoppage time as Carreras received two quick yellows and went down to nine men. Celta Vigo scored again directly after and secured a 2-0 win on the road.\n\nCelta Vigo returned home to host Italy’s Bologna in the Europa League. After assisting Swedberg against Madrid, Swedberg returned the favor and assisted Zaragoza’s opening goal in the 17th minute. That was his only shot attempt and he also had zero chances created for his teammates to shoot. He was subbed off at halftime with his goal still the only one in the match. Unfortunately his goal was not enough for his teammates to see the win out. Two second half goals for the road team led to a 2-1 road loss.\n\nZaragoza was on the bench for Celta Vigo’s 2-0 home win against Athletic Club Bilbao, but did not make it into the match.\n\nCelta Vigo will play twice on the road this week: on Wedenday against second division side Albacete in the Copa del Rey and on Saturday in league play against Real Oviedo.\n\nLovro Zvonarek is the only player on loan from the first team to the Swiss Super League.\n\nZvonarek started for Grasshopper in their lone win this month so far on the road against Cham in the Swiss Cup. He did not directly contribute to a goal, but his team scored two quick goals in the first half. He was subbed off in the 62nd minute with his team up 2-0. Cham scored a late goal in stoppage time, but it was not enough. Grasshopper won 2-1 to advance to the next round.\n\nZvonarek started again for Grasshopper last weekend in a home league match against Servette. He had four shots — three blocked and one missed wide — and two chances created for his teammates to shoot. Zvonarek was on the field for the entire match, but could not help his teammates find a goal, and they fell 1-0 at home.\n\nGrasshopper travelled to face Sion on Saturday. Zvonarek started again and played the full 90 minutes. He did not have a shot attempt and had two chances created. He also helped back on defense with an interception and seven recoveries. Grasshopper were shutout again in this match and fell 1-0 on the road.\n\nGrasshopper will travel to face Young Boys on the road on Wednesday and then will host St. Gallen on Sunday for their last match of 2025.\n\nThere are two players from the first team on loan to the 2. Bundesliga: Maurice Krattenmacher and Tarek Buchman.\n\nHertha BSC faced Kaiserslautern at home in the DFB-Pokal on 12/2. Krattenmacher started on the bench and saw a three-goal first half for his team. Hertha scored one more goal before bringing him on in the 72nd minute, up 4-1. Just three minutes later, he recorded an assist on Hertha’s fifth goal. In the 80th minute Krattenmacher scored the sixth and final goal as Hertha cruised to a massive 6-1 home win.\n\nKrattenmacher started on the bench for Hertha’s home league match against Magdeburg last weekend. He entered the match in the 65th minute with his team down 1-0. He had two shots — both blocked — and created one shot for his teammates to shoot. Unfortunately there were not able to find a goal and Magdeburg scored a late goal to end Hertha’s winning streak with a 2-0 shutout for the road team.\n\nHertha travelled to face Greuther Fürth on Friday. Krattenmacher entered the match in the 86th minute after a wild back and forth match led to a 3-3 score. He had one shot on goal and created a chance for his teammates to shoot, but it was not enough to find a winner. The match ended 3-3.\n\nHertha will finish off the year with a home match against Arminia Bielefeld on Friday.\n\nBuchmann is no longer on the injury list, but has not made it back onto a matchday squad since. He missed the 2-2 draw at home against local rivals Greuther Fürth and the 1-0 road loss against Schalke 04.\n\nNürnberg will host Aseko’s Hannover 96 for their last match of the year.\n\nThere are seven players on loan from the second team.\n\nThere are two players on loan from the second team in the 2. Bundesliga: Noel Aseko and Paul Scholl.\n\nAseko started last weekend for Hannover 96 on the road to Preussen Münster. He did not have a shot attempt nor did he create a shot attempt for his teammates. In fact, he had the least amount of touches for anyone that played the full 90 minutes. Hannover took a two-goal lead into the 90th minute but allowed two stoppage time goals — including one from Bavarial Loan Works alum, Oliver Batista-Meier — and had to settle for a 2-2 draw on the road.\n\nHannover hosted Bochum on Saturday. He again had a low number of touches, but this time only played 82 minutes. He again did not have a shot, nor did he create any chances. His best stat was his 100% completed passes, even if he only attempted 12 passes. The match ended scoreless.\n\nHannover will finish the year with a trip to nothern Bavaria to take on Nürnberg.\n\nScholl was on the bench for KSC’s 3-2 road loss to SV Darmstadt but did not make it onto the pitch.\n\nScholl was on the bench against as Karlsruhe hosted Paderborn on Saturday. He came into the match in the 82nd minute when KSC was down three goals and a man. One minute later a second Karlsruhe player was sent off. Scholl had just six touches in his short time on the pitch. Paderborn added a fourth goal and won 4-0.\n\nKSC will be on the road against Bochum on Saturday.\n\nMax Schmitt is the only player on loan in the 3. Liga.\n\nSchmitt was the second keeper for Ulm’s 1-0 win away to Viktoria Köln and a 5-3 home loss against VfL Osnabrück.\n\nUlm will face RW Essen on the road on Saturday.\n\nThere are two players on loan in the Regionalliga Südwest: Benedikt Wimmer and David Emmanuel.\n\nWimmer was not in the matchday squad for Sandhausen’s 3-2 win over Hessen Kassel in their final match of the year.\n\nEmmanuel was on the bench for Kassel’s 3-2 home loss against Sandhausen but did not make it onto the pitch. This was Kassel’s final match of the year\n\nJohnathan Asp Jensen is the only player from the second league on loan to the Swiss Super League.\n\nAsp started for Grasshopper on the road against Cham in the Swiss Cup back on 12/2. He did not directly contribute to a goal, but his team scored two quick goals in the first half. Asp was subbed off in the 76th minute with his team up 2-0. The home team scored a late goal in second half stoppage time, but it was not enough. Grasshopper won 2-1 to advance to the next round.\n\nAsp started last weekend in a home league match against Servette and played the full 90 minutes. He had one shot — blocked before it got to the keeper — and two chances for his teammates to shoot. Asp was not able to help his team find a goal and they fell 1-0 at home.\n\nAsp started for Grasshopper again on the road against Sion. He had a busy day with seven shot attempts — two on goal, four missed high or wide, and one that hit the crossbar — and created one chance for his teammates to shoot. His seventh and final shot attempt came from the penalty spot. His shot was on goal but he was not able to get it past Sion’s keeper. This would have been a late equlizer but instead Grasshopper fell 1-0 on the road.\n\nGrasshopper will travel to face Young Boys on the road on Wednesday and then will host St. Gallen on Sunday for their last match of 2025.\n\nMaximilian Hennig is the only player on loan to the Austrian Bundesliga.\n\nHennig started last weekend for Hartberg at home against LASK. He assisted a goal in the 25th minute to make it 2-0. He also helped on defense with four clearances and a recovery. He was subbed off at halftime with his team up 2-1 and up a man after a late first half red card. He watched a crazy second half as the keeper, Bavarian Loan Works alum Tom Hülsmann received two yellows and was also sent off. LASK equalized in second half stoppage time and the match ended with a 2-2 draw.\n\nHennig was not on the matchday squad for Hartberg’s final match of year — a 2-1 win against WSG Tirol.\n\nMudaser Sedat is the only person on loan to Austria’s second league.\n\nSedat was not in the matchday squad for Amstetten’s 3-3 road draw against Sturm Graz II. Incidentally, Amstetten’s keeper was also sent off in this match. He also missed Amstetten’s last match of the year, a 2-1 win against Admira Wacker.\n\nThere are two players on loan from the women’s team.\n\nEdna Imade is the only player on loan to Spain’s Primera División Femenina.\n\nImade was on the bench for Sociedad’s trip to face Real Madrid. She came into the match in the 58th minute with her team down 1-0. She only had four touches in the time she was on the pitch but created a chance for her teammates to shoot. Her efforts were not enough and Sociedad fell 1-0 on the road.\n\nImade started for Sociedad and played most of the match at home against Deportivo La Coruna. She had six shots — one on goal, one blocked, two missed, and two that hit the woodwork. Luckily her teammates were able to score three goals, even if Imade could not put one of her attempts in.\n\nReal Sociedad will travel to face Deportivo La Coruna again on Sunday, but this time in the Copa del Reina.\n\nAna Guzmán is the only player on loan to Brazil’s Brasileirão Feminino.\n\nGuzmán started on the bench for Palmerias’ second leg of the semifinals of the league playoff. She came into the match in the 78th minute with the match level at 1-1 and up 2-1 aggregate. She had one clearance and one recovery to help her team hold this result and move onto the finals.\n\nLast weekend, in the first leg of the finals, Palmerias hosted Corinthians. Guzmán started on the bench and was subbed in in the 90th minute with her team up 4-1. She was not able to contribute anything to the match, but saw her team score one more goal to make it 5-1.\n\nOn Sunday, Palmerias travelled to face Corinthians in the second leg of the finals with that 5-1 aggregate lead in hand. Guzmán started and played 74 minutes. Palmerias allowed one goal, but still secured the trophy with a 5-2 aggregate win. This secures the league-cup double for Palmerias. With Guzmán’s loan due to end at the end of December, this was a great way to end her loan.",

After that, however, Creekside would take things up a notch or two, maybe even three.\n\nQuarterback Cayden Benson and running back Ced Kelley both scored multiple touchdowns for the Seminoles as they began to break away from the Cadets in the second half.

It's allowed him to evolve as a pitcher, coupled with his confidence.\"\n\nStarting 45 of 46 regular-season games for the Padres from 2024-25, King went 18-12 with a 3.10 ERA and 1.194 WHIP in 247 IP. He battled injuries during his second year in San Diego, limiting him to 73.1 IP over 15 starts.\n\n\"We are playing around with a lot of different ideas and seeing if it takes us anywhere,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman told YES Network last week.\n\nKing transitioned from reliever to starter at the end of his time in New York, a chapter that spanned five MLB seasons (2019-23). He made his MLB debut Sept. 27, 2019, with the Yankees, who landed him from the Miami Marlins in a November 2017 trade.\n\nThe Marlins originally selected King from Boston College with the No. 353 overall pick in the 12th round of the 2016 MLB Draft. The Rochester, N.Y., native played at Warwick (R.I.) Bishop Hendrickson High School before heading to Boston College from 2014-16.",

It was a clear show of respect and care for a player who meant a lot to the organization and the people still wearing black and gold.\n\nMiami later announced that Fitzpatrick was dealing with a calf injury and was questionable to return.\n\nFitzpatrick spent five seasons with the Steelers, from 2019 through 2023, after being traded to Pittsburgh early in the 2019 season. He quickly became a centerpiece of the defense and one of the most trusted players on the field.\n\nDuring his time in Pittsburgh, Fitzpatrick was known for his big plays, leadership, and football smarts. He made multiple Pro Bowls, delivered countless momentum-changing interceptions, and helped lead a defense that was consistently among the league’s best. Just as important, he was extremely well-liked in the locker room and by the fan base.\n\nThat respect was still obvious Monday night. Even in a Dolphins uniform, Fitzpatrick was met with nothing but concern and support from his former coach and teammates. It was a reminder that some relationships in the NFL go beyond teams and jerseys.\n\nFor Steelers fans, it was also a reminder of how special Minkah Fitzpatrick’s time in Pittsburgh was—and why he’s still held in such high regard.",

    "fullText": "Although Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred takes players to the never-before-seen region of Skovos, it also marks the return of many beloved characters.\n\n on December 15, 2025 at 12:42PM PST\n\nAfter two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a \"satisfying\" conclusion and an \"epic, final showdown\" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too.\n\nPrior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of \"Jedi mind tricks,\" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice.\n\nIGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown.\n\nBurns: It's always been our intention. This is an \"Age of Hatred\" or Mephisto-Lilith-themed saga. Even before the base game came out--once we had finished our work on it, but before the actual release date--we were already planning out the next chapters of the story and it was always going to be about the story about Mephisto, his plans for Sanctuary, and ultimately all culminating to a final confrontation with him.\n\nRivera: When it comes to story, there's always things that change and it's trying to figure out what can we keep, what gets lost, and what is the streamline--especially when it comes to telling this really fun, big story. With Vessel of Hatred, we wanted to really dig into Mephisto and his motivation and keep that with Neyrelle. Now we get a chance to end it. I think it's sticking to our themes about family; that's a really big theme that we have with Mephisto and Lilith, and her children and Inarius. I think that it's finally all coming together. And that was always the plan--to have this big story that feels well-thought-out, and characters that you love and you want to fight for and want to fight against.\n\nIGN: And is this the final showdown?\n\nBurns: Yeah, this is a final showdown. We're going to see Mephisto in his full prime evil demonic glory. It's like what Eleni was talking about a little earlier: When you look at the bigger picture, you're seeing these phases of Mephisto, right? In the base game, he's very on the edges. He's not reborn yet and he's taking on the wolf form. In Vessel, he's a little more powerful because now he's in this Soulstone and he's able to do more. And so in Lord of Hatred, it's like there are no more chains on him. And although he's assuming--at first, at least--this form of Akarat, this prophet figure, he likes to manipulate people and do those sorts of things. He's using a new tool now to do that, but ultimately, the story culminates in us facing him, taking off his mask, and really just having this big epic showdown with him.\n\nRivera: It'll be very satisfying, I think, for the players with a lot of the story. There will be satisfaction along with horrors, and I think that's the best thing for Diablo. You've got some crazy, horrific things, and then you get this nice finale.\n\nGameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the Paladin and how they differ from previous games?\n\nBurns: There've been Paladins in Diablo before as well as the Crusader, who's similar to a Paladin in many ways because they're using the light as their source of magic. The Diablo 4 Paladin is a little bit different in terms of the lore and story. Rather than coming from the Zakarum church or being part of this big religion or institution, they're of a smaller order who are independent. And they're just out in the world trying to do good. They've learned from the past that being part of these big institutions inevitably leads to corruption, so they've purposefully, intentionally gone out and said, \"We're not going to get involved in that kind of stuff. We're just going to find the light within us and use that to do good out in the world.\" And so they have these oaths that they live by so that they don't follow the corruption and that sort of thing.\n\nEleni Rivera: The fun part is that we get to reinvent the Paladin. While they recognize the past, they know about the Zakarum, they know about other Paladins that have existed… They get to redefine who they are, what they are, and what The Order is. That's who they are. They even choose a new name when they join The Order, and their name is directly connected to what they find the most important within it. It's so cool. You get a chance to see this new form of who they are.\n\nBurns: And what's interesting about them too is they--due to their close connection with the light--are also aware of angels and the heavens. They know that angels are beings of light. And so they don't worship angels or anything like that, but they see them as these embodiments of light and embodiments of values that are associated with the light, like valor.\n\nGameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the region that's coming with the expansion? Are there any real-life locations that inspired it, or parts of history?\n\nBurns: Skovos is really cool, really unique, and interesting to Sanctuary. We mentioned earlier that Skovos is where Lilith, Inarius, and these other rebel angels and demons created Sanctuary, and then they hung out in Skovos. It wasn't necessarily called Skovos back then, but they lived there at the dawn of the world. This is where they created humans, or rather where they created the first humans: the Firstborn. When you think about this saga as a story of family, as Eleni said, or maybe as one about what humanity's fate is, it makes sense to bring this culmination with Mephisto to where humanity itself began. There's tons of Firstborn ruins and, sometimes, not even ruins--it's the modern-day people, the Askari. They've maintained this architecture, they live within it, and they see the Firstborn as part of their heritage in a way, even though it's distant.\n\nThere's a lot of different environments throughout these different islands. Each one of them has a unique theme and flavor. We explore a lot of the culture of this place, so you have the Amazons and you have this oracle order, this Order of Seers. We get to see how they work together and how they rule over this island nation to help it function and survive all this terrible stuff that's happening in other parts of Sanctuary.\n\nBut the big interesting point of conflict is that now the bad stuff that was happening in Sanctuary--the stuff that we saw in base game and Vessel of Hatred--now it's coming to Skovos. Mephisto, in the body of Akarat, has gathered a bunch of followers, he's brought them all to Skovos, and he's disrupting the order and the piece of this place. Anything you want to add to that, Eleni?\n\nRivera: I feel like you covered a lot of it, but it's really beautiful. It's stunning and it's a place that you haven't seen before, so I think that's really exciting. And there's just a lot to look at. There's water that you get to look at, and I know that's very small, but it's just… the environment team did a really good job. And in general, there's a lot of deep lore that we got a chance to explore there. I think that'll be really exciting for players who really love lore and players who are also just diving into Diablo for the first time.\n\nGameSpot: And compared to Vessel, how large is Lord of Hatred? How many hours of story can we expect?\n\nRivera: I would say it's comparable to Vessel of Hatred. The map is pretty big. Like Matt said, there's a lot of lore stuff you get to explore in Skovos, so it's got quite a bit of content that the players get to dive into.\n\nPC Gamer: How do you approach creating a villain like Mephisto in a way that feels like a threat to the player, given that our player characters have just killed tons of demons that were already very powerful?\n\nRivera: It's narrative. It's understanding what a player's weakness is, right? And it's building that up and connecting the player to people like Neyrelle and Lorath. You have these stakes that get bigger and bigger because you care about them more. So when it comes to someone who's so powerful, or someone who can defeat all these demons, what really is the thing that will get them to crack? It's the people that they love, the people that they want to fight for, and Sanctuary. And when it comes to creating a really big villain, it's building off that.\n\nBurns: When we first introduced [Mephisto] in the base game, part of the reason we introduced him that way is because he's not the antagonist in the story yet. We're hunting Lilith and he's helping us, and so it's creating this feeling of, \"Yeah, I don't know if I should trust him or I shouldn't trust him, but he's sort of useful to me, so at what point will the usefulness wear out or will he turn the tables on me?\" Because it's going to happen eventually, right? I think we wanted to introduce him that way just so that it would feel a little different than suddenly there's a prime evil sitting in front of you and you just want to fight him.\n\nI mean Eleni said it perfectly: It's how his effect on the characters we care about--and on the world at large--raises the stakes. And again, we're continuing this thread of him always being a bit of a devil on our shoulder. We're not always working with the best characters--sometimes our allies are a little shifty, too. He exploits that reality. He makes us doubt, maybe sometimes our actions, and the people around us.\n\nIGN: How do you make side quests feel like an organic part of the story when there's literally Satan running around?\n\nBurns: One thing that we've done is there are a number of side quests where it's a continuation of a character story that you meet in the main campaign. There are quests that follow an important character that you're around for some amount of time, and now you get to see what has happened to them after all these big events have unfolded. Yeah, Mephisto is running around and the stakes are so high, but what's going on with these other characters? It's about showing the aftermath of those big events, or showing the repercussions of the devil running loose.\n\nRivera: Yeah. I mean, the main story is so specific to our main characters, but the side quests are what breathe life into Sanctuary. They show us what everybody else is doing while the world is crumbling, and seeing intimate stories--seeing what other characters who maybe we know but they're not in the main quest--I think that gives us a chance as writers to dive deeper, and gives players get the chance to understand what these people are doing while there is this chaos. Life keeps on life-ing even when you've got Mephisto running amok. And I think that's the cool part about writing side quests.\n\nGameSpot: It seems like this idea of generational trauma is really at the core of this saga. Is that something that was intentional to this story? Are there some other ideas and themes that you were really hoping to get across and explore?\n\nBurns: Yes. One of the themes that's present throughout is this idea of the passing of the torch, or like you said, it's sort of a generational… Maybe trauma is part of it, but also how you pass on legacy, and whether you can even pass it on at all. And in passing on a legacy, what kind of burden are you putting on the new people?\n\nFor Lilith wanting to protect Sanctuary, or for the Horadrim wanting to do their thing, these are not easy jobs, right? They require a lot of sacrifice. Sometimes the goal is noble, but passing it on can be hard because you know that you're dooming these people to a tough life. That's definitely a theme that we played with in base game and Vessel, and also we explore in Lord of Hatred as well.\n\nThere's also this prophecy in the base game, and I think it shows up in Vessel of Hatred too, that Rathma had. He had these visions and saw the Great Serpent, and this is still a part of the story. As Eleni said, fate is a big theme and so is this prophecy, how it's unfolding, what it actually means, and whether it must happen or can be avoided. This thing will unfold and be fulfilled, but maybe not in the way the characters necessarily suspect. There will be a lot of sacrifices and choices made by characters that there are no coming back from. [Lord of Hatred] is going to be a big, exciting culmination of everything that started in the base game.\n\nPC Gamer: Could you talk a little bit more about Lilith coming back to the story and what her role is? I know there are quite a few players that really, really enjoyed her in the first game.\n\nRivera: We all love Lilith, right? She's cool, she's hot, she's our mom. I think it's really exciting we get a chance to see her in a new way. There's a lot of intimacy that we get to have with Lilith, and I think that we've always wanted to--or at least I've always wanted to--partner up with her. But Lilith will always be a demon at the end of the day. She has her own motivations and she's always going to have her own idea of what she wants in the world. So she has to decide whether or not she wants to ally with us for this bigger problem.\n\nBurns: The only thing I'd add is, again, it's about bringing these different threads to a close. In the base game, we were fed Lilith's blood petals--fed her blood. She's been a part of us this whole time. And though we defeated her in Hell, something of her has lived on in us. There's a presence inside of us that is slumbering basically. And now that we're going after Mephisto and the stakes are high and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, her presence within us really becomes a key to figuring out how to stop Mephisto. Like she said in the base game, \"There would be no victory without me.\" That sort of idea, it's true--we will need her to fix this and to save Sanctuary from Mephisto.\n\nGameSpot: What inspired the decision to bring back Lilith so soon? Were you a bit worried about bringing her back or was it just something that seemed like, \"Oh no, we have to do this?\"\n\nBurns: Like when I mentioned earlier, before the base game actually released and we were planning out future stories, we always did want to bring her back. Then it became a question of when. It was about finding the right opportunity to do it and make it feel the most impactful to the story.\n\nDuring [Vessel of Hatred's] development, we were toying around with the idea. We actually made some of these scenes where you heard her speaking. There was a scene where you saw her reflection or something like that too, but we cut those things out of Vessel because we were just trying to figure out, \"Okay, where's the place where we should highlight that so that it feels like something really juicy and impactful and not just a little thing that happens and then there's no payoff for it yet?\" You know what I mean?\n\nRivera: I feel like one of the biggest things is deciding how much payoff we want. We talk a lot about how this expansion is going to be super satisfying and everything will feel like it's tied together. Vessel of Hatred was the story of Neyrelle, it was a story of Mephisto, and it was about seeing what he could do without the power of being in Sanctuary. Now that he's out, it's seeing what he's going to do with this free will back in Sanctuary but masked as this major religious figure.\n\nBurns: One fun thing we're doing in Lord of Hatred that we didn't really do before is, with Lilith, you have different dialogue options for how you want to respond to her about certain things. We know that people have different feelings for her--whether she was right, whether she was wrong or whether they would've wanted to join her or not--and so we wanted to explore that through some of the dialogue you can have with her. Now, you get to see different ways she'll respond to you as well based on your decisions.\n\nRivera: I feel like Lilith is so nuanced and so complex. You get a mix of seduction and horror all at the same time and it's so cool and fun. And now we get a chance to really see her in a different way. When we last saw her we were fighting against her, but now there's a bigger issue. There's more at stake here, so it's her deciding what's important to her.\n\nGameSpot: You brought up that you now have options for how you want to interact with Lilith, and I thought that was really interesting because, right now, choice-driven, branching CRPGs are becoming more of the standard in the industry. Is that something that you've ever thought about exploring with Diablo? Having more choice throughout the story, exploring maybe different endings, different stories, and branching paths? Is that even possible in the structure of the game?\n\nBurns: I think it's cool and I enjoy that kind of stuff too. For Lord of Hatred, it's \n\nRivera: That's why we do it sometimes in side quests. It's not like you have two different paths, but I do think we get to explore a little bit of that. There was a side quest from, I think in Vessel of Hatred, that you get to have an alternate ending based on what you choose.\n\nIGN: Romance options? That's all I got.\n\nBlizzard PR representative: Are you asking, \"Can we hook up with Lilith?\"\n\nGameSpot: It's what everybody's thinking.\n\nRivera: In terms of romance, we get to see a little bit of Lorath's past, which is something that we haven't really gotten a chance to see with other characters. He has interactions with Queen Adriana that we get to see. We also get to see a lot more of Lorath, how he was painted in the past, and who he was versus who he's become now.\n\nPC Gamer: Is Lorath back? Are we going to hear more Ralph Ineson?\n\nBurns: Yeah, Lorath is one of the main characters in the expansion. He's going to be with you almost all the time throughout the campaign, except the times you split up and you're off doing different things, right? But yeah, he's there, he's continuing his story. There's a lot about Lorath and the Horadrim in Lord of Hatred. And again, it goes back to the themes of legacy and the fate of the Horadrim.\n\nWe've been in VO sessions with Ralph recording all of his lines, and it's always great to hear his voice again. The moment you hear it, you're like, \"Oh yeah, it's Lorath.\" That's been really fun and I'm super excited about Lorath's story in Lord of Hatred. I think it has a lot of great moments. He's a lot of fun to write as a character and, again, Ralph's voice is just amazing.\n\nAnother thing is Lorath has a history in Skovos, and that's something we'll explore in the campaign but, years and years ago, he came to Skovos with some other Horadrim and went on an adventure there. He met this Amazon named Adriana and they formed a bond, so he has some history with her. And now Adriana is the Amazon queen of Skovos. So with him coming back, there's a connection he has to this place that we're going to explore.\n\nIGN: I'm curious about how you guys are going to make players care about Akarat. The importance of the final cut scene of Vessel of Hatred might have been lost on people unless they're in deep on Diablo, but he's obviously a different type of puppet than a wolf. I'm curious about how you think about bringing Akarat as a character into the fold--and all the baggage that comes with him--and trying to explain why that matters while also showing this new version of the Lord of Hatred who is now walking around as a deity.\n\nRivera: When it comes to Akarat, he's just going to appear as a normal man. I think what is going to really cut deep is the amount of people who are now rushing to get to Skovos; seeing the influence that he has because he's such a big figure in the world and he's been doing miracles in Sanctuary. The idea of all these people worshiping this person that you know as a player is Mephisto, I think that is where that terror starts to come.\n\nHe also has his Jedi mind tricks, right? Mephisto is very good at getting in your head. You think you see one thing, but really he's showing you something else and that's the power. We get a chance to show how Mephisto really plays with your emotions and I think that's the best part about him.\n\nBurns: Just to add to that, a couple interesting things about Mephisto in this form--and ways to create interest for folks playing through it--is at first he's defying expectations, right? Yeah, he's a prime evil in this body, but he's not doing anything bad, which is interesting because that's how Mephisto was in the base game as well. Oftentimes, he's just telling you the truth. Maybe he's trying to get his own way by saying it, but he isn't always lying about things. Right now, he's just out there helping people and doing miracles. So it becomes this question, or this mystery, of what is he doing it all for? Why is he putting on this act? What's his end game for it all?\n\nThe other thing--and this ties into our themes--is that I think that Mephisto believes that humans don't really have any control over their fate. They're just cattle that more advanced entities or intelligent entities like him can lead around. What he's doing here is almost to prove a point to us, The Wanderer, and also to Lilith; you can create these things, these humans, and you can hope that they have some kind of free will or agency, but ultimately I'm going to show you that they don't. That's something else we play with, again, to just deepen his character a bit and make it more interesting.\n\nIGN: You have described Diablo IV as The Hatred Saga, and with this being the final confrontation with the Lord of Hatred, one would assume that that means that's the end of the aforementioned saga. I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about Diablo IV's future. I'm assuming that there's going to be more Diablo IV after this.\n\nBurns: You're right in terms of us just looking at it as The Hatred Saga, and really that's been our focus--just bringing this story to a close in a really big and impactful way. But there are other stories to tell on Sanctuary, of course, though I can't really go into detail about any other stuff.\n\nRivera: I think the best part is Diablo's live service. It gives us the opportunity to dive into whatever we want. Like Season 11, right? We get a chance to bring Hadriel back and we're getting a chance to talk to this angel that we only met briefly in Diablo II. We get to expand Hadriel's lore, which is really cool. We get a chance to always, possibly, tell new stories. But right now, we're just focusing on getting this expansion out and seeing what happens.\n\nThe above interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",

    "fullText": "It’s been three years since OpenAI set off euphoria over artificial intelligence with the release of ChatGPT. And while the money is still pouring in, so are the doubts about whether the good times can last.\n\nA recent sell-off in the shares of Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp.’s plunge after reporting mounting spending on AI, souring sentiment around a network of companies exposed to OpenAI — signs of skepticism are increasing. Looking to 2026, the debate among investors is whether to rein in AI exposure ahead of a potential bubble popping or double down to capitalize on the game-changing technology.\n\n“We’re in the phase of the cycle where the rubber meets the road,” said Jim Morrow, chief executive of Callodine Capital Management. “It’s been a good story, but we’re sort of anteing up at this point to see whether the returns on investment are going to be good.”\n\nThe queasiness about the AI trade involves its uses, the enormous cost of developing it, and whether consumers ultimately will pay for the services. Those answers will have major implications for the stock market’s future.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 index’s three-year, $30-trillion bull run has largely been driven by the world’s biggest tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as firms benefiting from spending on AI infrastructure such as chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom Inc. and electricity providers such as Constellation Energy Corp. If they stop rising, the equities indexes will follow.\n\n“These stocks don’t correct because the growth rate goes down,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital. “These stocks correct when the growth rate doesn’t accelerate any further.”\n\nOf course, there are still plenty of reasons for optimism. The tech giants that account for much of the AI spending have vast resources and have pledged to keep pumping in cash in the years ahead. Plus, developers of AI services, such as Alphabet’s Google, continue to make strides with new models. Hence the debate.\n\nHere’s a look at the key trends to watch while navigating through these choppy waters.\n\nOpenAI alone plans to spend $1.4 trillion in the coming years. But the Sam Altman-led company, which became the world’s most valuable startup in October, is generating far less revenue than its operating costs. It expects to burn $115 billion through 2029 before generating cash in 2030, the Information reported in September.\n\nThe company has had no problem with fundraising, collecting $40 billion from Softbank Group Corp. and other investors earlier this year. Nvidia pledged to invest as much as $100 billion in September, one of a series of deals the chipmaker has made that funnel cash to its customers, which is causing fears of circular financing in the AI industry.\n\nOpenAI could run into trouble if investors start to balk at committing more capital. And the consequences would spiral to the companies in its orbit, such as computing services provider CoreWeave Inc.\n\n“If you think about how much money — it’s in the trillions now — is crowded into a small group of themes and names, when there’s the first hint of that theme even having short-term issues or just valuations get so stretched they can’t possibly continue to grow like that, they’re all leaving at once,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund.\n\nPlenty of other companies are reliant on external funding to pursue AI ambitions. Oracle shares soared as it racked up bookings for cloud computing services, but building those data centers will require massive amounts of cash, which the company has secured by selling tens of billions of dollars in bonds. Using debt puts pressure on a company because bondholders need to be paid in cash on a schedule, unlike equity investors, who mostly profit as share prices rise.\n\nOracle’s stock got pounded on Thursday after the company reported significantly higher capital expenditures than expected in its fiscal second quarter and cloud sales growth missed the average analyst estimate. On Friday, a report that some data center projects it’s developing for OpenAI have been delayed sent Oracle’s shares down further and weighed on other stocks exposed to AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, a gauge of Oracle’s credit risk hit the highest level since 2009.\n\nAn Oracle spokesperson said in a statement that the company remained confident in its ability to meet its obligations and future expansion plans.\n\n“The credit people are smarter than the equity people, or at least they’re worried about the right thing — getting their money back,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to spend more than $400 billion on capital expenditures in the next 12 months, most of it for data centers. Although those companies are seeing AI-related revenue growth from cloud-computing and advertising businesses, it’s nowhere near the costs they’re incurring.\n\n“Any plateauing of growth projections or decelerations, we’re going to wind up in a situation where the market says, ‘OK, there’s an issue here,’” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.\n\nEarnings growth for the Magnificent Seven tech giants, which also includes Apple Inc., Nvidia and Tesla Inc., is projected to be 18% in 2026, the slowest in four years and slightly better than the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nRising depreciation expenses from the data center binge is a major worry. Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta combined for about $10 billion in depreciation costs in the final quarter of 2023. The figure rose to nearly $22 billion in the quarter that just ended in September. And it’s expected to be about $30 billion by this time next year.\n\nAll of this could put pressure on buybacks and dividends, which return cash to stockholders. In 2026, Meta and Microsoft are expected to have negative free cash flow after accounting for shareholder returns, while Alphabet is seen roughly breaking even, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern about all the spending is the strategy shift it represents. Big Tech’s value has long been premised on the companies’ ability to generate rapid revenue growth at low costs, which resulted in immense free cash flows. But their plans for AI have turned that upside down.\n\n“If we continue down the track of lever up our company to build out for the hopes that we can monetize this, multiples are going to contract,” O’Rourke said. “If things don’t come together for you, this whole pivot would have been a drastic mistake.”\n\nWhile Big Tech’s valuations are high, they’re nowhere near excessive compared with past periods of market euphoria. Comparisons with the dot-com bust are common, but the magnitude of the gains from AI are nothing like what happened during the development of the internet. For example, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is priced at 26 times projected profits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That figure exceeded 80 times at the height of the dot-com bubble.\n\nValuations during the dot-com era were far in excess of where they are now partly because of how far the stocks had run, but also because the companies were younger and less profitable — if they had profits at all.\n\n“These aren’t dot-com multiples,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer and portfolio manager of fundamental equities at BlackRock. “This isn’t to say there aren’t pockets of speculation or irrational exuberance, because there are, but I don’t think that exuberance is in the AI-related names of the Mag 7.”\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc., which trades at a multiple of more than 180 times estimated profits, is among the AI stocks with nosebleed valuations. Snowflake Inc. is another, with a multiple of almost 140 times projected earnings. But Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft are all below 30 times, which is relatively tame considering all the euphoria surrounding them.\n\nAll of which leaves investors in a quandary. Yes, the risks are right on the surface even as investors keep pouring into AI stocks. But for now, most companies aren’t priced at panic-inducing levels. The question is which direction the AI trade goes from here.\n\n“This kind of group thinking is going to crack,” Value Point’s Bhasin said. “It probably won’t crash like it did in 2000. But we’ll see a rotation.”\n\nWittenstein writes for Bloomberg.",

    "fullText": "What began the year as one of the best trades in the stock market has, in a matter of months, turned into one of the worst.\n\nAn array of public companies thought they had found a sort of perpetual motion machine: Use your corporate cash to buy up bitcoin or other digital tokens and presto, your share price shot up even more than the value of the tokens you bought.\n\nIt was a playbook invented by Michael Saylor, who transformed his company, Strategy Inc., into a publicly traded bitcoin holding vehicle. And through the first half of 2025 it worked for more than a hundred other companies that followed Saylor’s lead.\n\nDigital asset treasuries, as these firms became known, turned into one of the hottest trends in the public markets, as share prices skyrocketed and everyone from Peter Thiel to the Trump family piled in.\n\nOne prominent entrant, SharpLink Gaming Inc., soared more than 2,600% in a matter of days as the company said it would pivot from its old work in gaming, and sell shares to buy up lots and lots of Ethereum tokens, with one of Ethereum’s co-founders as the chairman.\n\nBut it was always hard to explain why tokens should be worth more just because they were held by a public company, and the wheels began to come off the car, at first slowly and then much more quickly.\n\nIn the case of SharpLink, the stock has fallen 86% from its peak, leaving the whole company worth less than the digital tokens it owns. The company now trades at roughly 0.9 times its Ether holdings. It was, at least, spared the fate of Greenlane Holdings, which plunged more than 99% this year, despite its stash of around $48 million BERA crypto tokens.\n\n“Investors took a look and understood that there’s not much yield from these holdings rather than just sitting on this pile of money, and that’s why they contracted,” B. Riley Securities Analyst Fedor Shabalin said in an interview.\n\nAmong the U.S. and Canadian-listed companies that became digital asset treasuries, the median stock price has fallen 43% this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin, by comparison, is down around just 6% since the beginning of the year.\n\nSome lucky digital asset treasuries are still worth more than their underlying holdings, but most have been losers for people who bought them when they were anywhere near their peaks and 70% are on track to end the year below where they began it, according to Bloomberg’s calculations.\n\nThe worst performers have been public companies that eschewed bitcoin and went for smaller, more volatile tokens.\n\nTwo of Trump’s sons lined up behind Alt5 Sigma Corp., a public company that set out to buy more than a billion dollars of WLFI, a token issued by a separate company that was co-founded by the Trump family. Those shares have fallen about 86% from their peak in June.\n\nThe volatility of these stocks is explained, at least in part, by all the money that was borrowed to pay for the corporate crypto acquisitions.\n\nStrategy came up with a remarkable array of convertible bonds and preferred shares that funded the company’s bitcoin purchases, with the tokens growing to be worth more than $70 billion at one point. Digital asset treasuries as a group raised more than $45 billion this year to purchase crypto tokens, according to Shabalin at B. Riley.\n\nNow, though, Strategy and all the other companies are on the hook to make the interest and dividend payments on that debt. That is a problem because their crypto holdings, for the most part, don’t generate any cash flow.\n\n“If you own Strategy, you own the bitcoin risk plus whatever kind of corporate stress, corporate risk they are taking on,” RIA Advisors Portfolio Manager Michael Lebowitz said in an interview.\n\nStrategy has recently tried to raise more capital to keep the flywheel spinning, turning to Europe in November to sell perpetual preferred stocks at a discount, after U.S. preferred shares sales fell short of expectations. But those euro-denominated preferred stocks have already fallen below their offer price.\n\nMeanwhile, for smaller digital asset treasuries without name recognition, capital raising opportunities are even harder to come by as crypto prices decline and investor enthusiasm wanes.\n\nFor Strategy, the obvious next step is to sell some of its crypto holdings to pay the bills. And that is what Saylor’s chief executive officer, Phong Le, said the company might do.\n\n“We can sell bitcoin and we would sell bitcoin if we needed to fund our dividend payments,” Le said on a podcast.\n\nLe said he will look at this option if the company’s so-called mNAV falls below 1, a calculation that would suggest the company’s market value has fallen below the value of its crypto holdings.\n\nThese comments shook the digital asset treasury industry because Saylor had said many times that he would not sell his bitcoin, and would buy more when the price went down.\n\n“Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin,” he joked in a February post on X.\n\nThe big concern now is that digital asset treasuries will be forced to sell their crypto, which will push down the prices of those tokens, setting off a downward spiral.\n\n“If there’s a headline that says Strategy sold, even if it’s three bitcoin, I think after everything Michael Saylor has said about he’s never selling a dime, people are going to start to question the whole bitcoin trade,” Lebowitz said.\n\nStrategy has created a $1.4-billion reserve fund to cover dividend payments in the near term. And shares are still up more than 1,200% since it started buying bitcoin in August 2020. But they are on track for a 38% decline this year.\n\nThe digital asset treasury wipeout risks bleeding into broader markets if traders are using borrowed money, which could force them to sell in order to cover margin calls. For now, the problems have largely cut off the flow of new companies adopting the strategy — and the burst of capital markets activity that it created.\n\nBut there are signs that there may be at least some new activity from somewhat more valuable digital asset treasuries acquiring smaller digital asset treasuries that are worth less than their holdings.\n\nStrive Inc., co-founded by former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, agreed to acquire Semler Scientific Inc. in an all-stock deal in September, merging the two bitcoin treasury companies. Semler was one of the first digital asset treasuries and has fallen 65% this year.\n\nRoss Carmel, a partner at Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel, expects that mergers and acquisitions will pick up for digital asset treasuries in early 2026 with a focus on the potential for further pain.\n\nThe industry is likely to see more structured securities transactions “that can be used to give these investors more downside protection in these deals,” Carmel said.",

    "fullText": "I’m a sucker for remoras. The streamlined fish are the ocean’s perfect hitchhiker, honed by millions of years of evolution to catch a ride with some of the sea’s biggest movers and shakers—sharks, whales, rays, even turtles. And now remoras can add another accomplishment to their already impressive resume: They were the inspiration for a space mission that could make autonomous tandem space missions in low Earth orbit.\n\nTwo private space companies recently revealed that they were conducting a test run of what’s called rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) technology. Essentially, two spacecraft, made by Impulse Space, used software from another space company, Starfish Space, to come within about 4,000 feet of each other as they floated high above Earth. The collaboration, called “Remora” by the companies involved, demonstrated the accuracy of such RPO technology, which could be used to bring two spacecraft in lockstep orbit—remora-like—to autonomously service the multitude of satellites that encircle the Earth.\n\nBut back to the watery realm. Remoras likely evolved from more garden variety fish starting about 32 million years ago. Cobia, the closest living relatives of remoras, are free-living and don’t latch onto other marine organisms. But they do provide an interesting model of how remoras may have come about.\n\nCobia look remarkably similar to remoras save for the one thing that makes the latter a champion marine hitchiker—a suction cup positioned on the tops of their heads. That structure most likely morphed through time from a dorsal fin on the remora’s ancestor, an insight definitively proven by researchers in 2012, after naturalists had been suggesting as much since the early 1800s.\n\nThat evolutionary innovation helps modern day remoras glom onto all sorts of their fellow oceanic travelers—sharks, whales, turtles, and more—while snapping up their scraps and sometimes picking off parasites. Interestingly, cobia also tend to tag along with larger marine swimmers, such as manta rays, marlins, and sharks. They just don’t employ a sucker to keep hold.\n\nI for one am glad to see remora get their moment in the spaceflight spotlight in the shallows of the cosmic ocean.\n\nEnjoying  Nautilus? \n\nLead image: Richard ling / Wikimedia",

    "title": "New Quantum Antenna Reveals a Hidden Terahertz World",
    "description": "Researchers at the University of Warsaw have unveiled a breakthrough method for detecting and precisely calibrating terahertz frequency combs using a quantum antenna made from Rydberg atoms. By combining atomic electrometry with a powerful terahertz-to-light conversion technique, they achieved the first measurement of a single terahertz comb tooth—something previously impossible due to the limits of electronics and optical tools.",
    "fullText": "A research team from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw has introduced a new way to measure hard-to-detect terahertz signals using a \"quantum antenna.\" In their work, the scientists applied an innovative radio wave detection setup based on Rydberg atoms that not only senses terahertz radiation, but also accurately calibrates a so-called frequency comb in this part of the spectrum. Until recently, the terahertz range was considered a blank area in the electromagnetic spectrum, and the method reported in the journal Optica opens the door to extremely sensitive spectroscopy and a new class of room-temperature quantum sensors.\n\nTerahertz (THz) radiation, being part of the electromagnetic spectrum, lies at the boundary of electronics and optics, positioned between microwaves (used, for example, in Wi-Fi) and infrared. Although it holds immense potential for applications that include inspecting packages without harmful X-rays, superspeed 6G communication, and spectroscopy and imaging of organic compounds, turning this potential into precise and sensitive measurements has been technically very difficult. In the past few years, scientists have made major strides in both generating and detecting terahertz radiation, yet until now they had not been able to measure a frequency comb in this region with the required precision.\n\nFrequency combs as ultra-precise electromagnetic rulers\n\nWhy is this so important? Frequency combs, which earned a Nobel Prize in 2005, can be imagined as an incredibly accurate ruler made not from a solid material, but from light or radio waves. Instead of millimeter markings, there is a sequence of evenly spaced lines (\"teeth\") at strictly defined frequencies. This \"electromagnetic ruler\" lets physicists determine the frequency of an unknown signal with extraordinary accuracy simply by seeing which \"tooth\" it matches. Because of this, frequency combs act as reference standards that can be used to calibrate and stabilize many types of instruments over a wide range of frequencies. Depending on where in the electromagnetic spectrum this ruler sits, scientists talk about optical, radio, or terahertz frequency combs.\n\nTerahertz frequency combs are particularly attractive because they can support calibration and highly accurate measurements in a band where the oscillation frequencies are higher than typical radio waves but lower than optical waves (light). However, such combs are notoriously difficult to measure with high precision, since their oscillations are too rapid for conventional electronics and cannot be directly captured with standard optical methods. Researchers have been able to determine the spacing between the comb \"teeth\" and to measure the total power spread across the spectrum, but determining how much power belongs to a single tooth has remained a major challenge.\n\nRydberg atoms turned into quantum antennas\n\nThe scientists from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw have now overcome this obstacle and, for the first time, measured the signal emitted by a single terahertz comb tooth. To achieve this, they employed a gas of rubidium atoms prepared in a Rydberg state. A Rydberg atom is defined as having a single electron excited to a very high orbit by being illuminated with precisely tuned lasers. This \"swollen\" atom acts as a quantum antenna that is extremely sensitive to external electric fields. In addition, by using tunable lasers, the detector can be adjusted to respond to one specific frequency within such a field, across a range that extends up to terahertz waves.\n\nTraditionally, in Rydberg electrometry, the phenomenon of Autler-Townes splitting is used to measure the electric field. Its huge advantage is that the measurement result depends only on fundamental atomic constants, providing an absolutely calibrated readout. Unlike classical antennas, which require laborious calibration in specialized radio laboratories, the atomic-based system is, in a sense, a standard unto itself. Moreover, thanks to the richness of energy states in the atom, such a sensor can be tuned almost continuously over an enormous range, from a direct current (DC) signal up to the aforementioned terahertz.\n\nHybrid terahertz to light conversion for extreme sensitivity\n\nHowever, this method has a limitation: on its own, it is not sensitive enough to record very weak terahertz signals. To remedy this, the research team additionally applied a radio wave-to-light conversion technique invented at the University of Warsaw and adapted it to the needs of terahertz radiation. In this process, the weak terahertz signal is converted into optical photons, which can then be detected with immense sensitivity using single-photon counters. This hybrid approach is the key to success: it combines the extreme sensitivity of photon detection with the ability to \"recover\" the calibration capabilities of the Autler-Townes method even for the weakest signals.\n\nThe sensor based on Rydberg atoms possesses all the features needed to perform precise frequency comb calibration: it can be tuned to a single tooth of the comb, and then retuned to the next, and the next. The scientists managed to observe several dozen teeth in a very wide frequency range this way. Additionally, thanks to the knowledge of the fundamental properties of atoms, the comb was directly calibrated, precisely determining its intensity.\n\nNew path for terahertz metrology and future technologies\n\nThe results obtained by the physicists from the University of Warsaw Wiktor Krokosz, Jan Nowosielski, Bartosz Kasza, Sebastian Borówka, Mateusz Mazelanik, Wojciech Wasilewski, and Michał Parniak represent much more than the development of another sensitive detector. Their work lays the groundwork for a new area of metrology. With the help of Rydberg atoms, the transformative uses of optical frequency combs can now be extended into the previously difficult terahertz region. Importantly, unlike many quantum technologies that require extremely low temperatures, this system functions at room temperature, which greatly lowers costs and makes future commercialization more realistic. This creates an opportunity to build reference measurement standards for the coming generation of terahertz technologies.\n\nThe project \"Quantum Optical Technologies\" (FENG.02.01-IP.05-0017/23) is implemented as part of Measure 2.1 International Research Agendas of the Foundation for Polish Science, co-financed by the European Union from Priority 2 of the European Funds for Modern Economy Programme 2021-2027 (FENG). The research is also one of the results of the SONATA17 and PRELUDIUM23 projects funded by the National Science Centre.)\n\nMaterials provided by University of Warsaw, Faculty of Physics.

    "fullText": "If you’re dreaming of sunny days on Kauaʻi’s famous shores, there’s a new rule you should know before heading to the beach. In a landmark environmental move, Kauaʻi County Mayor Derek S.K. Kawakami signed Bill No. 2976 on December 10, 2025, which will ban the sale, rental, and distribution of disposable polystyrene foam bodyboards across the island.\n\nThis may sound like a small policy change, but for locals, visitors, business owners, and ocean lovers alike, it marks a significant shift in how Hawaii’s communities are choosing to protect their beaches and marine ecosystems.\n\nUnder the new ordinance, disposable bodyboards made of polystyrene foam, which is the inexpensive, lightweight boards commonly sold at beachside shops, will no longer be allowed to be sold, rented, or handed out anywhere in Kauaʻi County. The ban doesn’t go into effect immediately, but will begin one year after the bill’s approval, giving local businesses and vendors time to adjust and transition to alternative products.\n\nThe foam was previously banned in January 2022 for all food related use, including cups, plates, and bowls (with exceptions for foods prepared off-island and shipped in, as well as containers used to package raw or butchered meats, poultry, fish and eggs). After this ban occurred under Bill 2775, all four of Hawaii's counties officially had polystyrene foam food bans, making Hawaii a “foam free” state, one of only five in the U.S.\n\nThe law creates a new environmental section in the Kauaʻi County Code aimed at reducing pollution and safeguarding coastal habitats. It also sets up civil penalties for violations, including escalating fines for businesses that don’t comply once the law is in force. Enforcement is expected to be handled by the county’s Public Works Solid Waste Division, with further legal action possible through the County Attorney’s office.\n\n“This ordinance reflects our responsibility to care for Kaua‘i’s environment. By encouraging durable alternatives, we are reducing waste, protecting marine life, and ensuring our islands remain beautiful for generations to come,” said Councilmember Fern Holland, who introduced the bill.\n\nAt the heart of the ban is concern for the island’s environment. Disposable polystyrene foam boards, often inexpensive and popular with casual beachgoers, are typically used only a few times before being thrown away. But that lightweight foam material doesn’t just disappear. Over time, these boards can break apart into tiny fragments, which are then carried by wind and waves into the ocean, onto shorelines, or into landfill sites.\n\nOnce in the environment, these tiny particles, often referred to as microplastics, pose a real threat to wildlife. Sea birds, fish, turtles, and other marine animals can mistakenly ingest this debris, leading to digestive issues, starvation, or even death. Fragmented foam can also entangle wildlife and contribute to larger pollution problems that harm reefs, beaches, and even water quality.\n\nMayor Kawakami summed up the reasoning succinctly: “Disposable bodyboards may seem small, but their impact has been anything but small. By eliminating polystyrene foam boards from stores and rentals, we are protecting our beaches, our ocean, and the wildlife that calls Kaua‘i home.”\n\nJust because disposable bodyboards are on their way out doesn’t mean you’ll have to ditch beach fun altogether. In fact, Bill 2976 itself encourages more sustainable alternatives.\n\nInstead of polystyrene boards, the ordinance recommends bodyboards made from higher-density, longer-lasting materials like high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene. These materials are more durable, meaning they don’t break apart as easily, and they have a smaller environmental footprint over their lifespan.\n\nMany experienced riders already prefer these more robust boards because they provide better performance, last for years instead of days, and can even be rented or resold. Local surf shops and rental outlets on Kauaʻi are expected to adjust their inventories to stock these eco-friendlier options before the ban takes effect.\n\nFor tourists, this could also be an opportunity: hotels, vacation rentals, and tour companies may begin offering board rentals or lending durable boards to guests, making it easier to enjoy Kauaʻi’s surf without contributing to pollution.\n\nKauaʻi’s bodyboard ban might seem niche, but it reflects a broader shift in how coastal communities manage tourism and natural resources. As beaches around the world face rising pollution and climate pressures, local governments are increasingly looking for balanced solutions that protect nature while still allowing people to enjoy outdoor recreation.\n\nSo next time you visit, don’t be surprised if that classic foam bodyboard you once knew is gone. But with the right board in hand and a bit more awareness, you’ll be helping protect the waves, wildlife, and wonder that make Kauaʻi’s beaches truly special.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Authorities on Monday had renewed a manhunt for the gunman who killed two students and injured seven more at Brown University over the weekend, after releasing a man who had been held on Sunday as ​a \"person of interest\" in the shooting.\n\nThough officials said late on Sunday they were resuming the search for a suspect, they said there were no ‌credible threats to the community and that they would not reimpose a shelter-in-place order for the campus and the surrounding area that had been lifted earlier.\n\nPolice have released surveillance footage showing the possible shooter ‌dressed in black walking near the building where the attack took place, though his face is not visible.\n\nThe gunman fled after shooting students in a classroom in Brown's Barus & Holley engineering and physics building, where outer doors had been left unlocked while exams were taking place, according to police.\n\nAt a press conference late on Sunday, officials said there had been enough evidence to justify taking into custody the unnamed person of interest, a man in his 20s.\n\nBut Providence Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters the investigation was going in a \"different direction,\" without ⁠offering more detail. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said ‌investigators had determined there was \"no basis to believe that he's a person of interest, so... he's being released.\"\n\nThe mass shooting shook the campus at Brown, one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the United States. The Ivy League school, which has nearly ‍11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, canceled exams and classes for the rest of the year, and the campus was quiet on Sunday as a light snowfall blanketed the city.\n\nThe two students killed were Ella Cook, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, according to statements from various officials.\n\nCook was vice president of the ​school's College Republicans and a \"leading Republican voice at Brown,\" according to an X post from the New York Republicans Club.

    "description": "A woman stumbled upon a 900-year-old treasure of over 2,150 medieval coins. Experts are analyzing the rare find for its historical significance.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA woman walking in the Czech Republic stumbled upon more than 2,150 early medieval silver coins.\n\nOriginally stored in a ceramic pot during a time of political turmoil, the coins have sat in place since the first quarter of the 12th century.\n\nMuseum staff will now analyze and restore the denarii.\n\nA ceramic pot turned into a jackpot for a woman on a walk in the Kutnohorsk Region of the Czech Republic. While out on a stroll, the woman happened upon a roughly 900-year-old stash of more than 2,150 medieval silver coins known as denarii.\n\nWhile the ceramic pot holding the coins was mostly demolished, the coins themselves remain a rich collection. According to a translated statement, they are now being processed by experts from the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, and the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora.\n\nDubbed one of the greatest finds of the last decade, institute archaeologist Filip Velímský believes the discovery is like winning a prize in the lottery—even if someone else was the loser. “It was probably placed in its place during the first quarter of the 12th century, at a time of internal political instability,” he said. “At that time, there were disputes in the country between the members of the Přemysl dynasty about the princely throne of Prague.”\n\nStashing coins in a ceramic container was meant to be a way of keeping them safe. And the container certainly did it’s job, even if the owner was never able to return for them—the coins weren’t recovered for another 900 years.\n\nAccording to the experts, that owner couldn’t have been just anyone.“Unfortunately, for the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, we lack data on the purchasing power of the contemporary coin,” Velímský said. “But it was a huge amount, unimaginable for an ordinary person and at the same time unaffordable. It can be compared to winning a million in the jackpot.”\n\nThe Kutnohorsk Region was known for frequent battles for the Prague princely throne, with the armies of individual rival princes repeatedly marching through the area, according to the institute. The experts claim that a large collection of coins found in such a place could mean that they were originally meant to pay wages for soldiers, or were some sort of “war booty.”\n\nEarly analysis of the haul shows both that the coins were minted in several places throughout the Kutnohorsk Region, and that they were likely created under the rule of three different Přemysl leaders (likely between 1085 and 1107): King Vratislav II and princes Břetislav II and Bořivoje II.\n\n“The coins were most likely minted in the Prague mint from silver that was imported to Bohemia at the time,” Lenka Mazačová, director of the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora, said in a statement. The coins are made from an silver alloy that included copper, lead, and trace amounts of other metals. The experts hope to figure out the exact composition of the coins to help determine the origin of the silver.\n\nWhile we may never know the true intentions—or provenance—of the coin collection, experts still plan to puzzle out as much as possible. Mazačová said that museum staff will now register all the pieces of the collection, clean and restore the coins, and subject them to X-ray imaging and spectral analysis to determine their specific material composition. The goal is to publicly display the collection in 2025, highlighting the 12th century history of the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.\n\nThe officials said talks with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as on Moscow’s demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country’s east.\n\nTrump dialed into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are expected this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated White House event. He added, “We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it ended, also.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine\" supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force's work would include \"operating inside Ukraine\" as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine's forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO's military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.

    "description": "The historic rally has carried over to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where the mining-heavy materials sector has led the index to record-breaking highs.",
    "fullText": "With many gold stocks cruising towards triple-digit gains in 2025, analysts say next year could be another period of blistering returns for companies mining the yellow metal.\n\nThe gold futures contract for February (GC=F) breached US$4,300 per ounce on Friday, a level not seen since October, when bullion hit an all-time high above US$4,350. This historic rally has carried over to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where the mining-heavy materials sector has led the index to record-breaking highs.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets expect gold to average US$4,600 per ounce in 2026, ending the year at approximately US$4,800 per ounce. In 2027, their team, led by the bank’s head of global metals and mining research, sees bullion averaging US$5,100 per ounce.\n\n“Historically, gold producers have behaved pro-cyclically, resulting in sharply higher costs/capital, rising reserve assumptions, and increasing M&A in a rising price environment, which has ultimately eroded investor returns,” Josh Wolfson and his peers wrote in RBC’s latest global precious metals equities outlook.\n\n“Today, producers are operating with a significantly more prudent approach to capital allocation and discretionary spending, and we expect reserves to be calculated at a conservative <US$2,000/oz, less than 50 per cent of current gold prices,” Wolfson added. “Gold producers are experiencing a perfect storm, and are behaving responsibly.”\n\nThat said, RBC describes its outlook on gold stocks as “more conservative than consensus.” The bank expects capital spending to rise, as producers with extra cash look to squeeze returns from existing projects. They also see all-in sustaining costs, a key industry metric, rising by nine per cent in 2026.\n\nAmong the operators, Wolfson and his team say Canadian companies Agnico Eagle (AEM.TO)(AEM), Barrick Mining (ABX.TO)(B), and Kinross Gold (K.TO) have the most downside risk. On the other hand, RBC predicts shares of South Africa-based AngloGold Ashanti (AU) could see “modest upside,” versus its estimates.\n\nExchange-traded fund (ETF) provider Global X says its Gold Producers Index ETF (GLDX.TO) is the top-performing ETF in Canada year-to-date, excluding leveraged funds. The TSX-listed basket of stocks has gained nearly 178 per cent year-to-date. Barrick, AngloGold, and Kinross are its top three holdings.\n\n“Anytime something is up in the triple digits, I would say that probably exceeds expectations,” Chris McHaney, Global X’s head of investment management and strategy, told Yahoo Finance Canada.\n\n“You might see a similar type of return [in 2026]. With the gold price where it is, generally at all-time highs, the gold producers don’t really need the price of gold to continue going up. They just need it to stay relatively where it is, and they’ll be able to make significant cash flows from their operations.”",

    "description": "Warren Buffett's recommended investment strategy would have been profitable 100% of the time throughout history.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett has frequently recommended that non-professional investors periodically buy shares of an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers easy exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world, including Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 1,810% during the last three decades, which is equivalent to 10.3% annually, a pace that would turn $400 per month into $835,000 over three decades.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›\n\nWarren Buffett, who took control of Berkshire Hathaway six decades ago, has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history. He has consistently given the same advice: Buy an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2021. He has suggested the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nHere's how that advice could turn $400 invested monthly into $835,000 over 30 years.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 measures the performance of the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large U.S. companies. It includes value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors, and covers about 80% of domestic equities and 40% of global equities by market value.\n\nThe index fund provides exposure to many of the most influential businesses in the world. The top 10 positions are listed by weight below:\n\nOne risk associated with owning an S&P 500 index fund is the extraordinary concentration of the underlying index. The top 10 companies account for 41% of the S&P 500 by market-cap weight, which means a large decline in two or three of those stocks could really drag on the entire index.\n\nHowever, the top 10 companies also account for approximately 33% of the S&P 500's earnings, so the statistic is not as alarming as many pundits make it out to be. Their price-to-earnings multiples are above average, but their strong competitive positions warrant premium valuations.\n\nThere is a simple reason Warren Buffett believes an S&P 500 index fund is the best way for the average investor to get stock market exposure: Buying individual stocks requires more work than most people are willing to take on, and beating the S&P 500 is challenging even for professional money managers.",

    "description": "\"I'm guessing a lot of you have never seen this.\"",
    "fullText": "Social media users were wowed by a repost of a huge carnivore roaming the frozen wilderness of northern Canada.\n\nThe trail camera footage, initially taken in 2021, was reposted by Yukon Wildlife Cams on Facebook. It shows a hefty, snow-covered grizzly bear treating the viewer to an extreme close-up as it looks right into the camera. The caption offers a little more context about the striking footage:\n\n\"Although I've shared this before, I'm guessing a lot of you have never seen this awesome snow-covered grizzly after a late September snowfall in 2021,\" the post read.\n\nYukon is home to as many as 7,000 grizzly bears. A grizzly bear is a type of brown bear that's smaller and lives further inland than its coastal cousins. Their smaller stature is due to their diets, which rely more on roots, berries, and small prey. They play a key role in the ecosystem as predators and foragers. They keep prey populations under control, and the bear's nutrient-dense scat is key to a healthy forest.\n\nThey are considered \"vulnerable\" in Yukon due to habitat loss and conflict with people. Grizzlies are also threatened by warming global temperatures driven by human activity, disrupting their food supply. For example, the calorie-rich seeds of whitebark pine, which they need to fatten up in the fall, are under threat, according to a study by the University of Colorado.\n\nBecause they only reproduce every three or four years after age eight, any recovery to their numbers will take time.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that the province's conservation plan faces is the difficulty of tracking grizzly numbers. That's where trail cameras can provide an invaluable service.\n\nCameras can make for an unobtrusive and cost-effective method for monitoring threatened wildlife. Additionally, they can play a key part in raising public awareness and support for conservation measures.\n\nAs the comments to the clip showed, viewers were delighted with the footage.\n\n\"Makes my heart race,\" one comment read.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother joked, \"All fattened up for the winter and ready for bed … just like me.\"\n\n\"Wow he really bulked up for his long winter's nap,\" a viewer noted. Though strictly speaking, bears enter torpor status for the winter, a lighter sleep where they will occasionally wake up to forage.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said in a court filing Monday that the president’s White House ballroom construction project must continue for unexplained national security reasons and because a preservationists' organization that wants it stopped has no standing to sue.\n\nThe filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt President Donald Trump's project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and a public comment period and wins approval from Congress.\n\nThe administration's 36-page filing included a declaration from Matthew C. Quinn, deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for the security of the president and other high-ranking officials, that said more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.” The filing did not explain the specific national security concerns; the administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in a private, in-person setting without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe East Wing had sat atop a emergency operations bunker for the president.\n\nQuinn said even a temporary halt to construction would “consequently hamper” the agency's ability to fulfill its statutory obligations and its protective mission.\n\nA hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington.\n\nThe government’s response offered the most comprehensive look yet at the ballroom construction project, including a window into how it was so swiftly approved by the Trump administration bureaucracy and its expanding scope.\n\nThe filings assert that final plans for the ballroom have yet to be finalized despite the continuing demolition and other work to prepare the site for eventual construction. Below-ground work on the site continues, wrote John Stanwich, the National Park Service’s liaison to the White House, and work on the foundations is set to begin in January. Above-ground construction “is not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest,” he wrote.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation did not respond to email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe privately funded group last week asked the U.S. District Court to block Trump's project.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”\n\nTrump had the East Wing torn down in October as part of his plan to build an estimated $300 million, 90,000-square-foot (27,432-square-meter) ballroom able to accommodate about 1,000 people before his term ends in January 2029. He says presidents before him long have wanted an event space larger than the rooms currently at the White House, and says the ballroom would end the practice of entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries in large, temporary pavilions on the south grounds.\n\nThe Trust asserts that the plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action was taken. The lawsuit notes that the Trust wrote to those entities and the National Park Service on Oct. 21, after East Wing demolition began, urging a stop to the project and asking the administration to comply with federal law, but received no response.\n\nThe lawsuit cites several federal statutes and rules detailing the role the planning and fine arts commission and lawmakers play in U.S. government construction projects.\n\nThe administration argued in its response that the president has the authority to modify the White House and included the extensive history of changes and additions to the Executive Mansion since it was built more than 200 years ago. It also asserted that the president is not subject to the statutes cited by the plaintiffs.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys said in the filing that the plaintiff's claims about the East Wing demolition are “moot” because the tear-down cannot be undone. The administration also argues that claims about future construction are “unripe” because the plans are not final.\n\nThe administration also contends that the Trust cannot establish “irreparable harm” because above-ground construction is not expected until spring. It argues that the reviews sought in the lawsuit, consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, “will soon be underway without this Court's involvement.”\n\nTrump's ballroom project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among his political adversaries, but the lawsuit is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop his plans for an addition that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing was torn down.\n\nIn 2000, the National Park Service's Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House first identified the need for a larger event space to address an increase in visitors and to provide a venue suitable for major events, according to the administration's filing.",

    "title": "This Horrific \"Puking\" Virus Is Spreading Across The US As We Speak. Here's What Experts Are Begging You To Know.",
    "description": "Norovirus is the most common cause of vomiting and diarrhea.",
    "fullText": "What is norovirus? “It is our most common cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and actually food-borne illness in the United States,” said Dr. Brintha Vasagar, a family physician in Wisconsin.\n\nThose are the two most common symptoms, but fever, body aches, and stomachaches are sometimes reported, too.\n\nWe typically experience higher rates of norovirus “from November to April, so we’re still pretty early in this season,” Vasagar added.\n\nNorovirus cases are currently elevated, but a little lower than where they were by this time last year, said Dr. Camile Gooden, an internal medicine physician at NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk in New York. However, “Recently, there has been a surge in norovirus ... we’re seeing more positive testing,” Gooden added. This is due to a new strain of the virus.\n\nThe virus spreads easily and in different ways than other winter viruses. Here’s what to know:\n\nWhile common winter illnesses such as the flu and COVID-19 spread through coughs and sneezes, norovirus spreads differently.\n\n“Traditionally, it’s [spread through] what we call the fecal-oral route, so stool to mouth, but it’s a pretty darn resilient virus, so it’s not like you’re licking other people’s poop,” said Dr. Ross Newman, a pediatrician based in Oregon and a medical communicator on social media.\n\nInstead, contaminated particles end up on people’s hands or surfaces they touch — and can sometimes even spread through the air, he explained.\n\nIf someone who has norovirus doesn’t wash their hands well after using the bathroom and then uses a towel to dry their hands, that towel can then become a carrier. Then, if a non-infected person uses that towel to dry their hands, they could pick up the virus.\n\n“It can exist on surfaces for long periods of time ... it can be on blankets, gloves, clothing, hair, skin ... or it can just be from filthy hands,” Newman added.\n\nContaminated surfaces can become a “source of spread,” added Gooden, which is how norovirus commonly rips through places with long-term care settings, day cares and cruise ships — all spaces where people are in close quarters and touching the same door handles, tables, light switches and toys.\n\nNorovirus can also spread through contaminated food, according to Gooden. “If you eat food that has not been washed properly and is contaminated, you could also get ill,” noted Gooden.\n\nThis could be from a sick person preparing the food or even from contaminated raw produce, she said.\n\n“You want to make sure that when you are consuming raw vegetables and raw fruits, that those have been washed appropriately because sometimes, even on farms, there might be exposure through irrigation systems to norovirus,” Gooden said.\n\nYou don’t need any fancy produce soaps, instead washing produce well with water is enough to kill the virus, Gooden said.\n\nNorovirus can also spread through shellfish that becomes contaminated by infected water. In this case, fully cooking shellfish can kill the virus, according to Vasagar.\n\n“The best way to protect yourself is really to perform good hand washing — and you have to use soap and water. You can’t rely on hand sanitizers necessarily, especially if you’ve touched contaminated surfaces or have come in contact with someone who is ill with norovirus,” Gooden said.\n\nA quick hand rinse isn’t good enough; use hot water and soap, and wash your hands for “the full Happy Birthday song, twice,” Vasagar stressed. “Most people don’t wash their hands long enough to really be effective.”\n\nBeyond hand-washing, disinfecting surfaces with bleach-based cleansers and washing linens frequently can kill the virus, Vasagar noted. This is especially important if someone in your home is sick.\n\n“The spread is ... so contagious that you’re really going to have to work hard to make sure everyone else in the family doesn’t get it,” Vasagar said.\n\n“The vomiting associated with norovirus is generally short-lived, 24 to 48 hours, but the diarrhea can last two weeks,” Newman said.\n\nPeople are most contagious the first one or two days after their symptoms start, but they can shed the virus for weeks after that point, Newman added.\n\nIf you get sick, stay home (and keep sick kids home) if you’re able, all three experts told HuffPost. Also watch out for dehydration, which is “the biggest concern with complications from most stomach bugs,” Newman said.\n\n“You’re losing a lot of fluids with vomiting, a lot of fluids with diarrhea,” Vasagar said. Signs of dehydration include decreased urination, dizziness, dry mouth, confusion, and fatigue. If you notice any of these symptoms, get to a doctor.\n\nTo combat dehydration, drink plenty of fluids, whether that’s water, tea, Gatorade or soup, Gooden noted. Even if you’re throwing up, you should still drink small amounts of fluids.\n\n“It’s really important to monitor for any development of severe symptoms,” Gooden said. “If your symptoms continue beyond 72 hours, usually, that’s a time that I would advise to reach out to your health care professional.”\n\nIf you have fevers, severe abdominal pain, or develop blood in your stool, you should seek medical attention, Gooden added.\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.\n\nAlso in Goodful: Homeowners Who Found Incredible Hidden Treasures In Their New Homes Are Sharing Their Finds, And Now I'm Checking Every Inch Of My Walls For Secret Compartments\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"NEVER Disclose This\": Women Are Sharing The \"Urgent\" Safety Tips That Other Women Taught Them, And They're Crucial To Know\n\nAlso in Goodful: I’m Not Saying You Hate Christmas, But If You Can’t Fill In The Blanks To Even 75% Of These Christmas Lyrics… Well, It's Not Looking Good",

    "fullText": "Chris Mooney is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a CNN Climate contributor. He is currently a professor of practice in the Environmental Institute at the University of Virginia.\n\nPlanet-warming pollution rates exploded after the end of World War II. James Watt’s steam engine launched the Industrial Revolution in 1769. Before that, for thousands of years, humans were clearing forested land for farming, releasing carbon from trees and plants into the atmosphere.\n\nThe severity of global warming has long depended on your frame of reference — on what temperature you think was normal for the Earth before humans began changing it. But what year should mark that moment?\n\nThat’s what makes a groundbreaking new temperature dataset released by a group of scientists based in the United Kingdom so striking. The datasets used to diagnose the modern history of the planet’s climate — and to proclaim that the world is now very near to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming — typically begin with the year 1850.\n\nThe new one goes all the way back to 1781.\n\nThis extended time frame matters because greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increased 2.5 percent between 1750 and 1850, enough to have caused some warming that the data hasn’t accounted for.\n\nThe new temperature record, dubbed GloSAT, helps contribute to the growing sense among scientists that the Earth has warmed more than what calculations based on the 1850 starting year would suggest.\n\n“That 1850 start time is one that’s chosen for essentially practical considerations, given the information that’s available,” said Colin Morice, lead author of the new study and a scientist with the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK. “For sure, 1850 is not the start of industrialization.”\n\nThe new dataset, published in Earth System Science Data by 16 scientists, shows a significantly cooler Earth from the late 1700s through 1849 compared with 1850-1900 — the latter being what scientists have defined as the “preindustrial” baseline period used to assess the planet’s temperature change.\n\nHowever, not all of the warming between the two early periods can be attributed to human activities, scientists caution.\n\nAmong other factors, two very powerful volcanic eruptions in the early 1800s had a marked cooling effect on the Earth. Particles from those eruptions spread around the planet’s stratosphere and blocked some sunlight.\n\n“We know 1815 was Tambora, with well documented impacts,” said Ed Hawkins, a researcher with the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and one of the study’s authors. “The 1808 eruption was nearly as big, but we have no idea where it happened.”\n\nSome of the warming that occurred by the late 19th century is a natural recovery from the cooling effect of these eruptions. But perhaps not only.\n\nThe leading climate science authority, the U.N. Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change, concluded in 2021 that there had probably been some human-caused warming between 1750 and 1850, assessing that it was between 0 and 0.2 degrees.\n\nThe scientists behind GloSAT come down right in the middle of that range.\n\nMorice and many of the same researchers contributed to a second study, accepted in the journal Environmental Research Letters, which uses the new dataset and climate models to analyze how much additional warming humans may have caused between 1750 and 1850. That study, led by Andrew Ballinger of the University of Edinburgh, determined that 0.09 degrees of warming occurred that was attributable to humans, as opposed to other factors, such as the waning effect of the large volcanic eruptions seen in the early 1800s.\n\n“This period of time is just so interesting, it’s got this large amount of volcanism in it,” said Andrew Schurer, one of that study’s authors and a researcher at the University of Edinburgh in the UK.\n\nPiers Forster, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds in the UK, landed on a similar number using a very different approach in a study last year. Forster used the very strong and simple relationship between the planet’s temperature and how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere.\n\nIt led him to conclude that the very early rise in carbon dioxide levels would have had a significant effect.\n\n“We think you get between an extra .1 and .2 degrees if you try and look at the total effect of human activity going back a bit further,” Forster said.\n\nNo one was keeping track of global temperature changes 300 years ago. But there were lots of people documenting local temperature change. Combinging their efforts helps modern researchers understand what was happening at a global scale.\n\nThe study of the oldest temperatures recorded by human observers is interwoven with the history of science, exploration and, frequently, the commercial activities that required businesses to collect the data.\n\nEarly modern records go back to the 17th century. Following the path of the scientific revolution generally, measurements began in Europe — and then spread to North America and around the globe. The Central England Temperature series, the longest of its kind, begins in 1659, stitching together the work of many observers. A temperature record in Uppsala, Sweden began in 1722, aided by the work of Anders Celsius, himself.\n\nThese very old temperature records feed into the new GloSAT analysis — and in some locations, they show a very large amount of warming.\n\nConsider a record that has been kept in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps at Hohenpeissenberg since 1781, when Augustinian clerics first began recording temperatures. They were contributing to the Societas Meteorologica Palatina, an early coordinated scientific effort that created a network of weather stations centered in today’s Germany, but extending as far afield as St. Petersburg in Russia.\n\nThis record is lucky to have survived, said Wolfgang Steinbrecht, a scientist with the German Weather Service who works at the observatory.\n\n“During the Napoleonic wars, all the monasteries were disbanded,” Steinbrecht said. “All the measurements were taken by people at monasteries, they were the ones who could read and write. But Hohenpeissenberg survived, now we have measurements more or less without gaps.”\n\nThe Hohenpeissenberg temperature record shows nearly 3 degrees of regional warming when the last 10 years are compared with temperatures between 1781 and 1849.\n\nBut how many local measurements, like this one, do you need before you can begin to deduce the the temperature of the entire planet? And how do you deal with the oceans?\n\nAfter all, measurements at Uppsala, Hoehenpeissenberg and other similar locations track early temperature changes on Earth’s land. But oceans cover about 70% of the planet. Reconstructing temperatures here, too, is a key addition of the GloSAT record.\n\nShips measured temperature in the 18th century, though not as systematically as people did on land. The British East India Company for instance, often took air pressure, temperature and other measurements as they sailed and traded silk, spices and sometimes slaves between Europe and India, China, and other locations in the late 18th century.\n\nThese ships provide a particularly detailed record, although scientists have had to carefully adjust the measurements because of biases — ships heat up dramatically during the day, for instance — and other factors.\n\n“The East India Company made their measurements for competitive advantage,” said Elizabeth Kent, a scientist with the National Oceanography Centre in the UK and one of the study’s authors.\n\n“They wanted to know the prevailing winds so they could do their trading faster, and the temperature of the currents helped them understand if they were catching the currents,” Kent continued. “So, we know that they were seriously trying to measure these things as well as they [could].”\n\nMany whaling vessels also took temperature measurements in the Atlantic ocean off the US coastline, and their records were compiled by Matthew Fountaine Maury, a US naval officer and early oceanographer. Trade routes meant ocean air temperatures were far better measured in the Atlantic and Indian oceans than over the vast Pacific.\n\nThe new dataset relies on all of these sources. It uses a measurement of marine air temperatures – not the temperature of the water itself, as in other datasets – because these were more frequently taken aboard ships in these early years. (This approach actually shows a slightly lower level of warming during the years of overlap with current temprature datasets, the authors note.)\n\nThe scientists fully admit that measurements become much more sparse as one goes back further in time, and indeed, their map of the Earth’s temperatures in the period from 1781-1800 comes with a lot of gaps. For this reason, the researchers ascribe a higher level of uncertainty to their estimates of the Earth’s true temperature during these early years.\n\n“As the authors themselves make clear, there is larger uncertainty prior to 1850. But it is cooler, it’s undoubtedly cooler,” said Peter Thorne, a climate scientist at Maynooth University in Ireland, who served as a reviewer for the new study.\n\nIf that additional bit of warming did occur, though, what might it mean for how we understand the state of the planet today, and how much humans have changed it?\n\nIt might seem daunting or disheartening to contemplate that climate change is an even bigger problem than we thought, or that we’ve done more to cause it than we realized. But it’s not so simple, scientists say.\n\nZeke Hausfather, a researcher with Berkeley Earth who is familiar with the GloSAT work, says he thinks it’s a significant advance. But he cautions about leaping to the conclusion that this realization of some additional early warming undermines climate goals, such as those written into the Paris climate agreement, as those are generally understood to be based on the 1850 to 1900 baseline.\n\n“I think it tells us something about pre-1850 warming,” Hausfather said, “I just don’t think we should read too much into what that implies for our ability to meet climate goals.”\n\nThorne, who reviewed the new study, agrees to a point. But he says the finding of earlier warming isn’t irrelevant — you just need to think carefully about what it means and doesn’t mean.\n\n“It does mean we warmed the Earth more, but it doesn’t mean the impacts are suddenly going to occur sooner,” Thorne said. “They are where they are. And they’ve almost invariably been calculated relative to a much more recent reference period.”\n\nStill, that additional warming can’t be ignored in assessing the total human impact on the Earth. It could even be part of what forced changes in some Earth systems.\n\nUltimately, for Thorne, it’s all part of a picture in which we should be increasingly concerned about the potential for mounting impacts.\n\n“It changes our perception of how far we have already pushed the climate system in important ways,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine has claimed to have blown up a Russian submarine using underwater drones for the first time.\n\nThe submarine, which was carrying Kalibr cruise missiles and is estimated to cost close to £300m, was critically damaged after being hit in the Russian port city of Novorossiysk, according to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Monday.\n\nThe SBU did not specify the date or time of the attack. If verified, this would be the first time an underwater drone has hit a Russian submarine since the invasion began in 2022.\n\nRussia’s Black Sea Fleet said a Ukrainian attempt to attack the Russian naval base failed, according to news agencies.\n\n“Not &NoBreak;a single ‌ship ‍or submarine of the Black Sea Fleet located at ‍the base in Novorossiysk Bay &NoBreak;was damaged,” agencies quoted the Black Sea Fleet as saying on Monday. “There ‍were no injuries to crew.”\n\nVideo footage purportedly of the attack shows multiple Russian warships and a surfaced submarine, before there’s a sudden explosion in the water.\n\nThe clip has not been independently verified, but Reuters confirmed the location as Novorossiysk using the port’s layout and piers.\n\nThe SBU claimed the 636.6 Varshavyanka-class submarine, which “carried four Kalibr cruise missile launchers”, had been left effectively inoperable.\n\nReplacing it, considering international sanctions imposed on Moscow, would cost up to £370m, the SBU said.\n\n“The Security Service of Ukraine carried out another unique special operation and launched a naval attack in the port of Novorossiysk,” the SBU said in a statement.\n\n“For the first time in history, Sub Sea Baby underwater drones blew up a Russian... submarine.”\n\nUkraine’s upgraded “Sub Sea Baby” drones were unveiled in October, according to the statement.\n\nThe drones reportedly operate at distances of more than 1,500km and carry a payload of up to 2,000kg, around double the previous limit.\n\nAccording to Kyiv, they have previously been used to strike the support columns of the Kerch Bridge, which links Crimea with mainland Russia, and three sanctioned oil tankers linked to Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Black Sea.\n\nDmytro Pletenchuk, the Ukrainian navy spokesman, told Reuters the operation to hit a submarine marked “another turning point” in the naval battle between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nAlexander Kamyshin, an advisor to ‍President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, ‌wrote on X that it was the first time in history that an underwater drone had neutralised a submarine. “I’ve been waiting for this day,” he said.\n\nThe Kalibr is one of the most modern and accurate cruise missiles in Russia’s arsenal. They are expensive and there are doubts about how many Moscow has left owing to difficulties procuring Western electronics.\n\nThe Varshavyanka submarine is known as the “Black Hole” because of the hull’s ability to absorb sounds and remain invisible to sonars.\n\nRussia is believed to have just 12 Varshavyanka submarines – six in its Black Sea fleet and six in its Pacific fleet, according to Ivan Stupak, Ukrainian military analyst and former SBU officer.\n\nHe added on social media that Novorossiysk is a heavily guarded port. “This is a real game-changer. As a result, one more Kalibr cruise missile carrier is lost and the potential total missile salvo against Ukrainian territory is slightly reduced,” said Mr Stupak.\n\nUkraine has become a world leader in sea drones and is thought to have carried out at least 13 attacks with them.\n\nKyiv has used them to attack Russian military ships and a naval base in Sevastopol, which forced Moscow to relocate its vessels from the Crimean port to the one in Novorossiysk.\n\nUkraine has stepped up its naval attacks in the Black Sea in recent weeks. Russia regularly strikes the Ukrainian port of Odessa.\n\nDrones have become a crucial part in Kyiv’s fight against Russia, as the devices are cheaper and quicker to produce than traditional weaponry.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Dec 15 (Reuters) - Ford Motor said on Monday it will take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry's retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration's policies and ​weakening EV demand.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will stop making the F-150 Lightning in its electric vehicle form, but will ‌pivot to producing an extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an EREV, which uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping ‌a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.\n\nInstead, Ford said it will pivot hard into gas and hybrid models, and eventually hire thousands of workers, even though there will be some layoffs at a jointly owned Tennessee battery plant in the near term. The company expects its global mix of hybrids, extended-range EVs and pure EVs to reach 50% by 2030, from 17% today.\n\nFord will spread out the writedown, taken primarily in ⁠the fourth quarter and continuing through next year ‌and into 2027, the company said. About $8.5 billion is related to cancelling planned EV models. Around $6 billion is tied to the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and $5 billion on what Ford called “program-related ‍expenses.”\n\nThe automaker also raised its 2025 guidance for adjusted earnings before taxes and interest, to about $7 billion, up from a previous range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion.\n\nFord’s shift reflects the auto industry’s response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook ​for electrics dimmed significantly this year as U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could ‌encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars.\n\nU.S. sales of electric vehicles fell about 40% in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand. The Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations.\n\n“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations.",

    "fullText": "Over 74 million Americans rely on Social Security benefits to pay the bills and enhance their lifestyles in retirement. Factors like when they claim their benefit, the percentage of their income they expect it to replace and numerous other variables determine how much financial security the program will provide. No matter if you have to live off of your Social Security check alone are use it to subsidize your fixed income and other retirement accounts, it’s important to make sure you’re mapping out the best course.\n\nCheck Out: Social Security’s Biggest Lie: Why ‘Full Retirement Age’ Isn’t What You Think\n\nRead Next: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\n\nBank tellers are on the front lines. They stand between retirees and their money — literally — and see the positive outcomes when people get it right firsthand. However, they also see the consequences suffered by those who get it wrong.\n\nGOBankingRates spoke with Izabella Bogumil, a relationship advisor with Addition Financial Credit Union in Lake Mary, Florida. Relationship advisors are Addition Financial’s equivalent of tellers, and Bogumil serves as the bridge between the retirees she serves and the Social Security income she safeguards on their behalf.\n\nIn her experience, these are the four most common and consequential mistakes she sees retirees make with their Social Security benefits. Avoid them to get as much out of the program as possible.\n\nThe full retirement age (FRA), when recipients can collect their entire benefit through monthly payments, is 67 for those born in 1960 or later. Everyone becomes eligible to claim Social Security at 62, but the tradeoff for an early retirement is a smaller check.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) reduces benefits by 5/9 of 1% for every month you claim early up to 36 months. After that, the SSA further reduces your benefit by 5/12 of 1% per month until your check shrinks by up to 30%, an outcome Bogumil sees all too often.\n\n“The most common mistake I see is with seniors who reach age 62 and then immediately claim their benefits,” she said. “This makes them lose a significant amount of their full benefit per month. With everything getting more expensive as time goes on, seniors who are cashing out early are struggling to make ends meet.”\n\nJust as the SSA reduces benefits for those who claim early, they issue credits that increase your payment for delaying retirement and claiming late or delaying benefits. “If possible, I recommend waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security to receive the maximum benefit,” said Bogumil.",

    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Qassim Hamadeh woke to the sounds of gunfire and explosions in his village of Beit Jin in southwestern Syria last month. Within hours, he had lost two sons, a daughter-in-law and his 4-year-old and 10-year-old grandsons. The five were among 13 villagers killed that day by Israeli forces.\n\nIsraeli troops had raided the village — not for the first time — seeking to capture, as they said, members of a militant group planning attacks into Israel. Israel said militants opened fire at the troops, wounding six, and that troops returned fire and brought in air support.\n\nHamadeh, like others in Beit Jin, dismissed Israel’s claims of militants operating in the village. The residents said armed villagers confronted Israeli soldiers they saw as invaders, only to be met with Israeli tank and artillery fire, followed by a drone strike. The government in Damascus called it a “massacre.”\n\nThe raid and similar recent Israeli actions inside Syria have increased tensions, frustrated locals and also scuttled chances — despite U.S. pressure — of any imminent thaw in relations between the two neighbors.\n\nAn Israeli-Syrian rapprochement seemed possible last December, after Sunni Islamist-led rebels overthrew autocratic Syrian President Bashar Assad, a close ally of Iran, Israel’s archenemy.\n\nSyria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the rebels who took over the country, said he has no desire for a conflict with Israel. But Israel was suspicious, mistrusting al-Sharaa because of his militant past and his group’s history of aligning with al-Qaida.\n\nIsraeli forces quickly moved to impose a new reality on the ground. They mobilized into the U.N.-mandated buffer zone in southern Syria next to the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community.\n\nIsraeli forces erected checkpoints and military installations, including on a hilltop that overlooks wide swaths of Syria. They set up landing pads on strategic Mt. Hermon nearby. Israeli reconnaissance drones frequently fly over surrounding Syrian towns, with residents often sighting Israeli tanks and Humvee vehicles patrolling those areas.\n\nIsrael has said its presence is temporary to clear out pro-Assad remnants and militants — to protect Israel from attacks. But it has given no indication its forces would leave anytime soon. Talks between the two countries to reach a security agreement have so far yielded no result.\n\nThe events in neighboring Lebanon, which shares a border with both Israel and Syria, and the two-year war in Gaza between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas have also raised concerns among Syrians that Israel plans a permanent land grab in southern Syria.\n\nIsraeli forces still have a presence in southern Lebanon, over a year since a U.S.-brokered ceasefire halted the latest Israel-Hezbollah war. That war began a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hezbollah firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with its ally Hamas.\n\nIsrael’s operations in Lebanon, which included bombardment across the tiny country and a ground incursion last year, have severely weakened Hezbollah.\n\nToday, Israel still controls five hilltop points in southern Lebanon, launches near-daily airstrikes against alleged Hezbollah targets and flies reconnaissance drones over the country, sometimes also carrying out overnight ground incursions.\n\nIn Gaza, where U.S. President Donald Trump’s 20-point ceasefire deal has brought about a truce between Israel and Hamas, similar buffer zones under Israeli control are planned even after Israel eventually withdraws from the more than half of the territory it still controls.\n\nAt a meeting of regional leaders and international figures earlier this month in Doha, Qatar, al-Sharaa accused Israel of using imagined threats to justify aggressive actions.\n\n“All countries support an Israeli withdrawal\" from Syria to the lines prior to Assad's ouster, he said, adding that it was the only way for both Syria and Israel to \"emerge in a state of safety.”\n\nThe new leadership in Damascus has had a multitude of challenges since ousting Assad.\n\nAl-Sharaa's government has been unable to implement a deal with local Kurdish-led authorities in northeast Syria, and large areas of southern Sweida province are now under a de facto administration led by the Druze religious minority, following sectarian clashes there in mid-July with local Bedouin clans.\n\nSyrian government forces intervened, effectively siding with the Bedouins. Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed, many by government fighters. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights.\n\nIsrael, which has cast itself as a defender of the Druze, though many of them in Syria are critical of its intentions, has also made overtures to Kurds in Syria.\n\n“The Israelis here are pursuing a very dangerous strategy,” said Michael Young, Senior Editor at the Beirut-based Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\nIt contradicts, he added, the positions of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt — and even the United States — which are \"all in agreement that what has to come out of this today is a Syrian state that is unified and fairly strong,” he added.\n\nIsrael and the US at odds over Syria\n\nIn a video released from his office after visiting Israeli troops wounded in Beit Jin, barely 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the edge of the U.N. buffer zone, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel seeks a “demilitarized buffer zone from Damascus to the (U.N.) buffer zone,” including Mt. Hermon.\n\n“It is also possible to reach an agreement with the Syrians, but we will stand by our principles in any case,” Netanyahu said.\n\nHis strategy has proven to be largely unpopular with the international community, including with Washington, which has backed al-Sharaa’s efforts to consolidate his control across Syria.\n\nIsrael’s operations in southern Syria have drawn rare public criticism from Trump, who has taken al-Sharaa, once on Washington's terror list, under his wing.\n\n“It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social after the Beit Jin clashes.\n\nSyria is also expected to be on the agenda when Netanyahu visits the U.S. and meets with Trump later this month.\n\nExperts doubt Israel will withdraw from Syria anytime soon — and the new government in Damascus has little leverage or power against Israel's much stronger military.\n\n“If you set up landing pads, then you are not here for short-term,” Issam al-Reiss, a military adviser with the Syrian research group ETANA, said of Israeli actions.\n\nHamadeh, the laborer from Beit Jin, said he can “no longer bear the situation” after losing five of his family.\n\nIsrael, he said, “strikes wherever it wants, it destroys whatever it wants, and kills whoever it wants, and no one holds it accountable.”",

    "description": "Venezuela's PDVSA was subject to a cyberattack that it blamed on the United States, the state-run oil company said on Monday, adding that its operations were unaffected even though",
    "fullText": "Dec 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela's PDVSA was subject to a cyberattack that it blamed on the United States, the state-run oil company said on Monday, adding that its operations were unaffected even though four sources said systems remained down ​with oil cargo deliveries suspended.\n\nTensions are high between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments, with a large-scale U.S. military buildup in ‌the southern Caribbean, U.S. strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats and comments from U.S. President Donald Trump that land operations may begin soon in Venezuela.\n\nThe Venezuelan government ‌has said the U.S. is seeking regime change to take over the country's vast oil reserves. Last week the U.S. Coast Guard seized a very large crude carrier (VLCC) carrying some 1.85 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy oil sold by PDVSA.\n\nPDVSA and the oil ministry said in statements on Monday that the cyberattack was carried out by \"foreign interests in complicity with domestic entities who are seeking to destroy the country's right to sovereign energy ⁠development.\"\n\nThey alleged the attack was part of U.S. efforts ‌to control Venezuela's oil through \"force and piracy.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPDVSA provided no further details, although the company said it had recovered from the attack. Venezuela's government ‍regularly blames problems like blackouts on conspirators from the opposition and foreign entities like the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, without giving evidence.\n\nSources said the effects were ongoing.\n\n\"There's no delivery (of cargoes), all systems are down,\" one company source said.\n\nOil output, refining and domestic distribution were not affected, the sources said, but ​the company on Monday failed to restart administrative systems, forcing workers to keep written records of operations.\n\nTwo other sources said PDVSA ordered ‌administrative and operational workers to disconnect from the company's systems and to limit access of indirect workers to PDVSA's facilities.\n\nLast week's VLCC seizure was the first interception of a tanker or cargo coming from Venezuela, which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2019, and a sign of growing pressure on President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe seizure has already led to a sharp fall in Venezuelan oil exports, also hitting crisis-stricken Cuba, which is facing daily power cuts.\n\nMore than 11 million barrels of oil are stuck on board other vessels in Venezuelan ⁠waters since last week. Among the few vessels setting sail are the ​ones chartered by U.S. oil firm Chevron, one of PDVSA's key partners, which continue ​departing under an authorization previously granted by Washington, according to shipping data.\n\nA tanker carrying Russian naphtha for PDVSA and at least four supertankers due to pick up crude cargoes in Venezuela have made u-turns, ship monitoring data ‍showed on Monday.\n\nBenin-flagged tanker Boltaris, which ⁠was carrying some 300,000 barrels of Russian naphtha bound for Venezuela, made a u-turn late last week and is now heading for Europe without having discharged, according to LSEG vessel monitoring data.\n\nAt least four VLCCs that were in PDVSA's schedules to ⁠load crude at Venezuelan ports in the coming weeks have also made u-turns in recent days, monitoring service TankerTrackers.com said.\n\nVenezuela's crude output averaged 1.17 million barrels per ‌day last month according to official figures, while oil exports rose to some 952,000 bpd, according to shipping data.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Reuters; editing by Julia Symmes-Cobb, Nathan Crooks and Nia Williams)",

    "description": "Axios reported on three changes over the past week.",
    "fullText": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris is making it clear that she is still keeping her options open on a potential presidential run, Axios reported.\n\nAccording to Axios, three developments over the past week have been viewed by many Democrats as the start of a 2028 campaign, including the recent expansion of her book tour to new cities for “107 Days,” which details her eleventh-hour entrance and defeat to President Donald Trump during the 2024 election.\n\nThe outlet on Sunday also pointed to her appearance before the Democratic National Committee’s annual winter meeting and her sudden change in rhetoric — such as critiquing both political parties and the status quo.\n\n“Both parties have failed to hold the public’s trust,” Harris said during her speech. “Government is viewed as fundamentally unable to meet the needs of its people. In these and in so many other ways, the people feel that the very institutions that were designed to support them have failed them. And they are not wrong.”\n\nHarris has continued to remain toward the top in recent polling related to the 2028 race. Among a pool of Democrats, the former vice president won 31.1% of the vote, standing ahead of California Gov. Gavin Newsom with 20.3% and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg with 10%, a new Big Data Poll found. Newsom has also led in several other polls.\n\nThe reported bid was quickly met with mixed but mainly negative reactions on social media.\n\n“Oh lord, the democrats are gifting Trump a third term,” Jason Calacanis, a co-host of the “All-In Post,” posted on X.\n\nMehdi Hasan, the progressive founder of the media company Zeteo, bluntly wrote: “Insanity.”\n\nInsanity https://t.co/sm5VovGbY1\n\n— Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) December 15, 2025\n\n“There are 1,057 days until the 2028 election. Is that long enough?” asked Byron York, a chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner.\n\nA polling aggregator account responded with a clip from “The Office.”\n\n“Harris/Walz 2028!” another user added.\n\nHarris has yet to directly weigh in on her political future. In an interview released last week by The New York Times, she threw cold water on discussing whether she was ready to run for president again.\n\n“It’s three years from now,” Harris said with emphasis. “I mean, honestly.”\n\nHarris did, however, note that she has been free from what she characterized as the “transactional” result of campaigning, including asking Americans for their vote at the ballot box.\n\n“I understand the focus on ’28 and all that,” Harris said in a wide-ranging interview. “But there will be a marble bust of me in Congress. I am a historic figure like any vice president of the United States ever was.”",

It included parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech, which took place before some of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.\n\nThe BBC spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, accusing it of defamation over editing of his Jan. 6 speech\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit Monday seeking $10 billion in damages from the BBC, accusing the British broadcaster of defamation as well as deceptive and unfair trade practices.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the BBC of broadcasting a “false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump,” calling it “a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence” the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt accused the BBC of “splicing together two entirely separate parts of President Trump’s speech on January 6, 2021” in order to ”intentionally misrepresent the meaning of what President Trump said.”\n\nAbrego Garcia is still hoping to find justice after his wrongful deportation, his lawyer says\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia wasn’t an activist and he didn’t choose to become locked into what has become one of the most contentious immigration issues of the Trump administration, his lawyer told The Associated Press.\n\nBut as he experiences some of the few days he’s had with his family since being sent erroneously to an El Salvador prison in March, his lawyer said he’s still hoping for a just resolution to his case.\n\n“He’s been through a lot, and he’s still fighting,” said his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg during an interview with AP following Abrego Garcia’s court-ordered release from detention last week. “What it is he can fight for is circumscribed by the law and by the great power of the United States government, but he’s still fighting.”\n\nAbrego Garcia’s mistaken deportation to El Salvador helped galvanize opposition to Trump’s immigration policies. He was held in a notoriously brutal prison there despite having no criminal record.\n\n▶ Read more about Abrego Garcia’s case\n\nSen. Mark Kelly’s attorney warns Trump administration of ‘dangerous overreach’\n\nThe attorney’s letter comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of the Democratic senator who was among a group of lawmakers in a video calling on military personnel to defy “illegal orders.”\n\n“There is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power,” wrote Paul J. Fishman in the letter to Navy Secretary John Phelan.\n\nTrump himself had lashed out at the lawmakers, who all have military backgrounds after years of service.\n\nKelly’s attorney warned of legal action if the department sought to pursue the senator in any forum — “criminal, disciplinary, or administrative.”\n\nFishman wrote they would “take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach.”\n\nSecret Service official says ballroom construction doesn’t yet meet agency’s security standards\n\nIn its Monday court filing, the Trump administration included a declaration from the deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service saying more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.”\n\nThe administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in-person without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among Trump’s political adversaries, but the lawsuit by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded group, is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) addition.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to block construction until the project goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification.\n\nTrump administration says White House ballroom construction is a matter of national security\n\nFor that reason, the construction project must continue, the Trump administration said in a court filing Monday.\n\nThe filing came in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt the project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress.\n\nExecutive order directs whole of government mobilization against drug traffickers\n\nThe order instructs the State and Treasury departments to pursue the financial assets of and sanctions on financial institutions and groups involved in fentanyl trafficking. It also calls for greater cooperation between the Pentagon and Justice Department on fentanyl and drug trafficking issues.\n\nThe order directs the homeland security secretary to “identify threat networks related to fentanyl smuggling” by using intelligence resources that in the past were devoted to the detection of other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe federal government by law has a wide range of national security and law enforcement capabilities to combat drug smuggling, including asset forfeiture, targeted arrests and surveillance of criminal organizations.\n\nThe Trump administration’s earlier this year designated some drug cartels as terror groups, a move that may unlock more coordination between the armed forces and domestic law enforcement but has been questioned by legal analysts over its scope and legality.\n\nWisconsin judge allows case against former Trump aides to proceed to trial\n\nA Wisconsin judge has ruled there is enough evidence to proceed to trial in a felony forgery case against an attorney and an aide to President Donald Trump related to action taken after 2020 election.\n\nThe judge on Monday at a preliminary hearing found there was probable cause to proceed with the charges after taking testimony from a special agent with the state Department of Justice who detailed the allegations.\n\nThe charges relate to attempts by the former aides to present a slate of Republican electors to Congress falsely claiming that Trump had won Wisconsin that year.\n\nFormer Trump attorney Jim Troupis and former Trump aide Mike Roman were in court for the hearing but did not testify. The judge postponed the preliminary hearing for a third person charged, Ken Chesebro, amid questions about what comments he made to prosecutors could be admitted in court.\n\nPence’s group urges Trump to fire RFK Jr.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence’s group Advancing American Freedom on Monday called on Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over what the group argues has been a slow-walked safety review of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nKennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary have pledged to review the drug’s safety but are facing mounting pressure from abortion opponents to move more quickly. Mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago, has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.\n\nIn a statement alongside Monday’s memo, the Republican Pence accused Kennedy of being unable or unwilling to keep promises to abortion opponents and said he should step aside.\n\nThe attacks come as Kennedy has faced criticism from both sides but also waves of support as he seeks to dramatically reshape the nation’s health agencies and target vaccines.\n\nTrump again says he’s ended hostilities between Thailand and Cambodia. But fighting continues\n\nThe two countries agreed to a ceasefire in July, and formalized the deal in October when Trump was in Malaysia. But lately, fighting has resumed. Trump on Friday said he had called the leaders and got them to agree to another truce -- but officials said heavy combat continues.\n\nNevertheless, Trump on Monday said in the Oval Office that “we were able to straighten that out.”\n\nThe two countries were “having a little problem yesterday,” Trump said. “I called them and I said, ‘look, fellas, relax. You gotta take it easy.’ They started the war again, and I got it ended.”\n\nTrump says he has asked Xi to free Jimmy Lai\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he feels “so badly” about Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong media mogul who on Monday was convicted in a landmark national security case.\n\nLai, 78, now could spend the rest of his life in prison. On Monday, Trump confirmed that he has brought up Lai’s case with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and asked for Lai’s release.\n\n“I spoke to President XI about it, and I asked to consider his release,” Trump said. “He’s not well, he’s an older man, and he’s not well, so I did put that request out. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nIn London and Washington, Jimmy Lai’s children have expressed gratitude for the support from the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump praises José Antonio Kast’s win in Chilean presidential election\n\nTrump touted the win by Kast, a far right conversative who comfortably defeated his left-of-center opponent in Sunday’s election, as a sign of his broader influence on politics across the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I look forward to pay my respects to him here,” Trump said of Kast. “He’s a very good person.”\n\nKast is the most conservative candidate to win Chile’s presidential election in 35 years. He won 58.2% of the votes on a campaign heavily centered on crime and immigration.\n\nTrump defends Syria’s new leader after attack that killed three Americans\n\nTrump said Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa “feels very badly” about an attack over the weekend that claimed the lives of two Iowa National Guard members and a U.S. civilian.\n\nTrump said the attack happened in a region of Syria that the new government doesn’t control.\n\n“This had nothing to do with him,” said Trump, speaking of al-Sharaa. He hosted al-Sharaa at the White House in November.\n\n“He feels very badly about it. He’s working on it. He’s a strong man, and this had nothing to do with the Syrian government,” Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. military and Trump have blamed the attack on the Islamic State group. Trump has threatened to retaliate.\n\nTrump defends FBI and calls Brown shooting a ‘school problem’\n\nTrump defended the FBI after a mass shooting at Brown University, arguing that questions about the case should be directed to officials at the Ivy League school in Rhode Island.\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that authorities do not yet know a motive in the shooting that killed two and injured others.\n\nPressed about why the FBI has not been able to identify a shooter, Trump called it a “school problem.” Brown “had their own guards, they had their own police and their own everything,” he said.\n\nTrump told reporters to “ask that question, really, to the school, not to the FBI,” which he said “came in after the fact.”\n\nHe said the FBI “will do a good job,” and cited the Charlie Kirk assassination as an example. In that case, the alleged killer’s family helped turn him in to authorities.\n\nTrump says the administration is considering changing how it treats marijuana\n\n“We are considering the idea because a lot of people want to see it,” the president said.\n\nTrump had said in August that he was reviewing whether the federal government should reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. Such a step could move the federal government closer to an approach already embraced by many states.\n\n“We are looking at that very strongly,” Trump said at the White House.\n\nTrump doubles down on criticizing Reiner and calls him ‘deranged’\n\nThe president was asked if he stood by his social media post in light of the pushback he was getting, including from those in his own party.\n\nUsing the third person, Trump said Reiner “was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned.”\n\n“I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way shape or form,” Trump said. “I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\nTrump signs executive order classifying fentanyl as a ‘weapon of mass destruction’\n\nHe signed the order in the Oval Office on Monday while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine, White House border czar Tom Homan and other top military officials.\n\nTrump says his administration is “formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is. No bomb does what this is doing.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the new designation would affect administration policy or what the legal implications would be for those impacted by fentanyl use or drug traffickers.\n\nThe term weapon of mass destruction has typically referred to nuclear, biological, chemical or kinetic threats capable of causing overwhelming and lasting damage to a population, infrastructure or environment. The term has also been hotly debated in American politics since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nTrump is recognizing 13 military service members with a Mexican Border Defense Medal\n\nThe president is in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump border czar Tom Homan, all of them hailing the border defense portion of his immigration crackdown.\n\nMilitary commanders and the award recipients looked on as Trump, Hegseth and Homan declared the border secure. Trump said his administration has “stopped the invasion in its tracks, and we are dismantling the cartels very rapidly.”\n\nHe added many hits from his 2024 campaign speech, blasting the immigration policies of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and declaring migrants who crossed the border “some of the worst people on Earth.”\n\nHoman praised “greatest president of my lifetime – yes, I said it.” Hegseth said the medal is a reprisal of a military honor awarded previously in the early 20th century\n\nTrump expresses optimism that Russia-Ukraine war is nearing the end\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump said while recapping war talks in Europe at the start of an unrelated White House event.\n\nTrump said he had a “long talk” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also spoke with the leaders of several European countries, including Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom as well as NATO.\n\n“Things are going along pretty well,” the president said.\n\nTrump said everyone wants to see the war end.\n\nPresident Trump to deliver remarks in North Carolina on Friday\n\nThe president’s upcoming trip to Rocky Mount was confirmed by Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley, a close Trump ally who was chair of the Republican National Committee during the 2024 election.\n\n“Let’s give him the North Carolina welcome he deserves,” Whatley wrote on social media. Whatley did not describe a reason for the trip in his social media post.\n\nThe event will take place at the Rocky Mount Events Center. Trump last week traveled to Pennsylvania to discuss the economy and cost of living.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson urges an appeal to ‘our better angels’ after weekend violence\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of tragedies,” the GOP speaker said as he arrived at the Capitol.\n\nHe drew on scripture to provide comfort to the Reiner family and others after “the senseless violence” this past weekend in Australia and at Brown University.\n\n“We have to appeal to our better angels,” Johnson said, and “I think we have to amplify those voices.”He declined to answer questions about Trump’s insensitive remarks after Reiner’s death.\n\nUS, Paraguay sign agreement setting out legal basis for American troops in the country\n\nThe United States and Paraguay have signed an agreement laying out the legal framework for American troops to be stationed the in the South American country and clearing the way for further defense and intelligence cooperation between the two as the Trump administration steps up military operations throughout the western hemisphere.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Ramirez signed the so-called “status of forces” agreement on Monday at the State Department. Both men hailed the deal as a step forward in relations that would enhance already strong counter-terrorism and -narcotics measures.\n\nSuch agreements outline the legal requirements and immunities for U.S. troops to be present in other countries, although there was no immediate announcement of any deployments to Paraguay.\n\nCalifornia hires two former CDC officials who rebuffed Trump, Kennedy\n\nCalifornia is hiring two former top federal health officials, state officials said Monday.\n\nSusan Monarez, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is helping California launch an effort to maintain trust in science-driven decision-making and improve public health infrastructure.\n\nMonarez is being joined by Dr. Debra Houry, CDC’s former chief medical officer. Both will be advisors, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.\n\nThe White House fired Monarez in August when she fell out of favor with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after only one month on the job. Houry and some other top CDC officials resigned in protest.\n\nA few Republicans speak out against Trump post on Reiner\n\nA few Republican members of Congress are calling out President Donald Trump’s insensitive social media post regarding the deaths of director-actor Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted ox X that regardless of how one felt about Reiner, “this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”\n\nRep. Mike Lawler of New York said of Trump’s post: “This statement is wrong. Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.”\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia tweeted: “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies. Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nNY Attorney General Letitia James makes first comments on the repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her\n\nJames said Monday she isn’t spending a lot of time thinking about the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her.\n\nJames, a Democrat, made her first public comments about the matter at an unrelated press conference after the news last week that a second federal grand jury had declined to indict her on charges related to her purchase of a home in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.\n\n“I don’t really spend a lot of time focused on this campaign of retribution,” said James. “I’ve got a lot of work on my hands — standing up and defending the rights of New Yorkers, protecting them from harms coming from Washington, D.C.”\n\nA judge last month threw out an indictment charging James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case at Republican President Donald Trump’s urging was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.\n\n“I’ve got a job to do,” said James, who had pleaded not guilty to the earlier indictment and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nPoll shows health costs are a rising concern among Americans\n\nAbout 3 in 10 Americans cite the cost of health care as the most urgent health problem facing the country, and about one-quarter say the health care system is in “crisis,” according to a new Gallup poll released Monday.\n\nThe poll also shows that only 16% of Americans are satisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S.\n\nThe findings from the survey conducted in November come as Congress has yet to address the spiking health insurance premium costs facing millions of Americans when Affordable Care Act health subsidies expire at the start of the new year.\n\nIt also comes as health expenses have risen across the board in response to a variety of factors, including inflation and the increasing use of expensive medications such as GLP-1 weight loss drugs.\n\nHunter Biden disbarred in Connecticut after complaints about federal convictions\n\nBiden agreed to the penalty and admitted to violating the state’s attorney conduct rules, but he did not admit to committing any crimes.\n\nHis father, former President Joe Biden, pardoned him last year after he was convicted of three felonies relating to a 2018 gun purchase and pleaded guilty to failing to pay federal taxes. He previously was disbarred in Washington, D.C.\n\nA Connecticut judge ordered the disbarment on Monday. Hunter Biden did not speak and he and his lawyer appeared via video at the virtual court hearing in Waterbury.\n\nThe judge found that Hunter Biden violated several lawyer ethics rules, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”\n\nIn a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment. He was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.\n\nWhite House views Russian openness to Ukraine joining the EU as a big deal\n\nThe U.S. officials who briefed reporters after Witkoff and Kushner met with Zelenskyy and other European officials in Berlin over the last two days said such an offer over Ukraine joining the EU would be a major concession by Moscow. But Russia has previously said it doesn’t object to Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "fullText": "New analysis suggests Bitcoin’s four-year cycles have been replaced — and the world’s biggest cryptocurrency could rebound to $140,000 at some point in the next 180 days.\n\nAccording to Copper, the arrival of exchange-traded funds tracking BTC’s spot price have changed this digital asset’s behavior, and given way to what it calls the “cost-basis returns cycle.”\n\n“Across 2024/2025, Bitcoin has exhibited the same repeatable pattern: price breaks to new all-time highs, corrects sharply, and then finds support almost perfectly at its ETF investor cost basis before beginning the next expansion.”\n\nThe company’s analysis suggests we have seen this play out three times since these ETFs launched back in January 2024 — with each cycle delivering returns of more than 60%.\n\nCopper also claims this has exposed a significant divide between crypto-focused traders and institutional investors, with some Bitcoin commentators claiming it is “the worst bull market ever.”\n\nSo… what exactly causes these sharp corrections once BTC enters price discovery mode? Well, its analysis suggests that institutions rebalancing their portfolios is primarily to blame — an activity that “transforms Bitcoin’s volatility into realized returns.”\n\n“Institutions are not ‘staking sats’ — in fact, most do not care about sats at all now that Bitcoin is accessible through equities-style ETF shares. They care about risk-adjusted contribution to a portfolio.”\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s been recommended that institutions allocate somewhere between 2% and 5% into Bitcoin — but a sudden surge in price can have a huge impact.\n\n“Without rebalancing, a modest 2% Bitcoin allocation drifts to 6.2% in less than 180 days during these cycles. A 5% allocation drifts dangerously close to double-digit.”\n\nCopper’s head of research Fadi Aboualfa told Cryptonews that Bitcoin is now at a critical juncture.\n\n“With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days. If cost basis rises 10% to 15% as in prior cycles, the resulting premium seen at past peaks produces a target range of $138,000 to $148,000.”\n\nThe prospect of a return to all-time highs within the next six months would provide a much-needed dose of “hopium” for traders. However, other analysts have warned there are few catalysts that can drive BTC forwards at the moment. The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25 percentage point interest rate reduction was largely priced in, with policymakers suggesting there may only be one cut in 2026.\n\nA big test will concern what happens if Bitcoin’s value falls below its cost basis for ETF investors — and whether sell-offs would intensify if institutions spent a prolonged period in the red.",

    "description": "\"Their worst fear had come true.\"",
    "fullText": "A troubling wildlife encounter in a Florida neighborhood is renewing conversations about rising human-animal conflict and the pressures pushing wild species into closer contact with communities.\n\nOfficials in Brevard County recently captured a large American crocodile after residents witnessed it swimming through a canal with a dog in its mouth — a moment one neighbor described as \"just heartbreaking,\" per WFOR.\n\nAccording to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the crocodile was first spotted Nov. 16 in a residential canal in South Patrick Shores, just north of Satellite Beach. Local resident Zack Spurlock told WESH that he rushed over after receiving a message from a friend who saw the reptile while on a walk with a baby stroller.\n\n\"Ten feet away is this 11-foot crocodile swimming with a golden retriever-type breed in its mouth,\" he said. \"I'm a dog owner. … My heart went out to them that their worst fear had come true.\"\n\nFWC officers responded, eventually capturing the crocodile — the only confirmed American crocodile seen in that area since 2018, per WFOR. After evaluating the situation, officials placed the animal into permanent captivity to protect both the community and the crocodile.\n\nWhile encounters between people and wildlife have always occurred, experts said they're becoming more frequent in areas experiencing rapid population growth, shrinking habitats, and shifting ecosystems linked to increasing global temperatures.\n\nAs natural spaces become more fragmented or stressed, animals may travel farther in search of food or cooler refuges — heightening the risk of dangerous run-ins for both humans and pets.\n\nProtecting and restoring habitats, improving water quality, and supporting biodiversity can reduce these conflicts and keep communities safer. Several conservation wins help prevent events like this, including efforts to restore coastal wetlands and wildlife corridors and community projects that create safer spaces for threatened species.\n\nFWC advises residents to keep pets leashed near water, avoid swimming outside designated areas, and maintain distance from crocodiles and alligators. Feeding wild reptiles is illegal and can make them more likely to approach humans.\n\nLong-term solutions rely on strengthening conservation policies, protecting wetlands, and supporting local wildlife organizations working to preserve healthy habitats. Everyday choices like reducing waste, supporting ecosystem-restoring nonprofits, and being alert in wildlife corridors help create safer boundaries between people and wildlife.\n\nFor urgent concerns, Florida residents can contact FWC's Nuisance Alligator Hotline at 866-392-4286.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Joe Rogan is raising some big questions about where tax money really goes. In an episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” he took aim at what he sees as government waste and called out the idea that simply taxing the rich will fix everything.\n\n“Figure out what to do with the money they already get from everybody,” Rogan said in the May episode with fellow comedian Jimmy Carr. “And you're not doing a good job with it. That's the problem. The problem isn't that the rich people aren't paying their taxes.”\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n\nRogan questioned whether increased taxes on wealthy individuals would actually help struggling Americans. “Are the poor people going to get that money? No. Are their services going to improve? No, you're just going to get more government,” he said.\n\nCarr, who once faced public backlash over a tax scandal in the UK, added humor to the topic, saying, “It was tax avoidance, not tax evasion. There’s a difference, and the difference is about 18 months in prison.”\n\nRogan pushed back on the idea that simply collecting more from the wealthy would improve anything for regular people. “What are you going to do? You’re going to enrich [the government],” he said. “They’re just going to get bigger and stronger and have even more power… It’s not going to help you if they tax rich people.”\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nCarr pointed to countries like Norway and Denmark, where high taxes result in actual public services that people seem to appreciate. Rogan responded that those systems work because those societies are small and manageable. “When you scale that to like hundreds of millions of people, things get really weird,” he said.\n\nRogan often voices his opinions about the role of money in today’s society. In a recent conversation on his podcast with comedian Ian Edwards, he warned that when money becomes the only goal, rich people lose their connection to others. “They don't give a f**k about you. They're just trying to make more numbers,” Rogan said about ultra-wealthy individuals focused solely on profit.\n\nHe also slammed how the pandemic pushed massive wealth into corporate hands while small businesses were left behind. “You can only go to Target during a pandemic… You can't go [to a small business], it's a pandemic,” he said. That shift, he argued, legally funneled money away from local economies.\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nBuffett's Secret to Wealth?

    "title": "'Being Charlie': Nick Reiner wrote a movie about being in rehab. His famous dad Rob Reiner made it into a movie.",
    "description": "\"He's the heart and soul of the film,\" Rob Reiner said about his son, Nick Reiner, who wrote the movie \"Being Charlie.\"",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: Business Insider published an interview with Rob Reiner and his son Nick Reiner in May 2016 about their movie, \"Being Charlie,\" which Nick wrote and is based on his experiences with drug addiction. On December 15, 2025, Nick Reiner was arrested on a murder charge in connection with the deaths of his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner. Below is the 2016 article.\n\nFor the last 30 years, Rob Reiner has been best known for directing movies like “Stand by Me,” “The Princess Bride,” “When Harry Met Sally,” and “A Few Good Men.” The titles have brought joy to millions.\n\nBut the Reiner household hasn't been all happy. The legendary actor/filmmaker’s son, Nick, 22, has been battling drug abuse since his late teens.\n\nMost families would want to keep that part of their lives as hidden from public view as possible. But Reiner admits that, even at the darkest moments of his son’s addiction, he thought of making a movie. Yet it was too painful to put pen to page and begin a script.\n\nInterestingly enough, his son came to the same realization as a means to rehabilitate.\n\nWhile at a rehab center in Los Angeles four years ago, Nick befriended fellow addict Matt Elisofon. The two began writing about their challenges with addiction and the people they met at rehab. Eventually they came up with a script for the movie “Being Charlie” (in theaters Friday), which they asked Rob to direct.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last September to a sold-out crowd.\n\nIt’s a mix of drama and comedy that focuses on an 18-year-old named Charlie (played Nick Robinson of “Jurassic World” fame) as he struggles with addiction to heroin and cocaine. As Charlie jumps in and out of rehab, the aggravation of his actor-turned-politician father (Cary Elwes) grows, and he doesn’t know how to help his son.\n\n“It was a real corrective emotional experience,” Nick Reiner told Business Insider following the TIFF screening about making the movie.\n\nIt took “Being Charlie” four years to get to the screen (in that time Nick has been sober), evolving from a half-hour comedy, then an hour dramedy that was rejected by the TV networks, to finally a feature film.\n\nAccording to Rob Reiner, what the project lacked in its early development was telling both the father's and son's sides.\n\n“It needed what he has been through but also what we had been through,” Rob told Business Insider, referring to himself and his wife, Michele, who was sitting beside him.\n\nNick and Elisofon were by Rob’s side throughout filming. According to Rob, the script was tweaked daily to make the scenes more true to life.\n\n“I relied on him,” Rob said of his son. “He’s the heart and soul of the film.”\n\nOne of the biggest adjustments came while shooting the film’s ending, in which Charlie and his father finally have a heart-to-heart.\n\nRob and Nick couldn’t find the right tone. After constant rewrites, they finally felt they had something a few days before shooting the scene. It’s a gripping moment when both the father and son open up to each other like they never have before.\n\nThe Reiners compare getting the ending right to the whole experience making the film.\n\n\"We were healing as we were going along,\" Nick said. \"And it all doesn’t happen overnight. Certain things we hadn’t dealt with for a while but we were able to through this movie. It didn’t fix everything, but it really tapped into — \"\n\nNick paused to find the words, then his father, sitting across from Nick, finished for him.\n\n\"It forced me to really have to understand what he had been going through for a long time,\" Rob said.",

    "fullText": "Despite traveling fairly frequently, I'd never been away from home for Christmas until recently\n\nIn 2023 (into 2024), I spent Christmas and New Year's Eve on a 22-day Holland America cruise around South America and Antarctica.\n\nI traveled with my grandma and cousin, and our cruise began in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and ended in Santiago, Chile.\n\nI felt hesitant about booking a cruise that took place over the holidays, but I figured it'd be worth missing my traditions for one year to wake up to a view of Antarctica on Christmas morning.\n\nThough Holland America had fantastic decorations, unbeatable views, and fun holiday-themed events, I felt homesick.\n\nIt was so hot in many of the ports that we stopped at, like Buenos Aires and Puerto Madryn, Argentina, because it was summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIt felt extra strange because I was traveling from Chicago, where we always have a chilly Christmas.\n\nDue to the warm weather, it was easy to forget that Christmas was just around the corner — and it felt odd, but delightful, to see decorated cities.\n\nOne of my favorite stops was in Puerto Aysén, Chile, where the town's main square was filled with lights and decorations depicting Santa and reindeer.\n\nOne of the most striking features on board was the ship's gingerbread village. The elaborate setup was just one of the beautiful decorative areas on the ship.\n\nSeveral Christmas trees were also displayed throughout the boat.\n\nIt wasn't just the Holland America crew that decorated — other guests brought tinsel, ornaments, and small decorations to hang from their room's doors and mailboxes. It added to the ship's festive spirit.\n\nThere were plenty of holiday-themed activities to take part in on the ship, too, like decorating gingerbread ornaments and creating origami Christmas trees.\n\nWe used these to decorate our room, and ended up placing the presents we'd brought near a small origami tree. Having our room slightly decorated helped us feel less homesick and more excited for the holidays.\n\nIt was also nice that, after breakfast on Christmas Day, the captain announced that there was an unidentified object flying over our ship.\n\nMinutes later, it was identified as Santa, who would be stopping by to bring presents to the children on board. Santa and some elves then appeared on the ship's main stage, handing out small gifts to kids and hot chocolate to adults.\n\nAs the clock ticked down to midnight on New Year's Eve, there was a bustling party on the Oosterdam's lido deck.\n\nIt featured the house band playing hits from several decades and complimentary flutes of sparkling wine.\n\nThe party took over the pool area, so there was no swimming, but the hot tubs were still in full use as ice-packed coolers for bottles of bubbly.\n\nBeing away from home during the holidays was tough, but getting my first view of Antarctica on Christmas morning was an unforgettable gift.\n\nThat morning, we were greeted with a close-up view of Elephant Island, one of the furthest reaches of Antarctica's South Shetland Islands.\n\nIt was a dream come true being there, but when it comes to the holidays, my heart will always be at home.\n\nThis story was originally published on January 16, 2024, and most recently updated on December 15, 2025.",

    "fullText": "South Korean shipyards are steadily becoming an integral part of US Navy maintenance work. Following in the footsteps of some of the nation's shipbuilding giants, another local shipbuilder just secured a new contract.\n\nHJ Shipbuilding and Construction announced on Monday that it won a deal to service a US Navy vessel — the Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo ship USNS Amelia Earhart — as Washington increasingly turns to South Korea's impressive commercial shipbuilding sector to support strained American yards and keep the fleet afloat.\n\nThe maintenance contract is with the Navy's Naval Supply System Command and Military Sealift Command.\n\nThe work on the Amelia Earhart — which will include an inspection of the ship's hull and systems, follow-up repairs and replacements, and a paint job — will begin in January 2026 at the Yeongdo Shipyard in Busan. The vessel will be delivered to the Navy by the end of March.\n\nThe Amelia Earhart is one of the Navy's supply ships that refuels and resupplies aircraft carriers and warships at sea. Its overhaul adds to a growing list of US Navy work going to South Korean companies.\n\nMajor South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean finished repairs on the USNS Wally Schirra, another Lewis and Clark-class vessel, in March, marking a first for a South Korean shipyard. And then HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, one of the country's largest shipbuilders, received a maintenance contract for another ship in the class, the USNS Alan Shepard.\n\nHJ Shipbuilding and Construction said it's the first midsize shipbuilder in South Korea to win a maintenance contract with the US Navy.\n\nWhile smaller voyage repairs to US Navy ships occur regularly at allied yards, the continued contract wins for South Korean shipyards highlight the growing shipbuilding collaboration between Washington and Seoul.\n\nThat partnership, which has included business deals for South Korean companies abroad as well as investments in American yards, is part of a broader willingness by the Trump administration to rely on its Pacific ally amid efforts to fix US shipbuilding issues.\n\nBillions of dollars are being put into modernizing US shipyards and addressing workforce and training issues as South Korea's government calls its investments a plan to \"Make American Shipbuilding Great Again.\" The US is also turning to Japan, another large shipbuilder, for assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan are the second and third largest shipbuilders in the world, respectively, and Navy leadership is increasingly recognizing their value in this sector. China, however, dominates the shipbuilding industry, relying heavily on its dual-use yards, workforce, and equipment to make military and commercial vessels at a rapid pace.",

    "description": "Skip the one-day shipping. A small-business expert shares how shoppers can help small brands grow through slower spending and thoughtful purchases.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with KK Hart, a 40-year-old multi-entrepreneur and business acquisition expert based in Dallas. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor the past 20 years of my career, I've supported small businesses. First as a consultant and then, through an unexpected journey, in business acquisition. As a non-institutional investor — which means I use my own money to invest and am not part of a fund or organization — I've purchased and led 10 small businesses, from brick-and-mortar fitness studios to skincare brands such as Ghost Democracy, my most recent acquisition.\n\nAs someone who has seen the inner workings of many businesses, I can say there's a mismatch between what consumers think small businesses need during this time of year and what they actually want. My passion is helping consumers understand how they can improve a small brand's profit margin and long-term viability during the holiday season and beyond.\n\nHere are three high-impact shopping strategies to try.\n\nShoppers have been trained to value speed and low cost, but small brands generally can't match that. When you look for the free or one-day shipping, you're asking a small business to compete on money — often at a loss, especially when you consider that logistics costs went up this year for small businesses.\n\nInstead, I like to encourage people to think of intentionality as the new convenience and prioritize slower shopping. I like to start planning what I might buy for the holiday season at the beginning of the year, so that I can shop more slowly in Q3 and Q4.\n\nWhen consumers slow down their purchasing and think more carefully about what they're buying, it leads to less friction and fewer returns, which are a massive cost for retailers. If you go slower, you have a week or two to ask the brand questions, like about their formulation or how they stack up to a competitive brand, and ensure you're making the best purchase for you. People are always surprised to find that small businesses actually respond honestly.\n\nIf you've missed a shipping deadline for a small business this year, go for gift cards. Gift cards are 100% cash flow for a small business, minimize returns, and allow your gift recipient to choose what they actually want.\n\nThe heart of this season is about giving and joy. I can tell you that business owners would like to have a lot of joy year-round — not just during the holiday season.\n\nYes, that can mean buying throughout the year and being a repeat customer to the brands you love. The post-holiday rush in January is a cash flow desert for many businesses.\n\nSupport can also look like leaving a review. While there's a lot of emphasis on the dollar amount going to small businesses, feedback can matter just as much. Your purchase in December and your review shortly thereafter could fuel purchases in July and August when things aren't as exciting. That creates more than money in the moment — it gives us a marketing asset all year long.\n\nFinally, think beyond the items you want to own and focus on how you can make an impact. When you consider what you really want from a product and purchase, you think differently than what's the lowest cost and the most convenient.\n\nAnytime I spend money, even as a consumer, I like to think about who I'm investing in. It's impactful to put your money into a small business, where it goes directly into a family's pocket and could impact their business for generations to come. When you invest in a brand in this way, you give them more than just your immediate gratification.\n\nAdditionally, it's also good to purchase items on first-party platforms, or a business's direct website, which places the marketplace commission back into the owner's hands. This is often overlooked, but a truly tangible way to make an impact.\n\nEssentially, you want to go from being a customer to thinking like a capital owner. That was my journey — realizing that the real impact is not in what you buy, but what you can help create with the money you spend.",

    "title": "Netflix's bid to buy Warner Bros. hinges on a key question: Who does it actually compete with?",
    "description": "Netflix and Warner Bros. have a deal, but regulators must approve the move. The question of how to define Netflix's market is a major consideration.",
    "fullText": "Would buying Warner Bros. give Netflix too much power?\n\nThe streaming giant is telling regulators it won't, and antitrust experts say the answer ultimately depends on how you define who Netflix competes with.\n\nDoes Netflix compete with only paid streaming services, a market where it dominates? What about the TV dinosaurs it disrupted, or the social video services nipping at its heels? Could sleep even be a competitor, as its cofounder Reed Hastings famously suggested?\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance has slammed the Netflix-Warner Bros. mega-deal as anticompetitive, arguing that it would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription video streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the Warner Bros. library (stocked with fare like Harry Potter and DC Comics).\n\nNetflix, for its part, is advocating for a definition that considers total US TV viewing time. The streamer, which has expressed confidence in its regulatory case, pointed to this in a letter to its employees on Monday.\n\n\"Even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US — still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%),\" Netflix's co-CEOs wrote on Monday, citing Nielsen data. A Netflix spokesperson referred to those remarks when asked for comment.\n\nConvincing antitrust regulators of that could be an uphill battle.\n\n\"Antitrust regulators are likely to define the relevant market narrowly,\" said Anthony Palomba, a business professor at the University of Virginia. \"The FTC and DOJ have consistently treated streaming as a discrete competitive arena, separate from linear television, theatrical distribution, or social video platforms.\"\n\nThe president has said the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem.\"\n\n\"They have a very big market share, and when they have Warner Brothers, you know, that share goes up a lot,\" he said of Netflix.\n\nReuben Miller, the head of antitrust at financial data service Dealreporter, said Netflix's bid would \"be challenged and litigated unless Netflix can convince Trump to come down on their side.\"\n\nHere's how regulators could determine Netflix's competitive market and, by extension, the future of the media business.\n\nA Netflix-Warner Bros. combination would be a colossus. Netflix and HBO Max have accounted for 39% of US paid subscription streaming revenue in 2025, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAny firm with 30% to 40% market share has historically drawn scrutiny from the US government. If regulators see paid streamers as a distinct market, Netflix's Warner Bros. deal could be in trouble.\n\nConsumers may not view social media apps — even when they are watched on a TV screen — as close substitutes for Netflix, Disney+, or Hulu, Palomba said. If so, a Netflix-HBO Max combination could limit choice or lead to price hikes.\n\nThere are few recent parallels to Netflix's Warner Bros. acquisition, Dealreporter's Miller said. One could be Charter Communications, which was allowed to expand its cable operation in 2016, though streamers were in their early days then. Miller said it felt like the government was protecting the nascent streaming industry. However, consumer behavior has changed so dramatically since then that he's unsure if those market definitions would be applicable.\n\n\"The incentive is to start with the assumption that a merger is illegal,\" Miller added. \"They're going to start with as narrow a definition as possible, so they'll probably start with paid streaming. And then the onus is on Netflix to try and get them to expand that market definition.\"\n\nAlthough Netflix is easily the most viewed paid streamer in the US, it's not the top streamer on TV screens.\n\nThat would be free YouTube, whose viewership share has soared relative to Netflix in recent years. At the end of 2022, Netflix and YouTube each commanded 7.5% of viewership on US TVs. But as of October, YouTube had a 12.9% share while Netflix took second place at 8%, according to Nielsen.\n\nAlong with its paid peers, Netflix is also battling free streamers like The Roku Channel and Fox's Tubi that are popular among Gen Z.\n\nWhen adding free streamers into the marketplace, Netflix and HBO Max together accounted for just over a fifth of US streaming minutes in October, MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote on Monday. While 20% share is powerhouse status, it might not be a dealbreaker from an antitrust perspective.\n\nNetflix has argued that it's competing against all of traditional TV, not just streamers.\n\nIts viewership share ranks sixth among TV media distributors, versus its second-place spot in streaming. When measured against cable and broadcast TV, Netflix's 8% share in October was slightly behind the 8.2% share for Paramount, which includes its cable channels and CBS.\n\nAnd since Netflix isn't trying to buy WBD's cable networks like CNN, it could argue that it's only adding a fraction of the media conglomerate's viewership time.\n\nNetflix would undoubtedly love a broad definition of its competitive market that includes TikTok, Instagram, and even video podcasts and video games, which are also spaces where the streamer competes.\n\nSome media insiders see an ultra-broad competitive landscape as a bridge too far.\n\n\"My clients are not pitching shows to YouTube,\" a TV agent said.\n\nCorey Martin of LA-based law firm Granderson Des Rochers said that \"to compare Netflix to YouTube, or even TikTok, is like comparing apples and oranges.\" He said the same applied to video games.\n\nConsumers tend to think of paid streamers like Netflix or Disney+ when they want to watch movies, TV, or sports, Martin said, but \"they don't necessarily think about YouTube or TikTok.\"\n\n\"Directly, it's hard to say that a video game is competing with a movie, or a video game is competing with the TV, even though they do consume our attention,\" said Rahul Telang, a business professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nHowever, some see truth in the idea of an all-consuming battle for attention.\n\nBernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said Netflix may be a leader in long-form video, but others have better sports offerings. Yoon also wrote in a mid-December note that attention has shifted to short-form video on Instagram and TikTok, and even new micro dramas.\n\n\"Critics may claim these are apples and oranges, but we heard the same argument about linear vs. streaming only a decade ago,\" Yoon wrote.",

    "description": "The Disney musical was a box-office flop. Now, it's considered a treasure that helped launch Christian Bale's career. Here's what the cast is up to.",
    "fullText": "In 1992, Disney's movie musical \"Newsies\" made its debut — and it's since become quite a treasure.\n\nLoosely based on the true story of the 1899 newsboys' strike in New York City, the film features a crew of so-called newsies as they sing their way through oppression and fight for a fairer working system.\n\n\"Newsies\" was a box-office flop when it was first released, reportedly making less than $3 million at the box office, even though it cost over $15 million to make.\n\nBut in the years since, \"Newsies\" has built up a passionate group of \"fansies\" and has been adapted into a majorly successful Broadway musical. It has also helped launch the careers of a few young stars.\n\nHere's what the cast of \"Newsies\" is up to 33 years later:\n\nIn 1992, Christian Bale was 17 years old and had a few acting credits to his name until \"Newsies\" came along.\n\nBale portrayed the film's lead Jack Kelly, one of the ringleaders behind the newsies' strike.\n\nBale gave quite a performance singing, dancing, and acting as a rough, 19th-century Manhattan teen fending for himself and his chosen family.\n\n\"Newsies\" wouldn't be Bale's last Disney movie.\n\nHe'd later star in the early-1990s Disney flop \"Swing Kids,\" voice Thomas in 1995's \"Pocahontas,\" and voice Bagheera in 2019's \"Mowgli.\"\n\nOf course, the actor is perhaps most well known for his roles in \"American Psycho,\" \"Ford v Ferrari,\" and the \"Batman\" franchise — though he has starred in several other major movies since his \"Newsies\" days.\n\nDavid Moscow and Bale had undeniable synergy while starring alongside each other in \"Newsies.\"\n\nMoscow played David Jacobs, \"a mouth with a brain\" and a coleader in the fictionalized strike against Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst.\n\n\"Newsies\" might have been Moscow's first Disney musical, but the young star was no stranger to the big screen, having starred in Tom Hanks' \"Big\" just a few years prior.\n\nDecades after singing and dancing next to the future star of the \"Batman\" series, Moscow continues to leave a mark on Hollywood.\n\nHe appeared in 2003's \"Just Married\" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy and produced over a dozen movies.\n\nMoscow also appeared in 2017's \"This Is Christmas\" and \"One Last Night\" — but he's mostly been focusing on behind-the-scenes work.\n\nStarring as David Jacob's younger brother, Les, in the musical, Luke Edwards was no stranger to acting when he landed the role.\n\nBefore starring in \"Newsies,\" Edwards had several acting credits to his name, including a role in the cult-favorite '80s comedy \"The Wizard.\"\n\nEdwards has guest-starred on shows like \"Without a Trace\" and \"True Detective,\" though you might remember Edwards from \"American Pie 2\" or even \"Jeepers Creepers II.\"\n\nEdwards has also appeared in \"The Super,\" \"Adverse,\" and \"My Friend's Play.\"\n\nOne of the older \"Newsies\" in the bunch, Max Casella was 24 years old when he officially made his musical debut as Racetrack Higgins.\n\nAside from having a few TV roles in the 1980s and early 1990s, Casella had not appeared in a major theatrical production prior to this one.\n\nHe was, however, most well known as the time for his role as Vinnie Delpino on \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\"\n\nSince \"Newsies,\" Casella has gone on to make an impressive resume for himself.\n\nHe's lent his voice to characters in \"The Little Mermaid 2,\" \"Dinosaur,\" and \"Courage the Cowardly Dog.\" He has appeared in over two dozen \"Sopranos\" episodes, acted in \"Leatherheads,\" and joined \"Boardwalk Empire\" in 2010.\n\nI recent years, you might have spotted Casella in \"Jackie\" alongside Natalie Portman, or on episodes of \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and \"Tulsa King.\"\n\nAlthough he was only 15 years old when he starred as the spunky Brooklyn newsie Spot Conlon, Gabriel Damon was already quite a seasoned actor with over 30 credits to his name.\n\nNotably, he was the voice of Littlefoot in the fan-favorite animated film, \"The Land Before Time.\"\n\nAside from a few appearances on \"Baywatch\" and a few one-off roles on shows like \"ER\" and \"Sirens,\" Damon has shied away from the acting industry.\n\nHis last noted role was in a short in 2006.\n\n\"Newsies\" was Marty Belafsky's first-ever movie role.\n\nIn the musical, he appeared as the goofy but lovable Crutchy.  He was only 16 years old when \"Newsies\" was released.\n\nWhen he appeared as Boots in the 1992 musical drama, Arvie Lowe Jr. was a 12-year-old actor with no other roles to his name.\n\nAfter \"Newsies\" wrapped, Lowe Jr. found himself starring on popular 1990s shows like \"Sister, Sister,\" \"Moesha,\" and \"Smart Guy.\"\n\nHe even starred on the early aughts Disney Channel show \"Lizzie McGuire\" alongside Hilary Duff.\n\nSince then, he's had a few minor roles in Hollywood, and he's appeared in a few video shorts and commercials. Lowe Jr. is also a graphic designer.\n\nEle Keats had a few acting credits under her belt in Hollywood before landing the role of Sarah Jacobs in \"Newsies.\"\n\nShe played Jack Kelly's love interest, which led to backlash from fans who were unhappy about her kiss with Bale. Some have even referred to her character as the \"Destroyer of Dreams.\"\n\nSince starring in \"Newsies,\" Keats has had a number of small roles and has even guest-starred on shows like \"CSI,\" \"CSI: NY,\" and \"Cold Case.\"\n\nIn the last few years, she's made a name for herself in the horror-film industry, starring in \"Insidious: Chapter 3\" and \"Ouija: Origin of Evil.\"\n\nShe also owns Ele Keats Jewelry, which has a showroom in Santa Monica.\n\nActor Bill Pullman played one of the few redeeming adult characters \"Newsies\" had to offer.\n\nPreviously known for his work in \"Spaceballs,\" among other films, Pullman starred in the Disney musical as passionate journalist Bryan Denton.\n\nRobert Duvall was quite the villain in the musical, where he appeared as publishing mogul Joseph Pulitzer.\n\nPrior to \"Newsies,\" he acted in dozens of works — including \"The Godfather\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\"\n\nAfter \"Newsies,\" Duvall appeared in projects like \"The Apostle,\" \"Deep Impact,\" \"Gone in 60 Seconds,\" and \"Kicking and Screaming.\"\n\nHe continues to make a name for himself in Hollywood, and recently appeared in \"Widows,\" \"Hustle,\" and \"The Pale Blue Eye.\"\n\nCorrection: December 15, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Luke Edwards' first major role. It was in \"The Wizard,\" not \"Newsies.\"\n\nThis story was originally published in August 2018 and most recently updated on December 15, 2025.",

    "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein victims'  lawsuits resembled two others, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for hundreds of millions.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge expressed skepticism about a pair of lawsuits that victims of Jeffrey Epstein had filed against two banks, suggesting he may dismiss them before they have a chance to go to trial.\n\nAt the outset of a Monday afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, US District Judge Jed Rakoff unfavorably compared the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon to two similar lawsuits he had previously overseen, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan agreed to settle the case for $290 million. Deutsche Bank agreed to settle for $75 million.\n\nRakoff said the language in the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon — which were brought by the same attorneys and filed in October — was \"frequently conclusory\" and appeared to lack sufficient detail to demonstrate what the banks did wrong. He called the lawsuits \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric.\"\n\n\"'Knows' without saying by whom is vague. 'Affiliated' without saying what that means is vague,\" Rakoff told David Boies, an attorney who brought the case. \"A lot of that language is in the complaint.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Epstein victims — David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards, and Brittany Henderson — two weeks to revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.\n\nThe judge said they would be permitted to use material they had already gathered as part of the discovery process in the case, but should put a hold on additional depositions and subpoenas until he issued a ruling, which he said could come at the end of January.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Bank of America and BNY Mellon aided in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by providing him with banking services and then ignoring red flags tied to his transactions.\n\nEpstein, a well-connected financier, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on criminal sex-trafficking charges. One of his associates, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to him.\n\nMonday's hearing was scheduled for the judge to weigh motions to dismiss the two lawsuits outright.\n\nCharlotte Taylor, an attorney at the law firm Jones Day representing Bank of America, argued the lawsuits consisted of \"recycled boilerplate allegations\" and that they could not prove the bank provided anything other than \"routine banking services\" to Epstein and his associates. Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney at WilmerHale, said the plaintiffs couldn't prove anyone at BNY Mellon had the \"state of mind\" to be found liable.\n\nBoies told Rakoff that the banks should have noticed enough smoke around the transactions from bank accounts belonging to Epstein and his associates to know there was a fire. Aside from Epstein's 2008 criminal conviction in Florida, he had been dogged by civil litigation for years, Boies said.\n\nRakoff expressed skepticism that the pattern of facts alleged in the lawsuit would be enough.\n\n\"Last I checked, that's not enough to survive a motion to dismiss,\" Rakoff said. \"You need to have enough allegations as to specific facts.\"\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawyers for the Epstein victims appeared eager to revise their lawsuits and include the information they obtained through the discovery process. Rakoff said that material may be redacted on the public docket.\n\n\"I think he's giving us a chance,\" Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, told Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Your Uber spending is coming back to haunt you — for real.\n\nJust days after \"Saturday Night Live\" aired a satirical skit about an \"Uber Eats wrapped\" and the horrors of discovering how much you spent on it this year, Uber made the embarrassment real with a Spotify-style year-end recap.\n\nOn Monday, the company launched a new year-in-review feature called \"YOUBER,\" which compiles users' activity across both Uber and Uber Eats.\n\nIt's unclear if \"SNL\" knew about Uber's plans before its spoof. It's also unclear how long Uber had the recap in the works, or if it was influenced by the skit. Uber and NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe feature echoes the sketch that aired on Saturday night, which lays bare how quickly people who willingly participate in data tracking recoil when that data reflects something they don't want to know.\n\nThe skit started with an innocuous character who was delighted to find that she was one of Sabrina Carpenter's top global listeners in 2025. Then the skit took an ominous turn when an advertisement claimed to reveal who the characters \"really are\" this year, featuring an \"Uber Eats wrapped.\"\n\nOne character learned he had eaten more chicken nuggets than 99% of users worldwide. Another was assigned an \"Uber Eats age\" — a riff on Spotify's \"listening age\" — only to be told his was \"Dead.\" The humiliation peaked when a character realized he had spent $24,000 on Uber Eats in a year, prompting him to scream into a pillow in response.\n\nTo access the actual feature, which is only available in the US at the moment, look for the \"YOUBER\" banner in your app, and it will show riders where they went, how often they opted for Uber Comfort, and which restaurants they returned to again and again.\n\nThe feature also assigns users one of 14 \"Uber Personality Profiles,\" including \"Do-Gooder\" for Uber Electric loyalists, \"Rise & Shiner\" for early-morning riders, and \"Delivery Darling\" for customers who \"live for deliveries of all kinds.\"\n\nAnd if you don't want to endure your guilt alone, you can always share it.

    "fullText": "The Kennedys' legacy of style endures through auctions of their historic clothing.\n\nEven unmentionables tied to the Kennedys remain hot-ticket items — a pair of JFK's underwear sold for $9,100 at an auction in March held by Julien's Auctions.\n\nOne of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' most memorable looks, the purple wool maternity coat she wore the night John F. Kennedy was elected in 1960, sold for $50,800 at Sotheby's Handbags and Fashion auction on Monday in New York City.\n\nThe coat's designer is unknown, but it remains recognizable as a pivotal moment in her rise to become one of America's defining fashion icons.\n\nTake a closer look at the former first lady's historic outfit.\n\nKennedy Onassis was pregnant with John F. Kennedy Jr. at the time, so she only occasionally joined Kennedy on the campaign trail leading up to election night. One such stop took place in New York City in October 1960, where she accessorized the purple coat with a matching hat.\n\nKennedy Onassis stood next to the then-president-elect as he delivered his acceptance speech.\n\nA photo of her wearing the coat appeared on the cover of the November 21, 1960, issue of Life Magazine.\n\nKennedy Onassis, who was eight months pregnant on election night, accessorized the coat with strands of pearls and low heels.\n\nAccording to Sotheby's, Kennedy Onassis shared the coat with a few of her close friends to wear during their pregnancies. The daughter of the last of these women to wear the coat donated it to Sotheby's.\n\nSotheby's estimated the coat's value at between $6,000 and $8,000. It sold for $50,800, more than six times the high estimate.",

    "description": "There is a workaround for this bizarre bug.",
    "fullText": "If you open a picture in the Photos app on your iPhone, and it inexplicably starts turning red, I wouldn't blame you for being a bit concerned. After all, that's not supposed to happen, and out of all the colors your photos could randomly fade into, red is among the creepiest.\n\nWhile you contemplate what angry and vengeful god you might have crossed recently, understand that this isn't necessarily a problem affecting all, or even most, iPhone users and their photos. In fact, it doesn't appear to be affecting photos taken on iPhones at all. Rather, the users reporting this issue see it when zooming in on photos taken on Android devices. It seems a new hue has been added to the iPhone/Android divide: green bubbles, red pictures.\n\nIf this isn't happening on your own iPhone, you can see the issue play out in this Reddit post. User djenki0119 posted a screen recording of themself browsing photos on their iPhone that they had originally taken on a Samsung Galaxy S24. At first, the pictures appears totally normal. But once djenki0119 zooms in on each, it quickly turns a deep shade of red—almost as if you were looking at film developing in a dark room. This user has the same issue, only they took their photo on a Motorola Razr.\n\nAt this time, it's unclear what is actually causing the issue to occur. It usually doesn't matter what type of device took any particular image: Once it's in the Photos app, it should display normally. But there must be something about Android files that the iOS Photos app isn't reading correctly, at least when users zoom in on the image. As 9to5Mac highlights, it appears that something is adding a red filter to these images in the Photos app. Since this issue is only popping up recently, my guess is there's a bug within iOS 26, though there could be an issue with Android instead.\n\nFor what it's worth, I wasn't able to replicate the problem with photos I sent from my Pixel 8 Pro over to my iPhone. But perhaps there is some strange combination of hardware and software that results in this tinting: Maybe a photo taken on a certain type of Android device running a specific version of Android turns red on a certain iPhone model running a specific version of iOS.\n\nLuckily, you don't have to wait for Apple, Google, Samsung, or Motorola to issue a fix, depending on where the actual issue is coming from. To return your image to its proper color scheme, open it in the Photos app, tap \"Edit,\" then choose \"Revert.\" This restores the image to its original state, and removes the red filter that was unnecessarily overlayed on top of it.",

    "title": "The Kindle App Now Has Built-In AI, Because of Course It Does",
    "description": "The feature is always on, whether or not you want it to be.",
    "fullText": "It's 2025, so every piece of technology now needs to have an AI component. It doesn't matter if these AI features are useful (though some are), they just need to be there, however ham-fisted or useless they may seem—though the line between those extremes often comes down to user preference. To that end, if you've ever been reading a book on the Kindle app and wished that you could ask your device a question about the text, Amazon has an AI bot for you.\n\nLast week, Amazon announced \"Ask this Book,\" a new AI feature for the Kindle app. Now available on the iOS version of the app, it lets you ask Amazon's AI questions about whatever it is you're reading, whether you bought or borrowed the title. You can highlight a selection from the text to include in you're queries, and ask questions relating the story's plot, characters, relationships, and theme. According to Amazon, all answers will be contextual, presumably meaning they'll all be related to the text at hand, and importantly, all answers will be spoiler-free. That should help avoid the classic mistake of googling a question you have about a book you're reading and spoiling a coming plot twist or character death.\n\nAmazon says Ask this Book is currently active for \"thousands\" of books written in English. As noted, as of this writing the feature is only live in the iOS version of the app, but Amazon is working on bringing it to the Android app, as well as Kindle devices, next year.\n\nIf this sounds like the type of feature you'd be interested in, great! If you don't care for this feature, either as a reader who doesn't want AI getting in the way of their books, a publisher who doesn't want Amazon training its AI on their IP, or a teacher who might see this as a potential cheating opportunity, there's bad news: Once Amazon makes Ask this Book available for any given title, it's permanently available, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. That comes directly from an Amazon spokesperson, who told Publishers Lunch, “[t]o ensure a consistent reading experience, the feature is always on, and there is no option for authors or publishers to opt titles out.”\n\nThat response bothers me for two reasons. One, it's always frustrating when a company introduces a new feature lwithout giving users the option to turn it off. I don't use Apple Intelligence, but I appreciate that Apple lets me turn it off. Meta, on the other hand, forces me to contend with Meta AI, even though I never use it. Amazon seems to be attending the Meta school of user design.\n\nBut what's more, it seems wild to me that authors and publishers don't get a say as to whether this AI bot gets to be active on their books—especially retroactively. It'd even be one thing if authors had to opt-in in order to put their books on the Kindle platform going forward. But to enable it on \"thousands\" of titles made available before Ask this Book was ever a thing is, to me, disrespectful to authors and publishers, to say the least.\n\nInterestingly, Amazon dodged questions from Publishers Lunch concerning licensing rights around Ask this Book, as well as protections for users, which is troubling given generative AI has a habit of hallucinating—or, in other words, making things up completely. Sure, when it's working as intended, the AI can help readers understand things they're confused about, but there's a real chance that the AI will misinterpret questions, misrepresent the text, or straight up lie, which could negatively impact a reader's experience of the work, with potential fallout for both the author and the publisher.\n\nWhile you won't see this feature yet on your Kindle, you will encounter it in the Kindle app. You can either access it from the menu in any book where the feature is available, or by highlighting text in said book. Once you do, Ask this Book will present a list of questions it thinks you might be interested in asking. If none of them do it for you, you can formulate your own questions, and ask followups after the bot answers.",

    "title": "All the Best Ways to Upgrade and Organize Your Garage",
    "description": "If the only thing in your garage is a car, you’re wasting a great opportunity.",
    "fullText": "Outfitting that garage with the right gear is the difference between a useful and organized space and a chaotic black hole of junk. If you want your garage to be a place where you can get work done, where you can actually find stuff, and maybe also where you can park your car, here’s what you should have, ranging from the must-have essentials to some luxuries you could stretch for.\n\nIf you want to get the most of any garage, here’s the short list of essentials:\n\nOverhead storage. An empty garage might seem like endless storage, but it fills up fast. If you don’t want to navigate a maze of junk every time you go in there, some overhead storage shelving is a must.\n\nWall storage. For more readily accessible storage, some bike hooks and wall hooks for yard tools (like rakes and shovels) will keep those things easy to grab but off the floor.\n\nAbsorbent mats. Your car will leak oil and other fluids, and the garage is where you do a lot of messy jobs. A large-format absorbent mat will save you a lot of cleanup.\n\nFire safety. Every space in your home should have a fire extinguisher within easy reach, and your garage is no exception. You might also consider keeping some fire blankets, which are often more effective for small, contained fires.\n\nSports caddy. If you’ve got a collection of balls for every possible sport, plus other implements, having a place to dump them all so they don’t roll around is a must.\n\nTool storage. Whether you go with a classic tool box or a set of magnetic strips on the walls, don’t let your expensive, delicate tools get dirty, damp, and lost.\n\nWorkbench. Even if you’re not a hobbyist or much of a DIYer, having a workbench in the garage is a good idea. If space is an issue, a wall-mounted folding one like this is an ideal solution.\n\nCreeper seat. Similarly, you don’t have to be a total gearhead to appreciate a creeper seat. Working in the garage often means working down low to the floor, so unless you enjoy sitting on he cold, greasy floor for a few hours, a creeper seat is a necessity.\n\nYou can always find an upgrade for any space, and your garage is no exception. Some useful-but-not-essential upgrades include:\n\nRubber door bottom. Your garage door probably isn’t a very good seal. When the weather’s hot or cold, that can make the space uncomfortable. A simple adhesive rubber door bottom provides a nice seal to make the space a little nicer to be in.\n\nClimate control. You don’t necessarily have to install central air or a mini-split in your garage. There are plenty of portable heating and cooling solutions that will keep you comfy while you work without breaking the bank.\n\nTire rack: If you have a growing collection of spare tires, or you’re rotating between all-weather and winter tires regularly, having a stable storage shelf for them is a lot better than stacking them up or having them rolling around.\n\nStopper mats: It’s a universal frustration: trying not to ram into the wall or crush a bunch of stuff every time you pull your car into the garage. If you don’t want a tennis ball hanging from a string, some simple mats like these will let you know when to hit the brakes.\n\nTile flooring: Even if you have a nice floor in your garage—maybe especially if you have a nice floor in there—a protective tile floor is a good idea. It’ll keep everything pristine and protected from damage (from dropped tools, for example).\n\nWant your garage to be even nicer? No problem—here are some very useful add-ons that fall into the “luxury” category for most garages:\n\nSpeakers. These days, you don’t need a whole entertainment system in your garage—your phone and a Bluetooth speaker will do. But the speaker needs to be waterproof and designed for work spaces if you want it to survive.\n\nFridge. If you’re still nipping into the kitchen for a fresh beverage while you’re working in the garage, it’s time to upgrade to a garage-specific fridge.\n\nRetractable extension cords. Necessary? Not really, but very useful: A retractable extension cord keeps wires out of the way when you’re not using them and prevents them from knotting up in maddening ways. Extra bonus: Have an outlet installed in the ceiling of the garage and mount the extension cord up there, too, so you just pull it down when you need it.\n\nUtility sink. Having a place to wash up and clean dirty tools in the garage is a godsend. If the garage isn’t plumbed and you don’t want to sink that kind of cash into it, an outdoor sink hooked up to a garden hose will do the trick.\n\nHoist. Suckers get on ladders and lift with their muscles. Smart folks install an overhead hoist that can lift cargo boxes or other heavy things out of the way with ease.\n\nGarage door screen. It’s nice to open the garage door while you’re working in the warm weather—unless it invites every bug in the universe to assault you. A nice garage door screen lets you enjoy the breeze without the bugs.\n\nLaser guides. If a rubber mat or a tennis ball on a string isn’t high-tech enough for your parking needs, why not install a laser-guided system? You’ll never scrape a door or crush a garbage can again.\n\nPaper towel dispenser. Necessary? Maybe not, but being able to grab a paper towel hands-free as needed just makes garage life easier.\n\nWall-mounted inflator. If you’ve got cars and bikes in your garage, installing a wall-mounted inflator will make keeping tires properly inflated and maintained a breeze.\n\nSeating area. And if you’ve got a large garage—or no car—why not create a comfortable place to sit and relax in-between projects? Some durable outdoor furniture and an outdoor rug are all you need.",

    "title": "What's Good (and What's Overhyped) About the Viral 2-2-2 Workout",
    "description": "The principles are sound, but is it really anything special?",
    "fullText": "If I’ve learned anything about online fitness content in the years I've spent consuming and creating it, it’s this: Stack a bunch of numbers together, and you have a potentially viral workout, from 12-3-30 to 4-2-1.\n\nThe latest is the 2-2-2 workout, which is supposed to reveal the big secret of effectively building muscle after you hit age 40. Unfortunately, after trying it out, I’m not so sure about that.\n\nI’ve been seeing the 2-2-2 workout pop up across the Internet, but all the sources point back to a video from Alain Gonzalez that claims the “2-workout-2-set” method is “getting men over 40 jacked FAST.”\n\nThat’s pretty much the whole pitch: The number 2 comes up twice (I felt like I was going mad trying to find out what the last 2 is for), and it’s aimed at middle-aged men. I’m not a man, but as a middle-aged woman with personal training and weightlifting coaching certifications, I’m in a pretty good positions to evaluate those claims. So let’s take a look at what’s actually in the workouts.\n\nI looked at the PDF Gonzalez offers that describes the program, and in it he does actually say what the many articles about his method did not: what the third “2” stands for. So, the 2-2-2 method is:\n\nTwo full-body workouts per week\n\nTwo reps in reserve on each set\n\nIt’s a fine setup, I think, and probably a lot of people of any gender or age would get stronger using a workout like this. But it also relies on two often misunderstood concepts.\n\nA working set is a set of an exercise that you think of as your “real” work for the day. This means that it does not include warmup sets, or anything else you do to prepare for those working sets.\n\nThis means you might end up doing more than two sets, depending on the exercise. For example, I may not need any warmup sets to do my cable lateral raises (one of the exercises Gonzalez recommends), so that’s just two actual sets. But if I’m supposed to do two hard sets of leg press, I’m not going to leg press a couple hundred pounds cold. I’d start with sets of lighter weights and work my way up—so maybe that will be five sets total for the day, but only the working sets count for the 2-2-2 program.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the PDF calls for seven exercises each day. That’s a minimum of 14 sets you’ll do per workout, with most exercises likely requiring at least one or two warmup sets, and some even more. You’ll also rest two to five minutes between sets. Emphasizing “just two sets” makes the workout sound quick and simple, but in practice, it looks like you’ll probably be in the gym a good while.\n\nReps in reserve, or RIR, is a great way to explain to experienced lifters how hard they’ll be working in a given set. If you’ve never used RIR before, though, there is a definite learning curve. The idea is that you stop an exercise with two reps “in reserve”—that is, reps that you could have done but didn’t. If you’ve done 10 lat pulldowns and you feel like the eleventh would be really hard and the twelfth would be the last one you could possibly do in this set, then you stop at 10. You’ve left those last two reps “in reserve.”\n\nThis is a common, useful way of talking about exercise intensity—see this explainer from the National Academy of Sports Medicine. But you have to have enough experience with that exercise, and with exercising in general, to recognize the signs your body gives you that you have exactly two reps left. Often, beginners will stop too early, and never get the benefits of going closer to failure before stopping.\n\nIf you’re used to using RIR (or RPE, which is a similar concept), this is a fine way of planning your workouts. If you tend to overestimate your abilities, you’ll probably hit RIR 0 (that is, failure) often enough to teach yourself what those last few reps feel like. But if you’re a person who tends to shy away from those harder reps, or if you’ve never really gone all the way to failure on an exercise, RIR is probably not a good tool for you.\n\nAs a lifter and a trainer, I like the idea of 2-2-2...for a specific kind of person. And yes, probably a lot of the “men over 40” in the target audience qualify as that person.\n\nSpecifically, this is a good workout for people who are already experienced in the gym, but can’t reliably make time for more than two workouts per week. You can get a lot done in two workouts, if each workout covers all your major muscle groups, which it does in this plan.\n\nThe routine does have a plan for progression, which is nice—a lot of trendy workout routines do not. You’ll be doing “double progression,” which means you increase reps of an exercise until you feel ready to increase the weight. At that point you’ll be doing fewer reps, so you start adding reps again. That’s a solid approach that doesn’t take much thinking ahead. (It’s also a missed opportunity to add another “2” to the name.)\n\nMy biggest gripe about this workout is just that there’s nothing special about it. It’s basic to the point of being almost common sense: Hey you, do two full-body workouts a week! Make sure each exercise has a few hard sets! Really, no need to overthink it.\n\nThere’s actually nothing special here for “men over 40,” except perhaps that men over 40 are more likely to have kids and other responsibilities taking up their time, and thus will find a twice-a-week schedule convenient. I also find the workout selection biased toward people who stick to machines. On the bright side, you could probably do this whole thing at a Planet Fitness, and that's going to be convenient for a lot of folks. But I find machines boring. (Maybe that's a \"me\" problem.)\n\nIn terms of Gonzalez’s actual workout materials, there are a few things that bug me. One is that he talks about the two-workouts-per-week schedule as if it were strongly supported by science as the best option. In reality, two workouts are fine, but people tend to do better with more. No champion bodybuilder or weightlifter hits every muscle twice a week and chills on the couch the rest of the time. Even most recreational athletes with some kind of goal will do better with three or four workouts. Two is enough for most people’s goals, but it’s not necessarily better.\n\nPromising more results for less work is a staple of the fitness industry, so I’m able to see through it—and of course everybody says their signature workout is the best option. But if you going in thinking the 2-2-2 really is the secret to getting jacked over 40, I beg you to consider that there is never one correct answer to fitness. You can pick any schedule that works each major muscle twice per week, and it will accomplish the same trick.",

    "description": "I am now a morning person.",
    "fullText": "I am not a morning person, and I never have been—well, unless I have to make money. For years, my start time at my old job was 5 a.m. and, against all odds, I made it in every day. Now, I teach a 6 a.m. spin class twice a week after being moved off the more-tolerable late morning shift. Until a few months ago, though, I was sleeping through every alarm on all the other days, even though I knew I should be getting up and going to the gym early as a solid way to start my day. It took me a long time, but I have managed to force myself into being the kind of person who is up before the sun and done with my daily exercise routine before my friends are even out of bed. Here's exactly what I did.\n\nSince starting to teach the 6 a.m. spin classes, I've noticed two undeniable things: I can drag myself out of bed for the promise of money with no problem and my day is measurably better when I start it with a workout. I am just more alert, productive, and all-around pleasant when the morning begins with exercise than I am when it begins with sleeping in. It was obvious I needed to start every day that way, whether or not I was getting paid to do it, but tricking myself into exercising \"for free\" was my first challenge.\n\nThe solution was one you might not like: I had to tie a financial stake to what I wanted to do. Instead of getting money, like I do when I teach, I had to pay money so I would be motivated not to let my investment go to waste. This was a problem because one of the perks of my part-time teaching gig is a free membership at a luxury gym here in New York City. Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but having free and unlimited access to a fancy gym didn't exactly motivate me; it would be there whenever I wanted to go and if I didn't happen to want to go at all, it wasn't like I was losing money on it. So, I started signing up for introductory offers at every studio in my area. Usually, these lasted one to two weeks and cost less than a regular membership at the studio in question would if I weren't on a trial offer. I had paid, but hadn't paid a relative bunch, and that was good enough to start. Up I got each morning, slowly but surely building a habit. The intro offers expired, though, and I'd find myself scrambling to find a new place to go, which upended my routine and wasn't conducive to consistency.\n\nNext, I downloaded ClassPass and set up an autopay for every month, but since my unused credits roll over to the next month, that wasn't as motivating. I took note of how much more consistent I am in a use-it-or-lose it scenario, kept ClassPass because it still comes in handy, but looked for more options. Ultimately, through ClassPass, I found a studio in my area that offers a Pilates-inspired strength training class. I became obsessed with it—but an unlimited monthly membership was a few hundred dollars. I put off getting that because it seemed exorbitant, but in the end, I realized that might be the only way to get myself to stick to the routine that was slowly forming. Eventually, I pulled the trigger. I traded away a small fortune for access to a studio full of something known as \"megaformers.\" I have been in that studio every single weekday morning at 6:30 (except on teaching days, when I run over at 7:30) for a month now. Sometimes, I go at 5:30 just because I can. Who the hell is she? I am not only prepared, but excited, to buy it again going into this next month.\n\nDo you need to spend hundreds on this? Absolutely not. But for me, tying financial stakes to my mission was crucial and, also just from my perspective, they had to be intense. A low-cost, big-box gym membership has never motivated me. What's $25 slipping out of my checking account every month along with all the other subscriptions I've forgotten about? When I've paid a little more to go to gyms that offer free classes, even signing up for morning ones didn't always do it, since there was no fee associated with skipping them. (As a teacher now, I realize exactly how nasty that mindset is, but I'm just being honest.) My subconscious is stubborn, it deeply desires staying in bed, and I had to take an extreme measure to beat it.\n\nFor you, a lower-cost gym membership might work just fine, but I'll caution that what has to go along with the financial investment is a time-based commitment. It's not that I struggle to work out in general; I do it every day, but I wanted to start doing it in the morning, not cramming it in at night or whenever I thought of it throughout the day. That's why paid classes have been so crucial: They're strictly scheduled. I can't just go whenever I want, nor can I decide I don't feel like going when the time rolls around. The combination of paying a noticeable amount and having to be there at a set time is elemental to what I'm doing.\n\nThat leads me to the next big thing I did. Buying classes, packages, a gym or app membership, or whatever else, isn't enough on its own if you don't make space in your life for using them. I had to take a hard look at my schedule. I fell back on a lot of scheduling tips I've written about here, like time blocking and time boxing, plus I started using prioritization techniques to figure out what could be rearranged. The MIT—or most important thing—method was helpful because it allowed me to calculate the impact my daily to-dos have on my larger goals, leaving space for me to acknowledge the positive impact morning workouts have on other parts of my day. With other kinds of prioritization approaches, working out didn't rank as high because it is something a little more optional than the work I have to do to keep a roof over my head, you know? But my goal here was to make more space for it and create a lifestyle that specifically positioned it as a morning activity, so the MIT method helped me center it.\n\nLike the financial investment, this meant something undesirable: I initially tried to get more serious about going to bed early. That is not aligned with who I am in the deepest parts of my soul, and it never has been. To be completely transparent, more often than not, I simply didn't do it. Asleep at 1 a.m. and awake at 5, I have just been tired a lot. I give myself grace with things like this because if I'm too hard on myself about it, I'll demoralize myself and that won't help me with my overall goal. Eventually, if being tired starts to annoy me too much, I'll course-correct and be asleep at 10 p.m. like a smarter person. As it is now, I've been making space in my schedule for some naps (which isn't something I've ever done much of before). Breaks are an important part of overall productivity, as is leaving yourself space to be who you are without trying to make too many drastic changes at once, so the temporary nap-allowance system is just fine. I'm also trying to avoid strenuous activity at night. I can't force myself to go to sleep early, but I can at least stop starting new projects at 11 p.m., which will just make me sleepier the next day than if I am relaxed pre-bedtime.\n\nI've noticed myself making small, subconscious changes even though I haven't become an early-bedtime gal yet. I'm calling it a night a lot sooner than I normally would when I'm out with friends, even though I'm not necessarily going home to sleep so much as I'm just going home not to be out. I also was struck by the inspiration to paint a piece of furniture last night at 11 p.m.. Normally, adherent to the 10-minute and one-more rules that I am, I would have jumped up and done this the moment I thought of it. Last night, I didn't do it, knowing I shouldn't get too involved in something tricky when I needed to be winding down ahead of this morning's Pilates class. These are baby steps, yes, but they're a lot more helpful to developing long-term, sustainable habits than complete personality overhauls are. Those rarely last, but little, incremental changes add up to longer-term success.\n\nThis part is fun, so there's the reprieve. For me, any meaningful life change has to come with little rewards, and I'm not talking about the mental health benefits of exercise, looking better, or feeling more productive after a workout. I'm talking about little treats. First of all, commitment to my new schedule opened up the opportunity to crush my goals with the various apps I use to track my workouts. I am serious about using my Peloton app to track all my workouts, even the ones I don't take through the app or using my Bike, largely because I think it gives me a better data breakdown than when I use the native workout-tracking function on my Apple Watch, but also because it contributes to my daily streak (as of today: 274 days). Getting a workout inputted into the app first thing in the morning secures my streak, which is literally just a number on a screen, but it motivates me.\n\nI have also started using something similar to a SMART goal to track and reward progress. SMART goals are ones that are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound. So, I tell myself things like, \"If I go to class at 5:30 tomorrow morning, I will stop at Dunkin' for a donut on the way home,\" or, \"If I work out every morning this week, I will get myself one new activewear outfit on Sunday.\"\n\nWearing silly little matchy outfits is also integral to my personal process, as it puts me in a good mood before I even leave the house and makes me feel more put-together and capable at the gym, but that might not be true for you. In fact, none of these things specifically need to be for you, but they can be a guideline. The general through line here is that I took the time to consider what I wanted (to wake up early and work out); and what I know about myself (I'm motivated by money, my schedule wasn't conducive to this activity, and I need constant mini-rewards to keep going); then combine those facts into a new, incremental strategy that worked for me. No matter what you want or what motivates you, you can do the same by relying on a few productivity tricks and your own self-awareness.",

    "title": "These Two New iPhone Features Are Coming to iOS 26.3",
    "description": "Apple is already working on the sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "Just three days after Apple released iOS 26.2 to iPhones everywhere, the company is back at it with a new update. iOS 26.3 is official, though only for beta testers. Those brave enough to install Apple's unfinished software on their devices won't find an update packed to the brim with new features and changes, but they will stumble upon two key new features. The thing is, we already knew both of them were on the way.\n\nThis isn't the end all be all for the update, however: Since iOS 26.3 is so new, it's possible testers will discover additional features hidden within the update. In addition, Apple may add new changes in subsequent beta versions. I'll continue to update this article to reflect any new features that reveal themselves, but, until then, here are the two new features we know about.\n\nBack in September, we learned that Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the EU, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAfter three months, we are now getting our first official look at this feature. In this first iOS 26.3 beta, there is now a \"Notification Forwarding\" option in Notification settings. While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nKnowledge of iOS 26.3's second feature is not quite so old. In fact, we only learned about it last week. As it happens, Apple is working directly with Google on an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless.\n\nAs of last week, Google had already rolled out its first test of the feature to Android Canary, but it was nowhere to be found in Apple's betas. Now, we know what to expect: In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Here, iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device, where you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nThis isn't the flashiest beta Apple has ever shipped, but it is possible to install right now. Both the developer and public betas are now available, which means anyone interested can enroll their device in Apple's beta program to give 26.3 a try.\n\nHowever, know the risks before you do. Unfinished software could come with bugs and glitches that could impact your experience using your iPhone. If the software is particularly glitchy, you could lose data when downgrading back to iOS 26.2. If you do decide to install the beta, make a complete backup of your iPhone to a Mac or PC before you do.",

    "title": "I Tested Google’s New Live Translation With AirPods, and It Actually Works Well",
    "description": "You don't need Pixel Buds to translate a live conversation anymore.",
    "fullText": "I can be pretty tough on AI, especially when it's used to make misinformation slop. But as cynical as I may seem, I do acknowledge that there are plenty of useful and beneficial features that AI powers. Take live translation, for instance: Not long ago, the concept of a device that could translate someone else's words directly in your ear as they spoke would seem like some far future technology. But not only is it not a futuristic technology, both Google and Apple have their own takes on the feature that users can take advantage of.\n\nThat said, not all iPhone and Android users alike have been able to use live translate. Both companies have limited the feature to work with their respective earbuds: For Apple, that's the AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3; for Google, that's the Pixel Buds. Without your platform's flagship earbuds, you haven't been able to use live translation, and instead need to stick with the rest of your translation app's experience, whether that be Apple Translate or Google Translate. Lucky for Android users, that's no longer the case for the latter.\n\nOn Friday, Google announced new Gemini translation capabilities for its proprietary translation app. The company says these new updates introduce \"state-of-the-art text translation quality,\" with more nuanced, natural, and accurate translations. Importantly, however, as part of those upgrades, the company is launching a beta where all Google Translate users can access live translation through any headphones—not just Pixel Buds. This initial rollout is only available on the Android version of Google Translate in the U.S., Mexico, and India, though Google says the company will bring the feature to iOS and more regions in the next year.\n\nThis is kind of huge: Companies typically like to keep features like this locked behind their own platform as a marketing tactic. You're more likely to buy Pixel Buds over other earbuds or headphones if you really want to try live translation. However, you don't even need to buy a new pair of headphones to use this feature at all: As long as you have some type of headphones or earbuds connected to your Android device, you can translate conversations on the fly.\n\nI gave this a shot on my Pixel 8 Pro with my AirPods Max, by playing a video of people speaking Portuguese. Set up wasn't the simplest: First, it took forever for the Pixel to recognize my AirPods, despite the headphones being in pairing mode for some time, but that's beside the point. The key issue was getting Google Translate to present the new beta for live translation. When I first opened it, it was using the older live translate feature, which didn't work with my AirPods. I had the latest version running, so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. When it launched, I didn't have live translate at all. Finally, after force quitting and reopening the app, I got a pop-up for the new live translation beta experience.\n\nThe next part was user error: I had my language set to the target language (Portuguese), and vice versa. As such, Google assumed I would be the one speaking Portuguese, and didn't vocalize the English translation. Once I flipped the languages, and confirmed that English would be spoken through my headphones, the feature started working—and well, for that matter. The video I choose was taken from a news broadcast, with two anchors, and various speakers during news segments. Once the video started, I could see Google Translation translating the words on my screen, and, after about four seconds, I heard the audio translated in my hear. Google Translate even tries to match the speaker's voice, and though it certainly isn't a deepfake, it does well enough to distinguish different speakers from one another. It even tried to take on more a serious tone to match the anchor's, versus the more casual tone of one of the people interviewed in a news segment.\n\nI tried a couple of other videos in different languages, but this time, using the \"Detect language\" feature rather than a preset target language. The app was able to recognize this video was spoken in Thai, and this one was spoken in Urdu, and translated both accordingly. And while I can't verify the quality of the translation (I am sadly not fluent in any other language), the experience was overall easy enough to follow. The speed of speech can get a bit slow at times, perhaps because the AI has a lot to process at once, but as long as you turn up the volume on your headphones, it's easy enough to follow.\n\nAll that to say, I'm very interested to give this a try in a real world scenario. Even though my daily driver is an iPhone, I might need to start carrying around my Pixel 8 Pro just in case.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nBernd Leno (Fulham): Excellent for Fulham in their 3-2 win at Burnley. I know the result looks like a close game and Fulham will say they deserved to win, but Bernd Leno made five or six good saves at the start of the game that kept them in it. Burnley will feel hard done by.\n\nMalo Gusto (Chelsea): I'm not the biggest lover of this fella if I'm being honest. I can't work out why I don't rate him but I just don't. But credit where credit is due - he scored a good goal and played well against Everton - who were poor. He seems to be stepping up. A goal and an assist. I have to be as fair as I can.\n\nNordi Mukiele (Sunderland): He was excellent in the win over Newcastle. He got a yellow card but shut down Anthony Gordon, one of the best wingers in the Premier League who will probably start for England at the World Cup, and Mukiele didn't allow him to get anything going. He handled the mental appoach to it fantastically. He got the crowd involved and was part of a monumental victory for Sunderland.\n\nCalvin Bassey (Fulham): He chipped in with a goal at Burnley and might be my favourite personality in football - happy-go-lucky, plays with his heart on his sleeve. He's going to make mistakes but doesn't try to be perfect or polished and it was another dominant display by him. It looks like he's at fault for the first goal but it's actually Antonee Robinson running out to the left for no good reason.\n\nIbrahima Konate (Liverpool): Konate was under a lot of pressure and people were questioning whether he's going to be at Liverpool long-term - whether he's letting the transfer saga get to his head. He stepped up again in the win against Brighton and delivered.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): I'm seeing a lot of talk about the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth being the best game we've seen all year. Amateur-hour defending. But quality with the corner for Casemiro's goal and then that free-kick - you get in team of the week if you spank one of them in the top bin. He deserves that.\n\nIbrahim Sangare (Nottingham Forest): I was struggling to put Forest players in, which is weird when they won 3-0, but I thought Spurs were that bad. So bad you couldn't turn around and say 'these were great players'. But Sangare with a goal and two assists has had a great day for a holding midfielder. He's thriving under Sean Dyche. They lose him now for the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, which is really disappointing.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi (Nottingham Forest): He's got all the ability and potential to be whatever he wants. We need to see more games like this - goals and assists. I thought he was excellent on the day and Spurs couldn't live with him - he ran them ragged.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): The most underrated striker in the Premier League. Two goals in back-to-back games. The kid scores. He comes off after 70 minutes for Alexander Isak. Fantastic signing. He will be pushing Erling Haaland all the way for most goals. This kid is mustard - he's the real deal. Another one who will be looking at the World Cup and thinking he's got to go - he can play off the left-hand side with Kylian Mbappe for France.\n\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa): Villa are going about their business now. They showed West Ham too many opportunities - they won 3-2 away but on another day they lose. Rogers, fantastic first goal. The calmness and poise to turn and swivel on it. The second, knuckleball. You can try that 10 times and it won't go there, right in the top corner. Making a real argument that he should be starting for England in the opening game of the World Cup. He's growing as a player and a leader. It's no coincidence Villa do well when this kid does well.\n\nHarry Wilson (Fulham): Just a player you really enjoy watching. He has no real super strength but got two assists and a goal at Burnley. So calm, so poised. Not the quickest but he'll go past you, and knows he'll go on the left foot but you can't stop him. Wonderful football player.\n\nArne Slot (Liverpool): A massive result against Brighton. It was all about how he handled the Mohamed Salah situation. A lot of pressure on him and Liverpool. He defused the situation perfectly. They got the clean sheet, got the win. Also he managed that Joe Gomez situation - another injury at right-back. Pivotal win for them, and when you look at the table they're seventh. Considering their bad start to the season they're a few points off the Champions League places. They'll feel happy.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "A remarkable, chaotic, mesmerising Premier League thriller at Old Trafford captured the imagination even of the clinical operators in the dugout.\n\n\"Really difficult to explain,\" said Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola. \"But I prefer 4-4 to 0-0.\"\n\n\"Fun,\" was Manchester United counterpart Ruben Amorim's initial observation.\n\nAnalysing for Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher went further.\n\n\"The best game of the Premier League season so far,\" said the former England and Liverpool defender. \"It was almost a throwback to Alex Ferguson's Manchester United with attacking football.\n\n\"It is the best I have seen Man Utd. For the majority of the game, they were absolutely fantastic.\n\n\"For the first time under Amorim - and first time in a long time - I felt like I was watching what Man Utd are supposed to be. Wave after wave attack, but the inability to defend has hurt them.\"\n\nFor the record, Ferguson took charge of two games when United scored four and didn't win.\n\nThe first was a significant factor in his side's failure to win the 2012 title as United threw away a 4-2 lead and drew 4-4 with Everton at Old Trafford.\n\nThe other was Ferguson's very last match, an extraordinary 5-5 draw at West Brom in 2013.\n\nAmorim has a very long road ahead before he can be compared to Ferguson.\n\nBut at least, on a night when his side led twice in the first half, then fought back to get their noses in front again after conceding two in a matter of minutes at the start of the second, and finally had to settle for a point as Bournemouth finished the stronger, he understood what everyone had witnessed.\n\nIn a vibrant first half, the hosts' had the highest non-penalty xG value (2.49), most shots (17) and joint-most touches in the opposition's box (30) of any side in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League match this season.\n\n\"If you understand a little bit,\" Amorim said. \"If you follow the club like I follow the Premier League for so long, you [know you] have not just the duty to try to win the games. The way you try to win the games is so important for the fans.\n\n\"Of course they are desperate to win, but also, I feel that they are desperate to be inspired when they come to Old Trafford.\n\n\"Today was inspiring, I think, also because of Bournemouth. But in the end that's the feeling of frustration of not winning the game.\"",
