Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTexas quarterback Arch Manning will return to school and play for the Longhorns in 2026, ending months of speculation about whether he would declare for the 2026 NFL draft following his first season as a starter.\n\nESPN's Dave Wilson reported on Monday night that Manning’s father, Cooper Manning, confirmed the decision. “Arch is playing football at Texas next year,” he said.\n\nTexas officials also told ESPN the program fully expected Manning to return, even though the redshirt sophomore was eligible to enter the draft. Manning’s decision gives the Longhorns a boost at the game’s most important position as they look to build on a late-season surge.\n\nDuring a media event in Orlando, Florida, ahead of the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl against Michigan on Dec. 31, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said another year of college football would benefit Manning.\n\n“He’s a young man who’s gotten better as the season’s gone on, and not only physically, but mentally, maturity-wise,” Sarkisian said. “I would think he’s going to want another year of that growth to put himself in position for hopefully a long career in the NFL.”\n\nSarkisian added that Texas’ unfinished goals likely factored into the decision.\n\n“We left some meat on the bone with an opportunity to be SEC champs, national champs,” Sarkisian said.\n\nManning played his best football down the stretch as Texas went 6-1 late in the season and pushed for the College Football Playoff. Entering the bowl game, he has completed 227 of 370 passes for 2,942 yards, 24 touchdowns and seven interceptions, with only two picks over the final seven games.

    "fullText": "Dolphins can't keep handing Tua Tagovailoa the QB Job after Steelers loss originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf you were to just look at the stat sheet on Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers, you’d think Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa wasn’t the problem. But that’s what happens when you’re down two scores in the fourth quarter and allowed to pad the numbers.\n\nTagovailoa finished the night completing 22 of 28 pass attempts for 253 yards, two touchdowns and one interception, posting a passer rating of 113.4. Despite the inflated numbers, the Dolphins still lost 28-15 and were eliminated from playoff contention. Miami will now miss the postseason for the second straight year.\n\nAnd with that, Miami Herald columnist Barry Jackson believes it should be the last time the Dolphins simply hand Tagovailoa the starting job.\n\n\"After another stinker for three quarters in prime time, after another disappointment in less-than-pristine weather, there really is no justification for the Dolphins to play another game, let alone another season, with Tua Tagovailoa as the uncontested starter,\" Jackson wrote.\n\nJackson even went as far as suggesting the Dolphins at least give backup Quinn Ewers a look.\n\n\"No, let’s be clear: If the Dolphins have no better options in 2026 while they pay off the final guaranteed year of Tagovailoa’s contract, then play him. If Quinn Ewers gets a chance in December and flops, then go back to Tagovailoa.\n\n\"But never again should Tagovailoa simply be gifted a starting job. What, exactly, is there left for the Dolphins to learn about Tagovailoa?\"\n\nAs Jackson pointed out, numbers matter — but the most relevant ones continue to work against Tagovailoa.\n\nIn cold-weather games, long considered Miami’s kryptonite, the Dolphins have now lost 14 straight when kickoff temperatures are below 40 degrees, including Monday night in Pittsburgh. Tagovailoa has been part of six of those losses.\n\nIn prime-time games, he’s 2-8 over his last 10 appearances. Against teams with winning records, he’s 3-12 over his last 15.\n\nDuring last offseason, Tagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension following a Pro Bowl season. He has done little since to justify it.\n\nHis production dipped significantly last season, though injuries played a role, as he missed six games with multiple issues. He's healthier this season but the only teams he and the Dolphins can beat are those who have less wins than they do.\n\nStill, the contract is now the hinge point for Miami’s future decisions.\n\nTagovailoa is scheduled to earn $56.4 million next season. Financially, only a post–June 1 trade would offer meaningful relief — and that scenario appears unlikely. Even a post–June 1 release would leave Miami with $99.2 million in dead cap over the next two years, according to Spotrac.\n\n\"The biggest mystery is how McDaniel could have seen all of Tagovailoa’s limitations and still advocated for the Dolphins to give him the four-year, $212 million extension ($167 million guaranteed) that has left the franchise shackled,\" Jackson wrote.\n\n\"Who, exactly, was looking out for the franchise when a handful of people running it thought it was a good idea to extend a quarterback who was injury-prone, athletically limited, and had failed multiple times against stout defenses?\"",

Kyle Filipowski scored 16 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and overtime as the Jazz won consecutive games for just the second time this season.\n\nFlagg has been playing his best basketball the past few weeks as the No. 1 overall draft pick has averaged 25.7 points in the last seven games and became the first 18-year-old in league history to score 40 points.

He missed the second free throw on purpose and Max Christie got the rebound while being fouled. Christie made both foul shots to send the game into overtime.\n\nBut the overtime belonged to the Jazz as the Mavericks shot 1 for 9.\n\nBoth teams were missing their starting centers as the Jazz rested Jusuf Nurkic and the Mavericks’ Anthony Davis sat out with a left calf bruise.\n\nRotation regulars Kevin Love and Svi Mykhailiuk were healthy scratches as the Jazz decided to play their youngsters.\n\nMavericks: Host the Pistons on Thursday night.\n\nJazz: Host the Lakers on Thursday night.\n\nAP NBA: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "Pistons’ Javonte Green puts Derrick White on a poster with savage throwdown appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nJavonte Green pulled off a poster dunk highlight on Derrick White during the Detroit Pistons’ matchup against the Boston Celtics on Monday night.\n\nGreen is going through the seventh season of his NBA career, his first with the Pistons. He has represented five teams throughout his time in the league, looking forward to having a solid role in Detroit’s success this year.\n\nGreen’s highlight against White took place midway through the fourth quarter. He stole the ball from Payton Pritchard then went on the fast break, leaping in the air as he threw down the one-handed dunk over White.\n\nHe was irate about the lack of a foul call and got hit with a technical foul.pic.twitter.com/QNZ1lctjn5\n\n— ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) December 16, 2025\n\nIt was a great highlight for Javonte Green to get against Derrick White, helping the Pistons get the 112-105 win over the Celtics.\n\nDetroit got off to a slow start, trailing 33-35 after the first quarter. They got back on track from there on, outscoring Boston by 15 points in the last three period of regulation.\n\nPerimeter shooting and ball movement made the difference in this matchup. The Pistons prevailed in both categories by knocking down 13 3-pointers and creating 21 assists. It wasn’t the same for the Celtics as they converted 10 triples and dished out 16 assists.\n\nFour players scored in double-digits for Detroit in the win. Cade Cunningham led the way with a stat line of 32 points, 10 assists, four rebounds, and a steal. He shot 11-of-21 from the field, including 6-of-10 from beyond the arc, and 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. Tobias Harris came next with 13 points and seven rebounds, Caris LeVert put up 13 points and two assists, while Jaden Ivey provided 10 points and three assists.\n\nDetroit improved to a 21-5 record on the season, maintaining the top spot of the Eastern Conference standings. They are above the 2.5 games above the New York Knicks and 5.5 games above the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe Pistons will look forward to their next matchup, remaining on the road. They face the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 18 at 8:30 p.m. ET.",

    "fullText": "Ohio State's Carnell Tate gets massive comparison to 42-TD NFL star who won national title originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes continue to be a wide receiver factory.\n\nTheir latest developmental project may just be star wideout Carnell Tate. Through nearly three seasons thus far in Columbus, Tate has continued to improve leaps and bounds, catching the attention of NFL Draft analysts and other football personnel.\n\nOne of those is ESPN's Matt Miller who confidently gave Tate an eye-popping NFL comp: Minnesota Vikings star wideout Justin Jefferson.\n\nMiller was particularly impressed with the way both men play their spots when it comes to spreading the field alongside their ability to generate yards after contact (YAC).\n\n“I know, I know… this sounds wild. But it’s on point when comparing Tate to what Jefferson was at LSU – not what he is doing now in the NFL. Both are 6-foot-3 and around 200 pounds,\" Miller wrote. \"They each excelled as route runners while also being dominant on 50-50 balls thanks to vertical skills and body-adjustment ability. “I’m not predicting Tate will take the NFL by storm and become a top player as quickly as Jefferson did, but their skill sets are very similar when evaluating where they were entering the draft.”\n\nJefferson has caught 42 touchdowns thus far through nearly six NFL seasons. His best season statistically came in 2022 when the Vikings won the NFC North with a 13-4 record. Jefferson's season saw him hit a career-high 1,809 yards while catching eight touchdowns.\n\nThe Vikings would go on to lose in the NFC Wild Card Round to the New York Giants at home, 31-24.\n\nAlthough Tate has more time to grow and develop into a big-game receiver at the next level, it's a telling sign to see that those in the know see immediate benefit for whichever team decides to draft him.",

    "fullText": "Kestin Richins, North Summit (Sr.)\n\nNorth Summit is off to a great 8-1 start this season, including six straight victories.\n\nOne of the catalysts has been senior Kestin Richins. The guard is averaging 7.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.0 steals for the Braves.\n\n“Kestin has developed into a leader for our team this year. He has been asked to play in different roles this season and has taken them on, giving 100 percent with each one,” said North Summit coach Aaron Preece.\n\n“He has made shots when needed and also gets the ball to the open player when they have a better shot, which has helped his teammates look for the same. He loves the game and plays every game with heart and hustle, which in turn helps his team play the same.”\n\nRichins enjoyed his best performance of the season last Friday, scoring 22 points in North Summit’s dominant 65-35 win over Valley.\n\nJessica Maynard, Mountain Ridge (Sr.)\n\nJessica Maynard is tearing it up for Mountain Ridge early this season.\n\nThe senior is averaging 20.3 points this season to go along with averaging nearly 10 rebounds per game.\n\n“Jess is an amazing ball player. She can impact the game in a variety of ways on both sides of the ball. On offense she can score inside or space and stretch the floor shooting. Defensively she can defend the other teams best guard on the perimeter, or anchor the defense as our rim protector,” said Mountain Ridge coach Matt Montgomery.\n\nLast week she scored 15 points in a 51-41 win over Davis and then 23 points in a 45-38 win over Lehi.\n\nMontgomery said Maynard is all about the wins.\n\n“But what makes her special is she doesn’t care who scores, she just wants to win. If you leave her open she’ll shoot, if you double her she’s just as happy setting up a teammate. She’s the ultimate team player and leader, and she’s a joy to coach,” said Montgomery.\n\nSean Cannon’s dedication in the pool is paying big dividends this season.\n\nThe junior owns the best time in the entire state in two events this season and ranks in the top 10 in five other events.\n\n“Sean consumes all things swimming, all things made available to him. If there is something written, video, or spoken about swimming, Sean can make it part of his training and convert it into success,” said Canyon View coach Kirt Brown.\n\nA year ago, Cannon was the 3A champ in the 200 free and finished third in the 100 butterfly.\n\nFast forward to this season, and his time of 1:45.99 is the best mark in the entire state six weeks into this season. His time of 21.66 is also the top mark in Utah.\n\nHis other top statewide marks are in the 100 back (second), 100 fly (third) and 200 individual medley (fifth).\n\nLayleigh Turner, Syracuse (So.)\n\nA year after making a big splash as a freshman at Syracuse, Layleigh Turner has picked up right where she left off.\n\nSix weeks into the season, she owns the best time statewide in the 200 free (1:57.04) in addition to ranking in the top five in five other events.\n\nShe owns the second best time in the 500 free and 100 backstroke.\n\n“Layleigh is a dream to coach. She absolutely has the heart of a champion. She just simply refuses to lose and if she does happen to lose a race, she doesn’t let it get her down. She uses it as motivation and works that much harder for the next meet,” said Syracuse coach Kyle Cunningham.\n\n“Not only is she a great swimmer, she’s a great student too and it’s an honor for me to be her coach. I’m grateful to have a front row seat to watch this amazing young woman in action. I have no doubt that she will be successful in anything she decides to do in life”\n\nAs a freshman last year, Turner won the 6A title in the 200 individual medley and finished second in the 100 breaststroke.\n\nKaden Martineau enjoyed a sensational weekend at the Juab Winter Classic dual meets this past weekend.\n\nHe went 8-0 at the tournament at 150 pounds, winning three matches by fall and five by technical fall.\n\n“Kaden has always been a hard worker, but he is especially focused and motivated this year. This week he was able to see the results of his efforts, going 10-0 on the week. We anticipate more success for Kaden as the season progresses. We are grateful for example and leadership on our team,” said Juab coach Joel Holman.\n\nAs a freshman last season, Martineau finished with a 46-12 record and placed third at state at 144 pounds. He’s looking to take the next step this season and win an individual state title.\n\nAlexandra Gates, Cedar Valley (Sr.)\n\nAlexandra Gates ran her record to 9-0 with a great performance at the Corner Canyon Cup last weekend.\n\nGates went 5-0, winning all five matches by fall at 138 pounds. She was named the most outstanding wrestler at the tournament.\n\n“Alex has worked really hard the past year and a half by going to camps and traveling with her club, Champions Wrestling Club, to Western Regionals and nationals. Plus she is a former Teen Miss Eagle Mountain who is fierce on the wrestling ma,” said Cedar Valley coach Erik Gonzalez.\n\nGates is one of the top wrestlers in 6A this year as she looks to build on last year’s 135-pound state title in 5A as she finished the season with a 32-9 record.",

They did just that.\n\nAlperen Sengun missed a game-tying 3 late in OT and the Nuggets held on for the win. Murray finished with 35 points.\n\nHere’s what else stood out from the game.\n\nJokic and the Nuggets starters came out a tad lackadaisical in the 1st quarter, but a wild bench lineup was there to jumpstart Denver‘s offense and defense. An early injury to Peyton Watson (right hip contusion) knocked him out of the 1st half, so it was Zeke Nnaji stepping in on the Nuggets’ second unit. And he held his own.\n\nJonas Valanciunas owned the paint in the 1st half, tallying 8 points on a perfect 4-4 shooting. Tim Hardaway Jr. was aggressive and accurate too. Hardaway finished the 1st half with 10 points.\n\nOverall, the Nuggets went +4 in the non-Jokic minutes in the 1st. They were only +1 in the Jokic minutes.\n\nDenver, behind the bench, shut down the Rockets offense in the 2nd quarter. The Nuggets held the Rockets to 21 points in the 2nd quarter.\n\nA couple no-calls also got the Rockets frustrated. It led to technical fouls on both coach Ime Udoka and Alperen Sengun. It’s what led to a double-digit 1st half lead for the Nuggets. Denver grabbed momentum and was able to lead 58-51 at the break.\n\nJokic and Alperen Sengun battled back and forth for most of the 4th quarter after Valanciunas fouled out around the 9-minute mark. Both bigs hit tough shot after tough shot.\n\nJokic got up to 37 points in the 4th quarter and had a straight-away 3 to win the game as time expired. His shot bounced off the back iron and to overtime we went.",

    "fullText": "Entering their Week 15 meeting, the Pittsburgh Steelers had won 22 consecutive Monday night home games and the Miami Dolphins had lost nine consecutive games with a kickoff temperature colder than 40 degrees.\n\nThose streaks continued as the Steelers defeated the Dolphins 28-15 on Monday night at Acrisure Stadium, where the game started at 17 degrees.\n\nPittsburgh quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed 23-of-27 passes for 224 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. Rodgers had the fourth game for a Steelers quarterback with that many passes that featured a completion rate of 85 percent or higher.\n\nBoth of Rodgers’ TD passes came in the third quarter, when Pittsburgh expanded its 7-3 halftime lead to a 21-3 advantage and started the drive that put the Steelers up 28-3 with 13:01 to play.\n\nThe loss ended Miami’s four-game winning streak and eliminated the Dolphins from playoff contention as they dropped to 6-8.\n\nTime for Miami to bench Tua Tagovailoa? ‘Very rash and shortsighted’\n\nBroncos cornerback Patrick Surtain II: ‘I had to make a play’\n\nMinkah Fitzpatrick goes back to Pittsburgh\n\nFive players from Alabama high schools and colleges got on the field during the Miami-Pittsburgh game:\n\nDolphins linebacker K.J. Britt (Oxford, Auburn) did not record any stats.\n\nSteelers offensive lineman Jack Driscoll (Auburn) dressed for the game but did not play. Pittsburgh elevated Driscoll from its practice squad to make him eligible to play.\n\nMinkah Fitzpatrick (Alabama) started at safety for the Dolphins. Fitzpatrick made six tackles and recorded one tackle for loss. Fitzpatrick left the game in the fourth quarter because of a calf injury.\n\nDolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill (West Alabama) is on injured reserve and not eligible to play.\n\nSteelers defensive tackle Brodric Martin (Northridge, North Alabama) was designated as a game-day inactive.\n\nTua Tagovailoa (Alabama) started at quarterback for the Dolphins.

    "fullText": "Stars’ Mikko Rantanen opens up about collision that injured Darcy Kuemper appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Dallas Stars are one of the best teams in the NHL this season. And they proved as much on Monday night when they defeated the Los Angeles Kings 4-1. However, the game was overshadowed a bit by an incident between Mikko Rantanen and Darcy Kuemper that left the Kings goaltender injured.\n\nDuring an offensive possession for Dallas, Rantanen battled Kings defenseman Brian Dumoulin in front of the net. After a shot on goal, Rantanen ran into Kuemper, sending him to the ice. Kuemper left the game after this, and he did not return to the ice.\n\nDarcy Kuemper has left the game after being bumped into by Mikko Rantanen 🤕\n\nThere was no call on the play besides Dallas' goal being waved off. pic.twitter.com/u2mIYIuZZb\n\n— Gino Hard (@GinoHard_) December 16, 2025\n\nAfter the game, Rantanen was asked about this incident. He told the media that he had no intention of hitting the Los Angeles netminder. And he hoped Kuemper wasn’t seriously injured as a result of their collision.\n\n“Yeah, it was unfortunate. I was just driving the net, and thought my route was top of the blue [crease]. Dumoulin was there kinda pushing me that way. I didn’t see he [Kuemper] was top of the blue. Unfortunate to see him go down. I told him right away, ‘my bad.’ Hopefully he doesn’t miss too much time,” the Stars star said, via team reporter Robert Tiffin.\n\nThis is not the first controversial moment Rantanen has been involved in this year. He delivered a hit that left New York Islanders defenseman Alexander Romanov injured earlier this year. Two games later, he also hit Calgary Flames forward Matt Coronato, causing him to briefly leave that contest.\n\nRantanen was suspended for the hit on Coronato. Whether any discipline comes as a result of this play remains to be seen. For now, the focus is on Kuemper’s health. Hopefully, Kuemper can return to the ice with no complications sooner rather than later.",

    "description": "Cameron Heyward explains the accountability culture fueling the Steelers after their dominant Monday night win over the Dolphins.",
    "fullText": "Steelers’ Cameron Heyward breaks down Pittsburgh’s accountability culture after MNF win appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers delivered a statement win on Monday Night Football, shaking off adversity and asserting control in a 28-15 victory over the Miami Dolphins (6-8) at Acrisure Stadium.\n\nAfter the game, veteran defensive leader Cameron Heyward appeared on SportsCenter with Scott Van Pelt, where he was asked about quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ leadership and what sparked the offensive turnaround.\n\n“I think there’s a level of accountability he brings to the group, the way he challenges guys, the way he communicates,” Heyward explained. “There’s a lot of stuff you see during practice, but then off the field, he’s working with guysmaking sure they’re, you know, it’s not just the offensive line, it’s the wide receivers, the tight ends, they all play a big role in what he wants to do. And he just keeps talking about it.”\n\nHeyward’s comments highlighted that Rodgers’ impact goes beyond what fans see on game day. Despite being new to Pittsburgh, Rodgers has embedded himself into every position group, reinforcing expectations and standards across the offense.\n\nPlaying in frigid conditions, Pittsburgh initially appeared headed for a conservative, grind-it-out contest. Instead, the game flipped dramatically just before halftime.\n\nBeginning with their final possession of the first half, the Steelers’ offense caught fire. That offensive surge turned a tight game into a commanding win and reinforced the Steelers’ identity as a team built on collective responsibility.\n\nVan Pelt followed up by asking whether Rodgers’ demanding style earns him leeway with teammates. Heyward made it clear that accountability runs in both directions.\n\n“I think that and then we can hold him [Aaron Rodgers] accountable too,” Heyward added. “We let him know when he’s playing like c*** too. “I think we all know we all have to play at a different level to games in this league and you know, it starts with myself…We all have to be accountable, we know we’re not running from that and we have a mature group that really talks about that.”\n\n\"Well, we let [Aaron Rodgers] know when he's playing like crap too.\"\n\nCameron Heyward talks about how the Steelers keep each other accountable 😂 pic.twitter.com/YDdNohXpJQ\n\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) December 16, 2025\n\nThat mindset was evident on the field. Rodgers delivered precise throws, including a key touchdown pass to DK Metcalf that effectively sealed the game. The veteran field general finished the game with 224 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, the Steelers’ defense overwhelmed Miami, punctuated by Heyward’s punishing sack of Tua Tagovailoa, he also recorded five tackles in this game. The win pushed Pittsburgh to 8-6 and strengthened its grip on the AFC North race, while Miami’s playoff hopes faded.",

    "description": "South Korea’s women added to the trophy cabinet twice in 2025, but underwhelming results in several international friendlies leave Shin Sangwoo and his squad with a point to prove at next year’s A...",
    "fullText": "South Korea’s women added to the trophy cabinet twice in 2025, but underwhelming results in several international friendlies leave Shin Sangwoo and his squad with a point to prove at next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup.\n\nThe year started on a high note for the South Korean women’s national team with victory in February’s Pink Ladies Cup. Korea won all three of their matches and did so with a better goal difference than Russia to claim the title. Sure, it wasn’t the most glorious win, given the calibre of the teams involved and the status (or lack thereof) of the tournament itself, but it was a win nonetheless, and the squad returned from the UAE with a nice shiny platter to put in the KFA trophy cabinet.\n\nIn May, Shin Sangwoo’s warriors were off to Australia for a pair of friendlies against the hosts of next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup. Buoyed by large and enthusiastic home crowds, the Matildas proved tough opponents. The results — a 1-0 loss and a 2-0 loss — weren’t terrible, but did lay bare a weakness in Korea’s goalscoring department, the team’s inability to get across the line (or at least, to do so in the right goal) damaging their confidence.\n\nThere were two more friendlies in late spring, this time on home soil as Korea played host to Colombia. The first match in Incheon ended as a 1-0 loss; Korea did well to hold their own fast and physical opponents. Despite the frustrating lack of goals, the home fans were treated to a moment of elation as Kim Minjeong made a cracking save to deny Usme’s penalty. There was further joy a few days later in Yongin as Jung Minyoung finally put an end to the goal drought just two minutes into her international debut. An unfortunate own goal from Kim Jinhui brought the sides level before the final whistle, but on some level, the friendlies were a success. Manager Shin experimented with formations, and everyone in the squad got minutes on the pitch, with the exception of third goalkeeper Woo Seobin.\n\nIn July, South Korea hosted the EAFF E-1 Football Championship (East Asian Cup), with both men’s and women’s competitions happening in venues around Gyeonggi-do in what must have been a busy week for those guys who shake the giant Taegukgi. The tournament saw Korea’s women take on some of their toughest competitors in the region. Against China, the final score was 2-2; Ji Soyun’s dramatic injury-time equaliser earned her a nomination for the KFA’s goal of the year. Another late equaliser, this time from Jeong Dabin, made it 1-1 against fierce rivals Japan. As Japan and China faced each other on the final matchday, a win for either team would secure them the title, but yet another stalemate in that match opened the door for Korea to swoop in and claim the victory, which they did with an assured 2-0 victory over Chinese Taipei (Taiwan).\n\nThus, Korea’s women lifted the East Asian Cup for the first time in 20 years, proving in the process that they can still compete with the regional football powerhouses despite a relative lack of investment and development in the women’s game. More accuracy in front of goal could have helped deliver a more decisive victory, but a trophy is a trophy, not to mention a huge confidence booster.\n\nThere were no A matches in the October international window due to the National Sports Festival, the KFA electing to avoid clashes so that the squads of the eight WK League clubs wouldn’t be left depleted. The national team still made headlines in the autumn as it emerged that several players had demanded equal treatment with the men’s team, allegedly threatening to boycott A matches unless their conditions, including business class flights for international fixtures, were met. The news divided more reasonable fans and provided ammunition for keyboard warriors who seem to think that national pride would be better served by defunding and disbanding the women’s team than supporting the Taeguk Warriors in women’s competitions.\n\nIt remains unclear in which section of the plane the squad travelled for their latest excursion, a trip to Europe for friendlies against Wales and the Netherlands. Shin should have fancied his team’s chances in Malaga as they lined up against a Welsh team on an 11-match winless run (spoiler alert: now 12), but it was his side that conceded first; Kim Minji scored her international debut in the second half to bring things level. After appearing the weaker side for much of the match, Korea seemed to gain some momentum after the goal, but it was too late.\n\nThe Netherlands were always going to be difficult opponents for Korea. In fact, Korea could learn a thing or two from the Dutch model of rapidly developing the domestic women’s football environment with the explicit core aim of improving the national team. WSL all-time top goalscorer Vivianne Miedema completed a hat-trick within 35 minutes; her teammates made it 5-0 by half time. The second half was goalless, but the damage was already done. The scoreline in this match, and England’s 8-0 thumping of China in front of 74,611 fans at Wembley a few days earlier, serve as a stark reminder that the top teams in Asia still have catching up to do when it comes to the women’s game.\n\nConceding five goals in 45 minutes and scraping a draw against a lower-ranking team on bad form: these are not results that inspire confidence, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and this pudding — next year's Asian Cup — is still in the oven, raw in the middle.\n\nUnder Shin Sangwoo the women's national team is making progress. He has used this year's A matches to play around with the squad, trying out several formations and starting lineups. Goalkeeper Kim Minjeong has solidified her place in the first eleven. A much-discussed \"new generation\" of players has been welcomed into the fold, with 12 players receiving their first senior call-up and 17 making their international debut this year. More of Korea's squad than ever before are playing regularly for fully professional clubs in the top leagues of Europe and North America.\n\n(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)\n\nLooking ahead to the Asian Cup, there is still work to do (isn't there always?). South Korea's women need to be more effective in front of goal. Goals, especially early goals, will boost the squad's confidence as they progress through the tournament and face tougher opposition. Players need to avoid becoming downcast when chasing a result, and trust themselves and their footballing ability rather than resorting to messy tackles and avoidable fouls.\n\nMental toughness will be key in the group stage as Korea are set to face hosts Australia. The Matildas have beaten them twice in 2025, and the home crowd will only be more animated for this major tournament. They are also joined in Group A by Iran and the Philippines. The former didn't make it past the group stage in their Asian Cup debut in 2022, while the latter became the underdog story of that tournament, securing their first-ever qualification for the FIFA Women's World Cup by reaching the semi-finals; they were beaten to the final by South Korea.\n\nNext year's Asian Cup has been a clear driving force behind the women's national team activities in 2025. It's a natural focal point when reflecting on this year, and South Korea's performance at the tournament may well alter the 2025 narrative when looking back in a few months' time. With drastic changes coming to the WK League in 2026 and the national team undergoing a generational shift, women's football in Korea is at a crossroads — let's hope this year's trophies are a sign of things to come.",

    "fullText": "Rams vs. Seahawks prediction, odds, pick for Week 16 Thursday Night Football appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nFollowing a wild week of upsets and new storylines in Week 15, Week 16 of the NFL season will begin with this upcoming divisional tilt on Thursday Night Football. The Los Angeles Rams (11-3) will visit the Seattle Seahawks (11-3) as the two sides battle for the top of the NFC West. Check our NFL odds series for the Rams-Seahawks prediction and pick.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams continue their run atop the NFC standings with their latest 41-34 win over the Detroit Lions in Week 15. This tilt against the Seahawks will be their most critical remaining game in deciding the division, but they’ve already secured their berth to the playoffs.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks beat the Indianapolis Colts 18-16 in Week 15, marking their fourth-consecutive win. They’ve won eight of their last nine games with their lone loss during that stretch coming at the hands of Los Angeles. They’ll hope to even the rivalry as the home underdogs.\n\nNFL Odds courtesy of DraftKings\n\n*practice status as of 12/15/2025*\n\nLos Angeles: WR Jordan Whittington, Limited (back) / OL Alaric Jackson, Limited (ankle) / DE Braden Fiske, DNP (ankle) / WR Davante Adams, DNP (hamstring) / S Jaylen McCollough, DNP (illness)\n\nSeattle: LB DeMarcus Lawrence, Limited (quad) / WR Cody White, Limited (abdomen) / OT Charles Cross, DNP (hamstring)\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are 5-2 at home. The Los Angeles Rams are 5-2 on the road.\n\nThe Seahawks are 10-4 ATS overall, 4-3 ATS at home. The Rams are 10-4 ATS overall, 5-2 ATS on the road.\n\nThe Rams are 3-1 against NFC West opponents. The Seahawks are 2-2.\n\nThe Rams are 7-3 outright, 8-2 ATS in their last 10 games against the Seahawks.\n\nBoth teams are 7-2 ATS in their last nine games.\n\nSeattle is 0-5 ATS in their last five home games against the Rams.\n\nThe Rams are 11-2 ATS in their last 13 games on the road.\n\nThe most significant tidbit for either team will be the potential loss of Rams’ WR Davante Adams, who went down with a hamstring injury in Week 15. He leads the NFL in receiving touchdowns (14) and has been an integral part of the added success for QB Matthew Stafford and the busiest WR in football Puka Nacua. The injury to Adams will certainly benefit opposing defenses as they can key their efforts in on Nacua, but it was notably TE Colby Parkinson with a career day against the Lions. With all the weapons around him, Matthew Stafford and this offense are poised for a deep run in the playoffs.\n\nThe Seahawks, who fell to the Rams 22-19 five weeks ago, should rest easy knowing they lost by just a field goal despite QB Sam Darnold’s four interceptions. Their defense played well for the most part given how much time they spent on the field, so this second game at home should see a better showing from the Seattle offense. WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba is making his case for the NFC’s best offensive player as his connection with Sam Darnold has been great to watch all season.\n\nThis Rams’ defense, while solid all season, had a much more lenient effort against the Lions in Week 15. They allowed 30 or more points to their opponent for just the third time all season, the second occasion in the last three weeks. They’re 1-2 when allowing 30+ points on defense, so silencing this Seahawks’ dual-threat offense will be of utmost importance.\n\nWith the injuries seen on the Rams’ offense, expect both defenses to have a significant impact in this game. The Seahawks’ defense ranks fifth league-wide with 22 total takeaways, while the Rams are right behind them with 21 total takeaways. Neither quarterback has been perfect up to this point, so don’t be surprised if we’re in for a low-scoring game on the short week for both teams.\n\nThis matchup will have everything at-stake and while both teams are likely heading for the playoffs, their race atop the NFC West division has been the tightest we’ve seen in all the league. The Rams were the more impressive team in Week 15, but it came at a cost as several key players were banged-up in the process.\n\nThe Seahawks certainly didn’t look their best against Philip Rivers and the Indianapolis Colts, but it was a tough game to scheme against with the unpredictability of a new quarterback under center. I expect the Seahawks to look much better during this game as their defense rises to the occasion against Matthew Stafford. For our final pick, we’ll take the Seattle Seahawks to win a defensive battle at home in this one.\n\nFinal Rams-Seahawks Thursday Night Football Prediction & Pick: Seattle Seahawks +1.5 (-122); UNDER 44.5 (-115)",

    "fullText": "DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic had 39 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his NBA-leading 12th triple-double of the season as the Denver Nuggets outlasted the Houston Rockets 128-125 in overtime on Monday night in a matchup of two of the top three teams in the Western Conference standings.\n\nJamal Murray added 35 points for Denver, including six of his team’s 11 points in overtime. Murray made 14 of his 15 free-throw attempts.\n\nThe win was the Nuggets’ fifth in a row and was their first home victory since Nov. 8.\n\nThe final 1:40 of regulation had four ties and four lead changes, a stretch capped off by a free throw by Murray that tied the game with 2.3 seconds remaining after an away-from-play foul on Houston’s Amen Thompson. Denver retained possession after the free throw, but a 3-point attempt by Jokic from the top of the key was long.\n\nThe Nuggets took a 124-117 lead after a Spencer Jones 3 with 2:59 remaining in overtime, but the Rockets clawed back, getting within three with the ball and 13 seconds remaining. Alperen Sengun missed a contested 24-foot 3 with 4.9 seconds remaining, allowing Denver to hold on for the victory.\n\nSengun paced the Rockets with 33 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first triple-double of the season. Kevin Durant added 25 points, seven assists, five rebounds and five blocks for Houston, which lost its third consecutive road game.\n\nA Nuggets team that was already down two starters in Aaron Gordon (hamstring) and Christian Braun (ankle) played much of the game without starting guard Peyton Watson, who left six minutes into the first quarter after suffering a right trunk contusion.\n\nRockets: At the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday.\n\nNuggets: Host the Orlando Magic on Thursday.\n\nAP NBA: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "description": "After an unlikely offensive explosion in Week 15, Mike Tomlin gives props to Steelers running back Kenneth Gainwell after MNF.",
    "fullText": "Steelers’ Mike Tomlin breaks down Kenneth Gainwell’s MNF breakout game appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nWhile the Pittsburgh Steelers had a number of heroes in their Monday Night Football win over the Miami Dolphins, from Aaron Rodgers, to Jonnu Smith, DK Metcalf, and their defensive line, one player who stepped up in a major way was one of the more unlikely members of Arthur Smith’s offense: Kenneth Gainwell.\n\nThat’s right, in a game where Jaylen Warren was active after being questionable right up to gametime, Gainwell exploded in a major way, amassing 126 yards between the ground and the passing game to lead the Steelers to their eighth win of the season.\n\nAsked about Gainwell’s huge game against a team teetering on the edge of playoff elimination, Tomlin celebrated the 2025 free agent addition for seemingly always bringing something to the table when his team needs it most.\n\n“When things are less than ideal, that’s what we’ve come to expect from him. Jalen missed Dublin, for example, and he played big out there,” Tomlin explained. “He brings that energy, man. He’s a football player, and we’re thankful to have him on our team.”\n\nOriginally drafted in the fifth round out of the 2021 NFL Draft out of Memphis, Gainwell was an instrumental part of multiple Philadelphia Eagles teams with Super Bowl aspirations, including the team that actually got it done earlier this year against the Kansas City Chiefs. Landing in Pittsburgh in free agency after the season, Gainwell has rapidly become a favorite of Rodgers, where his pass-catching abilities have allowed him to become a reliable outlet pass when his early reads are locked up.\n\nShould opposing teams put a little more respect on Gainwell’s name after his huge showing? Probably, as with a playoff push rapidly approaching, it’s clear Gainwell will only become a bigger part of the Steelers’ offense down the stretch.\n\n#Steelers Mike Tomlin.

    "fullText": "Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic posts eye-popping stat line despite fouling out vs. Rockets appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nIn a barnburner of a matchup between two of the best and most physically-imposing teams in the NBA in the Denver Nuggets and the Houston Rockets, it was the former that came out on top, 128-125, in overtime. It was a back-and-forth affair that saw incredible shot-making come from both teams, especially towards the end of regulation. But come overtime, the Rockets lost steam and the Nuggets did just enough to come away with the win.\n\nNikola Jokic was imposing his will all night long, finishing with yet another insane stat line (which is now getting pedestrian by his standards) of 39 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists. The Nuggets star fouled out in the end, but even foul trouble wasn’t enough to slow down the three-time MVP in his domination of the Rockets.\n\nJokic and Alperen Sengun were locked in a battle that seemed very personal. The Rockets star was looking to snatch Jokic’s crown, but the Nuggets star had every answer in the bag, as expected of a player as great as he is.\n\nSengun recorded a triple double of his own, putting up 33 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, and he’s closer to the caliber of player Jokic is than some would think. Nonetheless, the Nuggets star is arguably the best player in the league at the moment, and everyone saw why.\n\nThe good news is that Jokic and Jamal Murray are both healthy, so Denver has the foundational pieces of the two-man game that has been the cornerstone of their offense for nearly a decade. But with Peyton Watson having to exit early with a right trunk contusion, the Nuggets now have three key cogs in Watson, Christian Braun, and Aaron Gordon currently on the mend.\n\nThe Nuggets will now look to improve their 19-6 record when they return to action on Thursday night in a tussle against the Orlando Magic.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City were clinical in the final third in their 3-nil win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday. Erling Haaland’s brace and Phil Foden’s second-half strike saw Pep Guardiola’s side break open a tough fixture against a quality team. Crystal Palace had their chances at Selhurst Park but they failed to put any of them away. While at the other end of the pitch, City took their chances and left London with a valuable three points. Looking at Manchester City’s attack, they seemingly have a real point of difference to their rivals which could be crucial as this season unfolds.\n\nIt has emerged as this season has progressed which players form Manchester City’s best attack. Erling Haaland, Rayan Cherki and Jeremy Doku have been Pep Guardiola’s preferred front three. Phil Foden can also be added to this equation given the fact that he has scored 10 goals this season and his best attributes are often on display in the final third. What City have that their rivals do not is a blend of pace, power, guile and trickery. Each of Manchester City’s attacking players complements the other. It gives them a consistent weapon that their rivals seemingly do not.\n\nManchester City’s attack is even more dangerous when you factor in the runs made by Matheus Nunes and Nico O’Reilly from the full-back positions. Pep Guardiola’s side is also now scoring from set-pieces which completes the picture. What we saw in Manchester City’s win over Crystal Palace is that City’s attack can decide games ruthlessly.\n\nCrystal Palace had their chances at Selhurst Park. But they didn’t take them. Erling Haaland took his first chance against Crystal Palace. He headed home a superb Matheus Nunes cross to give City a first-half lead. Rayan Cherki drove at the Palace defence to set up Phil Foden’s second-half strike. Erling Haaland put away a penalty with ease in the 89th minute to wrap up three points for City. Although City didn’t create a host of chances at Selhurst Park, they ruthlessly put away those that came their way. It helped them pick up a crucial three points and showed that City have a quality that their rivals do not at this point of the season.\n\nAs of right now it does appear that Manchester City and Arsenal could be battling it out for the Premier League title. Aston Villa cannot be discounted at this stage. Whether or not they can sustain their impressive form remains to be seen.\n\nArsenal’s strengths are their defence and their prowess at set-pieces. Mikel Arteta’s side has them as the foundation of their play. They do have quality throughout their squad but it seems that those are their strongest attributes. Whether or not Arsenal’s set-piece prowess is sustainable across a full season remains to be seen. In contrast to the strength of Mikel Arteta’s side, you do sense that Manchester City’s attack can sustain their impressive form and efficiency. Erling Haaland’s goal-scoring prowess won’t fade. Jeremy Doku, as long as he isn’t injured, looks to have gone up a level. Phil Foden is an elite player and has returned to form this season. Rayan Cherki has adjusted to life at Manchester City quicker than expected. There is no reason why Manchester City’s attack cannot prove to be the difference across this season.\n\nThe Manchester City attack looks to be their point of difference this season. Pep Guardiola has a variety of weapons to unleash and it does seem that City’s attack could be key to them picking up extra points across this Premier League season. They did that against Crystal Palace and you do sense that it won’t be the last time that Manchester City’s attack helps them pick up points in tough matches this season.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca has given a blunt response to how his relationship is with the Chelsea board.\n\nIt all came out over the last few days and it has become the big story around Chelsea right now.\n\nAfter the Everton win on Saturday, Maresca went on a rant in his post match presser where he said he had just had the “worst 48 hours” since joining Chelsea.\n\nHe said he had had a lack of support, but didn’t reveal any more when pressed. So of course everyone wanted to know more.\n\nThe Blues boss doubled down on his comments yesterday in the press conference ahead of the League Cup game tonight. Or at least that is what we thought.\n\nIt seems he was pressed more about his relationship with the sporting directors and the owners in the embargoed section of the interview that was released late last night, and he decided to actually answer that question.\n\nPaul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart with Behdad Eghbali.\n\nAs cited by The Evening Standard, when sked how strong his relationship with the Chelsea co-owner Behdad Eghbali and co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart is, he replied: “It’s ok, it’s good.”\n\nPushed on whether it is as good as it has always been, he added: “I think so, yes.”\n\nMaresca was also asked whether he feels the head coach is the most important figure at Chelsea, or indeed at any football club.\n\n“I think the ones that put the money in are, not the manager,” he said. “It is the owner. I think they are the most important people in a football club.\n\n“The manager is an important part but is not the most important one.”",

    "description": "A fierce overtime battle saw Houston push Denver to the absolute limit. This clash showcased incredible offensive firepower and a controversial finish.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets opened their road trip in Denver on Friday night with a loss, but if this was meant to be a tone-setter for the next stretch, it did exactly that. This was the first of six straight road games, and it came against a Nuggets team sitting at 18-6 and second in the Western Conference, desperate to snap a four-game home losing streak. Houston entered at 16–6, third in the West, 8-4 on the road, and still leading the league in second-chance shots. Both teams had three days of rest. The building was packed. The energy was loud. And the game felt like it mattered from the jump.\n\nDenver may be a top-tier first-quarter team, but it was Houston that set the early tone. Alperen Şengün came out dominant, putting up 10 points and two assists by the halfway mark of the first quarter. The Rockets controlled pace, moved bodies, and forced Denver to work for everything. Despite Nikola Jokic and Şengün both being part of the rare group of centers averaging seven or more assists, it was Houston that finished the first quarter up six.\n\nThe second quarter is where momentum began to wobble. Denver rattled off an 8-0 run as Houston struggled to finish clean looks. Reed Sheppard started the night ice cold, going 0-for-6 before finally knocking down his first bucket- a three. The Rockets still controlled much of the half, but the final three minutes slipped away. At the break, Denver led 58-51, with both Kevin Durant and Şengün sitting at 14 points apiece. Ime Udoka picked up a technical arguing with officials, and the tone of the game was officially set: physical, emotional, and unforgiving.\n\nHouston responded the right way in the third. The Rockets came out hot, reclaiming the lead and marking the tenth lead change of the night. At that point, Durant had missed just two shots all game, sitting at 5-for-7, while Josh Okogie was a perfect 5-for-5. Bruce Brown’s reckless finish resulted in a flagrant foul on Durant, sending him to the line. Durant continued doing what he does best- drawing contact, living at the stripe, and knocking down that familiar midrange fadeaway. Okogie added an insane dunk and nine points in the quarter, and an 8-0 Houston run capped by a steal and Sheppard dunk swung momentum back again.\n\nThe fourth quarter turned into a grind. Bodies flying under the rim. Jokic living at the free-throw line. Things got personal between Jokic and Şengün. Leads changed hands possession by possession. With 1:30 left, it was tied at 109. Then 112. Then 115 with 20 seconds remaining. Shot-making reached absurd levels. Every seat in the building was standing.\n\nŞengün gave Houston a one-point lead with two seconds left after the Rockets went a perfect 5-for-5 on their final possessions. A controversial trip was called on Amen Thompson, Houston challenged, and lost. One free throw sent the game to overtime.\n\nIn OT, Jokic picked up his fifth foul on Şengün- both now at five- and Denver opened with a 3-0 run. Durant sent Jokic to the line again before Jokic fouled Reed Sheppard and was ejected after an unsuccessful Denver challenge. Houston called timeout down three with 6.8 seconds left. That was as close as it would get.\n\nJokic finished with his twelfth triple-double of the season: 39 points, 15 rebounds, 10 assists, shooting 48-percent from the field and 55.6-percent from deep. Jamal Murray added 35 points and five assists. For Houston, Şengün posted a monster triple-double of his own with 33 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, shooting just under 52-percent. Durant added 25 points, seven assists, and five blocks. Jabari Smith Jr. provided balance, knocking down four of six from three.\n\nHouston didn’t leave Denver with a win, but they left with proof. This road trip just started, and if this game was the bar, the Rockets aren’t backing down from anyone.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United played out a hugely entertaining 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in their Premier League game at Old Trafford on Monday.\n\nThe hosts should have won, considering they had taken the lead on three separate occasions, but Ruben Amorim’s confusing tweak at the back did not help the team, nor his young defenders.\n\nThe draw means the Red Devils are currently sixth in the league standings, two points off the top four. However, things will get trickier from here on in.\n\nThe head coach will be without his key attacking duo, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo, as both will depart for the Africa Cup of Nations. Noussair Mazraoui has already left, and both Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain sidelined.\n\nAnd in further bad news, Casemiro has also been ruled out of the match against Aston Villa next Sunday as he saw his fifth individual yellow against the Cherries.\n\nHe saw yellow for a foul on Marcus Tavernier in the second-half, who subsequently scored from the resultant free-kick to hand the visitors a 3-2 lead.\n\nFive yellow cards mean an automatic one-game suspension, and the Brazilian missing out against an in-form Villa means Amorim will have a mountain to climb at Villa Park.\n\nThe former Real Madrid superstar scored against the Cherries, and has generally looked much better as compared to last season, partly due to the team playing only once a week.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who the Portuguese tactician turns to in Casemiro’s absence. He does not seem to rate Kobbie Mainoo in a deeper role, and he has openly criticised Manuel Ugarte this season.\n\nThe Uruguayan has started three times in the league this season, and in all three occasions, the 20-time English league champions have come out on the losing side. He also has been linked with a January exit.\n\nWith Unai Emery’s side winning each of their last six games, Amorim will be hoping for an inspired showing from his available players.\n\nAfter his encouraging cameo, fans will be hoping Mainoo gets the nod in place of Casemiro.\n\nFeature image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Fabrizio Romano confirms that Liverpool have a 'genuine interest' in pushing for a £65m deal. The Reds are putting plans in motion.\n\nLiverpool's January plans are in motion with just a few weeks before the transfer window opens. It's one that they have to get right after struggling to put together a functional team over the summer.\n\nThe Reds spent an awful lot of money - record-breaking amounts - in an attempt to overhaul and improve a title-winning squad. However, they haven't really achieved that.\n\nMore work needs to happen, it seems, and they'll give that a go in the winter window. A centre-back almost certainly needs to arrive, for instance, after Giovanni Leoni's injury.\n\nBut that's not all. Liverpool also need to deal with the fact they never replaced Luis Diaz on the wing, while Mo Salah also doesn't have proper backup - a problem given he's off to the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nIt sounds as though the club may have chosen the answer to that problem, however.\n\nFabrizio Romano confirms that Liverpool do have ‘genuine interest’ in signing Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth. The Ghanian is expected to leave the Cherries in 2026 thanks to a release clause in his contract.\n\nThat clause is worth £65m, per the BBC, but drops down a bit next summer. Semenyo is very much available, then - but Liverpool are far from the only team keeping an eye on that.\n\n“[There’s] genuine interest but there are more clubs also keen,” says Romano to Give Me Sport. \"It’s going to be a race also with more sides, depending on what the player wants to do.”",

    "fullText": "Alperen Şengün vs. Nikola Jokic was exactly what it was supposed to be — and somehow still more than that. Two centers running offenses, bending defenses, and turning a regular-season game in December into something that felt personal by the fourth quarter.\n\nŞengün set the tone early. Ten points and two assists halfway through the first quarter, controlling pace against a Nuggets team that’s one of the best first-quarter groups in the league. Denver came in hot, winners of four straight on the road, but Houston punched first. And a big reason they could was Şengün’s comfort operating as a hub, not just a scorer. That’s the shared DNA here— both Jokic and Şengün are part of a rare class of centers averaging seven-plus assists, and the game flowed through them every possession.\n\nJokic answered the way Jokic always does. Scoring, rebounding, passing— all of it effortless and relentless. By the end of the night, he had his twelfth triple-double of the season with 39 points, 15 rebounds, and ten assists, shooting efficiently from everywhere on the floor. Şengün matched him punch for punch, finishing with a 33-point triple-double of his own on just under 52-percent shooting.\n\nAnd then it got physical. Fouls piled up. Trips to the line became inevitable. Things got personal under the rim. Both players picked up five fouls. Every possession mattered. Every touch felt loaded.\n\nThis wasn’t about flash. It was about control. About two centers dictating tempo, forcing decisions, and dragging entire defenses into uncomfortable places. The Nuggets survived it. The Rockets didn’t.\n\nBut if this matchup told us anything, it’s that Şengün belongs in these conversations",

    "fullText": "Ben Roethlisberger walks back controversial Mike Tomlin take originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger clarified comments he made earlier this month regarding Mike Tomlin’s future with the Steelers. On his podcast, Roethlisberger seemed to suggest that it might be time for the Steelers to move on from Tomlin at the end of the current campaign.\n\nHowever, Roethlisberger claimed that he was simply saying that Tomlin has the right to move on if he wans to, not that the Steelers should move on from him.\n\n\"Just because I said there's a time for some new things, that's just saying that I think Coach Tomlin -- if he wants to move on, he has every right to move on, it's not they should,\" Roethlisberger said, via ESPN. \"It's up to him, and he's earned that right. If he wants to do something else, he can and he should and we should honor him whenever that time comes. Maybe he wants to coach here for another 10 years, that's fine too.\"\n\nRoethlisbereger’s initial comments came amid a wave of calls for the Steelers to part ways with Tomlin, who has been the head coach in Pittsburgh since 2007.\n\n“It’s being talked about around here a lot. Maybe it’s time,” Roethlisberger said at the time. “Maybe it’s ‘clean house’ time. Maybe it is. … And I like Coach Tomlin. I have a lot of respect for Coach Tomlin, but maybe it’s best for him, too. Maybe a fresh start for him is what’s best, whether that’s in the pros (or not).”\n\nThe Steelers have won two straight games since those original remarks, so perhaps that contributed to Roethlisberger’s decision to couch his comments. The Steelers currently hold pole position in the AFC North, and they have a 61 percent of qualifying for postseason play for a third consecutive season.\n\nBut, the criticism when it comes to Tomlin is based around his lack of postseason success as of late. The Steelers haven’t won a playoff game since 2016 when they lost in the AFC Championship to the New England Patriots. So, simply securing a playoff spot likely won’t silence Tomlin’s detractors. Only a postseason win, or two, will do that.",

    "fullText": "Australia have opted against recalling batter Usman Khawaja for the vital third Ashes Test – a match Ben Stokes has called the most important game in his time as England captain.\n\nEngland, 2-0 down after defeats in the first two Tests, must win in Adelaide to keep their hopes of regaining the urn alive.\n\nDefeat would mean a fourth successive series loss in Australia, extend England's run without winning the Ashes to at least 12 years and heap significant pressure on the tourists' management.\n\nThe positions of Stokes, head coach Brendon McCullum and managing director Rob Key would all come under significant scrutiny.\n\n\"Throughout my career I've been involved in quite a few big moments. This is another one and I'm really, really looking forward to it,\" Stokes told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I've enjoyed the build-up, I've enjoyed the pressure of what this game means. As it's come closer and closer, it's become a lot easier. That's how I deal with big things and big moments – look at it front on, take it on and deal with all the emotions that come with it.\n\n\"What else are you supposed to do? Don't let the moment overcome me or feel like it's going to control me. I'll go out, put all that stuff to one side and do what I need to do in every situation I get put in, and try my absolute best.\"\n\nPat Cummins will return to lead Australia after missing the first two Tests as he recovered from a back problem.\n\nPace bowler Cummins and off-spinner Nathan Lyon are added to the Australia team that won the second Test in Brisbane, replacing Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett.\n\nIt means no return for opener Khawaja, who missed the Test at the Gabba because of back spasms. Khawaja turns 39 on Thursday and may have played the last match of an 85-Test career.\n\nTravis Head and Jake Weatherald will continue as the opening partnership\n\nAustralia were 2-0 ahead in the last Ashes in the UK in 2023, only for England to fight back to draw 2-2.\n\nCummins said his team have learned a \"few lessons\" from that experience and was also adamant he is fit enough to bowl without restrictions in Adelaide.\n\nThe 32-year-old has not played since the tour of West Indies in July after scans detected the back issue.\n\nMatch fitness could be crucial in the high temperatures that are forecast for when the match starts on Wednesday (23:30 GMT Tuesday).\n\n\"I had 16 weeks completely off bowling, made sure the bone heals well and from there it's ramping up,\" said Cummins.\n\n\"Normally you ramp up over maybe three or four months, but that would have meant missing the Ashes.\n\n\"We set on a pretty aggressive plan to get up in six or seven weeks. I haven't had any hiccups. I'm feeling great, probably better than I would have thought. The back has healed well, so, here we are.\"\n\nAustralia XI for third Ashes Test: Travis Head, Jake Weatherald, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Pat Cummins (captain), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland.\n\nEngland XI: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (captain), Jamie Smith, Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Josh Tongue.\n\nListen to the Test Match Special preview podcast\n\nBarking out orders: Stokes wants England to 'show a bit of dog'\n\nIn the aftermath of the defeat in the second Test in Brisbane, Stokes said his dressing room is \"no place for weak men\".\n\nEngland have spent part of the time since that loss on holiday in Noosa, then had three days of training in Adelaide.\n\nThe tourists have made one change to their side, with Josh Tongue coming in for fellow pace bowler Gus Atkinson. Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir has again been overlooked in favour of all-rounder Will Jacks.\n\nAll-rounder Stokes took over as captain in 2022 and his partnership with McCullum yielded 10 wins in their first 11 matches in charge.\n\nAfter those first 11 games, England have won 16 and lost 15 of their next 33. They have not won any of their five-Test series against Australia or India.\n\nSince pace bowler Mark Wood was ruled out of the series with a knee problem, Stokes remains as one of only four members of the England squad to have been part of a previous Ashes tour.\n\nThe 34-year-old has suggested that some of the newcomers to Australia had struggled with the atmosphere of the series.\n\n\"I've got an understanding that quite a few guys in the dressing room won't have that to fall back on,\" said Stokes. \"What I feel like I've had to do is fall back on my own experiences, and voice that to the group.\"\n\nDefeats in Ashes tours often bring sweeping changes to England teams. A loss in Adelaide would not only heap pressure onto Stokes, McCullum and Key, but also raise questions about the international futures of a number of players.\n\n\"I've probably used my voice more than I have at any time in the past three and a half years,\" said Stokes.\n\n\"We are in a situation where we know we need to win three games. There are a few things I felt the group needed to hear, but also a few things I felt like I needed to say to be able to go out there with a very clear head about this week.\n\n\"I've definitely left no stone unturned in terms of the mental side of the game, and what we're going into.\n\n\"Expectations around what we want to see this week – I've spoken a lot about fight, determination and grit over the last couple of days. I hope we're going to see a completely different thing, purely because of the situation we find ourselves in here.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Poor start to the game set the tone; Predators were quicker to pucks most of the night; second period reared its ugly head again; Dvorsky's first multi-goal, point game of NHL career a positive, as was seeing Kelly Chase's inspirational speech",
    "fullText": "ST. LOUIS – Sometimes, there are greater things in life that a game.\n\nYes, the St. Louis Blues lost yet again, and they lost for the second time in five days to the Nashville Predators, 5-2, at Enterprise Center on Monday (and we’ll get into it in observations, of course), but on a night when the Blues honored Hockey Fights Cancer Night and if you missed Kelly Chase’s speech in the first period, you need to take a moment to see it, as it happened right after Blued captain Brayden Schenn and Nashville’s Nic Hague fought for that purpose alone:\n\nWe all stand with you, @Chasenpucks39.#HockeyFightsCancer | @SitemanCenter pic.twitter.com/XDeYfv0fsy\n\n— St. Louis Blues (@StLouisBlues) December 16, 2025\n\nAs for the game itself, the Blues (12-15-7) got goals from Dalibor Dvorsky, his first multi-goal and multi-point game in the NHL, but it was a tough night for Joel Hofer, who allowed four goals on 25 shots.\n\nThe Blues lost to the Predators (13-15-4) for the second time in five days and have been outscored 12-4.\n\nLet’s look at Monday’s game observations:\n\n* Kelly Chase is an inspiration – For those that want, or need, to be versed on what the former Blues enforcer has been dealing with, it’s acute myeloid leukemia, a form of blood and bone marrow cancer first diagnosed in 2023, and the amount of chemotherapy, stints in cancer treatment centers, hospitals, the whole gamut this man has had to go through, I can’t even imagine.\n\nSo when he spoke with his doctor, Dr. Ramzi Abboud, former Blues captains in Garth Butcher and Hall of Famer Bernie Federko, it was inspiring on this night:\n\nKelly Chase is an inspiration man. Guy just keeps fighting and fighting. With Bernie Federko and Garth Butcher. #stlblues pic.twitter.com/zKzwJ0O6zD\n\n— Lou Korac (@lkorac10) December 16, 2025\n\nBlues coach Jim Montgomery was a teammate of Chase’s with the Blues in 1993-94, and he had two positives from this game. One was Dvorsky, and the other?\n\n“And then the other real positive was seeing my old teammate Kelly Chase,” Montgomery said. ‘When you think about Blues players and why this city and the fans love Blues players, is because of the fight inside of players like Kelly Chase. I was incredibly lucky to be and I’m very thankful for the season I had to play with him where I could learn from someone that competes like him night in, night out for his teammates and to see him up there and the message he delivered, I got a little emotional listening to him, and how can you not because you’ve got to love the man.”\n\nSchenn, a fellow Saskatoon native like Chase, would obviously run through a brick wall if Chase asked him to.\n\n“Kelly’s been amazing to me, to my family, to my brother, to guys around this room, to the organization,” Schenn said. “I really mean it when I say it: he’s a guy that will literally do anything for anyone, and I think we all see that. He’s a guy that’s going through a battle of his own and he’s still trying to raise money and help people out. He has a mentality and a personality that he would do absolutely anything for anyone. I’ve learned so much from him, even before when I was with the Flyers, I knew him way back being a Saskatchewan guy, he’s taken care of me tremendously from a young age. I owe a lot to what I’ve learned on and off the ice to Kelly Chase.\n\nI’ve been to the Gozzer Ranch in the summertime in Idaho where he hangs out. He knows my parents well, he knows (Schenn’s brother) Luke well, he’s done fantasy hockey camps and different charity events in Saskatoon that we’ve attended. This guy, he’ll do absolutely anything for anyone. He raises a ton of money to help out people and I’ve heard him say it, it’s true when it comes to hockey players. He said, ‘Guys are an inch deep and a mile wide,’ with how they help out, which is true. You do anything you possibly can to help out everyone, but I think he’s a guy that really digs in and tries to help people as much as he can and he’s doing it nonstop.”\n\n* Dvorsky’s glimpse of youth shining – It was another first for Dvorsky, whose multi-goal and multi-point game was his first.\n\nBut the great sign of maturity is instead of gloating of his accomplishments on this night in a loss, the No. 10 pick in the 2023 NHL Draft only offered, “Obviously it feels good to score, but first of all, I’m disappointed that we lost. That’s the most important is the team win and it’s always nice, but a win would be better.”\n\nBut Dvorsky’s goals, each was set up well.\n\nThe first tied the game 1-1 at 10:06 of the first period on a setup by Hugh McGing, who stripped Nashville defenseman Nick Blankenburg of the puck after a Justin Faulk flip-in, then fed Dvorsky for a high slot wrister that beat Juuse Saros:\n\nDvorsky's all like \"this game is tied\" pic.twitter.com/xQuK2gO1kE\n\n— St. Louis Blues (@StLouisBlues) December 16, 2025\n\n“The positive is Dalibor Dvorsky, it was nice seeing him moving his feet, beat a goalie clean with his first goal,” Montgomery said.\n\nAnd on the second, with the game out of hand at the time, Dvorsky finished off a Jake Neighbours pass at the left post to cut the Blues’ deficit to 4-2 at 8:29 of the first period:\n\nDing dong Dvorsky scores again pic.twitter.com/nt2Iu1EE9b\n\n— St. Louis Blues (@StLouisBlues) December 16, 2025\n\nDvorsky, who finished with 17:07 of ice time and three shots on goal, said it’s the kind of game that can fuel his confidence after coming in without a point in 11 straight.\n\n“It’s a step forward for sure,” Dvorsky said. “It boosts my confidence. I feel like I always try and play with confidence, but the two goals are good.\n\n“First of all we need to focus on winning the next game, but it’s always nice to score. I would never do it without the help of teammates. Great pass from ‘Ginger’ on the first one, then the whole PP unit did a great job on the second one, so it’s always about the teammates.”\n\n* First shift set the tone – The Blues had their top players on the ice, the Predators had their top players on.\n\nIt’s essential to begin the game the proper way, and the Blues did not after Nashville won the opening draw with former Blue Ryan O’Reilly, getting the puck in deep and the Blues were scrambling.\n\nO’Reilly collected a puck behind the net and fed Filip Forsberg in a tight area, and it was the first of three goals for Forsberg when he beat Hofer high on the short side from a sharp angle 27 seconds in for a 1-0 lead:\n\nBING BING BONG pic.twitter.com/eL0O6pNB5d\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 16, 2025\n\n“It’s a great example of not being prepared to start on time,” Montgomery said.\n\n* Another poor second period – The Blues came in, no secret to anyone, porous in the middle 20 minutes, and it didn’t get any better.\n\nThey were outscored 3-0 and fell to a league-worst minus-20 (48-28).\n\nFrom chasing pucks to turnovers to getting hemmed in, it was another case of generating little to nothing on one end to being bombarded at the other.\n\n“Too many turnovers, especially at the offensive blue line,” Montgomery said. “The old saying, and it’s a Ken Hitchcock saying, ‘play to the goal line and work and go to work together as a five-man unit, stay connected.’ If you had that mentality, if you look at our Friday night’s win against the Hawks (3-2), our first shift in the second, we won the draw, D-to-D, we gain the red line and we put it in, and that Schenn line went to work and we gained momentum off it, and our second period last game was really good. And it’s starts. You’ve got to be ready to start that period on time, you’ve got to be ready to start games on time.”\n\nThe Blues weren’t for a second straight period when once again, Nashville got a puck in deep, behind the net, and Michael Bunting wrapped around a puck through Hofer, a shot he should stop at 1:23 to make it 2-1 and give the Predators the lead for good:\n\n\"I think I'll do a wraparound\"\n-Bunts (obviously) pic.twitter.com/fb5iQqUqW1\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 16, 2025\n\nDvorsky’s ill-advised flip of a puck into the crowd from his own zone was the result of playing the puck too slowly, and three Predators converged on him, causing a delay of game minor and one that Forsberg scored his second of the game on at 5:31 to make it 3-1, a wrister from the high slot:\n\nFILthy on the power play 🤯 pic.twitter.com/rVJLvcPc6l\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 16, 2025\n\nAnd to cap things off, Hofer gave up a really bad one to Reid Schaefer at 18:45 to make it 4-1, a shot from near the blue line where the forward just spun and whirled the puck to the net that Hofer just missed:\n\nHIT 'EM WITH THE SPIN MOVE 🤩 pic.twitter.com/FDu38eIiTr\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 16, 2025\n\n“Obviously it’s something we’ve got to focus on and make sure we dive into,” Blues defenseman Colton Parayko said of second periods. ‘We’ve got to be better and I’m confident we will. We’ve got a strong group in here. It’s something we can obviously learn from and moving forward try to get better in the second.”\n\n* Getting beat to pucks, looking slow – The Predators were hungrier, faster to pucks throughout, and the result was much the same as other losses this season.\n\nWhen Forsberg added an empty-netter at 16:09 of the third period to make it 5-2, it marked the 12th time this season already – it only happened nine times all of last season – the Blues were beat by three goals or more.\n\nTheir goal differential is minus-37, which is far and beyond the worst in the NHL (Vancouver Canucks next at minus-23) and the 123 goals allowed is nine more than the next worst team, the Edmonton Oilers at 114.\n\n“Yeah, they were the better team,” Montgomery said of the Predators. “They were more connected, they supported each other. We always talk about puck support and winning goal lines and net fronts and second quicks is a term we use as well. Unfortunately we didn’t meet the tasks tonight in those areas.”\n\n* Injuries no excuse – The Blues won’t use the injury bug as an excuse. They are missing Dylan Holloway (high ankle sprain), Jordan Kyrou (lower-body injury), Jimmy Snuggerud (wrist), Nathan Walker (upper body) and Nick Bjugstad (upper body).\n\nThey’ve had to call up McGing, who has two points in three games, Matt Luff, who scored against the Chicago Blackhawks, and now they’re bringing up Otto Stenberg, the 25th pick in 2023.\n\n“Obviously a lot of injuries and that’s the nature of the game,” Parayko said. “There’s probably every team with almost some injuries. For us, it’s a mindset. We’ve got to come together and whoever’s playing that night is ready. That’s the biggest thing. You’ve got to be prepared. It’s next-man-up. We have great players in our locker room. Every night no matter who’s injured, guys are stepping up and a lot of guys are playing extremely well. As a group collectively, we’ve just got to support each other, just get the job done.”\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "Manchester United were involved in an emotional rollercoaster of a game last night against AFC Bournemouth.\n\nIn an incredibly rare game, United had the lead three times but managed to only net a 4-4 draw with the Cherries.\n\nIt was a jaw-dropping attacking display, but they also demonstrated defensive frailties that would make a school team blush.\n\nNaturally, when The Peoples Person asked its readers to vote for player of the match, attackers dominated.\n\n37% of fans felt that Bruno Fernandes was the best player on the pitch, and his statistics once again backed this up.\n\nThe Portuguese midfielder has been in outstanding form this season, and he scored a world-class free kick to bring the scores to 3-3.\n\nFernandes also has the most assists in the league at seven and was on the money again yesterday as Casemiro headed in his corner.\n\nThe Brazilian has only recently come back from injury, but was incredibly lively versus Wolverhampton Wanderers last week and now Bournemouth.\n\nHe led the line as a false nine and almost spectacularly set up Bryan Mbeumo for what would have been a goal of the season contender, but the Cameroonian fired over.\n\nCunha drove his side forward in the second half in search of goals and grabbed United’s fourth, and just his second in a red shirt.\n\nWith Amad and Bryan Mbeumo going to the Africa Cup of Nations, Cunha will become even more important for the Red Devils over the Christmas period.\n\nIn a close third, Amad scored 28% of the vote.\n\nThe Ivorian was a live wire all evening and gave the Cherries’ full-back nightmares.\n\nHe scored the opening goal and showed everyone at Old Trafford what a miss he will be over the Christmas break as he goes on international duty.\n\nSince Halloween, the Englishman has been one of the club’s most consistent performers, and he led the charge brilliantly last night in the front press.\n\nHe has also found his scoring boots recently, with excellent strikes versus both Crystal Palace and Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nThree percent of fans voted for another player in the United side.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Andoni Iraola wasn’t sure if he wanted Bournemouth’s exhilarating encounter with Man Utd to end after coming away with a point at Old Trafford on Monday night.\n\nThe two sides traded the lead on five occasions in one of the entertaining contests of the season thus far, but the game ended four apiece to leave them with a share of the spoils.\n\nThe results means the Red Devils have jumped ahead of Liverpool into sixth place in the Premier League table, while the Cherries have moved up to 13th.\n\n“It had everything,” Iraola told Sky Sports after the full-time whistle. “Moments where you think it’s a loss. Moments where you think we have this one, we are comfortable.\n\n“Even at the end, at the last minute two clear chances, and I was thinking maybe win this one. It’s just a point, it’s not a lot in the standings, but I think we can take good and bad things from today.\n\n“We are two teams that play quite aggressively, quite open and probably today we attacked much better than we defended.

    "description": "Jansen will help shore up Texas' catching situation; Alexander brings left-handed pitching element to Rangers' staff.",
    "fullText": "Entering the 2026 MLB season, the Texas Rangers knew that they needed some help at the catcher's position. The club non-tendered Jonah Heim after the season ended, so Texas needed to do something.\n\nTherefore, the Rangers have picked up Danny Jansen, who played last season for the Tampa Bay Rays and Milwaukee Brewers. The ballclub also added left-handed pitcher Tyler Alexander to their pitching staff. Besides Alexander, there's been some reporting from MLB.com that Texas might be close to a deal with Alexis Díaz.\n\nJansen agreed to a two-year contract for a reported $14.5 million with an option for 2027. Alexander is joining Texas on a one-year deal.\n\nJansen's defense is something that the Rangers really must have liked a lot. Last season, Jansen had 14 blocks above average. Jansen, though, has spent time during his MLB career on the injured list. In 2025, though, he managed to appear in 98 games, hitting .215 with a .720 OPS.\n\nHe avoided going on the injured list last season, too. When hitting, Jansen is known for pulling the ball and putting it in the air. The Rangers hope that Jansen continues that trend next season, too.\n\nWe’ve signed C Danny Jansen to a two-year contract with a mutual option for 2028 and LHP Tyler Alexander to a one-year contract. pic.twitter.com/CjvnRpvioo\n\n— Texas Rangers (@Rangers) December 16, 2025\n\nAlexander will be a strong addition to the Rangers' bullpen. In seven MLB seasons, Alexander has a 4.63 ERA while playing for four MLB clubs. This also is a coming home of sorts for Alexander, who played high school ball at Southlake Carroll in Southlake, Texas, which is just miles away from Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\n\nAlexander played his college ball at TCU in Fort Worth, so that put him in close proximity to go and see Rangers games while he was in college.\n\nAs for Díaz, he played for three teams last season and put together a not-so-impressive 8.15 ERA. That happened on the heels of a pretty outstanding 2023, when Díaz was an All-Star, and posted a 3.99 ERA in 2024.\n\nTexas set a foundation for its bullpen last season. With Alexander and, hopefully, Díaz coming on board, that just adds some additional arms that Rangers manager Skip Schumaker can look at to bring in as needed.\n\nWhile at the Winter Meetings last week in Orlando, Fla., Rangers general manager Ross Fenstermaker talked about what type of pitching philosophy the team is taking at this time.\n\n\"Last year, we wanted to get back to dominating the strike zone, so we targeted pitchers with a historical track record of throwing strikes and attacking the strike zone,\" Fenstermaker said. \"I think it's going to be much of the same going forward. But that is kind of a fundamental truth and a through point for us in terms of our pitching philosophy.\"\n\nLook for these additions to the Rangers' roster to come through for Schumaker, Fenstermaker, and Rangers president of baseball operations Chris Young in 2026.\n\nRemember to join our RANGERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "description": "Former NBA star Paul Pierce didn't hold back when he described the Lakers' poor decision-making in the final minutes of Sunday's win over the Suns.",
    "fullText": "Late in the third quarter of their Sunday matchup against the Phoenix Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers started to play the type of winning defense that their fans have been practically begging for. During a stretch of roughly 10 minutes that extended into the fourth quarter, they scored 24 unanswered points and forced seven turnovers, allowing them to take a 95-77 lead.\n\nHowever, after that outstanding spurt, the Lakers fell back into their old bad habits on both ends of the floor. They started to walk the ball upcourt and milk the shot clock, as if they were merely looking to conservatively protect their lead rather than build on it and hold off Phoenix. That behavior played right into Phoenix's hands, and they ended up having to pull out a 116-114 victory by the skin of their teeth after the Suns made a couple of big mistakes in the final seconds.\n\nIt was another reminder that the Lakers still have a lot of work to do in order to seriously contend for the NBA championship.\n\nHall of Famer Paul Pierce went off on them during a recent episode of the \"No Fouls Given\" podcast for the way they gave up their lead in the last several minutes of Sunday's game. He said the Lakers — and the Suns — had very poor basketball IQ in the final minutes of that contest, and that neither team will be able to win a playoff series this spring as a result.\n\n\"This was one of the lowest IQ, last four minutes I've seen from both teams this season. And based on what I saw, neither one of these teams can win a playoff series.\"\n\nOf course, the Lakers are likely not as reckless and undisciplined as they looked in the final minutes of Sunday's game, nor are they as good a defensive team as they looked during that 10-minute stretch late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter. They do have an 18-7 record, which gives them an elite winning percentage, and are in third place in the Western Conference.\n\nBut Los Angeles hasn't played the Denver Nuggets, Houston Rockets or New York Knicks yet, and when it faced the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder a month ago, it lost 121-92, albeit with LeBron James still out due to sciatica. Continuing to put forth the same ineptitude they displayed late in Sunday's game will almost certainly result in decisive losses against the Nuggets, Rockets, Knicks and especially the Thunder.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Paul Pierce on Lakers' basketball IQ in crunch time of Sunday's game",

    "fullText": "The ATP men's tennis tour will introduce an extreme heat policy from 2026 after criticism from players who sweltered through some tournaments this year.\n\nThe move brings the ATP into line with the women's WTA tour, which has a long-standing policy, and sports such as Formula One which has its own measures to protect drivers.\n\nIn October, Danish tennis star Holger Rune called temperatures of more than 30C and humidity soaring past 80 percent at the Shanghai Masters \"brutal\".\n\n\"Do you want a player to die on court?\" Rune was heard to ask as he wilted in the fierce conditions.\n\nThe ATP has now acted, saying on Monday it was \"strengthening protections for players competing in extreme conditions\".\n\nThe new rules are based on the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), which measures air temperature, humidity, wind speed and other factors to estimate heat stress.\n\nUnder the measures, a player can request a 10-minute cooling break in best-of-three singles matches if the WBGT reaches 30.1 degrees or higher during the first two sets.\n\nPlay will be suspended when the WBGT exceeds 32.2 degrees.\n\n\"The new heat rule provides a structured, medically supported approach to managing extreme heat, with the objective of safeguarding player health,\" the ATP said.\n\nIt added it will \"also improve conditions for spectators, officials, ball persons and tournament staff\".\n\nThe rules do not apply to the four Grand Slams, which have their own policies.\n\nPreviously, decisions over weather conditions, including heat, were down to the on-site ATP supervisor in coordination with medical teams and local organisers.\n\nThe planet is on track to log its second hottest year on record in 2025, Europe's global warming monitor said last week.",

    "description": "Huge amounts appear to have been raised for seriously ill children who never received the money.",
    "fullText": "A little boy faces the camera. He is pale and has no hair.\n\n\"I am seven years old and I have cancer,\" he says. \"Please save my life and help me.\"\n\nKhalil - who is pictured above in a still from the film - didn't want to record this, says his mother Aljin. She had been asked to shave his head, and then a film crew hooked him up to a fake drip, and asked his family to pretend it was his birthday. They had given him a script to learn and recite in English.\n\nAnd he didn't like it, says Aljin, when chopped onions were placed next to him, and menthol put under his eyes, to make him cry.\n\nAljin agreed to it because, although the set-up was fake, Khalil really did have cancer. She was told this video would help crowdfund money for better treatment. And it did raise funds - $27,000 (£20,204), according to a campaign we found in Khalil's name.\n\nBut Aljin was told the campaign had failed, and says she received none of this money - just a $700 (£524) filming fee on the day. One year later, Khalil died.\n\nAcross the world, desperate parents of sick or dying children are being exploited by online scam campaigns, the BBC World Service has discovered. The public have given money to the campaigns, which claim to be fundraising for life-saving treatment. We have identified 15 families who say they got little to nothing of the funds raised and often had no idea the campaigns had even been published, despite undergoing harrowing filming.\n\nNine families we spoke to - whose campaigns appear to be products of the same scam network - say they never received anything at all of the $4m (£2.9m) apparently raised in their names.\n\nA whistleblower from this network told us they had looked for \"beautiful children\" who \"had to be three to nine years old… without hair\".\n\nWe have identified a key player in the scam as an Israeli man living in Canada called Erez Hadari.\n\nOur investigation began in October 2023, when a distressing YouTube advert caught our attention. \"I don't want to die,\" a girl called Alexandra from Ghana sobbed. \"My treatments cost a lot.\"\n\nA crowdfunding campaign for her appeared to have raised nearly $700,000 (£523,797).\n\nWe saw more videos of sick children from around the world on YouTube, all strikingly similar - slickly produced, and seemingly having raised huge amounts of money. They all conveyed a sense of urgency, using emotive language.\n\nWe decided to investigate further.\n\nThe campaigns with the biggest apparent international reach were under the name of an organisation called Chance Letikva (Chance for Hope, in English) - registered in Israel and the US.\n\nIdentifying the children featured was difficult. We used geolocation, social media and facial recognition software to find their families, based as far apart as Colombia and the Philippines.\n\nWhile it was difficult to know for sure if the campaign websites' cash totals were genuine, we donated small amounts to two of them and saw the totals increase by those amounts.\n\nWe also spoke to someone who says she gave $180 (£135) to Alexandra's campaign and was then inundated with requests for more, all written as if sent by Alexandra and her father.\n\nIn the Philippines, Aljin Tabasa told us her son Khalil had fallen ill just after his seventh birthday.\n\n\"When we found out it was cancer it felt like my whole world shattered,\" she says.\n\nAljin says treatment at their local hospital in the city of Cebu was slow, and she had messaged everyone she could think of for help. One person put her in touch with a local businessman called Rhoie Yncierto - who asked for a video of Khalil which, looking back, Aljin realises was essentially an audition.\n\nAnother man then arrived from Canada in December 2022, introducing himself as \"Erez\". He paid her the filming fee up front, she says, promising a further $1,500 (£1,122) a month if the film generated lots of donations.\n\nErez directed Khalil's film at a local hospital, asking for retake after retake - the shoot taking 12 hours, Aljin says.\n\nMonths later, the family say they had still not heard how the video had performed. Aljin messaged Erez, who told her the video \"wasn't successful\".\n\n\"So as I understood it, the video just didn't make any money,\" she says.\n\nBut we told her the campaign had apparently collected $27,000 (£20,204) as of November 2024, and was still online.\n\n\"If I had known the money we had raised, I can't help but think that maybe Khalil would still be here,\" Aljin says. \"I don't understand how they could do this to us.\"\n\nWhen asked about his role in the filming, Rhoie Yncierto denied telling families to shave their children's heads for filming and said he had received no payment for recruiting families.\n\nHe said he had \"no control\" over what happened with the funds and had no contact with the families after the day of filming. When we told him they had not received any of the campaigns' donations he said he was \"puzzled\" and was \"very sorry for the families\".\n\nNobody named Erez appears on registration documents for Chance Letikva. But two of its campaigns we investigated had also been promoted by another organisation called Walls of Hope, registered in Israel and Canada. Documents list the director in Canada as Erez Hadari.\n\nWe asked Mr Hadari about his involvement in a campaign in the Philippines. He did not respond.\n\nWe visited further families whose campaigns were either organised by, or linked to, Mr Hadari - one in a remote indigenous community in Colombia, and another in Ukraine.\n\nAs with Khalil's case, local fixers had got in touch to offer help. The children were filmed and made to cry or fake tears for a nominal fee, but never received any further money.\n\nIn Sucre, north-west Colombia, Sergio Care says he initially refused this help. He had been approached by someone called Isabel, he says, who offered financial assistance after his eight-year-old daughter, Ana, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour.\n\nBut Isabel came looking for him at the hospital treating Ana, he says, accompanied by a man who said he worked for an international NGO.\n\nThe description Sergio gave of the man matched that of Erez Hadari - he then recognised him in a photo we showed him.\n\n\"He gave me hope... I didn't have any money for the future.\"\n\nDemands on the family did not end with the filming.\n\nIsabel kept ringing, Sergio says, demanding more photos of Ana in hospital. When Sergio didn't reply, Isabel started messaging Ana herself - voice notes we have heard.\n\nAna told Isabel she had no more photos to send. Isabel replied: \"This is very bad Ana, very bad indeed.\"\n\nIn January this year, Ana - now fully recovered - tried to find out what happened to the money promised.\n\n\"That foundation disappeared,\" Isabel told her in a voice note. \"Your video was never uploaded. Never. Nothing was done with it, you hear?\"\n\nBut we could see the video had been uploaded and, by April 2024, appeared to have raised nearly $250,000 (£187,070).\n\nIn October, we persuaded Isabel Hernandez to speak to us over video link.\n\nA friend from Israel, she explained, had introduced her to someone offering work for \"a foundation\" looking to help children with cancer. She refused to name who she worked for.\n\nShe was told only one of the campaigns she helped organise was published, she says, and that it had not been successful.\n\nWe showed Isabel that two campaigns had in fact been uploaded - one of them apparently raising more than $700,000 (£523,797).\n\n\"I need to apologise to [the families],\" she said. \"If I'd known what was going on, I would not have been able to do something like this.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, we discovered that the person who approached the mother of a sick child was actually employed in the place where the campaign video was filmed.\n\nTetiana Khaliavka organised a shoot with five-year-old Viktoriia, who has brain cancer, at Angelholm Clinic in Chernivtsi.\n\nOne Facebook post linked to Chance Letikva's campaign shows Viktoriia and her mother Olena Firsova, sitting on a bed. \"I see your efforts to save my daughter, and it deeply moves us all. It's a race against time to raise the amount needed for Viktoriia's treatments,\" reads the caption.\n\nOlena says she never wrote or even said these words and had no idea the campaign had been uploaded.\n\nIt appears to have raised more than €280,000 (£244,000).\n\nTetiana, we were told, was in charge of advertising and communications at Angelholm.\n\nThe clinic recently told the BBC it didn't approve filming on its premises - adding: \"The clinic has never participated in, nor supported, any fundraising initiatives organised by any organisation.\"\n\nAngelholm says it has terminated Tetiana Khaliavka's employment.\n\nOlena showed us the contract she had been asked to sign.\n\nIn addition to the family's $1,500 (£1,122) filming fee on the day, it states they would get $8,000 (£5,986) once the fundraising goal was met. The amount for the goal, however, has been left blank.\n\nThe contract showed an address in New York for Chance Letikva. On the organisation's website, there is another - in Beit Shemesh, about an hour from Jerusalem. We travelled to both, but found no sign of it.\n\nAnd we discovered Chance Letikva seems to be one of many such organisations.\n\nThe man who filmed Viktoriia's campaign told our producer - who was posing as a friend of a sick child - that he works for other similar organisations.\n\n\"Each time, it's a different one,\" the man - who had introduced himself as \"Oleh\" - told her. \"I hate to put it this way, but they work kind of like a conveyor belt.\"\n\n\"About a dozen similar companies\" requested \"material\", he said, naming two of them - Saint Teresa and Little Angels, both registered in the US.\n\nWhen we checked their registration documents, we once again found Erez Hadari's name.\n\nWhat is not clear is where the money raised for the children has gone.\n\nMore than a year after Viktoriia's filming, her mother Olena rang Oleh, who seems to go by Alex Kohen online, to find out. Shortly afterwards, someone from Chance Letikva called to say the donations had paid for advertising, she says.\n\nThis is also what Mr Hadari told Aljin, Khalil's mother, when she confronted him over the phone.\n\n\"There is cost of advertising. So the company lost money,\" Mr Hadari told her, without giving any evidence to support this.\n\nCharity experts told us advertising should not amount to more than 20% of the total raised by campaigns.\n\nSomeone previously employed to recruit children for Chance Letikva campaigns told us how those featured had been chosen.\n\nThey had been asked to visit oncology clinics, they said - speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"They were always looking for beautiful children with white skin. The child had to be three to nine years old. They had to know how to speak well. They had to be without hair,\" they told us.\n\n\"They asked me for photos, to see if the child is right, and I would send it to Erez.\"\n\nThe whistleblower told us Mr Hadari would then send the photo on to someone else, in Israel, whose name they were never told.\n\nAs for Mr Hadari himself, we tried to reach him at two addresses in Canada but could not find him. He replied to one voice note we had sent him - asking about the money he had been apparently crowdfunding - by saying the organisation \"has never been active\", without specifying which one. He did not respond to a further voice note and letter laying out all our questions and allegations.\n\nCampaigns set up by Chance Letikva for two children who died - Khalil and a Mexican boy called Hector - still appear to be accepting money.\n\nChance Letikva's US branch appears to be linked to a new organisation called Saint Raphael, which has produced more campaigns - at least two of which seem to have been filmed in Angelholm clinic in Ukraine, as the clinic's distinctive wood panelling and staff uniforms can be seen.\n\nOlena, Viktoriia's mother, says her daughter has been diagnosed with another brain tumour. She says she is sickened by the findings of our investigation.\n\n\"When your child is… hanging on the edge of life, and someone's out there, making money off that. Well, it's filthy. It's blood money.\"\n\nThe BBC contacted Tetiana Khaliavka and Alex Kohen, and the organisations Chance Letikva, Walls of Hope, Saint Raphael, Little Angels and Saint Teresa - inviting them to respond to the allegations made against them. None of them replied.\n\nThe Israeli Corporations Authority, which oversees the country's non-profit organisations, told us that if it has evidence founders are using entities as \"a cover for illegal activity\", then registration inside Israel may be denied and the founder could be barred from working in the sector.\n\nUK regulator, the Charity Commission, advises those wishing to donate to charities to check that those associations are registered, and that the appropriate fundraising regulator should be contacted if in doubt.\n\nAdditional reporting by: Ned Davies, Tracks Saflor, Jose Antonio Lucio, Almudena Garcia-parrado, Vitaliya Kozmenko, Shakked Auerbach, Tom Tzur Wisfelder, Katya Malofieieva, Anastasia Kucher, Alan Pulido and Neil McCarthy",

    "description": "Learn more about the top 10 countries the world can’t ignore in 2026 and find out how you can help.",
    "fullText": "For more than a decade, the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) annual Emergency Watchlist has accurately predicted 85-95 percent of the countries most likely to face a worsening humanitarian crisis in the coming year. The 2026 report highlights 20 countries and ranks the 10 at greatest risk, as a shifting world order leaves them to confront surging crises amid shrinking international support.\n\nThese countries are home to just 12 percent of the global population, yet account for 89 percent of global humanitarian need. In 2026, tens of millions of people are set to face deepening hunger, displacement and violence as international funding and political attention continue to decline.\n\nRead on to learn more about the 10 countries most likely to face a worsening humanitarian crisis in 2026 and find out how the IRC is responding.\n\nThe threat of renewed conflict between Israel and the Lebanese nonstate armed group Hezbollah is growing, even as approximately 80 percent of Lebanon’s population lives in poverty. Fighting between the two sides in 2024 displaced 1.4 million people in Lebanon and 96,000 Israelis. A return to large-scale conflict in 2026 would overwhelm Lebanon’s fragile public services and sharply escalate humanitarian needs.\n\nThe IRC has been working in Lebanon since 2012, delivering emergency and long-term support to Lebanese citizens and refugees. We offer legal services, protection, education and economic support, as well as mental, sexual and reproductive health services to people affected by and recovering from crises.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Lebanon.\n\nArmed groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda have engaged in an escalating campaign of kidnappings, forced recruitment and attacks on civilians in Burkina Faso for the past eight years. They have blockaded towns, cutting off more than a million people from food, water and health care. Recurring floods and droughts have also driven displacement and compounded the crisis. Pervasive insecurity has curbed the ability of humanitarians to reach the communities in greatest need.\n\nSince 2019, the IRC has been operating in Burkina Faso to address the humanitarian needs of populations affected by conflict and food insecurity. Its interventions span several sectors: water and sanitation, health, nutrition, economic recovery, protection, women's empowerment and governance. In close collaboration with authorities and local and international partners, the IRC works in accordance with humanitarian principles across seven regions to help communities survive, recover and rebuild their futures.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Burkina Faso.\n\nMali is facing escalating instability following changes in government, the withdrawal of French forces and the growing presence of the Russian Africa Corps. Armed groups—particularly Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM)—have expanded across central and southern Mali, attacking key trade routes and blocking the flow of fuel and goods into the capital, Bamako.\n\nThe IRC has been providing humanitarian assistance to crisis-affected populations in Mali since 2012, focusing on children, women and internally displaced persons. Our holistic approach integrates programming focused on health and nutrition, economic support, protection against violence and displacement, education, food security and equitable access to essential services.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Mali.\n\nConflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is growing despite a 2025 peace deal with Rwanda. Clashes involving the Rwandan-backed M23 armed group are escalating, as the group continues to expand its territorial control in eastern DRC and to exploit valuable rare earth and gold mining sites. Violence involving a number of local armed groups as well as forces from Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda is driving displacement, worsening food insecurity and increasing the risk of disease outbreaks.\n\nThe IRC has been operating in the DRC since 1996 to improve the well-being of crisis-affected communities, with a particular focus on women and children. In 2024, the IRC supported more than 305,000 people through its health, nutrition, WASH and education programs, while also strengthening child protection, advancing women’s empowerment and promoting community governance.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s DRC response.\n\nFive years after the military took power in 2021, the violent conflict in Myanmar between armed groups and the central military continues with no end in sight. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s humanitarian response remains severely underfunded, even after a major earthquake in 2025 escalated the crisis in the country, leaving a total of 16.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe IRC initiated an emergency response in Myanmar following Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The IRC has worked with local partners to expand its activities since then, serving people affected by the escalating conflict since February 2021, as well as marginalized and stateless communities. The IRC currently works across multiple sectors in six states, including providing emergency response to communities affected by the earthquake in March 2025.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s Myanmar response.\n\nHaiti has experienced political chaos since President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021, leaving the country without effective government or security. Armed gangs now control nearly all of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince. Internationally supported attempts to restore order have failed and the mandate of the Transitional Presidential Council, which currently rules Haiti, is set to expire in February 2026. Gangs could exploit this power vacuum, worsening the situation for civilians who are facing increasing violence, hunger and displacement.\n\nThe IRC has a history of providing humanitarian support in Haiti since 2010, working with a strong network of civil society organizations and local groups to respond to the needs of communities affected by internal displacement and longstanding gang violence. Since December 2022, our services have focused on cholera prevention for internally displaced people and support for survivors of violence, including gender-based violence.\n\nInterconnected domestic and regional dynamics are driving instability across northern Ethiopia that could tilt into widescale conflict. In addition, fighting perpetuated by armed groups continues to displace civilians. Climate shocks like droughts and floods worsen the humanitarian situation. With significant aid cuts, including a $387 million reduction from USAID in 2025, humanitarian agencies are ill-equipped to handle these overlapping crises.\n\nThe IRC began its operations in Ethiopia in 2000, providing support to refugees from neighboring countries as well as Ethiopians living in crisis-affected and underserved communities. The country continues to face recurring challenges, including conflict, natural hazards and climatic shocks, all of which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. We respond through multisectoral programming in health and nutrition, child protection, education, women’s protection and empowerment, economic recovery and development and environmental health.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s work in Ethiopia.\n\nSouth Sudan is at risk of sliding back into civil war, as the 2018 peace agreement collapses and the current government breaks down. Meanwhile, the civil war in neighboring Sudan has led to an influx of refugees, added to domestic tensions and disrupted vital oil exports, triggering economic turmoil and growing unrest among unpaid security forces. Relentless annual flooding is devastating food production and has trapped millions in a deepening humanitarian crisis.\n\nFor over three decades, the IRC has stood as a lifeline for communities across the region, responding to the urgent needs of those affected by conflict, displacement and disaster. As one of South Sudan’s largest humanitarian actors, we reach over a million people with health, protection, education and economic empowerment services. In an unstable nation, the IRC’s work is not only lifesaving, it is life-restoring, helping individuals and families rebuild with dignity and hope.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s South Sudan response.\n\nMore than two years of conflict have devastated Gaza and killed over 70,000 people, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. In October 2023, Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 200 hostages. The resulting military conflict between Israel and Hamas has systematically destroyed infrastructure, markets and essential food, water, shelter and health services across Gaza. Almost 80% of buildings have been damaged or destroyed and around 90% of the population have been displaced, often multiple times.\n\nA U.S.-led and regionally backed \"peace plan,\" including a ceasefire in October 2025, offers limited hope that external pressure may help reduce the intensity of conflict in 2026. However, there have been repeated violations of the October ceasefire in the weeks after it came into effect, and catastrophic levels of humanitarian need remain a certainty. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, escalating settler violence, financial restrictions and territorial fragmentation are eroding Palestinian security and daily life.\n\nThe IRC and our partners work to provide lifesaving services in the occupied Palestinian territory. In Gaza, that includes clean water, malnutrition treatment, protection and empowerment for women and children, early childhood development, psychosocial interventions, emergency reproductive health and other critical humanitarian needs. In the West Bank, the IRC and our partners continue to provide psychosocial interventions and early childhood development services, as well as build the capacity of community first aid workers.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s oPt response.\n\nFor the third year in a row, the IRC ranks Sudan atop the Watchlist as the country most likely to experience a deteriorating humanitarian crisis. Sudan’s catastrophic civil war, waged between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has killed over 150,000 people since April 2023 and is preventing lifesaving aid from reaching communities in need. The conflict has also triggered a devastating food crisis, forcing regions of Sudan into famine and causing deaths every single day.\n\nWhen the conflict began in 2023, the IRC adapted its programs and scaled up our response to address increased humanitarian needs. Despite operational challenges, the IRC continues to provide support in Blue Nile, Gedaref, Khartoum, River Nile, South Kordofan and White Nile states and is working on re-establishing its presence in Jazera state. We have an office in Port Sudan and are expanding our presence into other states, including Darfur.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s Sudan response.\n\nThe IRC’s Emergency Watchlist identifies the countries most likely to experience a deteriorating humanitarian crisis in 2026—but it also presents solutions. The IRC is on the ground in every single country on this list, delivering lifesaving aid to the communities most impacted.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee has over 90 years of experience helping people affected by crisis in more than 40 countries to survive, recover and rebuild their lives. We also help refugees and displaced people resettle and integrate into new communities in the U.S. and across Europe.\n\nOur ratings: We consistently earn top marks from charity watchdog groups for our efficient use of donor contributions and the effectiveness of our work.\n\nGet connected: Follow the IRC on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Bluesky and X.\n\nStay informed: Learn more about the world’s worst crises—and how you can help—in the full 2026 Emergency Watchlist.",

    "description": "The engineer behind Claude Code says vibe coding works for prototypes, but today's AI models still fall short for maintainable software.",
    "fullText": "The creator of one of the most popular AI coding tools says vibe coding can only go so far.\n\nBoris Cherny, the engineer behind Anthropic's Claude Code, said on an episode of \"The Peterman Podcast\" published Monday that while vibe coding has its place, it's far from a universal solution.\n\nIt works well for \"throwaway code and prototypes, code that's not in the critical path,\" he said.\n\n\"I do this all the time, but it's definitely not the thing you want to do all the time,\" Cherny said, referring to vibe coding.\n\n\"You want maintainable code sometimes. You want to be very thoughtful about every line sometimes,\" he added.\n\nClaude Code launched earlier this year as part of Anthropic's efforts to integrate AI more deeply into code development workflows.\n\nTop AI coding services like Cursor and Augment run on Anthropic's models, and even Meta uses Anthropic's models inside its coding assistant. Claude Code has also taken off with non-technical developers who want to build software with natural-language prompts.\n\nAnthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, said in October that Claude was writing 90% of the code in the company.\n\nFor critical coding tasks, Cherny said he typically pairs with a model to write code.\n\nHe starts by asking an AI model to generate a plan, then iterates on the implementation in small steps. \"I might ask it to improve the code or clean it up or so on,\" he said.\n\nFor parts of the system where he has strong technical opinions, Cherny said he still writes the code by hand.\n\nCherny said the models are still \"not great at coding.\"\n\n\"There's still so much room to improve, and this is the worst it's ever going to be,\" he said.\n\nCherny said it's \"insane\" to compare current tools to where AI coding was just a year ago, when it amounted to little more than type-ahead autocomplete. Now, it's a \"completely different world,\" he said, adding that what excites him is how fast the models are improving.\n\nAI-assisted coding has been gaining momentum across the tech world.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said last month that vibe coding is \"making coding so much more enjoyable,\" adding that people with no technical background can now build simple apps and websites.\n\n\"Things are getting more approachable, it's getting exciting again, and the amazing thing is, it's only going to get better,\" he said in a podcast interview with Logan Kilpatrick, who leads Google's AI Studio.\n\nPichai said during Alphabet's April earnings call that AI is writing over 30% of the new code at Google, an increase from 25% in October 2024.\n\nIt's \"fantastic\" how quickly developers can write software with AI coding tools, sometimes while \"barely looking at the code,\" said Google Brain founder Andrew Ng in May.\n\nFor non-technical developers, vibe coding has enabled them to automate parts of their jobs, prototype ideas, or build a creative product on the side, Business Insider reported last month.\n\nStill, leaders caution that the technology has limits. AI-generated code could contain mistakes, be overly verbose, or lack the proper structure.\n\n\"I'm not working on large codebases where you really have to get it right, the security has to be there,\" Pichai said in November.",

    "description": "Regardless of the experiences and material things that money can offer, at the end of the day, kids \"just want your time,\" Chris Hemsworth said.",
    "fullText": "Chris Hemsworth says his father's Alzheimer's diagnosis has reshaped how he thinks about family.\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of Jay Shetty's \"On Purpose\" podcast, the actor spoke about navigating his dad's diagnosis and filming \"A Road Trip to Remember\" with him, a documentary that follows their motorbike trip across Australia to revisit places from Hemsworth's childhood.\n\nHemsworth first found out he carries two copies of a gene that has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's while filming the National Geographic longevity documentary \"Limitless\" in 2022.\n\nOn the podcast, Hemsworth recalled how his father first reacted when the actor learned he was at high risk for Alzheimer's — and how things changed once his dad received his own diagnosis.\n\n\"I remember vividly that conversation of him sort of telling me not to be concerned about it. And then about two or three years later, my mom saying to me, 'I think we've got to get dad checked because there's these signs and things I'm concerned about,'\" Hemsworth told Shetty.\n\nTests revealed that both his parents also carried two copies of the same gene, and Hemsworth said he was \"immediately hit with the reality of what that meant\" for his dad.\n\nHe'd pushed aside his own results as a distant concern, but seeing his dad's diagnosis \"right in front of us\" was \"incredibly confronting,\" especially as his condition \"began to get worse.\"\n\nHemsworth said filming the documentary with his dad allowed them to have conversations that they hadn't had before.\n\n\"He says it in the documentary, but his biggest concern was being a burden. And that was heartbreaking to hear and consider,\" Hemsworth said. \"And I had never even, up until we shot the documentary, I didn't know even how he felt about it, you know, because I hadn't asked him.\"\n\nThe actor added that he was thankful for the chance to connect with his dad through the documentary, adding that it \"ignited something\" in his family to be more proactive, more present, and more connected because \"we're watching memories disappear in front of us.\"\n\nHemsworth said he and his brothers also try to offload the caretaking burden from his mom, adding that his dad's condition has prompted him to reevaluate his priorities in life.\n\nThe experience has forced him to slow down, and while he has films lined up for next year, he has \"turned down a lot of things\" so he can spend more time with his father, he said.\n\n\"I know I'm not going to get 10 years down the track and go, 'I'm glad I did those extra three or four films.' I'm going to say, 'I wish I spent more time with him, and with my mom, and with my brothers, and my wife, my kids, and family, and friends,'\" he said.\n\nThat has also reshaped his priorities as a father. Hemsworth has one daughter and twin sons with his wife, Elsa Pataky.\n\n\"It's attention, you know, they want your presence. They want your space. They want your focus,\" Hemsworth said of his kids. Regardless of the experiences and material things that money can offer, at the end of the day, kids \"just want your time,\" he added.\n\n\"And that for me has been terrifying at times, realizing how quick it's gone. I think I'll get to that, and then a year goes by, and I've done a couple of films or whatever and gone, 'Oh, wow, which part of their, you know, brief childhood have I missed?'\" Hemsworth said.\n\nHe added that he's become acutely aware of how quickly his children are growing up.\n\n\"They've taught me a greater awareness around the importance of this moment, because their personalities change every second and every day and every week and every month, and you kind of, you're mourning a version of that child every month because they're gone,\" he said.\n\nHemsworth isn't the only Hollywood star who has spoken about navigating a loved one's diagnosis.\n\nIn September, Emma Heming Willis said she mistook Bruce Willis' early symptoms for marital problems, and that his dementia diagnosis later gave her clarity.\n\n\"There was relief in understanding, 'Oh, okay, this wasn't my husband, it was that this disease was taking parts of his brain,'\" she told People. \"Once you hear that, I just softened.\"\n\nIn November, Jay Leno said caring for his wife amid her dementia diagnosis \"isn't work,\" but simply another chapter in their life together.\n\n\"There are going to be a couple of years that are tricky. So, the first 46, really great. But it's OK. It's not terrible. I'm not a woe-is-me person. I'm just lucky that I am able to take care of her,\" Leno told People.",

    "fullText": "Though the case is over, the video evidence that was to be presented in the harassment case against Rome Mayor Jeffrey Lanigan has been released — including an interview done by law enforcement.\n\nLanigan plead guilty to second-degree harassment on Dec. 12, stemming from an incident in the late afternoon of June 3 in the parking lot of Teugega Country Club in Rome between Lanigan and Brown.\n\nPer the sole charge, Lanigan stood accused of “pushing the victim against the rear passenger trunk area of a black Nissan, then restraining the arms of the victim before pushing the victim into a seated position in the front passenger seat of the above-mentioned vehicle.”\n\nIn a statement on June 4, Lanigan confirmed a verbal exchange between the two men, but said it had not turned physical. The statement describes Brown as having \"...flailed his arms and became verbally aggressive.\"\n\nIn the interview video, Lanigan can be seen speaking with a deputy with the Oneida County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"He had his hand up in the air when he saw it was me and was belligerently drunk,\" Lanigan said to a deputy. \"I brought his hand down and walked him over to the car and said 'sit down in the car and then I'll say my peace to you and then that's it and I'm done with it.'\"\n\nLanigan said the two \"...screamed at each other through the [car's] window\" and that was the extent of the altercation.\n\nWhen one of the deputies asked what his relationship with Brown was, Lanigan said the former mayor was a friend of 13 years who got him into politics. Lanigan alleges that things had been fine with Brown, up until Brown \"spoke badly\" about him on a podcast.\n\nArrests: Syracuse man arrested for car crash in Sullivan that left one dead\n\nCourt Proceedings: COs in Messiah Nantwi trial ask for separate trials\n\nSecurity: Law enforcement, mall officials talk security at Sangertown\n\n\"I called him when that happened, but he wouldn't take my calls,\" Lanigan said. \"We didn't talk again the whole winter. And then [June 2], he went on Talk of the Town and someone sent me the radio interview.\"\n\nOne of the deputies on the body-worn camera footage asks Lanigan if \"...that's what the text to him was about? That you wanted to talk to him?\"\n\nLanigan said yes and that he didn't threaten Brown.\n\nIn the footage, Brown could be seen talking to other individuals and getting into a car, only to get out when another individual approaches, whom he embraces. He can be seen talking across the parking lot to this individual, before Lanigan can be seen walking up behind Brown and placing a hand on his shoulder.\n\nThe two can be seen talking, but with every step that Lanigan takes, Brown takes one step back until he's positioned at the back of the car.\n\nBrown raises one arm and tries to push away and raises another above his head, but Lanigan grabs the second arm and guides Brown back to the car and into the passenger seat.\n\nFrom there, the two begin speaking to each other and gesturing. At one point, Lanigan starts to walk off, only for Brown to say something that makes Lanigan turn back around.\n\nThe two eventually separate and the car carrying Brown drives off.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Observer-Dispatch: Videos released after Rome Mayor Lanigan pleads guilty",

    "description": "Jillian Michaels called out NYT's Wajahat Ali for not doing a his homework after he incorrectly claimed she had referred to herself as a \"white nationalist\"",
    "fullText": "Fitness influencer Jillian Michaels called out New York Times opinion writer Wajahat Ali for not doing a “little homework” after he incorrectly claimed she had referred to herself as a “white nationalist” previously.\n\nTheir clash happened on Monday’s episode of Piers Morgan Uncensored, where Michaels and Ali debated violent attacks by radical Muslims after 16 people were slaughtered at a Hanukkah celebration in Australia last weekend.\n\nAli, after Michaels weighed in on the attack, said he had to deal with her saying a bunch of “hate-filled, stupid, reckless things” about Muslims.\n\n“You, by your own admission, are a white nationalist,” Ali continued.\n\n“I’m a white nationalist? You know I’m Arab, right? I’m Syrian and Lebanese and Turkish,” Michaels told him. “When did I say I was a white nationalist?”\n\n“You’re not a white nationalist?” Ali responded. “Oh, wasn’t there a clip saying you’re a white nationalist? So you’re not a white nationalist?”\n\n“Oh, interesting. Interesting to know,” Ali said.\n\nMichaels pressed him more on his claim, asking what mysterious clip he was referring to. Ali had no answer.\n\n“I’m under the mistaken impression you’re a white nationalist,” Ali said. “I’m glad you’re not.”\n\n“How about a little homework, Wajahat?” Michaels said, while chuckling over the whole thing.\n\nMichaels, a moment earlier, said it was fair to be concerned about Islamist attacks, after the shooting in Australia and an ISIS-inspired attack that killed three Americans in Syria this past weekend. She said that even if 1% of the world’s Muslim population is sympathetic to terrorist attacks, that is still 20 million people to be worried about.\n\n“I don’t think the alarm is about Muslims migrating to America,” she said. “I think the alarm is about assimilation. I don’t think that these two individuals in Bondi represent what I’ve been told is actually two billion Muslims.”\n\nAli bashed her a few minutes later.\n\nHe said ex-President George W. Bush’s War on Terror, following the 9/11 attacks, “caused immense chaos” based on “the same type of bullsh*t that Jillian’s saying right now.” Ali then branded her a “hate monger” who wants to “bring up Islamophobia” and  wants to “get rid of all Muslim immigrants.”\n\nMichaels was unmoved by Ali’s shot.\n\n“We have to call out the people who want to destroy the West,” she said.\n\nThe post ‘You Know I’m Arab, Right?’ Jillian Michaels Hits Back at NYT’s Wajahat Ali Calling Her a ‘White Nationalist’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "All life on Earth can be traced back to a Last Universal Common Ancestor, or LUCA—and it likely lived on Earth only 400 million years after its formation.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAll life on Earth can be traced back to a Last Universal Common Ancestor, or LUCA.\n\nA study suggests that this organism likely lived on Earth only 400 million years after its formation.\n\nFurther analysis also shows that this life form likely sported an early immune system, which means it was probably fighting off viruses.\n\nLife on Earth had to begin somewhere, and scientists think that “somewhere” is LUCA—or the Last Universal Common Ancestor. True to its name, this prokaryote-like organism represents the ancestor of every living thing, from the tiniest of bacteria to the grandest of blue whales.\n\nWhile the Cambrian Explosion kickstarted complex life in a major way some 530 million years, the true timeline of life on Earth is much longer. For years, scientists have estimated that LUCA likely arrived on the scene some 4 billion years, which is only 600 million years after the planet’s formation.\n\nBut a study from an international team of scientists pushes that timeline back even further to some 4.2 billion years ago, while also discovering some fascinating details about what life for LUCA might’ve been like. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.\n\n“The common ancestry of all extant cellular life is evidenced by the universal genetic code, machinery for protein synthesis, shared chirality of the almost-universal set of 20 amino acids and use of ATP as a common energy currency. As such, our understanding of LUCA impacts our understanding of the early evolution of life on Earth. Was LUCA a simple or complex organism? What kind of environment did it inhabit and when?”\n\nTo zero in on exactly when LUCA appeared on Earth, scientists had to work backward. First, the team compared genes in living species and counted the mutations that have occurred since sharing a common ancestor with LUCA. Using a genetic equation based on the time of separation between species, the team worked out that LUCA must’ve been mucking around on Earth as early as 400 million years after its creation, which puts this organism smack in the middle of the hellish geologic nightmare known as the Hadean Eon.\n\n“The evolutionary history of genes is complicated by their exchange between lineages,” University of Bristol’s Edmund Moody, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “We have to use complex evolutionary models to reconcile the evolutionary history of genes with the genealogy of species.”\n\nNot satisfied with just learning its age, the team took things a step further and retraced the physiological characteristics of living species to understand what LUCA must’ve been like 4.2 billion years ago—and the results gave some surprising answers. The scientists estimate that while LUCA was a simple prokaryote, it likely had an immune system, meaning it was already fighting off primordial viruses.\n\n“It’s clear that LUCA was exploiting and changing its environment, but it is unlikely to have lived alone,” University of Exeter’s Tim Lenton, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Its waste would have been food for other microbes, like methanogens, that would have helped to create a recycling ecosystem.”\n\nWhile LUCA is the oldest common ancestor we know of, scientists still don’t understand how life evolved from its very origins to the early communities of which LUCA is a part. Further studies will need to dive deeper into this primordial history and uncover exactly how you, me, and every other living thing, came to be.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

His retirement leaves a great void but the player has been plagued by injury in recent seasons.\"\n\n\"It is fitting that he leaves with a record haul of medals and since being appointed captain in 2022, he has always led by example and worn the county jersey with fierce pride and distinction,\" she concluded.",

    "description": "David Chung shares how his mother's immigrant journey inspired him to build a multimillion-dollar beauty business from the ground up.",
    "fullText": "David Chung is a serial entrepreneur and CEO of multiple beauty brands.\n\nFarmacy Beauty, which he founded in 2015, was acquired by Procter & Gamble for $350 million.\n\nHe isn't driven by money, and at 66, he can't envision retiring, he says.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chung, owner and chairman of Amare Global. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI couldn't believe there was a banana just sitting on the kitchen table. In Korea, having a banana was a big deal, but when I immigrated to New York City at 12, we had fruit and even M&Ms. Everything was so luxurious.\n\nMy mother immigrated to the US in 1963 with less than $100. When she arrived in New York, she started a small, mom-and-pop gift shop. She grew the business through and eventually got her green card. I joined her about eight years later, in the middle of a New York winter. I didn't speak the language, but I felt lucky to be in the US.\n\nMy mother continued to grow her store, expanding into a drugstore and pharmacy. By the early 2000s, she had a business worth tens of millions.\n\nShe was very, very entrepreneurial. Watching her journey inspired me and has carried over even today. I have a lot of her DNA when it comes to business. Now that I'm 66, I'll think, \"I'm just like my mother!\" It's scary.\n\nMy mom's business set the stage for mine. Working in her shop, I saw that beauty products provided a great business opportunity. The products are small, which reduces warehousing and shipping costs. They're consumable, so customers return again and again. And even if the economy is bad, people don't give up on their skin.\n\nI went to college, but I found it difficult to concentrate because I was always thinking about starting my business. Even today, I don't drive much because I get so distracted thinking about running my companies (instead, I use a driver). Eventually, I graduated with a degree in engineering.\n\nRight next to my school, there was a small video rental store. These were the days before Blockbuster. I bought that store when I was 23, and expanded it slowly to sell gifts and cosmetics.\n\nThat was my start in business. Other than my mom, I've never worked for anyone else. That meant I had to learn hard lessons about business structure, processes, and systems on my own.\n\nOver time, I pivoted from retail to research, design, and manufacturing. In 2018, I sold my shares in one company for $53.7 million. In 2021, I sold my company, Farmacy Beauty, for hundreds of millions (I'm not allowed to share the specific amount). I remember being at my computer on December 31st, watching the funds being deposited into my account. I didn't feel anything. I didn't think \"I'm rich now.\" I didn't even go out to dinner to celebrate.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about money for me. It's more about the accomplishment and excitement of building something. I remember the first time I was in a room with people who had more credentials than me. I came up with an idea they hadn't considered. That's the first time I realized that I had a different way of thinking about things.\n\nI have a huge amount of money now — I could never spend it all. And yet, when those funds hit my account, I didn't buy a Rolex or a fancy car. I went out and bought another company to run.\n\nRecently, I told an employee that I'm going to retire in three years. She laughed and said I told her the same thing 15 years ago.\n\nI don't think I will ever retire fully. God has given me a talent for being business-minded and good at what I'm doing. I want to utilize that as long as I'm able to.\n\nMy mother was very passionate about giving back, particularly to the Korean American community. I figure the more money I make, the more I can give back. So, why not use this skill?",

    "description": "\"Dizzying pace of drastic change.\"",
    "fullText": "A popular ski resort in California has taken drastic measures following warmer-than-average temperatures and a lack of natural snowfall.\n\nAs CBS News reported, Boreal Mountain, California, got off to a particularly warm start to its winter season at the end of November.\n\nIt had experienced above-average temperatures and a noticeable lack of substantial snowstorms for the region. As a result, officials at the ski resort turned to snowmaking machines to ensure that winter sports enthusiasts were able to enjoy their time.\n\n\"We've probably used 500 gallons of snow to put the product we have up on the hill,\" said Tucker Norred, Boreal's marketing director.\n\n\"It's just been a waiting game with temperatures. We blew as much snow as we could to make sure we could open safely for our guests.\"\n\nHowever, snowmaking machines can often require a high consumption of water, contributing to the depletion of nearby water supplies.\n\nThe snowmaking process can also be energy-intensive, often powered by polluting fuels such as gas or coal.\n\nWhile the resort has managed to keep the artificial powder flowing and its trails open for visitors, the weather is a departure from what the area is used to.\n\nOn average, Boreal Mountain can see around 400 inches of snow per season. That's enough to cover the 41 trails that are usually open to the public.\n\n\"To be honest with you, the last seven years I've been here, I've never seen this dirt. I've never seen these rocks,\" said Jackson Price, a longtime visitor to the ski resort, per CBS. \"It's been straight snow through the pasture.\"\n\nWould you like to have large solar farms in your state?\n\nDepends on how much it'll reduce my bills\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor, an overwhelming majority of the state was marked as free from drought as of early December.\n\nIn fact, less than 17% of California was experiencing even \"abnormally dry\" conditions on December 2. This marked a massive change from the \"3 Months Ago to Current\" data, which showed over three-quarters of the state was mired in abnormally dry or drought conditions.\n\nRising temperatures have greatly impacted historic climate patterns throughout many regions around the world. This has resulted in intensifying extreme weather events, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves. As seen in California, this can lead to unpredictability in weather forecasts.\n\nMany governments have begun to push legislation aimed at limiting reliance on planet-heating dirty fuels and promoting the widespread adoption of renewable energy, such as wind and solar power.\n\nFor example, in Poland, parliament officials have reduced barriers to delivering wind-energy projects.\n\nIn California, though, experts have recognized the importance of taking steps to mitigate the effects of a warming climate.\n\n\"The dizzying pace of drastic change underscores the need for California to invest in the resilience of Sierra-Cascade communities and landscapes, restoring forest health and economic vitality, so the Region can adapt and thrive in a changing climate,\" noted the Sierra Nevada Conservancy.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "Why Scientists Believe A Major Volcano Could Obliterate The Pacific Northwest",
    "description": "Scientists predict that a major volcano could wipe the Pacific Northwest off the map.",
    "fullText": "The Pacific Northwest has always carried an air of quiet menace — a region where breathtaking beauty overlaps with a geological time bomb ticking beneath the soil. For decades, scientists have warned that this postcard-perfect landscape sits atop one of the most volatile volcanic systems in the world. Now, new research and simmering seismic activity suggest the threat is far more immediate — and far more catastrophic — than most Americans realize.\n\nWhile locals joke about “the Big One,” volcanologists aren’t laughing. They’re tracking rising magma, mysterious ground swelling, ancient eruption patterns, and a supervolcano whose last major explosion altered the global climate. The unsettling truth? A single eruption could erase entire cities, disrupt global food chains, and plunge the world into a volcanic winter.\n\nHere’s why experts believe a major volcanic event could one day obliterate the Pacific Northwest — and why the rest of the country should be paying very close attention.\n\nYou might not be familiar with it, but the Cascadia Subduction Zone is a geological feature that should definitely be on your radar. This massive fault line stretches from Northern California to British Columbia and is capable of producing megathrust earthquakes and significant volcanic activity. A study published in the journal Science highlights that the geological pressures building up in this zone could eventually trigger a major volcanic event. So, while it might seem like just another scientific concern, the reality is that this subduction zone has the potential to cause a chain reaction of natural disasters.\n\nWhy does this matter to you? Well, if you’re living in or planning to visit the Pacific Northwest, it’s crucial to be aware of the geological dynamics at play. Knowing the risks can help you prepare and make informed decisions about earthquake and volcanic readiness. Plus, understanding the science behind these phenomena can make the concept less abstract and more a part of your everyday considerations. It's all about staying informed and prepared for what nature might throw your way.\n\nHistory has a way of repeating itself, especially when it comes to natural events like volcanic eruptions. Mount St. Helens’ 1980 eruption might be etched into public memory, but it’s just a part of a long history of volcanic activity in the region. Geological records indicate that the Pacific Northwest has been a hotspot for eruptions over millennia, each leaving a mark on the landscape and human history. By studying these past events, scientists can identify patterns and predict future activity with more accuracy.\n\nThis isn't just a theoretical exercise; it’s about learning from the past to protect the future. For people living in the area, this means understanding the very real possibility that another eruption could occur. It underscores the importance of having evacuation plans, emergency supplies, and community resources in place. After all, being prepared is about more than just peace of mind—it’s a practical step towards ensuring your safety.\n\nYou might think that technology would give us the upper hand against volcanic threats, and you'd be right—to an extent. Advances in\n\nmonitoring and satellite technology have dramatically improved our ability to detect early signs of volcanic activity. For instance, the US Geological Survey (USGS) regularly updates its Volcano Hazards Program to provide real-time monitoring and alerts. This means that scientists are more equipped than ever to provide early warnings, potentially saving lives and minimizing damage.\n\nHowever, technology isn’t a silver bullet. While it can offer crucial lead time, there's still an element of unpredictability in how a volcano might behave. For residents in the Pacific Northwest, this means remaining vigilant and responsive to official alerts and updates. Understanding that technology is a tool—not a guarantee—can help you remain proactive and prepared.\n\nAs cities expand and populations grow in the Pacific Northwest, the stakes of a volcanic eruption increase significantly. More people mean more infrastructure—homes, roads, and schools—that could potentially be affected by volcanic activity. Urban areas like Seattle and Portland are particularly vulnerable given their proximity to active volcanoes. The combination of dense populations and natural hazards is a recipe for complex emergency management challenges.\n\nFor you, this means that living in or near these urban centers requires a heightened awareness of both natural and man-made risks. While urban living offers convenience and opportunity, it also demands that you stay informed about local emergency plans and resources. The responsibility is twofold: enjoying the benefits of urban life while being mindful of the geological realities. After all, being aware is the first step towards being prepared.\n\nWhen you think of a volcanic eruption, economic implications might not be the first thing that comes to mind. But the financial consequences of such an event could be staggering. According to a report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a major eruption in the Pacific Northwest could result in billions of dollars in damages. From disrupted trade routes to destroyed infrastructure, the economic ripple effects would be felt far beyond the initial blast zone.\n\nThis isn’t just a concern for government officials or business owners—it's something that could impact you directly. Think about rising insurance premiums, increased cost of goods, and potential job disruptions. Understanding the economic stakes can help you make more informed financial decisions and encourage you to support policies that prioritize disaster readiness. In a way, being economically aware is just another form of preparedness.\n\nVolcanic eruptions don’t just alter landscapes—they can also have profound environmental impacts. The release of ash and gases can lead to short-term climate changes, affecting everything from air quality to agricultural productivity. For the Pacific Northwest, which is rich in natural beauty and biodiversity, a major eruption could pose significant threats to ecosystems. Understanding these potential consequences can help you appreciate the delicate balance between human activity and the natural world.\n\nThis isn’t just about preserving beauty; it’s about maintaining the health and sustainability of the environment you depend on. For people who live in the region, it means being mindful of how human actions can exacerbate natural risks. It’s a call to action to support environmental initiatives and policies that aim to protect and sustain the area's natural resources. After all, the environment is not just a backdrop to your life—it’s an integral part of it.\n\nWhile scientists and government agencies play a crucial role in disaster preparedness, community-level efforts are just as important. Programs focusing on public education and community drills are vital tools for ensuring that people know what to do in the event of a volcanic eruption. According to the National Academies of Sciences, investing in community preparedness can significantly mitigate the impact of natural disasters. This means that you, too, have a role to play in making sure your community is ready.\n\nCommunity preparedness isn't just about attending meetings or drills—it's about fostering a culture of readiness and resilience. It involves knowing your neighbors, understanding local resources, and having a clear plan for how to respond to emergencies. By participating in community efforts, you help create a network of support that can make all the difference when disaster strikes. After all, when it comes to facing natural threats, there’s strength in numbers.\n\nImagine receiving an alert on your phone that a volcanic eruption is imminent. That’s the power of early warning systems, designed to give people crucial lead time to evacuate and take protective measures. These systems utilize a combination of seismic data, satellite imagery, and other technological tools to provide timely alerts. For the Pacific Northwest, where the risk of an eruption is ever-present, these warning systems are a vital part of disaster management.\n\nBut early warnings are only as effective as the response they trigger. This means that you need to be ready to act quickly and decisively when an alert is issued. Familiarize yourself with the warning signs of volcanic activity and make sure you know the evacuation routes in your area. In doing so, you can turn a few moments’ notice into a potentially life-saving opportunity.\n\nThe field of geology is continually evolving, and that’s good news for anyone concerned about volcanic hazards. Ongoing research and technological innovations are providing new insights into the behavior of volcanoes. From advanced computer models to drone technology, scientists are developing tools that can help predict eruptions with greater accuracy. For the Pacific Northwest, this means a more robust understanding of the region’s volcanic threats.\n\nStaying informed about these scientific advancements can be both reassuring and empowering. It’s an invitation to engage with the science that’s shaping your world and to advocate for continued research and funding. Understanding the complexities of volcanic activity can transform fear into informed awareness. After all, knowledge is the best defense against the unknown.\n\nClimate change is altering weather patterns and environmental conditions worldwide, and its impact on volcanic activity is a growing area of study. Some researchers suggest that melting glaciers and shifting precipitation patterns could influence volcanic behavior. While the science is still evolving, it’s clear that climate change adds an extra layer of complexity to the already intricate dynamics of volcanism. For the Pacific Northwest, understanding these interactions is crucial for comprehensive disaster planning.\n\nFor you, this underscores the interconnectedness of environmental issues. It’s a reminder that addressing climate change is not just about reducing carbon footprints—it’s about understanding and mitigating its broader impacts. By supporting climate action, you’re contributing to a more stable and predictable natural environment. In a world of constant change, that kind of stability is invaluable.\n\nIn the event of a volcanic eruption, the effectiveness of emergency response infrastructure can be the difference between chaos and order. Robust communication systems, efficient transportation networks, and well-trained emergency personnel are all critical components. In the Pacific Northwest, efforts to strengthen this infrastructure are ongoing, but challenges remain. Understanding these efforts can help you appreciate the complexities of disaster management and the importance of supporting local initiatives.\n\nFor residents, this means being proactive in understanding the capabilities and limitations of local emergency services. Familiarize yourself with the resources available and how to access them in a crisis. By staying informed and engaged, you not only protect yourself but also contribute to a more resilient community. After all, successful emergency response is a collective effort.\n\nVolcanic eruptions don’t just reshape landscapes—they also impact the cultural and social fabric of affected areas. The Pacific Northwest, with its rich indigenous history and diverse communities, faces unique challenges and opportunities in this regard. Disasters can strain social bonds but also foster resilience and solidarity. Understanding the social dynamics at play can help you appreciate the human dimension of volcanic threats.\n\nFor you, this means recognizing the importance of community cohesion and cultural sensitivity in disaster preparedness. It’s about valuing the diverse perspectives and knowledge systems that can contribute to effective response and recovery efforts. By engaging with your community and honoring its cultural heritage, you help build a more inclusive and resilient society. In the face of natural threats, it’s this sense of community that often proves most enduring.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility for preparedness doesn’t just lie with scientists, government agencies, or community leaders—it’s a personal obligation as well. Having an emergency plan, maintaining a supply kit, and staying informed are crucial steps you can take. In the Pacific Northwest, where the risk of a volcanic eruption is ever-present, personal preparedness is not just advisable—it’s essential. By taking these steps, you not only protect yourself but also contribute to the safety and resilience of your community.\n\nThis isn’t about living in fear—it’s about living with awareness and intention. It’s about being proactive and empowered, understanding that preparedness is an ongoing process. In doing so, you not only mitigate the risks but also enhance your sense of control and peace of mind. After all, being prepared is not just about survival—it’s about thriving in the face of uncertainty.",

Air quality remains moderate for most of the region, with a mandatory wood-burning ban in effect through Tuesday for the South Coast Air Basin.\n\nThe NWS long-range forecast shows a Pacific storm could arrive as early as Dec. 22, with snow levels dropping in mountain communities – potentially complicating holiday travel.\n\n“There is a system that is very likely to bring us some widespread precipitation,” Montoya said. “Models don’t agree on when the rain begins or how much.”\n\nBut meteorologists caution that those hoping for a big boost to ski resorts may be disappointed.\n\n“Next week’s stormy pattern does not appear to be a big snowmaker for our area as the upper level trough will pull in moisture from the southwest initially, then a plume from the south joins in on the fun,” the Weather Service said in a bulletin. “Thus temperatures will remain too warm for any significant snow.”",

    "description": "A look at how the Cardinals split up their 66 offensive snaps against the Texans.",
    "fullText": "In the Arizona Cardinals' 40-20 loss to the Houston Texans on Sunday, 20 players participated in at least one of the 66 offensive snaps.\n\nQuarterback Jacoby Brissett, center Hjalte Froholdt, right guard Isaiah Adams and right tackle Kelvin Beachum played every snap. Left guard Jon Gaines II missed one snap, while tight end Trey McBride played all but five. Wide receiver Michael Wilson missed 10 and running back Michael Carter played all but 13 after Bam Knight was injured on the first Cardinals offensive snap of the game.\n\nRookie center/guard Hayden Conner played his first NFL offensive snaps with three.\n\nHow was the playing time divided up? Below are individual snap counts for every player who got in the game offensively, grouped by position.\n\nThe first number after each name is snaps and the second is the percentage. Players in bold were starters.\n\nActive, did not play: Kedon Slovis\n\nReserve/injured (eligible for return, but won’t): Kyler Murray\n\nBrissett had another 40-attempt game, completing 27 for 249 yards, three touchdowns, an interception and a 98.9 passer rating. He was sacked twice and ran three times for six yards.\n\nMichael Carter (53/80), Bam Knight (1/2), Emari Demercado (7/11), Corey Kiner (5/8)\n\nReserve/injured: Trey Benson, James Conner (eligible to return, but won’t)\n\nKnight was dropped for a loss of minus-2 yards on the Cardinals first offensive play of the game and was carted off after suffering an ankle injury. There was no further information on the severity of the injury.\n\nCarter had a productive game with 56 yards on 14 attempts, while adding 38 yards on three receptions. Active after missing the previous three games because of an ankle injury, Demarcado played only seven snaps and did little with one yard on one rush and no yards on two receptions because of one 5-yard loss. Kiner had two rushes for 11 yards on his five snaps.\n\nBenson’s 21-day practice window expired Thursday, so he will remain on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.\n\nMichael Wilson (56/85), Jalen Brooks (47/71), Trent Sherfield Sr. (14/21), Andre Baccellia (10/15)\n\nInactive: WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (injured), Xavier Weaver (injured)\n\nReserve/injured: Greg Dortch (eligible to return), Simi Fehoko (eligible to return), Zay Jones (eligible to return, but won’t)\n\nWilson had a quiet first half with one reception for six yards on four targets. However, he finished with five catches on 11 targets and an 11-yard touchdown. The only other wideout with targets was Brooks, who caught one of three for 19 yards.\n\nBaccellia played only 10 offensive snaps after suffering a neck injury returning a kickoff.\n\nTrey McBride (61/92), Elijah Higgins (46/70), Pharaoh Brown (11/17), Josiah Deguara (8/12)\n\nReserve/injured: Tip Reiman, Travis Vokolek (both eligible to return, but won’t)\n\nNo matter what defenses do to try and stop him, McBride continues to put up numbers. Targeted 13 times, he caught 12 for 134 yards and two touchdowns. It was his 16th consecutive game with at least five receptions, breaking Travis Kelce’s league record for tight ends.\n\nHe also has 105 receptions this season to become the first tight end in NFL history to register two consecutive 100-reception seasons. Kelce has hit the 100-catch barrier three times in his career, but never in consecutive seasons. The Cardinals overall record for receptions in one season in the 115 by DeAndre Hopkins in 2020. McBride also has 1,071 yards this season after having 1,146 last season. McBride needs 135 yards to pass Jackie Smith (1,205 in 1967) for the Cardinals record for most yards by a tight end in a season.\n\nWhen asked about the consecutive streak, McBride said, \"Sixteen games, for what? We've got to get more wins.\"\n\nHiggins had one catch for three yards Sunday and Brown had two for one yard.\n\nC Hjalte Froholdt (66/100), RG Isaiah Adams (66/100), RT Kelvin Beachum (66/100), LG Jon Gaines II (65/98), LT Josh Fryar (38/58), LT Demontrey Jacobs (37/56), G Hayden Conner (3/5)\n\nInactive: G Evan Brown (personal), LT Paris Johnson Jr. (injured)\n\nActive/did not play: T Christian Jones\n\nReserve/injured: RG Will Hernandez (eligible to return), RT Jonah Williams (eligible to return, but won’t)\n\nBrown was inactive handling a family matter for the second consecutive game. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said coaches wanted to see Fryar and Jacobs play and they shared snaps at left tackle while also being an extra blocker on run situations.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Stephanie Vaquer is still Women's World Champion, but she won her \"WWE Raw\" match against Judgment Day's Raquel Rodriguez by interference when WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella came through the crowd and caused a disqualification. Rodriguez had established herself as number one contender to Vaquer's title last week, when she took out Bella as she was attempting to demand her rematch after her loss to Vaquer at Survivor Series.\n\nRodriguez tried to overpower Vaquer to start off their match, and she got a lot of offense in throughout the bout. Vaquer went to the top rope to hit a flying cross body, but her challenger caught her and slammed her to the canvas. The champion tried to get Rodriguez in an armbar around the ropes, but before the referee could even begin a five count, Rodriguez had Vaquer up and hit a power bomb.\n\nVaquer hit the Devil's Kiss in the middle of the ring, causing Rodriguez to retreat to the corner where Vaquer hit her with a meteora. She tried to get Rodriguez up for the SVB, but couldn't. On the outside of the ring, Rodriguez caught a second Vaquer cross body and looked to throw her into the ring post, but Vaquer countered and sent Rodriguez face-first into the post.\n\nIt was then that Bella came out of the crowd to attack Vaquer. She connected with the Rack Attack 2.0 in the ring and later in a backstage segment, Bella said she demanded respect as a legend in the business from the other women.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "The Associated Press college football All-American Teams were announced on Monday and eight Ohio State players were named.",
    "fullText": "Now that the 2025 college football regular season is over, we are going to continue to hear about postseason awards and various All-American teams. One of the biggest of those is the Associated Press All-American team, and we saw that announced on Monday, with a lot of Ohio State players involved.\n\nIn total, eight Buckeyes were named across the three teams, with four of those keeping their hope alive in becoming consensus first-team All-Americans. Safety Caleb Downs, defensive tackle Kayden McDonald, linebacker Arvell Reese, and wide receiver Jeremiah Smith were all named to the first team, with all four already being named to the Walter Camp First-Team as well.\n\nBut that wasn't all, because four more Ohio State players appeared on other teams, with linebacker Sonny Styles and wide receiver Carnell Tate being named second-team All-Americans by the Associated Press, while defensive end Caden Curry and quarterback Julian Sayin appeared on the third team.\n\nSmith, widely known as the best receiver in the game, was snubbed for the Biletnikoff Award on Friday. He's caught 80 passes for 1,086 yards and 11 touchdowns. You can bet that he'll make more All-American lists going forward. Smith has had back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons and still has his junior year to go.McDonald has flashed on the scene this year in the middle of the defensive line and is a potential first-round NFL draft pick come April. He clogs up the middle and has tallied 57 tackles with eight tackles for loss and three sacks.\n\nReese has also come out of nowhere to be considered one of the best linebackers in the country and also a potential first-round NFL draft pick. He has been used all over the field because of his ability to run and react to plays at several levels. He's had 62 tackles with ten tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks.Need a news break? Downs has already taken home the Jim Thorpe Award and is considered by many as the best defensive player in the game, though he did not win the Bednarik Award. Like Reese, he is one of the linchpins of the defense, often lining up at all three levels. He has registered 60 total tackles with five tackles for loss, two interceptions, and a sack so far this year.\n\n🥇Team AP All-Americans 🇺🇸 \n\n🏅 @caleb_downs2 \n🏅 @Jermiah_Smith1 \n🏅 @arvxll \n🏅 @KMac_DT pic.twitter.com/gpQQxNAAOb\n\n— Ohio State Football (@OhioStateFB) December 15, 2025\n\nThe announcement of All-American teams will continue on Tuesday when the AFCA team will be announced. If any of the four first-teamers appear, they will officially garner consensus All-American honors. I like their chances, and even if any of the four don't appear Tuesday, there's still the Sporting News All-American Team on Wednesday, and the Football Writers' Association of America on Thursday.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuckeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Ohio State news, notes, and opinion.

    "description": "Kentucky’s head coach believes shooting success is coming as the Wildcats adjust and find continuity.",
    "fullText": "Mark Pope isn’t panicking about Kentucky basketball’s offense, even if the results haven’t fully shown up yet. Instead, Pope remains confident that patience and adjustments will pay off as the season moves along.\n\nPope acknowledged this week that Kentucky has tweaked its style of play to better suit its current personnel, focusing on creating space where players feel most comfortable. While the offense has at times looked “mocked up” and physical, Pope views that as part of the growth process rather than a long-term identity.\n\n“I actually think our team really, listen, by the end of the year, I think we will be really dangerous shooting the ball,” Pope said. “I’ve never been on a team where the NOAH numbers don’t actually eventually transport their way into games. I just have never seen that. So with that history, our expectation is this team will be really dangerous.”\n\nKentucky’s shooting metrics in practice suggest better days ahead, even if the game results haven’t matched yet, although we have seen some great performances against cupcake teams. Pope emphasized that the biggest hurdle right now is continuity, learning how hard the Wildcats must play to win, and building confidence through small successes.\n\nAs that confidence grows, Pope believes the game will begin to open up offensively. At the same time, he likes that his team is learning how to survive and compete in rugged, defensive-minded games, something he believes will matter most in March.\n\n“If we do this right,” Pope said, “it’s going to bode well for us when we get to the latter part of the season and the post-season.”\n\nFor Pope, the vision is clear: a Kentucky team capable of winning ugly and exploding offensively when it matters most.",

    "fullText": "As the Ohio State football team prepares for either Texas A&M or Miami in the Cotton Bowl Classic, the recruiting train keeps rolling. Currently, the Buckeyes have seven committed players in the 2027 class, but that number could jump to eight very soon. Four-star linebacker Quinton Cypher is down to four schools, and OSU has made the cut.\n\nCypher hails from Raleigh, North Carolina, and is rated as the No. 11 linebacker in the class according to 247Sports composite rankings. Watching this young man on film, he is explosive, quick to the ball, and can catch players from behind. Recently, Cypher narrowed his choices down to four schools, which include Ohio State, Alabama, Georgia, and Miami.\n\nHowever, it seems that OSU may have the inside track. According to insiders, the Buckeyes and Bulldogs are in a battle for this one, but On3's Steve Wiltfong logged a crystal ball prediction for Cypher to choose the Scarlet and Gray shortly after the list was trimmed to four.\n\nNEWS: Four-Star LB Quinton Cypher is down to 4 schools, he tells me for @rivals⁰⁰The 6’3 215 LB from Raleigh, NC will announce his commitment this week \n\nWhere Should He Go?https://t.co/dNj283DNzJ pic.twitter.com/J0wBO6prGX\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) December 14, 2025\n\nIt sounds as if we'll have an answer sooner rather than later, as the 6-foot-3, 215-pound linebacker will make his announcement sometime this week.

    "description": "Kamari Ramsey, Makai Lemon, Ja'Kobi Lane, Lake McRee and Eric Gentry are among the players who will not be playing for USC against TCU in the Alamo Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Following Monday afternoon’s practice at Howard Jones Field, USC coach Lincoln Riley addressed the media for the first time since the Trojans’ victory over crosstown rival UCLA on Nov. 29.\n\nUSC (9-3), ranked No. 16 in the AP poll, is preparing to play Texas Christian (9-4) on Dec. 30 in the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio. USC finished 7-2 in its second season in the Big Ten and won four of its last five games, the only setback during that stretch being a 42-27 loss to Oregon, which is the No. 5 seed in the College Football Playoff.\n\nRiley announced that safety Kamari Ramsey, receivers Makai Lemon and Ja’Kobi Lane, tight end Lake McRee and linebacker Eric Gentry will not play in the Alamo Bowl. Lane declared for the NFL draft on Monday.\n\n“Anthony Lucas and Bishop Fitzgerald want to play in the game but are dealing with injuries and trying to get back ... we’ll see how that goes,” Riley said. “Kilian O’Connor and Elijah Paige and Jahkeem Stewart all had surgery and will be ready to roll.”\n\nAsked about signing the No. 1 recruiting class for 2026, Riley said: “It was a great day. We tried to keep the focus on building next year’s team. The amount of guys that we signed is a big portion of it and as we start to look ahead ... half of our day and maybe even more is pointing towards next year and coming years. Meanwhile, obviously getting ready for this bowl game. It was a lot of hard work to add talent and people who care about this place and starting to put next year’s team together has been exciting here these last few weeks.”\n\nRiley has a 35-27 record in his four seasons at USC and is hoping to improve his bowl record to 3-1. He guided the Trojans to wins in the 2023 Holiday Bowl and 2024 Las Vegas Bowl.\n\nRiley watched the CIF state Open Division bowl game between Santa Margarita (coached by former Trojans quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer) and De La Salle on Saturday and was impressed by the performance of USC commit Trent Mosley, who had 11 catches for 183 yards and two touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in the Eagles’ 47-13 win.\n\n“He was someone we targeted very early on,” Riley said. “I thought he was super impressive and it was important. He’s one of the best receivers in the country. He’s proven that and he just played out of his mind. It’s a great family and he’s a really smart kid.”\n\nAsked what advice he gives to players who are deciding what to do next in their careers, Riley said: “Yes, it’s an important decision. The guys that make the right decision no matter what it is get a leg up on the rest of their lives. Consequently, a wrong decision can be catastrophic. That’s the world we all live in. I just try to educate them on their options. I don’t like telling guys you should do this or you shouldn’t do that. It’s more about, here’s this option, this is what it would look like, here’s what you need to consider. Sometimes the decision’s pretty clear one way or another, other times it’s not. I try to give them as much guidance as I possibly can.”\n\nGiven that USC will be missing quite a few players who were key contributors throughout the season, Riley is not ruling out the possibility of younger players seeing action against TCU.\n\n“There’s gonna be guys all over the place who are going to have opportunities,” Riley said. “All sides of the ball, all position groups, maybe it’s some of the guys you saw a little bit during the season and in some instances you’ll see guys get some burn in this game that haven’t played at all or very little. Bowl games are great, but days like this are the most valuable part of it because we’re just pouring reps into all of these guys, it’s super competitive and the energy level is just different. All these guys feel it’s their time.”\n\nRiley admitted he and his staff had to make hard decisions based on the incoming freshmen, a majority of whom are spring enrollees.\n\n“It’s huge, it’s a high, high number that are going to be here and it’s important,” he said. “We’ve had to make a bunch of roster decisions in the last couple of weeks. We have a large number of players who have already signed and some of the decisions we had to make were based on knowing what we have coming in, and when you sign as many as we did, you’re going to have tough decisions to make.”\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

All my brothers did sports. So I’ve been doing them since third grade.”\n\nShe’s played numerous sports throughout the years, but truly found her stride in cross country, even setting a school record her freshman year. But before her season even started this year, she tore her ACL, an injury that can put athletes on the bench for more than 9 months.\n\n“It’s been an emotional journey because running is my big thing,” Harris said. “I didn’t know if I’d be able to run this season with my team and keep our streaks alive and just be there for my team because that’s what I love doing.”\n\nThrough her recovery process, she said she found out she might be able to compete this season.\n\n“I got told by my doctors that if I put in the work at physical therapy this summer, that I would be able to get back to running before surgery,” Harris said.\n\nSo that’s what she did, working every week to get better and better to overcome this injury while pushing her team to grow together through a difficult season.\n\n“In a strange way, the injury has grown us all because as a coaching staff, we’ve been able to see our kids rally around one another, and other kids got stronger and maintained that going into the season,” Girls’ athletic coordinator JB Littlejohn said.\n\nDuring this recovery, Harris became an inspiration to her teammates and peers.\n\n“She was our athlete of the Year last year as a freshman,” Littlejohn said. “Her competitive nature, combined with her work ethic, you put that with the natural talent, that’s why we’re seeing what she’s doing.”\n\nThrough determination and hard work, Landry and her team made it all the way to the state cross country meet.\n\n“It was very like congratulating, and I felt like my efforts and everything that I went through paid off finally,” Harris said.\n\nYou can now stream KETK and FOX51 News live 24/7 on your smart TV with KETK+, our brand-new app!

Jovic took a hard foul from Collin Murray-Boyles while driving to the basket and fell to the floor 12 seconds after he entered the game.\n\nScottie Barnes added 17 points and 10 rebounds and Immanuel Quickley finished with 15 points for the Raptors, who made 16 3-pointers.

They remain in first place in the East while the Celtics fall to fourth and have dropped back-to-back games for the first time since November 3rd.

    "fullText": "Orioles face massive Yankees and Red Sox challenge in Michael King pursuit originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles find themselves facing massive odds to sign free agent pitcher Michael King, as two other American League East teams have joined the race for the former San Diego Padres pitcher. The right-handed ace has reportedly narrowed down the list to these three AL East teams, and as per sources, a decision could come soon.\n\nAccording to MLB insider Ken Rosenthal, the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox are both interested in the proven commodity. The insider has suggested that for the Orioles to get their hands on King, they'll have to outbid both AL East competitors, which will be a massive task, given the big market status.\n\nKing actually has local ties with Boston, as he went to Bishop Hendricken High School in Rhode Island and pitched for Boston College. Meanwhile, the Yankees are also associated with the pitcher since they traded for him from the Miami Marlins in November 2017. Earlier, there were rumors that the Chicago Cubs were an interested party, but now it appears his free agency has settled down for an AL East competitor.\n\nThe right-hander is a proven commodity in the majors. He was part of the transaction that sent Juan Soto to the New York Yankees before the 2024 season, thereby landing with the Padres, where he became a reliable arm, posting a sub-3.00 ERA in 173.2 innings. Due to shoulder and knee inflammation this year, he could only make 15 starts, recording a 3.44 ERA with a 1.20 WHIP.\n\nThe Orioles have already shown signs of improvement this offseason as they added Pete Alonso on a five-year, $155 million deal. Adding a reliable arm like King to their rotation will enhance their rotation, which also includes established pieces such as Trevor Rogers and Kyle Bradish, and will help Baltimore get back to the postseason after missing it in 2025.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Orioles, despite the uphill task to outdo AL East giants, can get King to sign with them.\n\nOrioles' Pete Alonso shares heartwarming reason behind new jersey number\n\nOrioles get lackluster grade for $28 million Ryan Helsley signing\n\nOrioles' next roster move after Ryan Helsley $28 million deal is clear\n\nOrioles sign former Mets, Cardinals All-Star closer to two-year deal",

    "fullText": "Cade Cunningham scored 32 points as the Detroit Pistons held off the Boston Celtics 112-105 to extend their lead at the top of the Eastern Conference standings on Monday.\n\nPistons point guard Cunningham produced another potent offensive display in a back-and-forth duel that saw the lead change hands 15 times before Detroit pulled away in the final minutes.\n\nCunningham, averaging just under 27 points this season, rattled in six three-pointers in 11-of-21 shooting from the field to help Detroit improve to 21-5 in the Eastern Conference.\n\nBut Detroit were made to work hard for their fourth straight win after a dogged performance from Boston, who led by as many as 12 points in the second quarter before being reeled in.\n\n\"We love games like this that are tough, muddy,\" Cunningham said. \"I think the game getting that way turns us up a little bit more.\"\n\nDetroit's starters were backed by 47 points from the bench, with Caris LeVert coming on to add 13 points in 19 minutes on court and Jaden Ivey finishing with 10 points.\n\n\"We're deep -- we got starters up and down the roster,\" Cunningham said. \"Guys who come in and do their job better than anybody in the league. It's fun to play with.\"\n\nJaylen Brown led Boston's scoring with 34 points while Derrick White finished with 31.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors improved to 16-11 to move into third place in the Eastern Conference with a 106-96 road win over the Miami Heat.\n\nBrandon Ingram's 28 points laid the foundation for Toronto, who outscored Miami 32-19 in the fourth quarter to wrap up the win.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI – The payoff for five days off? A fifth straight loss.\n\nWhether playing games in bunches or otherwise, it is not going well for the Miami Heat, this time falling 106-96 Monday night to the Toronto Raptors at Kaseya Center.\n\nStill without a victory since Dec. 1, the Heat this time could not overcome another injury absence from guard Tyler Herro.\n\nFactor in an ugly early tumble that left Heat forward Nikola Jovic with an elbow injury and the return from the five-day break seemingly only pushed Erik Spoelstra’s team further toward a breaking point.\n\nAs has been the case in recent games, the offense again sputtered, much of the early-season energy missing.\n\nSo while the Raptors snapped their four-game losing streak, the Heat’s moved to five.\n\nBam Adebayo led the Heat with 20 points and 10 rebounds, with Norman Powell also scoring 20. Otherwise, not nearly enough amid Herro’s absence.\n\nBrandon Ingram led the Raptors with 28 points.\n\nFive degrees of Heat from Monday night’s game:\n\n— Game flow: The Raptors led 23-22 after the first period, with the Heat then moving to a 52-46 halftime lead. From there, the Heat went into the fourth quarter up 77-74.\n\nThe Raptors swiftly moved to a 91-81 lead with 7:31 to play, putting the Heat in catch-up mode from that stage, as the offense stalled.\n\nFrom there, the Heat closed within 100-96 with 1:28 to play on a pair of Powell free throws, but the inability to get a defensive stop on the other and then the Heat’s 19th turnover effectively ended it.\n\n— No Herro: Having returned from a two-game absence in last Tuesday night’s NBA Cup loss in Orlando, Herro again was listed as out with a toe contusion, his third game missed with the ailment since Dec. 5. That is in addition to the 17 games he missed at the start of the season after September ankle surgery.\n\nWith guard Pelle Larsson out due to an ankle sprain, it resulted in the first Heat start for Simone Fontecchio, in an opening lineup rounded out by Adebayo, Powell, Andrew Wiggins and Davin Mitchell.\n\nThat gave the Heat their 11th lineup in their 26 games.\n\n— Jovic lost: Jovic left in the first period with his right arm in a protective brace after a hard fall.\n\nThe Heat listed it as an elbow injury, ruling him out for the night.\n\nJovic, who had been held out of the rotation in two of the previous three games, got the opportunity for the playing time with Herro and Larsson sidelined.\n\nJovic entered Monday night’s game with 3:50 to play in the opening period and was forced out 12 seconds later.\n\nBecause Jovic was unable to shoot the free throws from the foul on Toronto’s Collin Murray-Boyles, the Raptors were allowed to select the replacement shooter. They selected seldom-used forward Keshad Johnson, who entered 7 of 11 from the line, making both replacement free throws.\n\nJohnson then remained in the game, taking the minutes that would have gone to Jovic.\n\nA stretcher initially was brought to the court, with Jovic instead able to walk off the court while assisted.\n\n— Still struggling: For the first time in a week, Fontecchio hit a shot, after going 0 for 5 in last week’s loss in Orlando.\n\nBut the struggles remain ongoing, with Fontecchio closing 1 of 5 from the field Monday night, including 1 of 4 from beyond the arc.\n\n— Up next: It’s now out on the road for a three-game trip for the Heat after a two-day break, opening with a back-to-back set on Thursday and Friday nights against the Brooklyn Nets and then the Boston Celtics, with the trip concluding Sunday against the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Heat’s next home game also will be against the Raptors, on Dec. 23.",

    "description": "Surprise announcement that IHRA has acquired NHRA mainstay Maple Grove Raceway triggers scramble to replace playoff opener.",
    "fullText": "U.S. 131 Motorsports Park at Martin, Mich., will host its first NHRA national event as the opener to the six-race showdown in the Mission Foods Drag Racing Series.\n\nMaple Grove Raceway, near Reading, Pa., changed hands, effective Friday, from NHRA sanction to rival IHRA affiliation.\n\nReturn to Michigan for first time since 1960 U.S. Nationals buoys NHRA’s 2026 calendar.\n\nKoretsky family says move to IHRA satisfies “innovative, forward-thinking approach [that] this sport has been missing.”\n\nThe upcoming inaugural Great Lakes Nationals Sept. 18-20 at Martin, Michigan’s US 131 Motorsports Park represents more than a schedule change in the NHRA’s 2026 Countdown to the Championship.\n\nThe abrupt change in the NHRA’s 2026 calendar came with the rival International Hot Rod Association’s announcement Friday at the PRI Show at Indianapolis that it has acquired Maple Grove Raceway, marking a significant milestone for the sport of drag racing.\n\nThis 15th of 20 races during the NHRA’s 75th anniversary season—the first of six playoff races in the Mission Foods Drag Racing Series—signifies a major shift in power in the straightline sport. It exposes significant disagreement about management styles between the NHRA and a resurgent IHRA. Maple Grove Raceway, near Reading, Pennsylvania, has been one of the NHRA’s strongest pillars for a national spectrum of events.\n\nFrom the NHRA’s perspective, it’s a bit of a coup, too. The Great Lakes Nationals will mark the first major NHRA event in Michigan, the center of the US auto manufacturing industry, since the 1960 US Nationals at Detroit Dragway. And it will showcase one of the most updated and family friendly facilities in the country.\n\nThe Martin, Michigan, race has become one of four new racetracks on the NHRA schedule for 2026. Maryland International Raceway, South Georgia Motorsports Park, and Rockingham (North Carolina) Dragway already have joined the 20-race lineup.\n\nSo despite the IHRA’s rekindled rivalry with the NHRA, the latest move only indicates the overall health of the sport.\n\nBut Friday’s news was a blow to the NHRA, which announced this past September that it had a Saturday sellout crowd for the fourth-straight year at its Countdown to the Championship kickoff at Maple Grove Raceway.\n\nAlways one of the most popular dragstrips on the national tour, owner Kenny Koretsky and family raised the bar by sinking millions of dollars and tons of energy into customer service at the historic Eastern Pennsylvania venue since they purchased it in 2022.\n\nSo the so-called “House of Chaos”—nicknamed for former Pro Stock racer Kenny Koretsky’s reputation as “Captain Chaos”—plunged the NHRA into a bit of chaos for a few days. Unsuccessful repeated attempts to contact the NHRA since Friday produced a prepared statement Monday about the playoff opener’s move to Michigan.\n\nWhile the NHRA has moved on to its fresh affiliation with US 131 Motorsports Park, the IHRA takes over one of the NHRA’s biggest revenue-streaming facilities.\n\n“This is a track with deep roots and an even stronger future,” IHRA owner Darryl Cuttell said. “Maple Grove represents what racing should be: competitive, welcoming, and centered [on] racers and families. Bringing it under the IHRA umbrella is not just a business decision—it’s a commitment to strengthening the sport and investing in its long-term success.”\n\nThe Koretsky family emphasized the personal significance of this transition.\n\n“Maple Grove has always been more than a racetrack to our family—it is home, not just for us, but for generations of racers,” the Koretskys said. “Our mission has always been to preserve this facility and ensure it remains a premier racing destination. Seeing Maple Grove join the IHRA family feels like a natural and meaningful next step for the sport.\n\n“Meeting Darryl and Leah from the IHRA was truly eye-opening. Their vision, work ethic, and genuine passion for racers and fans are unmatched,” they said. “Their innovative, forward-thinking approach is exactly what this sport has been missing. The IHRA shares our values—making racing affordable, fun, and family-centered. This new chapter is about honoring Maple Grove’s legacy while elevating the experience for future generations.”\n\nThe Koretsky family said it looks forward to working closely with the IHRA throughout 2026 and beyond.\n\nAs for the NHRA’s new focus, President Glen Cromwell said Monday in a statement that the Martin, Michigan, event is “a[n] historic milestone for the facility, and it’s another terrific way to celebrate our 75th anniversary season, bringing the incredible action of NHRA drag racing to the passionate fan base in Michigan.” He said it “will be extremely meaningful during our 75th anniversary season, as it reflects NHRA’s continued commitment to growing the sport and bringing championship-level NHRA racing to outstanding venues. The track’s dedication to its racers and fans, and its enthusiasm as a new NHRA Member Track makes it an excellent addition to the national tour.”\n\nUS 131 Motorsports Park will also host a yet-to-be defined NHRA national open July 8-9, leading into a July 10-12 Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series (sportsman) divisional event.",

    "fullText": "I have said this before, but I always have the best intentions on writing when I go on vacation, but it never happens. Good news for you is that you get two weeks of updates of Bayern loanees all wrapped into one article! We will be looking back at the entire month of December so far. This includes the last round of Pokal (and other cup competitions), a European competition window, and two weekends of league play. Pertetz got back into action and Krattenmacher had a goal and an assist off the bench in the Pokal matches. Nübel allowed five goals against Bayern, but then had two great results since. Palhinha has been on a terrible streak without a shot attempt in four matches. Plus, Guzmán helped her team secure a league-cup double in the final match of the season.\n\nThere are nine players from on loan from the first team.\n\nThere are four players on loan to the German Bundesliga: Alexander Nübel, Ibrahimović, Daniel Peretz, and Armindo Sieb.\n\nNübel was on the bench for Stuttgart’s 2-0 win against Bochum in the DFB-Pokal.\n\nHe returned to the starting lineup against his parent club that weekend against at home against Bayern. Things did not go well for him. Although he saved five shots, he also conceded five goals — one of which was due to an error he made. He received no help from his offense and fell at home 5-0.\n\nNübel remained in the lineup for Stuttgart’s home match against Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Europa League. He only saved one attempt on goal in this match, but also conceded a goal. Luckily he did receive scoring support from his team in this match and Suttgart won 4-1.\n\nStuttgart travelled to face Werder Bremen on Sunday. Nübel was in goal again and saved all three shots on goal that he faced and earned the shutout for Stuttgart. His teammates were able to score four road goals to earn a 4-0 win far from home.\n\nStuttgart will host Hoffenheim on Saturday.\n\nIbrahimović was on the bench for the beginning of Heidenheim’s match against Freiburg. He came into the match at halftime with his team down 1-0. He did not have a shot attempt but created two chances for his teammates to shoot. Although he did not directly contribute to a goal, his teammates were able to score two goals and earn the 2-1 win at home.\n\nIbrahimović started for Heidenheim on the road against St Pauli in Hamburg. He had one shot — on goal — and created three chances for his teammates to shoot. This was not enough for Heidenheim to find more than one goal and they fell on the road 2-1.\n\nHeidenheim will host Bayern on Sunday in the final fixture of the calendar year.\n\nPeretz started for Hamburg against Holstein Kiel in the DFB-Pokal last Wednesday. The match was scoreless after 90 minutes and Peretz kept a shutout through 118 minutes. He had three saves in that time, but the one goal was enough to send the match to penalties. In penalties he only saved one attempt but he allowed four goals. They fell 4-2 in penalties and HSV were eliminated from the tournament.\n\nPeretz was on the bench for the next two matches: a 3-2 home win against Werder Bremen and a 4-1 road loss against Hoffenheim.\n\nSieb was not in the matchday lineup for Mainz’ 1-0 home loss against Borussia Monchengladbach. He was on the bench for Mainz’ 1-1 draw in Poland against Lech Poznan in the Conference League and a 2-2 road draw against Bayern in league play, but he did not get into either match.\n\nMainz will host Turkish side Samsunspur on Thursday in the Conference League. They will also host St Pauli on Sunday in the last league match of the year.\n\nThere are two player on loan to the English Premier League: João Palhinha and Jonah Kusi-Asare.\n\nPalhinha was on bench on 12/3 for Spurs’ 2-2 draw at Newcastle but did not get into the match.\n\nPalhinha was again on the bench last weekend at home against Brentford. He entered the match in the 65th minute up 2-0. He did not have a shot attempt nor did he create a shot for his teammates to shoot either. The score did not change while he was on the pitch as Spurs earned the 2-0 win at home.\n\nSpurs hosted Slavia Prague on Tuesday in the Champions League and Palhinha returned to the starting lineup. He again did not have a shot nor a chance created for his teammates to shoot, but Spurs were able to score three goals through an own goal and two penalties. Palhinha helped Spurs keep a shutout with three clearances, an interception, and five recoveries. Spurs earned a lackluster 3-0 home win.\n\nSpurs were away to Nottinham Forest on Sunday and Palhinha started back on the bench. He came into the match in the 59th minute right after Spurs went down 2-0. He again had zero shot attempts and zero chances created for his teammates to shoot. He helped back on defense again with two clearances and four recoveries, but this was not enough to keep Forest from scoring again. Spurs fell 3-0 on the road.\n\nTottenham will host Liverpool on Saturday.\n\nKusi-Asare started on the bench for Fulham as they hosted Manchester City on 12/3. He entered the match in the second half with his team down 5-3. He did not have a shot attempt and created one shot for his teammates to shoot. Fulham were able to score one more, but could not find an equalizer, falling 5-4 at home.\n\nFulham host cross-town rivals Crystal Palace last weekend. Kusi-Asare was on the bench, but did not make it into the match for their 2-1 loss. He was not in the matchday squad for the 3-2 road win against Burnley.\n\nFulham will go on the road to face Newcastle in the EFL Cup on Wednesday in their only match this week.\n\nBryan Zaragoza is the only player on loan to Spain’s La Liga.\n\nZaragoza was not in the matchday squad for Celta Vigo’s Copa del Rey match against second division Sant Andreu. Celta Vigo advanced to the next round after both teams scored in extra time, requiring penalties. They won the penalty shootout 7-6.\n\nZaragoza returned to the squad and started at Real Madrid last weekend. He did not have a shot attempt but assisted the opening goal in the 53rd minute to put his team up 1-0. Ten minutes later Madrid’s Garcia received two yellows within two minutes. Zaragoza was subbed off in the 71st minute and watched Madrid do the same thing in stoppage time as Carreras received two quick yellows and went down to nine men. Celta Vigo scored again directly after and secured a 2-0 win on the road.\n\nCelta Vigo returned home to host Italy’s Bologna in the Europa League. After assisting Swedberg against Madrid, Swedberg returned the favor and assisted Zaragoza’s opening goal in the 17th minute. That was his only shot attempt and he also had zero chances created for his teammates to shoot. He was subbed off at halftime with his goal still the only one in the match. Unfortunately his goal was not enough for his teammates to see the win out. Two second half goals for the road team led to a 2-1 road loss.\n\nZaragoza was on the bench for Celta Vigo’s 2-0 home win against Athletic Club Bilbao, but did not make it into the match.\n\nCelta Vigo will play twice on the road this week: on Wedenday against second division side Albacete in the Copa del Rey and on Saturday in league play against Real Oviedo.\n\nLovro Zvonarek is the only player on loan from the first team to the Swiss Super League.\n\nZvonarek started for Grasshopper in their lone win this month so far on the road against Cham in the Swiss Cup. He did not directly contribute to a goal, but his team scored two quick goals in the first half. He was subbed off in the 62nd minute with his team up 2-0. Cham scored a late goal in stoppage time, but it was not enough. Grasshopper won 2-1 to advance to the next round.\n\nZvonarek started again for Grasshopper last weekend in a home league match against Servette. He had four shots — three blocked and one missed wide — and two chances created for his teammates to shoot. Zvonarek was on the field for the entire match, but could not help his teammates find a goal, and they fell 1-0 at home.\n\nGrasshopper travelled to face Sion on Saturday. Zvonarek started again and played the full 90 minutes. He did not have a shot attempt and had two chances created. He also helped back on defense with an interception and seven recoveries. Grasshopper were shutout again in this match and fell 1-0 on the road.\n\nGrasshopper will travel to face Young Boys on the road on Wednesday and then will host St. Gallen on Sunday for their last match of 2025.\n\nThere are two players from the first team on loan to the 2. Bundesliga: Maurice Krattenmacher and Tarek Buchman.\n\nHertha BSC faced Kaiserslautern at home in the DFB-Pokal on 12/2. Krattenmacher started on the bench and saw a three-goal first half for his team. Hertha scored one more goal before bringing him on in the 72nd minute, up 4-1. Just three minutes later, he recorded an assist on Hertha’s fifth goal. In the 80th minute Krattenmacher scored the sixth and final goal as Hertha cruised to a massive 6-1 home win.\n\nKrattenmacher started on the bench for Hertha’s home league match against Magdeburg last weekend. He entered the match in the 65th minute with his team down 1-0. He had two shots — both blocked — and created one shot for his teammates to shoot. Unfortunately there were not able to find a goal and Magdeburg scored a late goal to end Hertha’s winning streak with a 2-0 shutout for the road team.\n\nHertha travelled to face Greuther Fürth on Friday. Krattenmacher entered the match in the 86th minute after a wild back and forth match led to a 3-3 score. He had one shot on goal and created a chance for his teammates to shoot, but it was not enough to find a winner. The match ended 3-3.\n\nHertha will finish off the year with a home match against Arminia Bielefeld on Friday.\n\nBuchmann is no longer on the injury list, but has not made it back onto a matchday squad since. He missed the 2-2 draw at home against local rivals Greuther Fürth and the 1-0 road loss against Schalke 04.\n\nNürnberg will host Aseko’s Hannover 96 for their last match of the year.\n\nThere are seven players on loan from the second team.\n\nThere are two players on loan from the second team in the 2. Bundesliga: Noel Aseko and Paul Scholl.\n\nAseko started last weekend for Hannover 96 on the road to Preussen Münster. He did not have a shot attempt nor did he create a shot attempt for his teammates. In fact, he had the least amount of touches for anyone that played the full 90 minutes. Hannover took a two-goal lead into the 90th minute but allowed two stoppage time goals — including one from Bavarial Loan Works alum, Oliver Batista-Meier — and had to settle for a 2-2 draw on the road.\n\nHannover hosted Bochum on Saturday. He again had a low number of touches, but this time only played 82 minutes. He again did not have a shot, nor did he create any chances. His best stat was his 100% completed passes, even if he only attempted 12 passes. The match ended scoreless.\n\nHannover will finish the year with a trip to nothern Bavaria to take on Nürnberg.\n\nScholl was on the bench for KSC’s 3-2 road loss to SV Darmstadt but did not make it onto the pitch.\n\nScholl was on the bench against as Karlsruhe hosted Paderborn on Saturday. He came into the match in the 82nd minute when KSC was down three goals and a man. One minute later a second Karlsruhe player was sent off. Scholl had just six touches in his short time on the pitch. Paderborn added a fourth goal and won 4-0.\n\nKSC will be on the road against Bochum on Saturday.\n\nMax Schmitt is the only player on loan in the 3. Liga.\n\nSchmitt was the second keeper for Ulm’s 1-0 win away to Viktoria Köln and a 5-3 home loss against VfL Osnabrück.\n\nUlm will face RW Essen on the road on Saturday.\n\nThere are two players on loan in the Regionalliga Südwest: Benedikt Wimmer and David Emmanuel.\n\nWimmer was not in the matchday squad for Sandhausen’s 3-2 win over Hessen Kassel in their final match of the year.\n\nEmmanuel was on the bench for Kassel’s 3-2 home loss against Sandhausen but did not make it onto the pitch. This was Kassel’s final match of the year\n\nJohnathan Asp Jensen is the only player from the second league on loan to the Swiss Super League.\n\nAsp started for Grasshopper on the road against Cham in the Swiss Cup back on 12/2. He did not directly contribute to a goal, but his team scored two quick goals in the first half. Asp was subbed off in the 76th minute with his team up 2-0. The home team scored a late goal in second half stoppage time, but it was not enough. Grasshopper won 2-1 to advance to the next round.\n\nAsp started last weekend in a home league match against Servette and played the full 90 minutes. He had one shot — blocked before it got to the keeper — and two chances for his teammates to shoot. Asp was not able to help his team find a goal and they fell 1-0 at home.\n\nAsp started for Grasshopper again on the road against Sion. He had a busy day with seven shot attempts — two on goal, four missed high or wide, and one that hit the crossbar — and created one chance for his teammates to shoot. His seventh and final shot attempt came from the penalty spot. His shot was on goal but he was not able to get it past Sion’s keeper. This would have been a late equlizer but instead Grasshopper fell 1-0 on the road.\n\nGrasshopper will travel to face Young Boys on the road on Wednesday and then will host St. Gallen on Sunday for their last match of 2025.\n\nMaximilian Hennig is the only player on loan to the Austrian Bundesliga.\n\nHennig started last weekend for Hartberg at home against LASK. He assisted a goal in the 25th minute to make it 2-0. He also helped on defense with four clearances and a recovery. He was subbed off at halftime with his team up 2-1 and up a man after a late first half red card. He watched a crazy second half as the keeper, Bavarian Loan Works alum Tom Hülsmann received two yellows and was also sent off. LASK equalized in second half stoppage time and the match ended with a 2-2 draw.\n\nHennig was not on the matchday squad for Hartberg’s final match of year — a 2-1 win against WSG Tirol.\n\nMudaser Sedat is the only person on loan to Austria’s second league.\n\nSedat was not in the matchday squad for Amstetten’s 3-3 road draw against Sturm Graz II. Incidentally, Amstetten’s keeper was also sent off in this match. He also missed Amstetten’s last match of the year, a 2-1 win against Admira Wacker.\n\nThere are two players on loan from the women’s team.\n\nEdna Imade is the only player on loan to Spain’s Primera División Femenina.\n\nImade was on the bench for Sociedad’s trip to face Real Madrid. She came into the match in the 58th minute with her team down 1-0. She only had four touches in the time she was on the pitch but created a chance for her teammates to shoot. Her efforts were not enough and Sociedad fell 1-0 on the road.\n\nImade started for Sociedad and played most of the match at home against Deportivo La Coruna. She had six shots — one on goal, one blocked, two missed, and two that hit the woodwork. Luckily her teammates were able to score three goals, even if Imade could not put one of her attempts in.\n\nReal Sociedad will travel to face Deportivo La Coruna again on Sunday, but this time in the Copa del Reina.\n\nAna Guzmán is the only player on loan to Brazil’s Brasileirão Feminino.\n\nGuzmán started on the bench for Palmerias’ second leg of the semifinals of the league playoff. She came into the match in the 78th minute with the match level at 1-1 and up 2-1 aggregate. She had one clearance and one recovery to help her team hold this result and move onto the finals.\n\nLast weekend, in the first leg of the finals, Palmerias hosted Corinthians. Guzmán started on the bench and was subbed in in the 90th minute with her team up 4-1. She was not able to contribute anything to the match, but saw her team score one more goal to make it 5-1.\n\nOn Sunday, Palmerias travelled to face Corinthians in the second leg of the finals with that 5-1 aggregate lead in hand. Guzmán started and played 74 minutes. Palmerias allowed one goal, but still secured the trophy with a 5-2 aggregate win. This secures the league-cup double for Palmerias. With Guzmán’s loan due to end at the end of December, this was a great way to end her loan.",

It's allowed him to evolve as a pitcher, coupled with his confidence.\"\n\nStarting 45 of 46 regular-season games for the Padres from 2024-25, King went 18-12 with a 3.10 ERA and 1.194 WHIP in 247 IP. He battled injuries during his second year in San Diego, limiting him to 73.1 IP over 15 starts.\n\n\"We are playing around with a lot of different ideas and seeing if it takes us anywhere,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman told YES Network last week.\n\nKing transitioned from reliever to starter at the end of his time in New York, a chapter that spanned five MLB seasons (2019-23). He made his MLB debut Sept. 27, 2019, with the Yankees, who landed him from the Miami Marlins in a November 2017 trade.\n\nThe Marlins originally selected King from Boston College with the No. 353 overall pick in the 12th round of the 2016 MLB Draft. The Rochester, N.Y., native played at Warwick (R.I.) Bishop Hendrickson High School before heading to Boston College from 2014-16.",

It was a clear show of respect and care for a player who meant a lot to the organization and the people still wearing black and gold.\n\nMiami later announced that Fitzpatrick was dealing with a calf injury and was questionable to return.\n\nFitzpatrick spent five seasons with the Steelers, from 2019 through 2023, after being traded to Pittsburgh early in the 2019 season. He quickly became a centerpiece of the defense and one of the most trusted players on the field.\n\nDuring his time in Pittsburgh, Fitzpatrick was known for his big plays, leadership, and football smarts. He made multiple Pro Bowls, delivered countless momentum-changing interceptions, and helped lead a defense that was consistently among the league’s best. Just as important, he was extremely well-liked in the locker room and by the fan base.\n\nThat respect was still obvious Monday night. Even in a Dolphins uniform, Fitzpatrick was met with nothing but concern and support from his former coach and teammates. It was a reminder that some relationships in the NFL go beyond teams and jerseys.\n\nFor Steelers fans, it was also a reminder of how special Minkah Fitzpatrick’s time in Pittsburgh was—and why he’s still held in such high regard.",

    "fullText": "Although Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred takes players to the never-before-seen region of Skovos, it also marks the return of many beloved characters.\n\n on December 15, 2025 at 12:42PM PST\n\nAfter two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a \"satisfying\" conclusion and an \"epic, final showdown\" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too.\n\nPrior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of \"Jedi mind tricks,\" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice.\n\nIGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown.\n\nBurns: It's always been our intention. This is an \"Age of Hatred\" or Mephisto-Lilith-themed saga. Even before the base game came out--once we had finished our work on it, but before the actual release date--we were already planning out the next chapters of the story and it was always going to be about the story about Mephisto, his plans for Sanctuary, and ultimately all culminating to a final confrontation with him.\n\nRivera: When it comes to story, there's always things that change and it's trying to figure out what can we keep, what gets lost, and what is the streamline--especially when it comes to telling this really fun, big story. With Vessel of Hatred, we wanted to really dig into Mephisto and his motivation and keep that with Neyrelle. Now we get a chance to end it. I think it's sticking to our themes about family; that's a really big theme that we have with Mephisto and Lilith, and her children and Inarius. I think that it's finally all coming together. And that was always the plan--to have this big story that feels well-thought-out, and characters that you love and you want to fight for and want to fight against.\n\nIGN: And is this the final showdown?\n\nBurns: Yeah, this is a final showdown. We're going to see Mephisto in his full prime evil demonic glory. It's like what Eleni was talking about a little earlier: When you look at the bigger picture, you're seeing these phases of Mephisto, right? In the base game, he's very on the edges. He's not reborn yet and he's taking on the wolf form. In Vessel, he's a little more powerful because now he's in this Soulstone and he's able to do more. And so in Lord of Hatred, it's like there are no more chains on him. And although he's assuming--at first, at least--this form of Akarat, this prophet figure, he likes to manipulate people and do those sorts of things. He's using a new tool now to do that, but ultimately, the story culminates in us facing him, taking off his mask, and really just having this big epic showdown with him.\n\nRivera: It'll be very satisfying, I think, for the players with a lot of the story. There will be satisfaction along with horrors, and I think that's the best thing for Diablo. You've got some crazy, horrific things, and then you get this nice finale.\n\nGameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the Paladin and how they differ from previous games?\n\nBurns: There've been Paladins in Diablo before as well as the Crusader, who's similar to a Paladin in many ways because they're using the light as their source of magic. The Diablo 4 Paladin is a little bit different in terms of the lore and story. Rather than coming from the Zakarum church or being part of this big religion or institution, they're of a smaller order who are independent. And they're just out in the world trying to do good. They've learned from the past that being part of these big institutions inevitably leads to corruption, so they've purposefully, intentionally gone out and said, \"We're not going to get involved in that kind of stuff. We're just going to find the light within us and use that to do good out in the world.\" And so they have these oaths that they live by so that they don't follow the corruption and that sort of thing.\n\nEleni Rivera: The fun part is that we get to reinvent the Paladin. While they recognize the past, they know about the Zakarum, they know about other Paladins that have existed… They get to redefine who they are, what they are, and what The Order is. That's who they are. They even choose a new name when they join The Order, and their name is directly connected to what they find the most important within it. It's so cool. You get a chance to see this new form of who they are.\n\nBurns: And what's interesting about them too is they--due to their close connection with the light--are also aware of angels and the heavens. They know that angels are beings of light. And so they don't worship angels or anything like that, but they see them as these embodiments of light and embodiments of values that are associated with the light, like valor.\n\nGameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the region that's coming with the expansion? Are there any real-life locations that inspired it, or parts of history?\n\nBurns: Skovos is really cool, really unique, and interesting to Sanctuary. We mentioned earlier that Skovos is where Lilith, Inarius, and these other rebel angels and demons created Sanctuary, and then they hung out in Skovos. It wasn't necessarily called Skovos back then, but they lived there at the dawn of the world. This is where they created humans, or rather where they created the first humans: the Firstborn. When you think about this saga as a story of family, as Eleni said, or maybe as one about what humanity's fate is, it makes sense to bring this culmination with Mephisto to where humanity itself began. There's tons of Firstborn ruins and, sometimes, not even ruins--it's the modern-day people, the Askari. They've maintained this architecture, they live within it, and they see the Firstborn as part of their heritage in a way, even though it's distant.\n\nThere's a lot of different environments throughout these different islands. Each one of them has a unique theme and flavor. We explore a lot of the culture of this place, so you have the Amazons and you have this oracle order, this Order of Seers. We get to see how they work together and how they rule over this island nation to help it function and survive all this terrible stuff that's happening in other parts of Sanctuary.\n\nBut the big interesting point of conflict is that now the bad stuff that was happening in Sanctuary--the stuff that we saw in base game and Vessel of Hatred--now it's coming to Skovos. Mephisto, in the body of Akarat, has gathered a bunch of followers, he's brought them all to Skovos, and he's disrupting the order and the piece of this place. Anything you want to add to that, Eleni?\n\nRivera: I feel like you covered a lot of it, but it's really beautiful. It's stunning and it's a place that you haven't seen before, so I think that's really exciting. And there's just a lot to look at. There's water that you get to look at, and I know that's very small, but it's just… the environment team did a really good job. And in general, there's a lot of deep lore that we got a chance to explore there. I think that'll be really exciting for players who really love lore and players who are also just diving into Diablo for the first time.\n\nGameSpot: And compared to Vessel, how large is Lord of Hatred? How many hours of story can we expect?\n\nRivera: I would say it's comparable to Vessel of Hatred. The map is pretty big. Like Matt said, there's a lot of lore stuff you get to explore in Skovos, so it's got quite a bit of content that the players get to dive into.\n\nPC Gamer: How do you approach creating a villain like Mephisto in a way that feels like a threat to the player, given that our player characters have just killed tons of demons that were already very powerful?\n\nRivera: It's narrative. It's understanding what a player's weakness is, right? And it's building that up and connecting the player to people like Neyrelle and Lorath. You have these stakes that get bigger and bigger because you care about them more. So when it comes to someone who's so powerful, or someone who can defeat all these demons, what really is the thing that will get them to crack? It's the people that they love, the people that they want to fight for, and Sanctuary. And when it comes to creating a really big villain, it's building off that.\n\nBurns: When we first introduced [Mephisto] in the base game, part of the reason we introduced him that way is because he's not the antagonist in the story yet. We're hunting Lilith and he's helping us, and so it's creating this feeling of, \"Yeah, I don't know if I should trust him or I shouldn't trust him, but he's sort of useful to me, so at what point will the usefulness wear out or will he turn the tables on me?\" Because it's going to happen eventually, right? I think we wanted to introduce him that way just so that it would feel a little different than suddenly there's a prime evil sitting in front of you and you just want to fight him.\n\nI mean Eleni said it perfectly: It's how his effect on the characters we care about--and on the world at large--raises the stakes. And again, we're continuing this thread of him always being a bit of a devil on our shoulder. We're not always working with the best characters--sometimes our allies are a little shifty, too. He exploits that reality. He makes us doubt, maybe sometimes our actions, and the people around us.\n\nIGN: How do you make side quests feel like an organic part of the story when there's literally Satan running around?\n\nBurns: One thing that we've done is there are a number of side quests where it's a continuation of a character story that you meet in the main campaign. There are quests that follow an important character that you're around for some amount of time, and now you get to see what has happened to them after all these big events have unfolded. Yeah, Mephisto is running around and the stakes are so high, but what's going on with these other characters? It's about showing the aftermath of those big events, or showing the repercussions of the devil running loose.\n\nRivera: Yeah. I mean, the main story is so specific to our main characters, but the side quests are what breathe life into Sanctuary. They show us what everybody else is doing while the world is crumbling, and seeing intimate stories--seeing what other characters who maybe we know but they're not in the main quest--I think that gives us a chance as writers to dive deeper, and gives players get the chance to understand what these people are doing while there is this chaos. Life keeps on life-ing even when you've got Mephisto running amok. And I think that's the cool part about writing side quests.\n\nGameSpot: It seems like this idea of generational trauma is really at the core of this saga. Is that something that was intentional to this story? Are there some other ideas and themes that you were really hoping to get across and explore?\n\nBurns: Yes. One of the themes that's present throughout is this idea of the passing of the torch, or like you said, it's sort of a generational… Maybe trauma is part of it, but also how you pass on legacy, and whether you can even pass it on at all. And in passing on a legacy, what kind of burden are you putting on the new people?\n\nFor Lilith wanting to protect Sanctuary, or for the Horadrim wanting to do their thing, these are not easy jobs, right? They require a lot of sacrifice. Sometimes the goal is noble, but passing it on can be hard because you know that you're dooming these people to a tough life. That's definitely a theme that we played with in base game and Vessel, and also we explore in Lord of Hatred as well.\n\nThere's also this prophecy in the base game, and I think it shows up in Vessel of Hatred too, that Rathma had. He had these visions and saw the Great Serpent, and this is still a part of the story. As Eleni said, fate is a big theme and so is this prophecy, how it's unfolding, what it actually means, and whether it must happen or can be avoided. This thing will unfold and be fulfilled, but maybe not in the way the characters necessarily suspect. There will be a lot of sacrifices and choices made by characters that there are no coming back from. [Lord of Hatred] is going to be a big, exciting culmination of everything that started in the base game.\n\nPC Gamer: Could you talk a little bit more about Lilith coming back to the story and what her role is? I know there are quite a few players that really, really enjoyed her in the first game.\n\nRivera: We all love Lilith, right? She's cool, she's hot, she's our mom. I think it's really exciting we get a chance to see her in a new way. There's a lot of intimacy that we get to have with Lilith, and I think that we've always wanted to--or at least I've always wanted to--partner up with her. But Lilith will always be a demon at the end of the day. She has her own motivations and she's always going to have her own idea of what she wants in the world. So she has to decide whether or not she wants to ally with us for this bigger problem.\n\nBurns: The only thing I'd add is, again, it's about bringing these different threads to a close. In the base game, we were fed Lilith's blood petals--fed her blood. She's been a part of us this whole time. And though we defeated her in Hell, something of her has lived on in us. There's a presence inside of us that is slumbering basically. And now that we're going after Mephisto and the stakes are high and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, her presence within us really becomes a key to figuring out how to stop Mephisto. Like she said in the base game, \"There would be no victory without me.\" That sort of idea, it's true--we will need her to fix this and to save Sanctuary from Mephisto.\n\nGameSpot: What inspired the decision to bring back Lilith so soon? Were you a bit worried about bringing her back or was it just something that seemed like, \"Oh no, we have to do this?\"\n\nBurns: Like when I mentioned earlier, before the base game actually released and we were planning out future stories, we always did want to bring her back. Then it became a question of when. It was about finding the right opportunity to do it and make it feel the most impactful to the story.\n\nDuring [Vessel of Hatred's] development, we were toying around with the idea. We actually made some of these scenes where you heard her speaking. There was a scene where you saw her reflection or something like that too, but we cut those things out of Vessel because we were just trying to figure out, \"Okay, where's the place where we should highlight that so that it feels like something really juicy and impactful and not just a little thing that happens and then there's no payoff for it yet?\" You know what I mean?\n\nRivera: I feel like one of the biggest things is deciding how much payoff we want. We talk a lot about how this expansion is going to be super satisfying and everything will feel like it's tied together. Vessel of Hatred was the story of Neyrelle, it was a story of Mephisto, and it was about seeing what he could do without the power of being in Sanctuary. Now that he's out, it's seeing what he's going to do with this free will back in Sanctuary but masked as this major religious figure.\n\nBurns: One fun thing we're doing in Lord of Hatred that we didn't really do before is, with Lilith, you have different dialogue options for how you want to respond to her about certain things. We know that people have different feelings for her--whether she was right, whether she was wrong or whether they would've wanted to join her or not--and so we wanted to explore that through some of the dialogue you can have with her. Now, you get to see different ways she'll respond to you as well based on your decisions.\n\nRivera: I feel like Lilith is so nuanced and so complex. You get a mix of seduction and horror all at the same time and it's so cool and fun. And now we get a chance to really see her in a different way. When we last saw her we were fighting against her, but now there's a bigger issue. There's more at stake here, so it's her deciding what's important to her.\n\nGameSpot: You brought up that you now have options for how you want to interact with Lilith, and I thought that was really interesting because, right now, choice-driven, branching CRPGs are becoming more of the standard in the industry. Is that something that you've ever thought about exploring with Diablo? Having more choice throughout the story, exploring maybe different endings, different stories, and branching paths? Is that even possible in the structure of the game?\n\nBurns: I think it's cool and I enjoy that kind of stuff too. For Lord of Hatred, it's \n\nRivera: That's why we do it sometimes in side quests. It's not like you have two different paths, but I do think we get to explore a little bit of that. There was a side quest from, I think in Vessel of Hatred, that you get to have an alternate ending based on what you choose.\n\nIGN: Romance options? That's all I got.\n\nBlizzard PR representative: Are you asking, \"Can we hook up with Lilith?\"\n\nGameSpot: It's what everybody's thinking.\n\nRivera: In terms of romance, we get to see a little bit of Lorath's past, which is something that we haven't really gotten a chance to see with other characters. He has interactions with Queen Adriana that we get to see. We also get to see a lot more of Lorath, how he was painted in the past, and who he was versus who he's become now.\n\nPC Gamer: Is Lorath back? Are we going to hear more Ralph Ineson?\n\nBurns: Yeah, Lorath is one of the main characters in the expansion. He's going to be with you almost all the time throughout the campaign, except the times you split up and you're off doing different things, right? But yeah, he's there, he's continuing his story. There's a lot about Lorath and the Horadrim in Lord of Hatred. And again, it goes back to the themes of legacy and the fate of the Horadrim.\n\nWe've been in VO sessions with Ralph recording all of his lines, and it's always great to hear his voice again. The moment you hear it, you're like, \"Oh yeah, it's Lorath.\" That's been really fun and I'm super excited about Lorath's story in Lord of Hatred. I think it has a lot of great moments. He's a lot of fun to write as a character and, again, Ralph's voice is just amazing.\n\nAnother thing is Lorath has a history in Skovos, and that's something we'll explore in the campaign but, years and years ago, he came to Skovos with some other Horadrim and went on an adventure there. He met this Amazon named Adriana and they formed a bond, so he has some history with her. And now Adriana is the Amazon queen of Skovos. So with him coming back, there's a connection he has to this place that we're going to explore.\n\nIGN: I'm curious about how you guys are going to make players care about Akarat. The importance of the final cut scene of Vessel of Hatred might have been lost on people unless they're in deep on Diablo, but he's obviously a different type of puppet than a wolf. I'm curious about how you think about bringing Akarat as a character into the fold--and all the baggage that comes with him--and trying to explain why that matters while also showing this new version of the Lord of Hatred who is now walking around as a deity.\n\nRivera: When it comes to Akarat, he's just going to appear as a normal man. I think what is going to really cut deep is the amount of people who are now rushing to get to Skovos; seeing the influence that he has because he's such a big figure in the world and he's been doing miracles in Sanctuary. The idea of all these people worshiping this person that you know as a player is Mephisto, I think that is where that terror starts to come.\n\nHe also has his Jedi mind tricks, right? Mephisto is very good at getting in your head. You think you see one thing, but really he's showing you something else and that's the power. We get a chance to show how Mephisto really plays with your emotions and I think that's the best part about him.\n\nBurns: Just to add to that, a couple interesting things about Mephisto in this form--and ways to create interest for folks playing through it--is at first he's defying expectations, right? Yeah, he's a prime evil in this body, but he's not doing anything bad, which is interesting because that's how Mephisto was in the base game as well. Oftentimes, he's just telling you the truth. Maybe he's trying to get his own way by saying it, but he isn't always lying about things. Right now, he's just out there helping people and doing miracles. So it becomes this question, or this mystery, of what is he doing it all for? Why is he putting on this act? What's his end game for it all?\n\nThe other thing--and this ties into our themes--is that I think that Mephisto believes that humans don't really have any control over their fate. They're just cattle that more advanced entities or intelligent entities like him can lead around. What he's doing here is almost to prove a point to us, The Wanderer, and also to Lilith; you can create these things, these humans, and you can hope that they have some kind of free will or agency, but ultimately I'm going to show you that they don't. That's something else we play with, again, to just deepen his character a bit and make it more interesting.\n\nIGN: You have described Diablo IV as The Hatred Saga, and with this being the final confrontation with the Lord of Hatred, one would assume that that means that's the end of the aforementioned saga. I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about Diablo IV's future. I'm assuming that there's going to be more Diablo IV after this.\n\nBurns: You're right in terms of us just looking at it as The Hatred Saga, and really that's been our focus--just bringing this story to a close in a really big and impactful way. But there are other stories to tell on Sanctuary, of course, though I can't really go into detail about any other stuff.\n\nRivera: I think the best part is Diablo's live service. It gives us the opportunity to dive into whatever we want. Like Season 11, right? We get a chance to bring Hadriel back and we're getting a chance to talk to this angel that we only met briefly in Diablo II. We get to expand Hadriel's lore, which is really cool. We get a chance to always, possibly, tell new stories. But right now, we're just focusing on getting this expansion out and seeing what happens.\n\nThe above interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "fullText": "It’s been three years since OpenAI set off euphoria over artificial intelligence with the release of ChatGPT. And while the money is still pouring in, so are the doubts about whether the good times can last.\n\nA recent sell-off in the shares of Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp.’s plunge after reporting mounting spending on AI, souring sentiment around a network of companies exposed to OpenAI — signs of skepticism are increasing. Looking to 2026, the debate among investors is whether to rein in AI exposure ahead of a potential bubble popping or double down to capitalize on the game-changing technology.\n\n“We’re in the phase of the cycle where the rubber meets the road,” said Jim Morrow, chief executive of Callodine Capital Management. “It’s been a good story, but we’re sort of anteing up at this point to see whether the returns on investment are going to be good.”\n\nThe queasiness about the AI trade involves its uses, the enormous cost of developing it, and whether consumers ultimately will pay for the services. Those answers will have major implications for the stock market’s future.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 index’s three-year, $30-trillion bull run has largely been driven by the world’s biggest tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as firms benefiting from spending on AI infrastructure such as chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom Inc. and electricity providers such as Constellation Energy Corp. If they stop rising, the equities indexes will follow.\n\n“These stocks don’t correct because the growth rate goes down,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital. “These stocks correct when the growth rate doesn’t accelerate any further.”\n\nOf course, there are still plenty of reasons for optimism. The tech giants that account for much of the AI spending have vast resources and have pledged to keep pumping in cash in the years ahead. Plus, developers of AI services, such as Alphabet’s Google, continue to make strides with new models. Hence the debate.\n\nHere’s a look at the key trends to watch while navigating through these choppy waters.\n\nOpenAI alone plans to spend $1.4 trillion in the coming years. But the Sam Altman-led company, which became the world’s most valuable startup in October, is generating far less revenue than its operating costs. It expects to burn $115 billion through 2029 before generating cash in 2030, the Information reported in September.\n\nThe company has had no problem with fundraising, collecting $40 billion from Softbank Group Corp. and other investors earlier this year. Nvidia pledged to invest as much as $100 billion in September, one of a series of deals the chipmaker has made that funnel cash to its customers, which is causing fears of circular financing in the AI industry.\n\nOpenAI could run into trouble if investors start to balk at committing more capital. And the consequences would spiral to the companies in its orbit, such as computing services provider CoreWeave Inc.\n\n“If you think about how much money — it’s in the trillions now — is crowded into a small group of themes and names, when there’s the first hint of that theme even having short-term issues or just valuations get so stretched they can’t possibly continue to grow like that, they’re all leaving at once,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund.\n\nPlenty of other companies are reliant on external funding to pursue AI ambitions. Oracle shares soared as it racked up bookings for cloud computing services, but building those data centers will require massive amounts of cash, which the company has secured by selling tens of billions of dollars in bonds. Using debt puts pressure on a company because bondholders need to be paid in cash on a schedule, unlike equity investors, who mostly profit as share prices rise.\n\nOracle’s stock got pounded on Thursday after the company reported significantly higher capital expenditures than expected in its fiscal second quarter and cloud sales growth missed the average analyst estimate. On Friday, a report that some data center projects it’s developing for OpenAI have been delayed sent Oracle’s shares down further and weighed on other stocks exposed to AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, a gauge of Oracle’s credit risk hit the highest level since 2009.\n\nAn Oracle spokesperson said in a statement that the company remained confident in its ability to meet its obligations and future expansion plans.\n\n“The credit people are smarter than the equity people, or at least they’re worried about the right thing — getting their money back,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to spend more than $400 billion on capital expenditures in the next 12 months, most of it for data centers. Although those companies are seeing AI-related revenue growth from cloud-computing and advertising businesses, it’s nowhere near the costs they’re incurring.\n\n“Any plateauing of growth projections or decelerations, we’re going to wind up in a situation where the market says, ‘OK, there’s an issue here,’” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.\n\nEarnings growth for the Magnificent Seven tech giants, which also includes Apple Inc., Nvidia and Tesla Inc., is projected to be 18% in 2026, the slowest in four years and slightly better than the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nRising depreciation expenses from the data center binge is a major worry. Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta combined for about $10 billion in depreciation costs in the final quarter of 2023. The figure rose to nearly $22 billion in the quarter that just ended in September. And it’s expected to be about $30 billion by this time next year.\n\nAll of this could put pressure on buybacks and dividends, which return cash to stockholders. In 2026, Meta and Microsoft are expected to have negative free cash flow after accounting for shareholder returns, while Alphabet is seen roughly breaking even, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern about all the spending is the strategy shift it represents. Big Tech’s value has long been premised on the companies’ ability to generate rapid revenue growth at low costs, which resulted in immense free cash flows. But their plans for AI have turned that upside down.\n\n“If we continue down the track of lever up our company to build out for the hopes that we can monetize this, multiples are going to contract,” O’Rourke said. “If things don’t come together for you, this whole pivot would have been a drastic mistake.”\n\nWhile Big Tech’s valuations are high, they’re nowhere near excessive compared with past periods of market euphoria. Comparisons with the dot-com bust are common, but the magnitude of the gains from AI are nothing like what happened during the development of the internet. For example, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is priced at 26 times projected profits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That figure exceeded 80 times at the height of the dot-com bubble.\n\nValuations during the dot-com era were far in excess of where they are now partly because of how far the stocks had run, but also because the companies were younger and less profitable — if they had profits at all.\n\n“These aren’t dot-com multiples,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer and portfolio manager of fundamental equities at BlackRock. “This isn’t to say there aren’t pockets of speculation or irrational exuberance, because there are, but I don’t think that exuberance is in the AI-related names of the Mag 7.”\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc., which trades at a multiple of more than 180 times estimated profits, is among the AI stocks with nosebleed valuations. Snowflake Inc. is another, with a multiple of almost 140 times projected earnings. But Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft are all below 30 times, which is relatively tame considering all the euphoria surrounding them.\n\nAll of which leaves investors in a quandary. Yes, the risks are right on the surface even as investors keep pouring into AI stocks. But for now, most companies aren’t priced at panic-inducing levels. The question is which direction the AI trade goes from here.\n\n“This kind of group thinking is going to crack,” Value Point’s Bhasin said. “It probably won’t crash like it did in 2000. But we’ll see a rotation.”\n\nWittenstein writes for Bloomberg.",

    "fullText": "What began the year as one of the best trades in the stock market has, in a matter of months, turned into one of the worst.\n\nAn array of public companies thought they had found a sort of perpetual motion machine: Use your corporate cash to buy up bitcoin or other digital tokens and presto, your share price shot up even more than the value of the tokens you bought.\n\nIt was a playbook invented by Michael Saylor, who transformed his company, Strategy Inc., into a publicly traded bitcoin holding vehicle. And through the first half of 2025 it worked for more than a hundred other companies that followed Saylor’s lead.\n\nDigital asset treasuries, as these firms became known, turned into one of the hottest trends in the public markets, as share prices skyrocketed and everyone from Peter Thiel to the Trump family piled in.\n\nOne prominent entrant, SharpLink Gaming Inc., soared more than 2,600% in a matter of days as the company said it would pivot from its old work in gaming, and sell shares to buy up lots and lots of Ethereum tokens, with one of Ethereum’s co-founders as the chairman.\n\nBut it was always hard to explain why tokens should be worth more just because they were held by a public company, and the wheels began to come off the car, at first slowly and then much more quickly.\n\nIn the case of SharpLink, the stock has fallen 86% from its peak, leaving the whole company worth less than the digital tokens it owns. The company now trades at roughly 0.9 times its Ether holdings. It was, at least, spared the fate of Greenlane Holdings, which plunged more than 99% this year, despite its stash of around $48 million BERA crypto tokens.\n\n“Investors took a look and understood that there’s not much yield from these holdings rather than just sitting on this pile of money, and that’s why they contracted,” B. Riley Securities Analyst Fedor Shabalin said in an interview.\n\nAmong the U.S. and Canadian-listed companies that became digital asset treasuries, the median stock price has fallen 43% this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin, by comparison, is down around just 6% since the beginning of the year.\n\nSome lucky digital asset treasuries are still worth more than their underlying holdings, but most have been losers for people who bought them when they were anywhere near their peaks and 70% are on track to end the year below where they began it, according to Bloomberg’s calculations.\n\nThe worst performers have been public companies that eschewed bitcoin and went for smaller, more volatile tokens.\n\nTwo of Trump’s sons lined up behind Alt5 Sigma Corp., a public company that set out to buy more than a billion dollars of WLFI, a token issued by a separate company that was co-founded by the Trump family. Those shares have fallen about 86% from their peak in June.\n\nThe volatility of these stocks is explained, at least in part, by all the money that was borrowed to pay for the corporate crypto acquisitions.\n\nStrategy came up with a remarkable array of convertible bonds and preferred shares that funded the company’s bitcoin purchases, with the tokens growing to be worth more than $70 billion at one point. Digital asset treasuries as a group raised more than $45 billion this year to purchase crypto tokens, according to Shabalin at B. Riley.\n\nNow, though, Strategy and all the other companies are on the hook to make the interest and dividend payments on that debt. That is a problem because their crypto holdings, for the most part, don’t generate any cash flow.\n\n“If you own Strategy, you own the bitcoin risk plus whatever kind of corporate stress, corporate risk they are taking on,” RIA Advisors Portfolio Manager Michael Lebowitz said in an interview.\n\nStrategy has recently tried to raise more capital to keep the flywheel spinning, turning to Europe in November to sell perpetual preferred stocks at a discount, after U.S. preferred shares sales fell short of expectations. But those euro-denominated preferred stocks have already fallen below their offer price.\n\nMeanwhile, for smaller digital asset treasuries without name recognition, capital raising opportunities are even harder to come by as crypto prices decline and investor enthusiasm wanes.\n\nFor Strategy, the obvious next step is to sell some of its crypto holdings to pay the bills. And that is what Saylor’s chief executive officer, Phong Le, said the company might do.\n\n“We can sell bitcoin and we would sell bitcoin if we needed to fund our dividend payments,” Le said on a podcast.\n\nLe said he will look at this option if the company’s so-called mNAV falls below 1, a calculation that would suggest the company’s market value has fallen below the value of its crypto holdings.\n\nThese comments shook the digital asset treasury industry because Saylor had said many times that he would not sell his bitcoin, and would buy more when the price went down.\n\n“Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin,” he joked in a February post on X.\n\nThe big concern now is that digital asset treasuries will be forced to sell their crypto, which will push down the prices of those tokens, setting off a downward spiral.\n\n“If there’s a headline that says Strategy sold, even if it’s three bitcoin, I think after everything Michael Saylor has said about he’s never selling a dime, people are going to start to question the whole bitcoin trade,” Lebowitz said.\n\nStrategy has created a $1.4-billion reserve fund to cover dividend payments in the near term. And shares are still up more than 1,200% since it started buying bitcoin in August 2020. But they are on track for a 38% decline this year.\n\nThe digital asset treasury wipeout risks bleeding into broader markets if traders are using borrowed money, which could force them to sell in order to cover margin calls. For now, the problems have largely cut off the flow of new companies adopting the strategy — and the burst of capital markets activity that it created.\n\nBut there are signs that there may be at least some new activity from somewhat more valuable digital asset treasuries acquiring smaller digital asset treasuries that are worth less than their holdings.\n\nStrive Inc., co-founded by former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, agreed to acquire Semler Scientific Inc. in an all-stock deal in September, merging the two bitcoin treasury companies. Semler was one of the first digital asset treasuries and has fallen 65% this year.\n\nRoss Carmel, a partner at Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel, expects that mergers and acquisitions will pick up for digital asset treasuries in early 2026 with a focus on the potential for further pain.\n\nThe industry is likely to see more structured securities transactions “that can be used to give these investors more downside protection in these deals,” Carmel said.",

    "fullText": "I’m a sucker for remoras. The streamlined fish are the ocean’s perfect hitchhiker, honed by millions of years of evolution to catch a ride with some of the sea’s biggest movers and shakers—sharks, whales, rays, even turtles. And now remoras can add another accomplishment to their already impressive resume: They were the inspiration for a space mission that could make autonomous tandem space missions in low Earth orbit.\n\nTwo private space companies recently revealed that they were conducting a test run of what’s called rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) technology. Essentially, two spacecraft, made by Impulse Space, used software from another space company, Starfish Space, to come within about 4,000 feet of each other as they floated high above Earth. The collaboration, called “Remora” by the companies involved, demonstrated the accuracy of such RPO technology, which could be used to bring two spacecraft in lockstep orbit—remora-like—to autonomously service the multitude of satellites that encircle the Earth.\n\nBut back to the watery realm. Remoras likely evolved from more garden variety fish starting about 32 million years ago. Cobia, the closest living relatives of remoras, are free-living and don’t latch onto other marine organisms. But they do provide an interesting model of how remoras may have come about.\n\nCobia look remarkably similar to remoras save for the one thing that makes the latter a champion marine hitchiker—a suction cup positioned on the tops of their heads. That structure most likely morphed through time from a dorsal fin on the remora’s ancestor, an insight definitively proven by researchers in 2012, after naturalists had been suggesting as much since the early 1800s.\n\nThat evolutionary innovation helps modern day remoras glom onto all sorts of their fellow oceanic travelers—sharks, whales, turtles, and more—while snapping up their scraps and sometimes picking off parasites. Interestingly, cobia also tend to tag along with larger marine swimmers, such as manta rays, marlins, and sharks. They just don’t employ a sucker to keep hold.\n\nI for one am glad to see remora get their moment in the spaceflight spotlight in the shallows of the cosmic ocean.\n\nEnjoying  Nautilus? \n\nLead image: Richard ling / Wikimedia",

    "description": "Researchers at the University of Warsaw have unveiled a breakthrough method for detecting and precisely calibrating terahertz frequency combs using a quantum antenna made from Rydberg atoms. By combining atomic electrometry with a powerful terahertz-to-light conversion technique, they achieved the first measurement of a single terahertz comb tooth—something previously impossible due to the limits of electronics and optical tools.",
    "fullText": "A research team from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw has introduced a new way to measure hard-to-detect terahertz signals using a \"quantum antenna.\" In their work, the scientists applied an innovative radio wave detection setup based on Rydberg atoms that not only senses terahertz radiation, but also accurately calibrates a so-called frequency comb in this part of the spectrum. Until recently, the terahertz range was considered a blank area in the electromagnetic spectrum, and the method reported in the journal Optica opens the door to extremely sensitive spectroscopy and a new class of room-temperature quantum sensors.\n\nTerahertz (THz) radiation, being part of the electromagnetic spectrum, lies at the boundary of electronics and optics, positioned between microwaves (used, for example, in Wi-Fi) and infrared. Although it holds immense potential for applications that include inspecting packages without harmful X-rays, superspeed 6G communication, and spectroscopy and imaging of organic compounds, turning this potential into precise and sensitive measurements has been technically very difficult. In the past few years, scientists have made major strides in both generating and detecting terahertz radiation, yet until now they had not been able to measure a frequency comb in this region with the required precision.\n\nFrequency combs as ultra-precise electromagnetic rulers\n\nWhy is this so important? Frequency combs, which earned a Nobel Prize in 2005, can be imagined as an incredibly accurate ruler made not from a solid material, but from light or radio waves. Instead of millimeter markings, there is a sequence of evenly spaced lines (\"teeth\") at strictly defined frequencies. This \"electromagnetic ruler\" lets physicists determine the frequency of an unknown signal with extraordinary accuracy simply by seeing which \"tooth\" it matches. Because of this, frequency combs act as reference standards that can be used to calibrate and stabilize many types of instruments over a wide range of frequencies. Depending on where in the electromagnetic spectrum this ruler sits, scientists talk about optical, radio, or terahertz frequency combs.\n\nTerahertz frequency combs are particularly attractive because they can support calibration and highly accurate measurements in a band where the oscillation frequencies are higher than typical radio waves but lower than optical waves (light). However, such combs are notoriously difficult to measure with high precision, since their oscillations are too rapid for conventional electronics and cannot be directly captured with standard optical methods. Researchers have been able to determine the spacing between the comb \"teeth\" and to measure the total power spread across the spectrum, but determining how much power belongs to a single tooth has remained a major challenge.\n\nRydberg atoms turned into quantum antennas\n\nThe scientists from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw have now overcome this obstacle and, for the first time, measured the signal emitted by a single terahertz comb tooth. To achieve this, they employed a gas of rubidium atoms prepared in a Rydberg state. A Rydberg atom is defined as having a single electron excited to a very high orbit by being illuminated with precisely tuned lasers. This \"swollen\" atom acts as a quantum antenna that is extremely sensitive to external electric fields. In addition, by using tunable lasers, the detector can be adjusted to respond to one specific frequency within such a field, across a range that extends up to terahertz waves.\n\nTraditionally, in Rydberg electrometry, the phenomenon of Autler-Townes splitting is used to measure the electric field. Its huge advantage is that the measurement result depends only on fundamental atomic constants, providing an absolutely calibrated readout. Unlike classical antennas, which require laborious calibration in specialized radio laboratories, the atomic-based system is, in a sense, a standard unto itself. Moreover, thanks to the richness of energy states in the atom, such a sensor can be tuned almost continuously over an enormous range, from a direct current (DC) signal up to the aforementioned terahertz.\n\nHybrid terahertz to light conversion for extreme sensitivity\n\nHowever, this method has a limitation: on its own, it is not sensitive enough to record very weak terahertz signals. To remedy this, the research team additionally applied a radio wave-to-light conversion technique invented at the University of Warsaw and adapted it to the needs of terahertz radiation. In this process, the weak terahertz signal is converted into optical photons, which can then be detected with immense sensitivity using single-photon counters. This hybrid approach is the key to success: it combines the extreme sensitivity of photon detection with the ability to \"recover\" the calibration capabilities of the Autler-Townes method even for the weakest signals.\n\nThe sensor based on Rydberg atoms possesses all the features needed to perform precise frequency comb calibration: it can be tuned to a single tooth of the comb, and then retuned to the next, and the next. The scientists managed to observe several dozen teeth in a very wide frequency range this way. Additionally, thanks to the knowledge of the fundamental properties of atoms, the comb was directly calibrated, precisely determining its intensity.\n\nNew path for terahertz metrology and future technologies\n\nThe results obtained by the physicists from the University of Warsaw Wiktor Krokosz, Jan Nowosielski, Bartosz Kasza, Sebastian Borówka, Mateusz Mazelanik, Wojciech Wasilewski, and Michał Parniak represent much more than the development of another sensitive detector. Their work lays the groundwork for a new area of metrology. With the help of Rydberg atoms, the transformative uses of optical frequency combs can now be extended into the previously difficult terahertz region. Importantly, unlike many quantum technologies that require extremely low temperatures, this system functions at room temperature, which greatly lowers costs and makes future commercialization more realistic. This creates an opportunity to build reference measurement standards for the coming generation of terahertz technologies.\n\nThe project \"Quantum Optical Technologies\" (FENG.02.01-IP.05-0017/23) is implemented as part of Measure 2.1 International Research Agendas of the Foundation for Polish Science, co-financed by the European Union from Priority 2 of the European Funds for Modern Economy Programme 2021-2027 (FENG). The research is also one of the results of the SONATA17 and PRELUDIUM23 projects funded by the National Science Centre.)\n\nMaterials provided by University of Warsaw, Faculty of Physics.

    "fullText": "If you’re dreaming of sunny days on Kauaʻi’s famous shores, there’s a new rule you should know before heading to the beach. In a landmark environmental move, Kauaʻi County Mayor Derek S.K. Kawakami signed Bill No. 2976 on December 10, 2025, which will ban the sale, rental, and distribution of disposable polystyrene foam bodyboards across the island.\n\nThis may sound like a small policy change, but for locals, visitors, business owners, and ocean lovers alike, it marks a significant shift in how Hawaii’s communities are choosing to protect their beaches and marine ecosystems.\n\nUnder the new ordinance, disposable bodyboards made of polystyrene foam, which is the inexpensive, lightweight boards commonly sold at beachside shops, will no longer be allowed to be sold, rented, or handed out anywhere in Kauaʻi County. The ban doesn’t go into effect immediately, but will begin one year after the bill’s approval, giving local businesses and vendors time to adjust and transition to alternative products.\n\nThe foam was previously banned in January 2022 for all food related use, including cups, plates, and bowls (with exceptions for foods prepared off-island and shipped in, as well as containers used to package raw or butchered meats, poultry, fish and eggs). After this ban occurred under Bill 2775, all four of Hawaii's counties officially had polystyrene foam food bans, making Hawaii a “foam free” state, one of only five in the U.S.\n\nThe law creates a new environmental section in the Kauaʻi County Code aimed at reducing pollution and safeguarding coastal habitats. It also sets up civil penalties for violations, including escalating fines for businesses that don’t comply once the law is in force. Enforcement is expected to be handled by the county’s Public Works Solid Waste Division, with further legal action possible through the County Attorney’s office.\n\n“This ordinance reflects our responsibility to care for Kaua‘i’s environment. By encouraging durable alternatives, we are reducing waste, protecting marine life, and ensuring our islands remain beautiful for generations to come,” said Councilmember Fern Holland, who introduced the bill.\n\nAt the heart of the ban is concern for the island’s environment. Disposable polystyrene foam boards, often inexpensive and popular with casual beachgoers, are typically used only a few times before being thrown away. But that lightweight foam material doesn’t just disappear. Over time, these boards can break apart into tiny fragments, which are then carried by wind and waves into the ocean, onto shorelines, or into landfill sites.\n\nOnce in the environment, these tiny particles, often referred to as microplastics, pose a real threat to wildlife. Sea birds, fish, turtles, and other marine animals can mistakenly ingest this debris, leading to digestive issues, starvation, or even death. Fragmented foam can also entangle wildlife and contribute to larger pollution problems that harm reefs, beaches, and even water quality.\n\nMayor Kawakami summed up the reasoning succinctly: “Disposable bodyboards may seem small, but their impact has been anything but small. By eliminating polystyrene foam boards from stores and rentals, we are protecting our beaches, our ocean, and the wildlife that calls Kaua‘i home.”\n\nJust because disposable bodyboards are on their way out doesn’t mean you’ll have to ditch beach fun altogether. In fact, Bill 2976 itself encourages more sustainable alternatives.\n\nInstead of polystyrene boards, the ordinance recommends bodyboards made from higher-density, longer-lasting materials like high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene. These materials are more durable, meaning they don’t break apart as easily, and they have a smaller environmental footprint over their lifespan.\n\nMany experienced riders already prefer these more robust boards because they provide better performance, last for years instead of days, and can even be rented or resold. Local surf shops and rental outlets on Kauaʻi are expected to adjust their inventories to stock these eco-friendlier options before the ban takes effect.\n\nFor tourists, this could also be an opportunity: hotels, vacation rentals, and tour companies may begin offering board rentals or lending durable boards to guests, making it easier to enjoy Kauaʻi’s surf without contributing to pollution.\n\nKauaʻi’s bodyboard ban might seem niche, but it reflects a broader shift in how coastal communities manage tourism and natural resources. As beaches around the world face rising pollution and climate pressures, local governments are increasingly looking for balanced solutions that protect nature while still allowing people to enjoy outdoor recreation.\n\nSo next time you visit, don’t be surprised if that classic foam bodyboard you once knew is gone. But with the right board in hand and a bit more awareness, you’ll be helping protect the waves, wildlife, and wonder that make Kauaʻi’s beaches truly special.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Authorities on Monday had renewed a manhunt for the gunman who killed two students and injured seven more at Brown University over the weekend, after releasing a man who had been held on Sunday as ​a \"person of interest\" in the shooting.\n\nThough officials said late on Sunday they were resuming the search for a suspect, they said there were no ‌credible threats to the community and that they would not reimpose a shelter-in-place order for the campus and the surrounding area that had been lifted earlier.\n\nPolice have released surveillance footage showing the possible shooter ‌dressed in black walking near the building where the attack took place, though his face is not visible.\n\nThe gunman fled after shooting students in a classroom in Brown's Barus & Holley engineering and physics building, where outer doors had been left unlocked while exams were taking place, according to police.\n\nAt a press conference late on Sunday, officials said there had been enough evidence to justify taking into custody the unnamed person of interest, a man in his 20s.\n\nBut Providence Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters the investigation was going in a \"different direction,\" without ⁠offering more detail. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said ‌investigators had determined there was \"no basis to believe that he's a person of interest, so... he's being released.\"\n\nThe mass shooting shook the campus at Brown, one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the United States. The Ivy League school, which has nearly ‍11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, canceled exams and classes for the rest of the year, and the campus was quiet on Sunday as a light snowfall blanketed the city.\n\nThe two students killed were Ella Cook, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, according to statements from various officials.\n\nCook was vice president of the ​school's College Republicans and a \"leading Republican voice at Brown,\" according to an X post from the New York Republicans Club. Her LinkedIn profile included jobs as an ‌ice cream server at a Mountain Brook creamery and a program assistant in New York.\n\n\"Wesley and I join the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University's campus,\" U.S. Senator Katie Britt of Alabama wrote in a statement with her husband, Wesley.\n\nUmurzokov, an aspiring neurosurgeon, was \"the most kind-hearted person,\" according to a GoFundMe campaign set up by his family.\n\n\"He always lent a helping hand to anyone in need without hesitation, and was the most kind-hearted person our family knew,\" the family wrote. \"Our family is incredibly devastated by this loss.\"\n\nHe graduated from Midlothian ⁠High School in Virginia this spring, according to the Washington Post. In a statement, the U.S. ​ambassador to Uzbekistan, Jonathan Henick, mourned \"the loss of his bright future.\"\n\nRef Bari, 22, ​a graduate student at Brown, said he was inside the Barus & Holley building when he heard a series of loud popping sounds that appeared to be gunfire.\n\nBari ran out of the building and asked another student running in the street if he could hide with her ‍and her friends and she agreed. They ⁠returned to her basement apartment and hid in the bathroom.\n\n\"She trusted me,\" he said. \"The only connection between us is we're both students at Brown but beyond that, we don't know each other.\"\n\nTeaching assistant Joseph Oduro, 21, told CNN he was in a classroom that was attacked.\n\n\"The first couple of gunshots went ⁠straight to the chalkboard right where I was standing,\" Oduro said. \"Who knows, if I didn't duck, maybe I'm not here today.\"\n\nA student next to him took two bullets to the leg and was due ‌to undergo surgery on Sunday, he said.",

    "description": "A woman stumbled upon a 900-year-old treasure of over 2,150 medieval coins. Experts are analyzing the rare find for its historical significance.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA woman walking in the Czech Republic stumbled upon more than 2,150 early medieval silver coins.\n\nOriginally stored in a ceramic pot during a time of political turmoil, the coins have sat in place since the first quarter of the 12th century.\n\nMuseum staff will now analyze and restore the denarii.\n\nA ceramic pot turned into a jackpot for a woman on a walk in the Kutnohorsk Region of the Czech Republic. While out on a stroll, the woman happened upon a roughly 900-year-old stash of more than 2,150 medieval silver coins known as denarii.\n\nWhile the ceramic pot holding the coins was mostly demolished, the coins themselves remain a rich collection. According to a translated statement, they are now being processed by experts from the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, and the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora.\n\nDubbed one of the greatest finds of the last decade, institute archaeologist Filip Velímský believes the discovery is like winning a prize in the lottery—even if someone else was the loser. “It was probably placed in its place during the first quarter of the 12th century, at a time of internal political instability,” he said. “At that time, there were disputes in the country between the members of the Přemysl dynasty about the princely throne of Prague.”\n\nStashing coins in a ceramic container was meant to be a way of keeping them safe. And the container certainly did it’s job, even if the owner was never able to return for them—the coins weren’t recovered for another 900 years.\n\nAccording to the experts, that owner couldn’t have been just anyone.“Unfortunately, for the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, we lack data on the purchasing power of the contemporary coin,” Velímský said. “But it was a huge amount, unimaginable for an ordinary person and at the same time unaffordable. It can be compared to winning a million in the jackpot.”\n\nThe Kutnohorsk Region was known for frequent battles for the Prague princely throne, with the armies of individual rival princes repeatedly marching through the area, according to the institute. The experts claim that a large collection of coins found in such a place could mean that they were originally meant to pay wages for soldiers, or were some sort of “war booty.”\n\nEarly analysis of the haul shows both that the coins were minted in several places throughout the Kutnohorsk Region, and that they were likely created under the rule of three different Přemysl leaders (likely between 1085 and 1107): King Vratislav II and princes Břetislav II and Bořivoje II.\n\n“The coins were most likely minted in the Prague mint from silver that was imported to Bohemia at the time,” Lenka Mazačová, director of the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora, said in a statement. The coins are made from an silver alloy that included copper, lead, and trace amounts of other metals. The experts hope to figure out the exact composition of the coins to help determine the origin of the silver.\n\nWhile we may never know the true intentions—or provenance—of the coin collection, experts still plan to puzzle out as much as possible. Mazačová said that museum staff will now register all the pieces of the collection, clean and restore the coins, and subject them to X-ray imaging and spectral analysis to determine their specific material composition. The goal is to publicly display the collection in 2025, highlighting the 12th century history of the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.\n\nThe officials said talks with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as on Moscow’s demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country’s east.\n\nTrump dialed into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are expected this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated White House event. He added, “We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it ended, also.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine\" supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force's work would include \"operating inside Ukraine\" as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine's forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO's military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington. Seung Min Kim and Darlene Superville in Washington; Pietro De Cristofaro in Berlin; Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine; and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",

In 2027, their team, led by the bank’s head of global metals and mining research, sees bullion averaging US$5,100 per ounce.\n\n“Historically, gold producers have behaved pro-cyclically, resulting in sharply higher costs/capital, rising reserve assumptions, and increasing M&A in a rising price environment, which has ultimately eroded investor returns,” Josh Wolfson and his peers wrote in RBC’s latest global precious metals equities outlook.\n\n“Today, producers are operating with a significantly more prudent approach to capital allocation and discretionary spending, and we expect reserves to be calculated at a conservative <US$2,000/oz, less than 50 per cent of current gold prices,” Wolfson added. “Gold producers are experiencing a perfect storm, and are behaving responsibly.”\n\nThat said, RBC describes its outlook on gold stocks as “more conservative than consensus.” The bank expects capital spending to rise, as producers with extra cash look to squeeze returns from existing projects. They also see all-in sustaining costs, a key industry metric, rising by nine per cent in 2026.\n\nAmong the operators, Wolfson and his team say Canadian companies Agnico Eagle (AEM.TO)(AEM), Barrick Mining (ABX.TO)(B), and Kinross Gold (K.TO) have the most downside risk. On the other hand, RBC predicts shares of South Africa-based AngloGold Ashanti (AU) could see “modest upside,” versus its estimates.\n\nExchange-traded fund (ETF) provider Global X says its Gold Producers Index ETF (GLDX.TO) is the top-performing ETF in Canada year-to-date, excluding leveraged funds. The TSX-listed basket of stocks has gained nearly 178 per cent year-to-date. Barrick, AngloGold, and Kinross are its top three holdings.\n\n“Anytime something is up in the triple digits, I would say that probably exceeds expectations,” Chris McHaney, Global X’s head of investment management and strategy, told Yahoo Finance Canada.\n\n“You might see a similar type of return [in 2026]. With the gold price where it is, generally at all-time highs, the gold producers don’t really need the price of gold to continue going up. They just need it to stay relatively where it is, and they’ll be able to make significant cash flows from their operations.”",

    "description": "Warren Buffett's recommended investment strategy would have been profitable 100% of the time throughout history.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett has frequently recommended that non-professional investors periodically buy shares of an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers easy exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world, including Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 1,810% during the last three decades, which is equivalent to 10.3% annually, a pace that would turn $400 per month into $835,000 over three decades.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›\n\nWarren Buffett, who took control of Berkshire Hathaway six decades ago, has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history. He has consistently given the same advice: Buy an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2021. He has suggested the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nHere's how that advice could turn $400 invested monthly into $835,000 over 30 years.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 measures the performance of the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large U.S. companies. It includes value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors, and covers about 80% of domestic equities and 40% of global equities by market value.\n\nThe index fund provides exposure to many of the most influential businesses in the world. The top 10 positions are listed by weight below:\n\nOne risk associated with owning an S&P 500 index fund is the extraordinary concentration of the underlying index. The top 10 companies account for 41% of the S&P 500 by market-cap weight, which means a large decline in two or three of those stocks could really drag on the entire index.\n\nHowever, the top 10 companies also account for approximately 33% of the S&P 500's earnings, so the statistic is not as alarming as many pundits make it out to be. Their price-to-earnings multiples are above average, but their strong competitive positions warrant premium valuations.\n\nThere is a simple reason Warren Buffett believes an S&P 500 index fund is the best way for the average investor to get stock market exposure: Buying individual stocks requires more work than most people are willing to take on, and beating the S&P 500 is challenging even for professional money managers.",

    "description": "\"I'm guessing a lot of you have never seen this.\"",
    "fullText": "Social media users were wowed by a repost of a huge carnivore roaming the frozen wilderness of northern Canada.\n\nThe trail camera footage, initially taken in 2021, was reposted by Yukon Wildlife Cams on Facebook. It shows a hefty, snow-covered grizzly bear treating the viewer to an extreme close-up as it looks right into the camera. The caption offers a little more context about the striking footage:\n\n\"Although I've shared this before, I'm guessing a lot of you have never seen this awesome snow-covered grizzly after a late September snowfall in 2021,\" the post read.\n\nYukon is home to as many as 7,000 grizzly bears. A grizzly bear is a type of brown bear that's smaller and lives further inland than its coastal cousins. Their smaller stature is due to their diets, which rely more on roots, berries, and small prey. They play a key role in the ecosystem as predators and foragers. They keep prey populations under control, and the bear's nutrient-dense scat is key to a healthy forest.\n\nThey are considered \"vulnerable\" in Yukon due to habitat loss and conflict with people. Grizzlies are also threatened by warming global temperatures driven by human activity, disrupting their food supply. For example, the calorie-rich seeds of whitebark pine, which they need to fatten up in the fall, are under threat, according to a study by the University of Colorado.\n\nBecause they only reproduce every three or four years after age eight, any recovery to their numbers will take time.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that the province's conservation plan faces is the difficulty of tracking grizzly numbers. That's where trail cameras can provide an invaluable service.\n\nCameras can make for an unobtrusive and cost-effective method for monitoring threatened wildlife. Additionally, they can play a key part in raising public awareness and support for conservation measures.\n\nAs the comments to the clip showed, viewers were delighted with the footage.\n\n\"Makes my heart race,\" one comment read.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother joked, \"All fattened up for the winter and ready for bed … just like me.\"\n\n\"Wow he really bulked up for his long winter's nap,\" a viewer noted. Though strictly speaking, bears enter torpor status for the winter, a lighter sleep where they will occasionally wake up to forage.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said in a court filing Monday that the president’s White House ballroom construction project must continue for unexplained national security reasons and because a preservationists' organization that wants it stopped has no standing to sue.\n\nThe filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt President Donald Trump's project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and a public comment period and wins approval from Congress.\n\nThe administration's 36-page filing included a declaration from Matthew C. Quinn, deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for the security of the president and other high-ranking officials, that said more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.” The filing did not explain the specific national security concerns; the administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in a private, in-person setting without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe East Wing had sat atop a emergency operations bunker for the president.\n\nQuinn said even a temporary halt to construction would “consequently hamper” the agency's ability to fulfill its statutory obligations and its protective mission.\n\nA hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington.\n\nThe government’s response offered the most comprehensive look yet at the ballroom construction project, including a window into how it was so swiftly approved by the Trump administration bureaucracy and its expanding scope.\n\nThe filings assert that final plans for the ballroom have yet to be finalized despite the continuing demolition and other work to prepare the site for eventual construction. Below-ground work on the site continues, wrote John Stanwich, the National Park Service’s liaison to the White House, and work on the foundations is set to begin in January. Above-ground construction “is not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest,” he wrote.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation did not respond to email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe privately funded group last week asked the U.S. District Court to block Trump's project.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”\n\nTrump had the East Wing torn down in October as part of his plan to build an estimated $300 million, 90,000-square-foot (27,432-square-meter) ballroom able to accommodate about 1,000 people before his term ends in January 2029. He says presidents before him long have wanted an event space larger than the rooms currently at the White House, and says the ballroom would end the practice of entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries in large, temporary pavilions on the south grounds.\n\nThe Trust asserts that the plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action was taken. The lawsuit notes that the Trust wrote to those entities and the National Park Service on Oct. 21, after East Wing demolition began, urging a stop to the project and asking the administration to comply with federal law, but received no response.\n\nThe lawsuit cites several federal statutes and rules detailing the role the planning and fine arts commission and lawmakers play in U.S. government construction projects.\n\nThe administration argued in its response that the president has the authority to modify the White House and included the extensive history of changes and additions to the Executive Mansion since it was built more than 200 years ago. It also asserted that the president is not subject to the statutes cited by the plaintiffs.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys said in the filing that the plaintiff's claims about the East Wing demolition are “moot” because the tear-down cannot be undone. The administration also argues that claims about future construction are “unripe” because the plans are not final.\n\nThe administration also contends that the Trust cannot establish “irreparable harm” because above-ground construction is not expected until spring. It argues that the reviews sought in the lawsuit, consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, “will soon be underway without this Court's involvement.”\n\nTrump's ballroom project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among his political adversaries, but the lawsuit is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop his plans for an addition that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing was torn down.\n\nIn 2000, the National Park Service's Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House first identified the need for a larger event space to address an increase in visitors and to provide a venue suitable for major events, according to the administration's filing.",

    "description": "Norovirus is the most common cause of vomiting and diarrhea.",
    "fullText": "What is norovirus? “It is our most common cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and actually food-borne illness in the United States,” said Dr. Brintha Vasagar, a family physician in Wisconsin.\n\nThose are the two most common symptoms, but fever, body aches, and stomachaches are sometimes reported, too.\n\nWe typically experience higher rates of norovirus “from November to April, so we’re still pretty early in this season,” Vasagar added.\n\nNorovirus cases are currently elevated, but a little lower than where they were by this time last year, said Dr. Camile Gooden, an internal medicine physician at NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk in New York. However, “Recently, there has been a surge in norovirus ... we’re seeing more positive testing,” Gooden added. This is due to a new strain of the virus.\n\nThe virus spreads easily and in different ways than other winter viruses. Here’s what to know:\n\nWhile common winter illnesses such as the flu and COVID-19 spread through coughs and sneezes, norovirus spreads differently.\n\n“Traditionally, it’s [spread through] what we call the fecal-oral route, so stool to mouth, but it’s a pretty darn resilient virus, so it’s not like you’re licking other people’s poop,” said Dr. Ross Newman, a pediatrician based in Oregon and a medical communicator on social media.\n\nInstead, contaminated particles end up on people’s hands or surfaces they touch — and can sometimes even spread through the air, he explained.\n\nIf someone who has norovirus doesn’t wash their hands well after using the bathroom and then uses a towel to dry their hands, that towel can then become a carrier. Then, if a non-infected person uses that towel to dry their hands, they could pick up the virus.\n\n“It can exist on surfaces for long periods of time ... it can be on blankets, gloves, clothing, hair, skin ... or it can just be from filthy hands,” Newman added.\n\nContaminated surfaces can become a “source of spread,” added Gooden, which is how norovirus commonly rips through places with long-term care settings, day cares and cruise ships — all spaces where people are in close quarters and touching the same door handles, tables, light switches and toys.\n\nNorovirus can also spread through contaminated food, according to Gooden. “If you eat food that has not been washed properly and is contaminated, you could also get ill,” noted Gooden.\n\nThis could be from a sick person preparing the food or even from contaminated raw produce, she said.\n\n“You want to make sure that when you are consuming raw vegetables and raw fruits, that those have been washed appropriately because sometimes, even on farms, there might be exposure through irrigation systems to norovirus,” Gooden said.\n\nYou don’t need any fancy produce soaps, instead washing produce well with water is enough to kill the virus, Gooden said.\n\nNorovirus can also spread through shellfish that becomes contaminated by infected water. In this case, fully cooking shellfish can kill the virus, according to Vasagar.\n\n“The best way to protect yourself is really to perform good hand washing — and you have to use soap and water. You can’t rely on hand sanitizers necessarily, especially if you’ve touched contaminated surfaces or have come in contact with someone who is ill with norovirus,” Gooden said.\n\nA quick hand rinse isn’t good enough; use hot water and soap, and wash your hands for “the full Happy Birthday song, twice,” Vasagar stressed. “Most people don’t wash their hands long enough to really be effective.”\n\nBeyond hand-washing, disinfecting surfaces with bleach-based cleansers and washing linens frequently can kill the virus, Vasagar noted. This is especially important if someone in your home is sick.\n\n“The spread is ... so contagious that you’re really going to have to work hard to make sure everyone else in the family doesn’t get it,” Vasagar said.\n\n“The vomiting associated with norovirus is generally short-lived, 24 to 48 hours, but the diarrhea can last two weeks,” Newman said.\n\nPeople are most contagious the first one or two days after their symptoms start, but they can shed the virus for weeks after that point, Newman added.\n\nIf you get sick, stay home (and keep sick kids home) if you’re able, all three experts told HuffPost. Also watch out for dehydration, which is “the biggest concern with complications from most stomach bugs,” Newman said.\n\n“You’re losing a lot of fluids with vomiting, a lot of fluids with diarrhea,” Vasagar said. Signs of dehydration include decreased urination, dizziness, dry mouth, confusion, and fatigue. If you notice any of these symptoms, get to a doctor.\n\nTo combat dehydration, drink plenty of fluids, whether that’s water, tea, Gatorade or soup, Gooden noted. Even if you’re throwing up, you should still drink small amounts of fluids.\n\n“It’s really important to monitor for any development of severe symptoms,” Gooden said. “If your symptoms continue beyond 72 hours, usually, that’s a time that I would advise to reach out to your health care professional.”\n\nIf you have fevers, severe abdominal pain, or develop blood in your stool, you should seek medical attention, Gooden added.\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.\n\nAlso in Goodful: Homeowners Who Found Incredible Hidden Treasures In Their New Homes Are Sharing Their Finds, And Now I'm Checking Every Inch Of My Walls For Secret Compartments\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"NEVER Disclose This\": Women Are Sharing The \"Urgent\" Safety Tips That Other Women Taught Them, And They're Crucial To Know\n\nAlso in Goodful: I’m Not Saying You Hate Christmas, But If You Can’t Fill In The Blanks To Even 75% Of These Christmas Lyrics… Well, It's Not Looking Good",

    "fullText": "Chris Mooney is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a CNN Climate contributor. He is currently a professor of practice in the Environmental Institute at the University of Virginia.\n\nPlanet-warming pollution rates exploded after the end of World War II. James Watt’s steam engine launched the Industrial Revolution in 1769. Before that, for thousands of years, humans were clearing forested land for farming, releasing carbon from trees and plants into the atmosphere.\n\nThe severity of global warming has long depended on your frame of reference — on what temperature you think was normal for the Earth before humans began changing it. But what year should mark that moment?\n\nThat’s what makes a groundbreaking new temperature dataset released by a group of scientists based in the United Kingdom so striking. The datasets used to diagnose the modern history of the planet’s climate — and to proclaim that the world is now very near to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming — typically begin with the year 1850.\n\nThe new one goes all the way back to 1781.\n\nThis extended time frame matters because greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increased 2.5 percent between 1750 and 1850, enough to have caused some warming that the data hasn’t accounted for.\n\nThe new temperature record, dubbed GloSAT, helps contribute to the growing sense among scientists that the Earth has warmed more than what calculations based on the 1850 starting year would suggest.\n\n“That 1850 start time is one that’s chosen for essentially practical considerations, given the information that’s available,” said Colin Morice, lead author of the new study and a scientist with the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK. “For sure, 1850 is not the start of industrialization.”\n\nThe new dataset, published in Earth System Science Data by 16 scientists, shows a significantly cooler Earth from the late 1700s through 1849 compared with 1850-1900 — the latter being what scientists have defined as the “preindustrial” baseline period used to assess the planet’s temperature change.\n\nHowever, not all of the warming between the two early periods can be attributed to human activities, scientists caution.\n\nAmong other factors, two very powerful volcanic eruptions in the early 1800s had a marked cooling effect on the Earth. Particles from those eruptions spread around the planet’s stratosphere and blocked some sunlight.\n\n“We know 1815 was Tambora, with well documented impacts,” said Ed Hawkins, a researcher with the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and one of the study’s authors. “The 1808 eruption was nearly as big, but we have no idea where it happened.”\n\nSome of the warming that occurred by the late 19th century is a natural recovery from the cooling effect of these eruptions. But perhaps not only.\n\nThe leading climate science authority, the U.N. Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change, concluded in 2021 that there had probably been some human-caused warming between 1750 and 1850, assessing that it was between 0 and 0.2 degrees.\n\nThe scientists behind GloSAT come down right in the middle of that range.\n\nMorice and many of the same researchers contributed to a second study, accepted in the journal Environmental Research Letters, which uses the new dataset and climate models to analyze how much additional warming humans may have caused between 1750 and 1850. That study, led by Andrew Ballinger of the University of Edinburgh, determined that 0.09 degrees of warming occurred that was attributable to humans, as opposed to other factors, such as the waning effect of the large volcanic eruptions seen in the early 1800s.\n\n“This period of time is just so interesting, it’s got this large amount of volcanism in it,” said Andrew Schurer, one of that study’s authors and a researcher at the University of Edinburgh in the UK.\n\nPiers Forster, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds in the UK, landed on a similar number using a very different approach in a study last year. Forster used the very strong and simple relationship between the planet’s temperature and how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere.\n\nIt led him to conclude that the very early rise in carbon dioxide levels would have had a significant effect.\n\n“We think you get between an extra .1 and .2 degrees if you try and look at the total effect of human activity going back a bit further,” Forster said.\n\nNo one was keeping track of global temperature changes 300 years ago. But there were lots of people documenting local temperature change. Combinging their efforts helps modern researchers understand what was happening at a global scale.\n\nThe study of the oldest temperatures recorded by human observers is interwoven with the history of science, exploration and, frequently, the commercial activities that required businesses to collect the data.\n\nEarly modern records go back to the 17th century. Following the path of the scientific revolution generally, measurements began in Europe — and then spread to North America and around the globe. The Central England Temperature series, the longest of its kind, begins in 1659, stitching together the work of many observers. A temperature record in Uppsala, Sweden began in 1722, aided by the work of Anders Celsius, himself.\n\nThese very old temperature records feed into the new GloSAT analysis — and in some locations, they show a very large amount of warming.\n\nConsider a record that has been kept in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps at Hohenpeissenberg since 1781, when Augustinian clerics first began recording temperatures. They were contributing to the Societas Meteorologica Palatina, an early coordinated scientific effort that created a network of weather stations centered in today’s Germany, but extending as far afield as St. Petersburg in Russia.\n\nThis record is lucky to have survived, said Wolfgang Steinbrecht, a scientist with the German Weather Service who works at the observatory.\n\n“During the Napoleonic wars, all the monasteries were disbanded,” Steinbrecht said. “All the measurements were taken by people at monasteries, they were the ones who could read and write. But Hohenpeissenberg survived, now we have measurements more or less without gaps.”\n\nThe Hohenpeissenberg temperature record shows nearly 3 degrees of regional warming when the last 10 years are compared with temperatures between 1781 and 1849.\n\nBut how many local measurements, like this one, do you need before you can begin to deduce the the temperature of the entire planet? And how do you deal with the oceans?\n\nAfter all, measurements at Uppsala, Hoehenpeissenberg and other similar locations track early temperature changes on Earth’s land. But oceans cover about 70% of the planet. Reconstructing temperatures here, too, is a key addition of the GloSAT record.\n\nShips measured temperature in the 18th century, though not as systematically as people did on land. The British East India Company for instance, often took air pressure, temperature and other measurements as they sailed and traded silk, spices and sometimes slaves between Europe and India, China, and other locations in the late 18th century.\n\nThese ships provide a particularly detailed record, although scientists have had to carefully adjust the measurements because of biases — ships heat up dramatically during the day, for instance — and other factors.\n\n“The East India Company made their measurements for competitive advantage,” said Elizabeth Kent, a scientist with the National Oceanography Centre in the UK and one of the study’s authors.\n\n“They wanted to know the prevailing winds so they could do their trading faster, and the temperature of the currents helped them understand if they were catching the currents,” Kent continued. “So, we know that they were seriously trying to measure these things as well as they [could].”\n\nMany whaling vessels also took temperature measurements in the Atlantic ocean off the US coastline, and their records were compiled by Matthew Fountaine Maury, a US naval officer and early oceanographer. Trade routes meant ocean air temperatures were far better measured in the Atlantic and Indian oceans than over the vast Pacific.\n\nThe new dataset relies on all of these sources. It uses a measurement of marine air temperatures – not the temperature of the water itself, as in other datasets – because these were more frequently taken aboard ships in these early years. (This approach actually shows a slightly lower level of warming during the years of overlap with current temprature datasets, the authors note.)\n\nThe scientists fully admit that measurements become much more sparse as one goes back further in time, and indeed, their map of the Earth’s temperatures in the period from 1781-1800 comes with a lot of gaps. For this reason, the researchers ascribe a higher level of uncertainty to their estimates of the Earth’s true temperature during these early years.\n\n“As the authors themselves make clear, there is larger uncertainty prior to 1850. But it is cooler, it’s undoubtedly cooler,” said Peter Thorne, a climate scientist at Maynooth University in Ireland, who served as a reviewer for the new study.\n\nIf that additional bit of warming did occur, though, what might it mean for how we understand the state of the planet today, and how much humans have changed it?\n\nIt might seem daunting or disheartening to contemplate that climate change is an even bigger problem than we thought, or that we’ve done more to cause it than we realized. But it’s not so simple, scientists say.\n\nZeke Hausfather, a researcher with Berkeley Earth who is familiar with the GloSAT work, says he thinks it’s a significant advance. But he cautions about leaping to the conclusion that this realization of some additional early warming undermines climate goals, such as those written into the Paris climate agreement, as those are generally understood to be based on the 1850 to 1900 baseline.\n\n“I think it tells us something about pre-1850 warming,” Hausfather said, “I just don’t think we should read too much into what that implies for our ability to meet climate goals.”\n\nThorne, who reviewed the new study, agrees to a point. But he says the finding of earlier warming isn’t irrelevant — you just need to think carefully about what it means and doesn’t mean.\n\n“It does mean we warmed the Earth more, but it doesn’t mean the impacts are suddenly going to occur sooner,” Thorne said. “They are where they are. And they’ve almost invariably been calculated relative to a much more recent reference period.”\n\nStill, that additional warming can’t be ignored in assessing the total human impact on the Earth. It could even be part of what forced changes in some Earth systems.\n\nUltimately, for Thorne, it’s all part of a picture in which we should be increasingly concerned about the potential for mounting impacts.\n\n“It changes our perception of how far we have already pushed the climate system in important ways,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine has claimed to have blown up a Russian submarine using underwater drones for the first time.\n\nThe submarine, which was carrying Kalibr cruise missiles and is estimated to cost close to £300m, was critically damaged after being hit in the Russian port city of Novorossiysk, according to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Monday.\n\nThe SBU did not specify the date or time of the attack. If verified, this would be the first time an underwater drone has hit a Russian submarine since the invasion began in 2022.\n\nRussia’s Black Sea Fleet said a Ukrainian attempt to attack the Russian naval base failed, according to news agencies.\n\n“Not &NoBreak;a single ‌ship ‍or submarine of the Black Sea Fleet located at ‍the base in Novorossiysk Bay &NoBreak;was damaged,” agencies quoted the Black Sea Fleet as saying on Monday. “There ‍were no injuries to crew.”\n\nVideo footage purportedly of the attack shows multiple Russian warships and a surfaced submarine, before there’s a sudden explosion in the water.\n\nThe clip has not been independently verified, but Reuters confirmed the location as Novorossiysk using the port’s layout and piers.\n\nThe SBU claimed the 636.6 Varshavyanka-class submarine, which “carried four Kalibr cruise missile launchers”, had been left effectively inoperable.\n\nReplacing it, considering international sanctions imposed on Moscow, would cost up to £370m, the SBU said.\n\n“The Security Service of Ukraine carried out another unique special operation and launched a naval attack in the port of Novorossiysk,” the SBU said in a statement.\n\n“For the first time in history, Sub Sea Baby underwater drones blew up a Russian... submarine.”\n\nUkraine’s upgraded “Sub Sea Baby” drones were unveiled in October, according to the statement.\n\nThe drones reportedly operate at distances of more than 1,500km and carry a payload of up to 2,000kg, around double the previous limit.\n\nAccording to Kyiv, they have previously been used to strike the support columns of the Kerch Bridge, which links Crimea with mainland Russia, and three sanctioned oil tankers linked to Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Black Sea.\n\nDmytro Pletenchuk, the Ukrainian navy spokesman, told Reuters the operation to hit a submarine marked “another turning point” in the naval battle between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nAlexander Kamyshin, an advisor to ‍President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, ‌wrote on X that it was the first time in history that an underwater drone had neutralised a submarine. “I’ve been waiting for this day,” he said.\n\nThe Kalibr is one of the most modern and accurate cruise missiles in Russia’s arsenal. They are expensive and there are doubts about how many Moscow has left owing to difficulties procuring Western electronics.\n\nThe Varshavyanka submarine is known as the “Black Hole” because of the hull’s ability to absorb sounds and remain invisible to sonars.\n\nRussia is believed to have just 12 Varshavyanka submarines – six in its Black Sea fleet and six in its Pacific fleet, according to Ivan Stupak, Ukrainian military analyst and former SBU officer.\n\nHe added on social media that Novorossiysk is a heavily guarded port. “This is a real game-changer. As a result, one more Kalibr cruise missile carrier is lost and the potential total missile salvo against Ukrainian territory is slightly reduced,” said Mr Stupak.\n\nUkraine has become a world leader in sea drones and is thought to have carried out at least 13 attacks with them.\n\nKyiv has used them to attack Russian military ships and a naval base in Sevastopol, which forced Moscow to relocate its vessels from the Crimean port to the one in Novorossiysk.\n\nUkraine has stepped up its naval attacks in the Black Sea in recent weeks. Russia regularly strikes the Ukrainian port of Odessa.\n\nDrones have become a crucial part in Kyiv’s fight against Russia, as the devices are cheaper and quicker to produce than traditional weaponry.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Dec 15 (Reuters) - Ford Motor said on Monday it will take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry's retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration's policies and ​weakening EV demand.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will stop making the F-150 Lightning in its electric vehicle form, but will ‌pivot to producing an extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an EREV, which uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping ‌a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.\n\nInstead, Ford said it will pivot hard into gas and hybrid models, and eventually hire thousands of workers, even though there will be some layoffs at a jointly owned Tennessee battery plant in the near term. The company expects its global mix of hybrids, extended-range EVs and pure EVs to reach 50% by 2030, from 17% today.\n\nFord will spread out the writedown, taken primarily in ⁠the fourth quarter and continuing through next year ‌and into 2027, the company said. About $8.5 billion is related to cancelling planned EV models. Around $6 billion is tied to the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and $5 billion on what Ford called “program-related ‍expenses.”\n\nThe automaker also raised its 2025 guidance for adjusted earnings before taxes and interest, to about $7 billion, up from a previous range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion.\n\nFord’s shift reflects the auto industry’s response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook ​for electrics dimmed significantly this year as U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could ‌encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars.\n\nU.S. sales of electric vehicles fell about 40% in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand. The Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations.\n\n“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations.",

    "description": "These are the four most common and consequential mistakes a bank teller sees retirees make with their Social Security benefits.",
    "fullText": "Over 74 million Americans rely on Social Security benefits to pay the bills and enhance their lifestyles in retirement. Factors like when they claim their benefit, the percentage of their income they expect it to replace and numerous other variables determine how much financial security the program will provide. No matter if you have to live off of your Social Security check alone are use it to subsidize your fixed income and other retirement accounts, it’s important to make sure you’re mapping out the best course.\n\nCheck Out: Social Security’s Biggest Lie: Why ‘Full Retirement Age’ Isn’t What You Think\n\nRead Next: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\n\nBank tellers are on the front lines. They stand between retirees and their money — literally — and see the positive outcomes when people get it right firsthand. However, they also see the consequences suffered by those who get it wrong.\n\nGOBankingRates spoke with Izabella Bogumil, a relationship advisor with Addition Financial Credit Union in Lake Mary, Florida. Relationship advisors are Addition Financial’s equivalent of tellers, and Bogumil serves as the bridge between the retirees she serves and the Social Security income she safeguards on their behalf.\n\nIn her experience, these are the four most common and consequential mistakes she sees retirees make with their Social Security benefits. Avoid them to get as much out of the program as possible.\n\nThe full retirement age (FRA), when recipients can collect their entire benefit through monthly payments, is 67 for those born in 1960 or later. Everyone becomes eligible to claim Social Security at 62, but the tradeoff for an early retirement is a smaller check.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) reduces benefits by 5/9 of 1% for every month you claim early up to 36 months. After that, the SSA further reduces your benefit by 5/12 of 1% per month until your check shrinks by up to 30%, an outcome Bogumil sees all too often.\n\n“The most common mistake I see is with seniors who reach age 62 and then immediately claim their benefits,” she said. “This makes them lose a significant amount of their full benefit per month. With everything getting more expensive as time goes on, seniors who are cashing out early are struggling to make ends meet.”\n\nJust as the SSA reduces benefits for those who claim early, they issue credits that increase your payment for delaying retirement and claiming late or delaying benefits. “If possible, I recommend waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security to receive the maximum benefit,” said Bogumil.",

Within hours, he had lost two sons, a daughter-in-law and his 4-year-old and 10-year-old grandsons. The five were among 13 villagers killed that day by Israeli forces.\n\nIsraeli troops had raided the village — not for the first time — seeking to capture, as they said, members of a militant group planning attacks into Israel. Israel said militants opened fire at the troops, wounding six, and that troops returned fire and brought in air support.\n\nHamadeh, like others in Beit Jin, dismissed Israel’s claims of militants operating in the village. The residents said armed villagers confronted Israeli soldiers they saw as invaders, only to be met with Israeli tank and artillery fire, followed by a drone strike. The government in Damascus called it a “massacre.”\n\nThe raid and similar recent Israeli actions inside Syria have increased tensions, frustrated locals and also scuttled chances — despite U.S. pressure — of any imminent thaw in relations between the two neighbors.\n\nAn Israeli-Syrian rapprochement seemed possible last December, after Sunni Islamist-led rebels overthrew autocratic Syrian President Bashar Assad, a close ally of Iran, Israel’s archenemy.\n\nSyria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the rebels who took over the country, said he has no desire for a conflict with Israel. But Israel was suspicious, mistrusting al-Sharaa because of his militant past and his group’s history of aligning with al-Qaida.\n\nIsraeli forces quickly moved to impose a new reality on the ground. They mobilized into the U.N.-mandated buffer zone in southern Syria next to the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community.\n\nIsraeli forces erected checkpoints and military installations, including on a hilltop that overlooks wide swaths of Syria. They set up landing pads on strategic Mt. Hermon nearby. Israeli reconnaissance drones frequently fly over surrounding Syrian towns, with residents often sighting Israeli tanks and Humvee vehicles patrolling those areas.\n\nIsrael has said its presence is temporary to clear out pro-Assad remnants and militants — to protect Israel from attacks. But it has given no indication its forces would leave anytime soon. Talks between the two countries to reach a security agreement have so far yielded no result.\n\nThe events in neighboring Lebanon, which shares a border with both Israel and Syria, and the two-year war in Gaza between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas have also raised concerns among Syrians that Israel plans a permanent land grab in southern Syria.\n\nIsraeli forces still have a presence in southern Lebanon, over a year since a U.S.-brokered ceasefire halted the latest Israel-Hezbollah war. That war began a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hezbollah firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with its ally Hamas.\n\nIsrael’s operations in Lebanon, which included bombardment across the tiny country and a ground incursion last year, have severely weakened Hezbollah.\n\nToday, Israel still controls five hilltop points in southern Lebanon, launches near-daily airstrikes against alleged Hezbollah targets and flies reconnaissance drones over the country, sometimes also carrying out overnight ground incursions.\n\nIn Gaza, where U.S. President Donald Trump’s 20-point ceasefire deal has brought about a truce between Israel and Hamas, similar buffer zones under Israeli control are planned even after Israel eventually withdraws from the more than half of the territory it still controls.\n\nAt a meeting of regional leaders and international figures earlier this month in Doha, Qatar, al-Sharaa accused Israel of using imagined threats to justify aggressive actions.\n\n“All countries support an Israeli withdrawal\" from Syria to the lines prior to Assad's ouster, he said, adding that it was the only way for both Syria and Israel to \"emerge in a state of safety.”\n\nThe new leadership in Damascus has had a multitude of challenges since ousting Assad.\n\nAl-Sharaa's government has been unable to implement a deal with local Kurdish-led authorities in northeast Syria, and large areas of southern Sweida province are now under a de facto administration led by the Druze religious minority, following sectarian clashes there in mid-July with local Bedouin clans.\n\nSyrian government forces intervened, effectively siding with the Bedouins. Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed, many by government fighters. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights.\n\nIsrael, which has cast itself as a defender of the Druze, though many of them in Syria are critical of its intentions, has also made overtures to Kurds in Syria.\n\n“The Israelis here are pursuing a very dangerous strategy,” said Michael Young, Senior Editor at the Beirut-based Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\nIt contradicts, he added, the positions of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt — and even the United States — which are \"all in agreement that what has to come out of this today is a Syrian state that is unified and fairly strong,” he added.\n\nIsrael and the US at odds over Syria\n\nIn a video released from his office after visiting Israeli troops wounded in Beit Jin, barely 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the edge of the U.N. buffer zone, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel seeks a “demilitarized buffer zone from Damascus to the (U.N.) buffer zone,” including Mt. Hermon.\n\n“It is also possible to reach an agreement with the Syrians, but we will stand by our principles in any case,” Netanyahu said.\n\nHis strategy has proven to be largely unpopular with the international community, including with Washington, which has backed al-Sharaa’s efforts to consolidate his control across Syria.\n\nIsrael’s operations in southern Syria have drawn rare public criticism from Trump, who has taken al-Sharaa, once on Washington's terror list, under his wing.\n\n“It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social after the Beit Jin clashes.\n\nSyria is also expected to be on the agenda when Netanyahu visits the U.S. and meets with Trump later this month.\n\nExperts doubt Israel will withdraw from Syria anytime soon — and the new government in Damascus has little leverage or power against Israel's much stronger military.\n\n“If you set up landing pads, then you are not here for short-term,” Issam al-Reiss, a military adviser with the Syrian research group ETANA, said of Israeli actions.\n\nHamadeh, the laborer from Beit Jin, said he can “no longer bear the situation” after losing five of his family.\n\nIsrael, he said, “strikes wherever it wants, it destroys whatever it wants, and kills whoever it wants, and no one holds it accountable.”",

    "description": "Venezuela's PDVSA was subject to a cyberattack that it blamed on the United States, the state-run oil company said on Monday, adding that its operations were unaffected even though",
    "fullText": "Dec 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela's PDVSA was subject to a cyberattack that it blamed on the United States, the state-run oil company said on Monday, adding that its operations were unaffected even though four sources said systems remained down ​with oil cargo deliveries suspended.\n\nTensions are high between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments, with a large-scale U.S. military buildup in ‌the southern Caribbean, U.S. strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats and comments from U.S. President Donald Trump that land operations may begin soon in Venezuela.\n\nThe Venezuelan government ‌has said the U.S. is seeking regime change to take over the country's vast oil reserves. Last week the U.S. Coast Guard seized a very large crude carrier (VLCC) carrying some 1.85 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy oil sold by PDVSA.\n\nPDVSA and the oil ministry said in statements on Monday that the cyberattack was carried out by \"foreign interests in complicity with domestic entities who are seeking to destroy the country's right to sovereign energy ⁠development.\"\n\nThey alleged the attack was part of U.S. efforts ‌to control Venezuela's oil through \"force and piracy.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPDVSA provided no further details, although the company said it had recovered from the attack. Venezuela's government ‍regularly blames problems like blackouts on conspirators from the opposition and foreign entities like the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, without giving evidence.\n\nSources said the effects were ongoing.\n\n\"There's no delivery (of cargoes), all systems are down,\" one company source said.\n\nOil output, refining and domestic distribution were not affected, the sources said, but ​the company on Monday failed to restart administrative systems, forcing workers to keep written records of operations.\n\nTwo other sources said PDVSA ordered ‌administrative and operational workers to disconnect from the company's systems and to limit access of indirect workers to PDVSA's facilities.\n\nLast week's VLCC seizure was the first interception of a tanker or cargo coming from Venezuela, which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2019, and a sign of growing pressure on President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe seizure has already led to a sharp fall in Venezuelan oil exports, also hitting crisis-stricken Cuba, which is facing daily power cuts.\n\nMore than 11 million barrels of oil are stuck on board other vessels in Venezuelan ⁠waters since last week. Among the few vessels setting sail are the ​ones chartered by U.S. oil firm Chevron, one of PDVSA's key partners, which continue ​departing under an authorization previously granted by Washington, according to shipping data.\n\nA tanker carrying Russian naphtha for PDVSA and at least four supertankers due to pick up crude cargoes in Venezuela have made u-turns, ship monitoring data ‍showed on Monday.\n\nBenin-flagged tanker Boltaris, which ⁠was carrying some 300,000 barrels of Russian naphtha bound for Venezuela, made a u-turn late last week and is now heading for Europe without having discharged, according to LSEG vessel monitoring data.\n\nAt least four VLCCs that were in PDVSA's schedules to ⁠load crude at Venezuelan ports in the coming weeks have also made u-turns in recent days, monitoring service TankerTrackers.com said.\n\nVenezuela's crude output averaged 1.17 million barrels per ‌day last month according to official figures, while oil exports rose to some 952,000 bpd, according to shipping data.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Reuters; editing by Julia Symmes-Cobb, Nathan Crooks and Nia Williams)",

    "description": "Axios reported on three changes over the past week.",
    "fullText": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris is making it clear that she is still keeping her options open on a potential presidential run, Axios reported.\n\nAccording to Axios, three developments over the past week have been viewed by many Democrats as the start of a 2028 campaign, including the recent expansion of her book tour to new cities for “107 Days,” which details her eleventh-hour entrance and defeat to President Donald Trump during the 2024 election.\n\nThe outlet on Sunday also pointed to her appearance before the Democratic National Committee’s annual winter meeting and her sudden change in rhetoric — such as critiquing both political parties and the status quo.\n\n“Both parties have failed to hold the public’s trust,” Harris said during her speech. “Government is viewed as fundamentally unable to meet the needs of its people. In these and in so many other ways, the people feel that the very institutions that were designed to support them have failed them. And they are not wrong.”\n\nHarris has continued to remain toward the top in recent polling related to the 2028 race. Among a pool of Democrats, the former vice president won 31.1% of the vote, standing ahead of California Gov. Gavin Newsom with 20.3% and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg with 10%, a new Big Data Poll found. Newsom has also led in several other polls.\n\nThe reported bid was quickly met with mixed but mainly negative reactions on social media.\n\n“Oh lord, the democrats are gifting Trump a third term,” Jason Calacanis, a co-host of the “All-In Post,” posted on X.\n\nMehdi Hasan, the progressive founder of the media company Zeteo, bluntly wrote: “Insanity.”\n\nInsanity https://t.co/sm5VovGbY1\n\n— Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) December 15, 2025\n\n“There are 1,057 days until the 2028 election. Is that long enough?” asked Byron York, a chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner.\n\nA polling aggregator account responded with a clip from “The Office.”\n\n“Harris/Walz 2028!” another user added.\n\nHarris has yet to directly weigh in on her political future. In an interview released last week by The New York Times, she threw cold water on discussing whether she was ready to run for president again.\n\n“It’s three years from now,” Harris said with emphasis. “I mean, honestly.”\n\nHarris did, however, note that she has been free from what she characterized as the “transactional” result of campaigning, including asking Americans for their vote at the ballot box.\n\n“I understand the focus on ’28 and all that,” Harris said in a wide-ranging interview. “But there will be a marble bust of me in Congress. I am a historic figure like any vice president of the United States ever was.”",

Fishman in the letter to Navy Secretary John Phelan.\n\nTrump himself had lashed out at the lawmakers, who all have military backgrounds after years of service.\n\nKelly’s attorney warned of legal action if the department sought to pursue the senator in any forum — “criminal, disciplinary, or administrative.”\n\nFishman wrote they would “take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach.”\n\nSecret Service official says ballroom construction doesn’t yet meet agency’s security standards\n\nIn its Monday court filing, the Trump administration included a declaration from the deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service saying more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.”\n\nThe administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in-person without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among Trump’s political adversaries, but the lawsuit by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded group, is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) addition.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to block construction until the project goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification.\n\nTrump administration says White House ballroom construction is a matter of national security\n\nFor that reason, the construction project must continue, the Trump administration said in a court filing Monday.\n\nThe filing came in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt the project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress.\n\nExecutive order directs whole of government mobilization against drug traffickers\n\nThe order instructs the State and Treasury departments to pursue the financial assets of and sanctions on financial institutions and groups involved in fentanyl trafficking. It also calls for greater cooperation between the Pentagon and Justice Department on fentanyl and drug trafficking issues.\n\nThe order directs the homeland security secretary to “identify threat networks related to fentanyl smuggling” by using intelligence resources that in the past were devoted to the detection of other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe federal government by law has a wide range of national security and law enforcement capabilities to combat drug smuggling, including asset forfeiture, targeted arrests and surveillance of criminal organizations.\n\nThe Trump administration’s earlier this year designated some drug cartels as terror groups, a move that may unlock more coordination between the armed forces and domestic law enforcement but has been questioned by legal analysts over its scope and legality.\n\nWisconsin judge allows case against former Trump aides to proceed to trial\n\nA Wisconsin judge has ruled there is enough evidence to proceed to trial in a felony forgery case against an attorney and an aide to President Donald Trump related to action taken after 2020 election.\n\nThe judge on Monday at a preliminary hearing found there was probable cause to proceed with the charges after taking testimony from a special agent with the state Department of Justice who detailed the allegations.\n\nThe charges relate to attempts by the former aides to present a slate of Republican electors to Congress falsely claiming that Trump had won Wisconsin that year.\n\nFormer Trump attorney Jim Troupis and former Trump aide Mike Roman were in court for the hearing but did not testify. The judge postponed the preliminary hearing for a third person charged, Ken Chesebro, amid questions about what comments he made to prosecutors could be admitted in court.\n\nPence’s group urges Trump to fire RFK Jr.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence’s group Advancing American Freedom on Monday called on Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over what the group argues has been a slow-walked safety review of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nKennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary have pledged to review the drug’s safety but are facing mounting pressure from abortion opponents to move more quickly. Mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago, has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.\n\nIn a statement alongside Monday’s memo, the Republican Pence accused Kennedy of being unable or unwilling to keep promises to abortion opponents and said he should step aside.\n\nThe attacks come as Kennedy has faced criticism from both sides but also waves of support as he seeks to dramatically reshape the nation’s health agencies and target vaccines.\n\nTrump again says he’s ended hostilities between Thailand and Cambodia. But fighting continues\n\nThe two countries agreed to a ceasefire in July, and formalized the deal in October when Trump was in Malaysia. But lately, fighting has resumed. Trump on Friday said he had called the leaders and got them to agree to another truce -- but officials said heavy combat continues.\n\nNevertheless, Trump on Monday said in the Oval Office that “we were able to straighten that out.”\n\nThe two countries were “having a little problem yesterday,” Trump said. “I called them and I said, ‘look, fellas, relax. You gotta take it easy.’ They started the war again, and I got it ended.”\n\nTrump says he has asked Xi to free Jimmy Lai\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he feels “so badly” about Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong media mogul who on Monday was convicted in a landmark national security case.\n\nLai, 78, now could spend the rest of his life in prison. On Monday, Trump confirmed that he has brought up Lai’s case with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and asked for Lai’s release.\n\n“I spoke to President XI about it, and I asked to consider his release,” Trump said. “He’s not well, he’s an older man, and he’s not well, so I did put that request out. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nIn London and Washington, Jimmy Lai’s children have expressed gratitude for the support from the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump praises José Antonio Kast’s win in Chilean presidential election\n\nTrump touted the win by Kast, a far right conversative who comfortably defeated his left-of-center opponent in Sunday’s election, as a sign of his broader influence on politics across the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I look forward to pay my respects to him here,” Trump said of Kast. “He’s a very good person.”\n\nKast is the most conservative candidate to win Chile’s presidential election in 35 years. He won 58.2% of the votes on a campaign heavily centered on crime and immigration.\n\nTrump defends Syria’s new leader after attack that killed three Americans\n\nTrump said Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa “feels very badly” about an attack over the weekend that claimed the lives of two Iowa National Guard members and a U.S. civilian.\n\nTrump said the attack happened in a region of Syria that the new government doesn’t control.\n\n“This had nothing to do with him,” said Trump, speaking of al-Sharaa. He hosted al-Sharaa at the White House in November.\n\n“He feels very badly about it. He’s working on it. He’s a strong man, and this had nothing to do with the Syrian government,” Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. military and Trump have blamed the attack on the Islamic State group. Trump has threatened to retaliate.\n\nTrump defends FBI and calls Brown shooting a ‘school problem’\n\nTrump defended the FBI after a mass shooting at Brown University, arguing that questions about the case should be directed to officials at the Ivy League school in Rhode Island.\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that authorities do not yet know a motive in the shooting that killed two and injured others.\n\nPressed about why the FBI has not been able to identify a shooter, Trump called it a “school problem.” Brown “had their own guards, they had their own police and their own everything,” he said.\n\nTrump told reporters to “ask that question, really, to the school, not to the FBI,” which he said “came in after the fact.”\n\nHe said the FBI “will do a good job,” and cited the Charlie Kirk assassination as an example. In that case, the alleged killer’s family helped turn him in to authorities.\n\nTrump says the administration is considering changing how it treats marijuana\n\n“We are considering the idea because a lot of people want to see it,” the president said.\n\nTrump had said in August that he was reviewing whether the federal government should reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. Such a step could move the federal government closer to an approach already embraced by many states.\n\n“We are looking at that very strongly,” Trump said at the White House.\n\nTrump doubles down on criticizing Reiner and calls him ‘deranged’\n\nThe president was asked if he stood by his social media post in light of the pushback he was getting, including from those in his own party.\n\nUsing the third person, Trump said Reiner “was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned.”\n\n“I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way shape or form,” Trump said. “I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\nTrump signs executive order classifying fentanyl as a ‘weapon of mass destruction’\n\nHe signed the order in the Oval Office on Monday while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine, White House border czar Tom Homan and other top military officials.\n\nTrump says his administration is “formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is. No bomb does what this is doing.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the new designation would affect administration policy or what the legal implications would be for those impacted by fentanyl use or drug traffickers.\n\nThe term weapon of mass destruction has typically referred to nuclear, biological, chemical or kinetic threats capable of causing overwhelming and lasting damage to a population, infrastructure or environment. The term has also been hotly debated in American politics since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nTrump is recognizing 13 military service members with a Mexican Border Defense Medal\n\nThe president is in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump border czar Tom Homan, all of them hailing the border defense portion of his immigration crackdown.\n\nMilitary commanders and the award recipients looked on as Trump, Hegseth and Homan declared the border secure. Trump said his administration has “stopped the invasion in its tracks, and we are dismantling the cartels very rapidly.”\n\nHe added many hits from his 2024 campaign speech, blasting the immigration policies of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and declaring migrants who crossed the border “some of the worst people on Earth.”\n\nHoman praised “greatest president of my lifetime – yes, I said it.” Hegseth said the medal is a reprisal of a military honor awarded previously in the early 20th century\n\nTrump expresses optimism that Russia-Ukraine war is nearing the end\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump said while recapping war talks in Europe at the start of an unrelated White House event.\n\nTrump said he had a “long talk” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also spoke with the leaders of several European countries, including Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom as well as NATO.\n\n“Things are going along pretty well,” the president said.\n\nTrump said everyone wants to see the war end.\n\nPresident Trump to deliver remarks in North Carolina on Friday\n\nThe president’s upcoming trip to Rocky Mount was confirmed by Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley, a close Trump ally who was chair of the Republican National Committee during the 2024 election.\n\n“Let’s give him the North Carolina welcome he deserves,” Whatley wrote on social media. Whatley did not describe a reason for the trip in his social media post.\n\nThe event will take place at the Rocky Mount Events Center. Trump last week traveled to Pennsylvania to discuss the economy and cost of living.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson urges an appeal to ‘our better angels’ after weekend violence\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of tragedies,” the GOP speaker said as he arrived at the Capitol.\n\nHe drew on scripture to provide comfort to the Reiner family and others after “the senseless violence” this past weekend in Australia and at Brown University.\n\n“We have to appeal to our better angels,” Johnson said, and “I think we have to amplify those voices.”He declined to answer questions about Trump’s insensitive remarks after Reiner’s death.\n\nUS, Paraguay sign agreement setting out legal basis for American troops in the country\n\nThe United States and Paraguay have signed an agreement laying out the legal framework for American troops to be stationed the in the South American country and clearing the way for further defense and intelligence cooperation between the two as the Trump administration steps up military operations throughout the western hemisphere.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Ramirez signed the so-called “status of forces” agreement on Monday at the State Department. Both men hailed the deal as a step forward in relations that would enhance already strong counter-terrorism and -narcotics measures.\n\nSuch agreements outline the legal requirements and immunities for U.S. troops to be present in other countries, although there was no immediate announcement of any deployments to Paraguay.\n\nCalifornia hires two former CDC officials who rebuffed Trump, Kennedy\n\nCalifornia is hiring two former top federal health officials, state officials said Monday.\n\nSusan Monarez, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is helping California launch an effort to maintain trust in science-driven decision-making and improve public health infrastructure.\n\nMonarez is being joined by Dr. Debra Houry, CDC’s former chief medical officer. Both will be advisors, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.\n\nThe White House fired Monarez in August when she fell out of favor with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after only one month on the job. Houry and some other top CDC officials resigned in protest.\n\nA few Republicans speak out against Trump post on Reiner\n\nA few Republican members of Congress are calling out President Donald Trump’s insensitive social media post regarding the deaths of director-actor Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted ox X that regardless of how one felt about Reiner, “this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”\n\nRep. Mike Lawler of New York said of Trump’s post: “This statement is wrong. Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.”\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia tweeted: “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies. Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nNY Attorney General Letitia James makes first comments on the repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her\n\nJames said Monday she isn’t spending a lot of time thinking about the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her.\n\nJames, a Democrat, made her first public comments about the matter at an unrelated press conference after the news last week that a second federal grand jury had declined to indict her on charges related to her purchase of a home in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.\n\n“I don’t really spend a lot of time focused on this campaign of retribution,” said James. “I’ve got a lot of work on my hands — standing up and defending the rights of New Yorkers, protecting them from harms coming from Washington, D.C.”\n\nA judge last month threw out an indictment charging James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case at Republican President Donald Trump’s urging was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.\n\n“I’ve got a job to do,” said James, who had pleaded not guilty to the earlier indictment and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nPoll shows health costs are a rising concern among Americans\n\nAbout 3 in 10 Americans cite the cost of health care as the most urgent health problem facing the country, and about one-quarter say the health care system is in “crisis,” according to a new Gallup poll released Monday.\n\nThe poll also shows that only 16% of Americans are satisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S.\n\nThe findings from the survey conducted in November come as Congress has yet to address the spiking health insurance premium costs facing millions of Americans when Affordable Care Act health subsidies expire at the start of the new year.\n\nIt also comes as health expenses have risen across the board in response to a variety of factors, including inflation and the increasing use of expensive medications such as GLP-1 weight loss drugs.\n\nHunter Biden disbarred in Connecticut after complaints about federal convictions\n\nBiden agreed to the penalty and admitted to violating the state’s attorney conduct rules, but he did not admit to committing any crimes.\n\nHis father, former President Joe Biden, pardoned him last year after he was convicted of three felonies relating to a 2018 gun purchase and pleaded guilty to failing to pay federal taxes. He previously was disbarred in Washington, D.C.\n\nA Connecticut judge ordered the disbarment on Monday. Hunter Biden did not speak and he and his lawyer appeared via video at the virtual court hearing in Waterbury.\n\nThe judge found that Hunter Biden violated several lawyer ethics rules, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”\n\nIn a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment. He was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.\n\nWhite House views Russian openness to Ukraine joining the EU as a big deal\n\nThe U.S. officials who briefed reporters after Witkoff and Kushner met with Zelenskyy and other European officials in Berlin over the last two days said such an offer over Ukraine joining the EU would be a major concession by Moscow. But Russia has previously said it doesn’t object to Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "fullText": "New analysis suggests Bitcoin’s four-year cycles have been replaced — and the world’s biggest cryptocurrency could rebound to $140,000 at some point in the next 180 days.\n\nAccording to Copper, the arrival of exchange-traded funds tracking BTC’s spot price have changed this digital asset’s behavior, and given way to what it calls the “cost-basis returns cycle.”\n\n“Across 2024/2025, Bitcoin has exhibited the same repeatable pattern: price breaks to new all-time highs, corrects sharply, and then finds support almost perfectly at its ETF investor cost basis before beginning the next expansion.”\n\nThe company’s analysis suggests we have seen this play out three times since these ETFs launched back in January 2024 — with each cycle delivering returns of more than 60%.\n\nCopper also claims this has exposed a significant divide between crypto-focused traders and institutional investors, with some Bitcoin commentators claiming it is “the worst bull market ever.”\n\nSo… what exactly causes these sharp corrections once BTC enters price discovery mode? Well, its analysis suggests that institutions rebalancing their portfolios is primarily to blame — an activity that “transforms Bitcoin’s volatility into realized returns.”\n\n“Institutions are not ‘staking sats’ — in fact, most do not care about sats at all now that Bitcoin is accessible through equities-style ETF shares. They care about risk-adjusted contribution to a portfolio.”\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s been recommended that institutions allocate somewhere between 2% and 5% into Bitcoin — but a sudden surge in price can have a huge impact.\n\n“Without rebalancing, a modest 2% Bitcoin allocation drifts to 6.2% in less than 180 days during these cycles. A 5% allocation drifts dangerously close to double-digit.”\n\nCopper’s head of research Fadi Aboualfa told Cryptonews that Bitcoin is now at a critical juncture.\n\n“With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days. If cost basis rises 10% to 15% as in prior cycles, the resulting premium seen at past peaks produces a target range of $138,000 to $148,000.”\n\nThe prospect of a return to all-time highs within the next six months would provide a much-needed dose of “hopium” for traders. However, other analysts have warned there are few catalysts that can drive BTC forwards at the moment. The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25 percentage point interest rate reduction was largely priced in, with policymakers suggesting there may only be one cut in 2026.\n\nA big test will concern what happens if Bitcoin’s value falls below its cost basis for ETF investors — and whether sell-offs would intensify if institutions spent a prolonged period in the red.",

    "description": "\"Their worst fear had come true.\"",
    "fullText": "A troubling wildlife encounter in a Florida neighborhood is renewing conversations about rising human-animal conflict and the pressures pushing wild species into closer contact with communities.\n\nOfficials in Brevard County recently captured a large American crocodile after residents witnessed it swimming through a canal with a dog in its mouth — a moment one neighbor described as \"just heartbreaking,\" per WFOR.\n\nAccording to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the crocodile was first spotted Nov. 16 in a residential canal in South Patrick Shores, just north of Satellite Beach. Local resident Zack Spurlock told WESH that he rushed over after receiving a message from a friend who saw the reptile while on a walk with a baby stroller.\n\n\"Ten feet away is this 11-foot crocodile swimming with a golden retriever-type breed in its mouth,\" he said. \"I'm a dog owner. … My heart went out to them that their worst fear had come true.\"\n\nFWC officers responded, eventually capturing the crocodile — the only confirmed American crocodile seen in that area since 2018, per WFOR. After evaluating the situation, officials placed the animal into permanent captivity to protect both the community and the crocodile.\n\nWhile encounters between people and wildlife have always occurred, experts said they're becoming more frequent in areas experiencing rapid population growth, shrinking habitats, and shifting ecosystems linked to increasing global temperatures.\n\nAs natural spaces become more fragmented or stressed, animals may travel farther in search of food or cooler refuges — heightening the risk of dangerous run-ins for both humans and pets.\n\nProtecting and restoring habitats, improving water quality, and supporting biodiversity can reduce these conflicts and keep communities safer. Several conservation wins help prevent events like this, including efforts to restore coastal wetlands and wildlife corridors and community projects that create safer spaces for threatened species.\n\nFWC advises residents to keep pets leashed near water, avoid swimming outside designated areas, and maintain distance from crocodiles and alligators. Feeding wild reptiles is illegal and can make them more likely to approach humans.\n\nLong-term solutions rely on strengthening conservation policies, protecting wetlands, and supporting local wildlife organizations working to preserve healthy habitats. Everyday choices like reducing waste, supporting ecosystem-restoring nonprofits, and being alert in wildlife corridors help create safer boundaries between people and wildlife.\n\nFor urgent concerns, Florida residents can contact FWC's Nuisance Alligator Hotline at 866-392-4286.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

The problem isn't that the rich people aren't paying their taxes.”\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n\nRogan questioned whether increased taxes on wealthy individuals would actually help struggling Americans. “Are the poor people going to get that money? No. Are their services going to improve? No, you're just going to get more government,” he said.\n\nCarr, who once faced public backlash over a tax scandal in the UK, added humor to the topic, saying, “It was tax avoidance, not tax evasion. There’s a difference, and the difference is about 18 months in prison.”\n\nRogan pushed back on the idea that simply collecting more from the wealthy would improve anything for regular people. “What are you going to do? You’re going to enrich [the government],” he said. “They’re just going to get bigger and stronger and have even more power… It’s not going to help you if they tax rich people.”\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nCarr pointed to countries like Norway and Denmark, where high taxes result in actual public services that people seem to appreciate. Rogan responded that those systems work because those societies are small and manageable. “When you scale that to like hundreds of millions of people, things get really weird,” he said.\n\nRogan often voices his opinions about the role of money in today’s society. In a recent conversation on his podcast with comedian Ian Edwards, he warned that when money becomes the only goal, rich people lose their connection to others. “They don't give a f**k about you. They're just trying to make more numbers,” Rogan said about ultra-wealthy individuals focused solely on profit.\n\nHe also slammed how the pandemic pushed massive wealth into corporate hands while small businesses were left behind. “You can only go to Target during a pandemic… You can't go [to a small business], it's a pandemic,” he said. That shift, he argued, legally funneled money away from local economies.\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nBuffett's Secret to Wealth?

    "title": "'Being Charlie': Nick Reiner wrote a movie about being in rehab. His famous dad Rob Reiner made it into a movie.",
    "description": "\"He's the heart and soul of the film,\" Rob Reiner said about his son, Nick Reiner, who wrote the movie \"Being Charlie.\"",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: Business Insider published an interview with Rob Reiner and his son Nick Reiner in May 2016 about their movie, \"Being Charlie,\" which Nick wrote and is based on his experiences with drug addiction. On December 15, 2025, Nick Reiner was arrested on a murder charge in connection with the deaths of his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner. Below is the 2016 article.\n\nFor the last 30 years, Rob Reiner has been best known for directing movies like “Stand by Me,” “The Princess Bride,” “When Harry Met Sally,” and “A Few Good Men.” The titles have brought joy to millions.\n\nBut the Reiner household hasn't been all happy. The legendary actor/filmmaker’s son, Nick, 22, has been battling drug abuse since his late teens.\n\nMost families would want to keep that part of their lives as hidden from public view as possible. But Reiner admits that, even at the darkest moments of his son’s addiction, he thought of making a movie. Yet it was too painful to put pen to page and begin a script.\n\nInterestingly enough, his son came to the same realization as a means to rehabilitate.\n\nWhile at a rehab center in Los Angeles four years ago, Nick befriended fellow addict Matt Elisofon. The two began writing about their challenges with addiction and the people they met at rehab. Eventually they came up with a script for the movie “Being Charlie” (in theaters Friday), which they asked Rob to direct.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last September to a sold-out crowd.\n\nIt’s a mix of drama and comedy that focuses on an 18-year-old named Charlie (played Nick Robinson of “Jurassic World” fame) as he struggles with addiction to heroin and cocaine. As Charlie jumps in and out of rehab, the aggravation of his actor-turned-politician father (Cary Elwes) grows, and he doesn’t know how to help his son.\n\n“It was a real corrective emotional experience,” Nick Reiner told Business Insider following the TIFF screening about making the movie.\n\nIt took “Being Charlie” four years to get to the screen (in that time Nick has been sober), evolving from a half-hour comedy, then an hour dramedy that was rejected by the TV networks, to finally a feature film.\n\nAccording to Rob Reiner, what the project lacked in its early development was telling both the father's and son's sides.\n\n“It needed what he has been through but also what we had been through,” Rob told Business Insider, referring to himself and his wife, Michele, who was sitting beside him.\n\nNick and Elisofon were by Rob’s side throughout filming. According to Rob, the script was tweaked daily to make the scenes more true to life.\n\n“I relied on him,” Rob said of his son. “He’s the heart and soul of the film.”\n\nOne of the biggest adjustments came while shooting the film’s ending, in which Charlie and his father finally have a heart-to-heart.\n\nRob and Nick couldn’t find the right tone. After constant rewrites, they finally felt they had something a few days before shooting the scene. It’s a gripping moment when both the father and son open up to each other like they never have before.\n\nThe Reiners compare getting the ending right to the whole experience making the film.\n\n\"We were healing as we were going along,\" Nick said. \"And it all doesn’t happen overnight. Certain things we hadn’t dealt with for a while but we were able to through this movie. It didn’t fix everything, but it really tapped into — \"\n\nNick paused to find the words, then his father, sitting across from Nick, finished for him.\n\n\"It forced me to really have to understand what he had been going through for a long time,\" Rob said.",

    "fullText": "Despite traveling fairly frequently, I'd never been away from home for Christmas until recently\n\nIn 2023 (into 2024), I spent Christmas and New Year's Eve on a 22-day Holland America cruise around South America and Antarctica.\n\nI traveled with my grandma and cousin, and our cruise began in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and ended in Santiago, Chile.\n\nI felt hesitant about booking a cruise that took place over the holidays, but I figured it'd be worth missing my traditions for one year to wake up to a view of Antarctica on Christmas morning.\n\nThough Holland America had fantastic decorations, unbeatable views, and fun holiday-themed events, I felt homesick.\n\nIt was so hot in many of the ports that we stopped at, like Buenos Aires and Puerto Madryn, Argentina, because it was summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIt felt extra strange because I was traveling from Chicago, where we always have a chilly Christmas.\n\nDue to the warm weather, it was easy to forget that Christmas was just around the corner — and it felt odd, but delightful, to see decorated cities.\n\nOne of my favorite stops was in Puerto Aysén, Chile, where the town's main square was filled with lights and decorations depicting Santa and reindeer.\n\nOne of the most striking features on board was the ship's gingerbread village. The elaborate setup was just one of the beautiful decorative areas on the ship.\n\nSeveral Christmas trees were also displayed throughout the boat.\n\nIt wasn't just the Holland America crew that decorated — other guests brought tinsel, ornaments, and small decorations to hang from their room's doors and mailboxes. It added to the ship's festive spirit.\n\nThere were plenty of holiday-themed activities to take part in on the ship, too, like decorating gingerbread ornaments and creating origami Christmas trees.\n\nWe used these to decorate our room, and ended up placing the presents we'd brought near a small origami tree. Having our room slightly decorated helped us feel less homesick and more excited for the holidays.\n\nIt was also nice that, after breakfast on Christmas Day, the captain announced that there was an unidentified object flying over our ship.\n\nMinutes later, it was identified as Santa, who would be stopping by to bring presents to the children on board. Santa and some elves then appeared on the ship's main stage, handing out small gifts to kids and hot chocolate to adults.\n\nAs the clock ticked down to midnight on New Year's Eve, there was a bustling party on the Oosterdam's lido deck.\n\nIt featured the house band playing hits from several decades and complimentary flutes of sparkling wine.\n\nThe party took over the pool area, so there was no swimming, but the hot tubs were still in full use as ice-packed coolers for bottles of bubbly.\n\nBeing away from home during the holidays was tough, but getting my first view of Antarctica on Christmas morning was an unforgettable gift.\n\nThat morning, we were greeted with a close-up view of Elephant Island, one of the furthest reaches of Antarctica's South Shetland Islands.\n\nIt was a dream come true being there, but when it comes to the holidays, my heart will always be at home.\n\nThis story was originally published on January 16, 2024, and most recently updated on December 15, 2025.",

    "fullText": "South Korean shipyards are steadily becoming an integral part of US Navy maintenance work. Following in the footsteps of some of the nation's shipbuilding giants, another local shipbuilder just secured a new contract.\n\nHJ Shipbuilding and Construction announced on Monday that it won a deal to service a US Navy vessel — the Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo ship USNS Amelia Earhart — as Washington increasingly turns to South Korea's impressive commercial shipbuilding sector to support strained American yards and keep the fleet afloat.\n\nThe maintenance contract is with the Navy's Naval Supply System Command and Military Sealift Command.\n\nThe work on the Amelia Earhart — which will include an inspection of the ship's hull and systems, follow-up repairs and replacements, and a paint job — will begin in January 2026 at the Yeongdo Shipyard in Busan. The vessel will be delivered to the Navy by the end of March.\n\nThe Amelia Earhart is one of the Navy's supply ships that refuels and resupplies aircraft carriers and warships at sea. Its overhaul adds to a growing list of US Navy work going to South Korean companies.\n\nMajor South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean finished repairs on the USNS Wally Schirra, another Lewis and Clark-class vessel, in March, marking a first for a South Korean shipyard. And then HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, one of the country's largest shipbuilders, received a maintenance contract for another ship in the class, the USNS Alan Shepard.\n\nHJ Shipbuilding and Construction said it's the first midsize shipbuilder in South Korea to win a maintenance contract with the US Navy.\n\nWhile smaller voyage repairs to US Navy ships occur regularly at allied yards, the continued contract wins for South Korean shipyards highlight the growing shipbuilding collaboration between Washington and Seoul.\n\nThat partnership, which has included business deals for South Korean companies abroad as well as investments in American yards, is part of a broader willingness by the Trump administration to rely on its Pacific ally amid efforts to fix US shipbuilding issues.\n\nBillions of dollars are being put into modernizing US shipyards and addressing workforce and training issues as South Korea's government calls its investments a plan to \"Make American Shipbuilding Great Again.\" The US is also turning to Japan, another large shipbuilder, for assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan are the second and third largest shipbuilders in the world, respectively, and Navy leadership is increasingly recognizing their value in this sector. China, however, dominates the shipbuilding industry, relying heavily on its dual-use yards, workforce, and equipment to make military and commercial vessels at a rapid pace.",

    "title": "3 holiday shopping rules I swear by after two decades investing in small businesses",
    "description": "Skip the one-day shipping. A small-business expert shares how shoppers can help small brands grow through slower spending and thoughtful purchases.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with KK Hart, a 40-year-old multi-entrepreneur and business acquisition expert based in Dallas. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor the past 20 years of my career, I've supported small businesses. First as a consultant and then, through an unexpected journey, in business acquisition. As a non-institutional investor — which means I use my own money to invest and am not part of a fund or organization — I've purchased and led 10 small businesses, from brick-and-mortar fitness studios to skincare brands such as Ghost Democracy, my most recent acquisition.\n\nAs someone who has seen the inner workings of many businesses, I can say there's a mismatch between what consumers think small businesses need during this time of year and what they actually want. My passion is helping consumers understand how they can improve a small brand's profit margin and long-term viability during the holiday season and beyond.\n\nHere are three high-impact shopping strategies to try.\n\nShoppers have been trained to value speed and low cost, but small brands generally can't match that. When you look for the free or one-day shipping, you're asking a small business to compete on money — often at a loss, especially when you consider that logistics costs went up this year for small businesses.\n\nInstead, I like to encourage people to think of intentionality as the new convenience and prioritize slower shopping. I like to start planning what I might buy for the holiday season at the beginning of the year, so that I can shop more slowly in Q3 and Q4.\n\nWhen consumers slow down their purchasing and think more carefully about what they're buying, it leads to less friction and fewer returns, which are a massive cost for retailers. If you go slower, you have a week or two to ask the brand questions, like about their formulation or how they stack up to a competitive brand, and ensure you're making the best purchase for you. People are always surprised to find that small businesses actually respond honestly.\n\nIf you've missed a shipping deadline for a small business this year, go for gift cards. Gift cards are 100% cash flow for a small business, minimize returns, and allow your gift recipient to choose what they actually want.\n\nThe heart of this season is about giving and joy. I can tell you that business owners would like to have a lot of joy year-round — not just during the holiday season.\n\nYes, that can mean buying throughout the year and being a repeat customer to the brands you love. The post-holiday rush in January is a cash flow desert for many businesses.\n\nSupport can also look like leaving a review. While there's a lot of emphasis on the dollar amount going to small businesses, feedback can matter just as much. Your purchase in December and your review shortly thereafter could fuel purchases in July and August when things aren't as exciting. That creates more than money in the moment — it gives us a marketing asset all year long.\n\nFinally, think beyond the items you want to own and focus on how you can make an impact. When you consider what you really want from a product and purchase, you think differently than what's the lowest cost and the most convenient.\n\nAnytime I spend money, even as a consumer, I like to think about who I'm investing in. It's impactful to put your money into a small business, where it goes directly into a family's pocket and could impact their business for generations to come. When you invest in a brand in this way, you give them more than just your immediate gratification.\n\nAdditionally, it's also good to purchase items on first-party platforms, or a business's direct website, which places the marketplace commission back into the owner's hands. This is often overlooked, but a truly tangible way to make an impact.\n\nEssentially, you want to go from being a customer to thinking like a capital owner. That was my journey — realizing that the real impact is not in what you buy, but what you can help create with the money you spend.",

    "title": "Netflix's bid to buy Warner Bros. hinges on a key question: Who does it actually compete with?",
    "description": "Netflix and Warner Bros. have a deal, but regulators must approve the move. The question of how to define Netflix's market is a major consideration.",
    "fullText": "Would buying Warner Bros. give Netflix too much power?\n\nThe streaming giant is telling regulators it won't, and antitrust experts say the answer ultimately depends on how you define who Netflix competes with.\n\nDoes Netflix compete with only paid streaming services, a market where it dominates? What about the TV dinosaurs it disrupted, or the social video services nipping at its heels? Could sleep even be a competitor, as its cofounder Reed Hastings famously suggested?\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance has slammed the Netflix-Warner Bros. mega-deal as anticompetitive, arguing that it would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription video streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the Warner Bros. library (stocked with fare like Harry Potter and DC Comics).\n\nNetflix, for its part, is advocating for a definition that considers total US TV viewing time. The streamer, which has expressed confidence in its regulatory case, pointed to this in a letter to its employees on Monday.\n\n\"Even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US — still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%),\" Netflix's co-CEOs wrote on Monday, citing Nielsen data. A Netflix spokesperson referred to those remarks when asked for comment.\n\nConvincing antitrust regulators of that could be an uphill battle.\n\n\"Antitrust regulators are likely to define the relevant market narrowly,\" said Anthony Palomba, a business professor at the University of Virginia. \"The FTC and DOJ have consistently treated streaming as a discrete competitive arena, separate from linear television, theatrical distribution, or social video platforms.\"\n\nThe president has said the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem.\"\n\n\"They have a very big market share, and when they have Warner Brothers, you know, that share goes up a lot,\" he said of Netflix.\n\nReuben Miller, the head of antitrust at financial data service Dealreporter, said Netflix's bid would \"be challenged and litigated unless Netflix can convince Trump to come down on their side.\"\n\nHere's how regulators could determine Netflix's competitive market and, by extension, the future of the media business.\n\nA Netflix-Warner Bros. combination would be a colossus. Netflix and HBO Max have accounted for 39% of US paid subscription streaming revenue in 2025, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAny firm with 30% to 40% market share has historically drawn scrutiny from the US government. If regulators see paid streamers as a distinct market, Netflix's Warner Bros. deal could be in trouble.\n\nConsumers may not view social media apps — even when they are watched on a TV screen — as close substitutes for Netflix, Disney+, or Hulu, Palomba said. If so, a Netflix-HBO Max combination could limit choice or lead to price hikes.\n\nThere are few recent parallels to Netflix's Warner Bros. acquisition, Dealreporter's Miller said. One could be Charter Communications, which was allowed to expand its cable operation in 2016, though streamers were in their early days then. Miller said it felt like the government was protecting the nascent streaming industry. However, consumer behavior has changed so dramatically since then that he's unsure if those market definitions would be applicable.\n\n\"The incentive is to start with the assumption that a merger is illegal,\" Miller added. \"They're going to start with as narrow a definition as possible, so they'll probably start with paid streaming. And then the onus is on Netflix to try and get them to expand that market definition.\"\n\nAlthough Netflix is easily the most viewed paid streamer in the US, it's not the top streamer on TV screens.\n\nThat would be free YouTube, whose viewership share has soared relative to Netflix in recent years. At the end of 2022, Netflix and YouTube each commanded 7.5% of viewership on US TVs. But as of October, YouTube had a 12.9% share while Netflix took second place at 8%, according to Nielsen.\n\nAlong with its paid peers, Netflix is also battling free streamers like The Roku Channel and Fox's Tubi that are popular among Gen Z.\n\nWhen adding free streamers into the marketplace, Netflix and HBO Max together accounted for just over a fifth of US streaming minutes in October, MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote on Monday. While 20% share is powerhouse status, it might not be a dealbreaker from an antitrust perspective.\n\nNetflix has argued that it's competing against all of traditional TV, not just streamers.\n\nIts viewership share ranks sixth among TV media distributors, versus its second-place spot in streaming. When measured against cable and broadcast TV, Netflix's 8% share in October was slightly behind the 8.2% share for Paramount, which includes its cable channels and CBS.\n\nAnd since Netflix isn't trying to buy WBD's cable networks like CNN, it could argue that it's only adding a fraction of the media conglomerate's viewership time.\n\nNetflix would undoubtedly love a broad definition of its competitive market that includes TikTok, Instagram, and even video podcasts and video games, which are also spaces where the streamer competes.\n\nSome media insiders see an ultra-broad competitive landscape as a bridge too far.\n\n\"My clients are not pitching shows to YouTube,\" a TV agent said.\n\nCorey Martin of LA-based law firm Granderson Des Rochers said that \"to compare Netflix to YouTube, or even TikTok, is like comparing apples and oranges.\" He said the same applied to video games.\n\nConsumers tend to think of paid streamers like Netflix or Disney+ when they want to watch movies, TV, or sports, Martin said, but \"they don't necessarily think about YouTube or TikTok.\"\n\n\"Directly, it's hard to say that a video game is competing with a movie, or a video game is competing with the TV, even though they do consume our attention,\" said Rahul Telang, a business professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nHowever, some see truth in the idea of an all-consuming battle for attention.\n\nBernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said Netflix may be a leader in long-form video, but others have better sports offerings. Yoon also wrote in a mid-December note that attention has shifted to short-form video on Instagram and TikTok, and even new micro dramas.\n\n\"Critics may claim these are apples and oranges, but we heard the same argument about linear vs. streaming only a decade ago,\" Yoon wrote.",

    "description": "The Disney musical was a box-office flop. Now, it's considered a treasure that helped launch Christian Bale's career. Here's what the cast is up to.",
    "fullText": "In 1992, Disney's movie musical \"Newsies\" made its debut — and it's since become quite a treasure.\n\nLoosely based on the true story of the 1899 newsboys' strike in New York City, the film features a crew of so-called newsies as they sing their way through oppression and fight for a fairer working system.\n\n\"Newsies\" was a box-office flop when it was first released, reportedly making less than $3 million at the box office, even though it cost over $15 million to make.\n\nBut in the years since, \"Newsies\" has built up a passionate group of \"fansies\" and has been adapted into a majorly successful Broadway musical. It has also helped launch the careers of a few young stars.\n\nHere's what the cast of \"Newsies\" is up to 33 years later:\n\nIn 1992, Christian Bale was 17 years old and had a few acting credits to his name until \"Newsies\" came along.\n\nBale portrayed the film's lead Jack Kelly, one of the ringleaders behind the newsies' strike.\n\nBale gave quite a performance singing, dancing, and acting as a rough, 19th-century Manhattan teen fending for himself and his chosen family.\n\n\"Newsies\" wouldn't be Bale's last Disney movie.\n\nHe'd later star in the early-1990s Disney flop \"Swing Kids,\" voice Thomas in 1995's \"Pocahontas,\" and voice Bagheera in 2019's \"Mowgli.\"\n\nOf course, the actor is perhaps most well known for his roles in \"American Psycho,\" \"Ford v Ferrari,\" and the \"Batman\" franchise — though he has starred in several other major movies since his \"Newsies\" days.\n\nDavid Moscow and Bale had undeniable synergy while starring alongside each other in \"Newsies.\"\n\nMoscow played David Jacobs, \"a mouth with a brain\" and a coleader in the fictionalized strike against Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst.\n\n\"Newsies\" might have been Moscow's first Disney musical, but the young star was no stranger to the big screen, having starred in Tom Hanks' \"Big\" just a few years prior.\n\nDecades after singing and dancing next to the future star of the \"Batman\" series, Moscow continues to leave a mark on Hollywood.\n\nHe appeared in 2003's \"Just Married\" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy and produced over a dozen movies.\n\nMoscow also appeared in 2017's \"This Is Christmas\" and \"One Last Night\" — but he's mostly been focusing on behind-the-scenes work.\n\nStarring as David Jacob's younger brother, Les, in the musical, Luke Edwards was no stranger to acting when he landed the role.\n\nBefore starring in \"Newsies,\" Edwards had several acting credits to his name, including a role in the cult-favorite '80s comedy \"The Wizard.\"\n\nEdwards has guest-starred on shows like \"Without a Trace\" and \"True Detective,\" though you might remember Edwards from \"American Pie 2\" or even \"Jeepers Creepers II.\"\n\nEdwards has also appeared in \"The Super,\" \"Adverse,\" and \"My Friend's Play.\"\n\nOne of the older \"Newsies\" in the bunch, Max Casella was 24 years old when he officially made his musical debut as Racetrack Higgins.\n\nAside from having a few TV roles in the 1980s and early 1990s, Casella had not appeared in a major theatrical production prior to this one.\n\nHe was, however, most well known as the time for his role as Vinnie Delpino on \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\"\n\nSince \"Newsies,\" Casella has gone on to make an impressive resume for himself.\n\nHe's lent his voice to characters in \"The Little Mermaid 2,\" \"Dinosaur,\" and \"Courage the Cowardly Dog.\" He has appeared in over two dozen \"Sopranos\" episodes, acted in \"Leatherheads,\" and joined \"Boardwalk Empire\" in 2010.\n\nI recent years, you might have spotted Casella in \"Jackie\" alongside Natalie Portman, or on episodes of \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and \"Tulsa King.\"\n\nAlthough he was only 15 years old when he starred as the spunky Brooklyn newsie Spot Conlon, Gabriel Damon was already quite a seasoned actor with over 30 credits to his name.\n\nNotably, he was the voice of Littlefoot in the fan-favorite animated film, \"The Land Before Time.\"\n\nAside from a few appearances on \"Baywatch\" and a few one-off roles on shows like \"ER\" and \"Sirens,\" Damon has shied away from the acting industry.\n\nHis last noted role was in a short in 2006.\n\n\"Newsies\" was Marty Belafsky's first-ever movie role.\n\nIn the musical, he appeared as the goofy but lovable Crutchy.  He was only 16 years old when \"Newsies\" was released.\n\nWhen he appeared as Boots in the 1992 musical drama, Arvie Lowe Jr. was a 12-year-old actor with no other roles to his name.\n\nAfter \"Newsies\" wrapped, Lowe Jr. found himself starring on popular 1990s shows like \"Sister, Sister,\" \"Moesha,\" and \"Smart Guy.\"\n\nHe even starred on the early aughts Disney Channel show \"Lizzie McGuire\" alongside Hilary Duff.\n\nSince then, he's had a few minor roles in Hollywood, and he's appeared in a few video shorts and commercials. Lowe Jr. is also a graphic designer.\n\nEle Keats had a few acting credits under her belt in Hollywood before landing the role of Sarah Jacobs in \"Newsies.\"\n\nShe played Jack Kelly's love interest, which led to backlash from fans who were unhappy about her kiss with Bale. Some have even referred to her character as the \"Destroyer of Dreams.\"\n\nSince starring in \"Newsies,\" Keats has had a number of small roles and has even guest-starred on shows like \"CSI,\" \"CSI: NY,\" and \"Cold Case.\"\n\nIn the last few years, she's made a name for herself in the horror-film industry, starring in \"Insidious: Chapter 3\" and \"Ouija: Origin of Evil.\"\n\nShe also owns Ele Keats Jewelry, which has a showroom in Santa Monica.\n\nActor Bill Pullman played one of the few redeeming adult characters \"Newsies\" had to offer.\n\nPreviously known for his work in \"Spaceballs,\" among other films, Pullman starred in the Disney musical as passionate journalist Bryan Denton.\n\nRobert Duvall was quite the villain in the musical, where he appeared as publishing mogul Joseph Pulitzer.\n\nPrior to \"Newsies,\" he acted in dozens of works — including \"The Godfather\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\"\n\nAfter \"Newsies,\" Duvall appeared in projects like \"The Apostle,\" \"Deep Impact,\" \"Gone in 60 Seconds,\" and \"Kicking and Screaming.\"\n\nHe continues to make a name for himself in Hollywood, and recently appeared in \"Widows,\" \"Hustle,\" and \"The Pale Blue Eye.\"\n\nCorrection: December 15, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Luke Edwards' first major role. It was in \"The Wizard,\" not \"Newsies.\"\n\nThis story was originally published in August 2018 and most recently updated on December 15, 2025.",

    "title": "Judge expresses skepticism toward Epstein victim lawsuit against big banks alleging they facilitated sex-trafficking",
    "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein victims'  lawsuits resembled two others, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for hundreds of millions.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge expressed skepticism about a pair of lawsuits that victims of Jeffrey Epstein had filed against two banks, suggesting he may dismiss them before they have a chance to go to trial.\n\nAt the outset of a Monday afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, US District Judge Jed Rakoff unfavorably compared the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon to two similar lawsuits he had previously overseen, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan agreed to settle the case for $290 million. Deutsche Bank agreed to settle for $75 million.\n\nRakoff said the language in the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon — which were brought by the same attorneys and filed in October — was \"frequently conclusory\" and appeared to lack sufficient detail to demonstrate what the banks did wrong. He called the lawsuits \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric.\"\n\n\"'Knows' without saying by whom is vague. 'Affiliated' without saying what that means is vague,\" Rakoff told David Boies, an attorney who brought the case. \"A lot of that language is in the complaint.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Epstein victims — David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards, and Brittany Henderson — two weeks to revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.\n\nThe judge said they would be permitted to use material they had already gathered as part of the discovery process in the case, but should put a hold on additional depositions and subpoenas until he issued a ruling, which he said could come at the end of January.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Bank of America and BNY Mellon aided in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by providing him with banking services and then ignoring red flags tied to his transactions.\n\nEpstein, a well-connected financier, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on criminal sex-trafficking charges. One of his associates, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to him.\n\nMonday's hearing was scheduled for the judge to weigh motions to dismiss the two lawsuits outright.\n\nCharlotte Taylor, an attorney at the law firm Jones Day representing Bank of America, argued the lawsuits consisted of \"recycled boilerplate allegations\" and that they could not prove the bank provided anything other than \"routine banking services\" to Epstein and his associates. Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney at WilmerHale, said the plaintiffs couldn't prove anyone at BNY Mellon had the \"state of mind\" to be found liable.\n\nBoies told Rakoff that the banks should have noticed enough smoke around the transactions from bank accounts belonging to Epstein and his associates to know there was a fire. Aside from Epstein's 2008 criminal conviction in Florida, he had been dogged by civil litigation for years, Boies said.\n\nRakoff expressed skepticism that the pattern of facts alleged in the lawsuit would be enough.\n\n\"Last I checked, that's not enough to survive a motion to dismiss,\" Rakoff said. \"You need to have enough allegations as to specific facts.\"\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawyers for the Epstein victims appeared eager to revise their lawsuits and include the information they obtained through the discovery process. Rakoff said that material may be redacted on the public docket.\n\n\"I think he's giving us a chance,\" Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, told Business Insider.",

It's also unclear how long Uber had the recap in the works, or if it was influenced by the skit. Uber and NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe feature echoes the sketch that aired on Saturday night, which lays bare how quickly people who willingly participate in data tracking recoil when that data reflects something they don't want to know.\n\nThe skit started with an innocuous character who was delighted to find that she was one of Sabrina Carpenter's top global listeners in 2025. Then the skit took an ominous turn when an advertisement claimed to reveal who the characters \"really are\" this year, featuring an \"Uber Eats wrapped.\"\n\nOne character learned he had eaten more chicken nuggets than 99% of users worldwide. Another was assigned an \"Uber Eats age\" — a riff on Spotify's \"listening age\" — only to be told his was \"Dead.\" The humiliation peaked when a character realized he had spent $24,000 on Uber Eats in a year, prompting him to scream into a pillow in response.\n\nTo access the actual feature, which is only available in the US at the moment, look for the \"YOUBER\" banner in your app, and it will show riders where they went, how often they opted for Uber Comfort, and which restaurants they returned to again and again.\n\nThe feature also assigns users one of 14 \"Uber Personality Profiles,\" including \"Do-Gooder\" for Uber Electric loyalists, \"Rise & Shiner\" for early-morning riders, and \"Delivery Darling\" for customers who \"live for deliveries of all kinds.\"\n\nAnd if you don't want to endure your guilt alone, you can always share it.

    "title": "If Some Photos Are Inexplicably Turning Red on Your iPhone, There's a Fix",
    "description": "There is a workaround for this bizarre bug.",
    "fullText": "If you open a picture in the Photos app on your iPhone, and it inexplicably starts turning red, I wouldn't blame you for being a bit concerned. After all, that's not supposed to happen, and out of all the colors your photos could randomly fade into, red is among the creepiest.\n\nWhile you contemplate what angry and vengeful god you might have crossed recently, understand that this isn't necessarily a problem affecting all, or even most, iPhone users and their photos. In fact, it doesn't appear to be affecting photos taken on iPhones at all. Rather, the users reporting this issue see it when zooming in on photos taken on Android devices. It seems a new hue has been added to the iPhone/Android divide: green bubbles, red pictures.\n\nIf this isn't happening on your own iPhone, you can see the issue play out in this Reddit post. User djenki0119 posted a screen recording of themself browsing photos on their iPhone that they had originally taken on a Samsung Galaxy S24. At first, the pictures appears totally normal. But once djenki0119 zooms in on each, it quickly turns a deep shade of red—almost as if you were looking at film developing in a dark room. This user has the same issue, only they took their photo on a Motorola Razr.\n\nAt this time, it's unclear what is actually causing the issue to occur. It usually doesn't matter what type of device took any particular image: Once it's in the Photos app, it should display normally. But there must be something about Android files that the iOS Photos app isn't reading correctly, at least when users zoom in on the image. As 9to5Mac highlights, it appears that something is adding a red filter to these images in the Photos app. Since this issue is only popping up recently, my guess is there's a bug within iOS 26, though there could be an issue with Android instead.\n\nFor what it's worth, I wasn't able to replicate the problem with photos I sent from my Pixel 8 Pro over to my iPhone. But perhaps there is some strange combination of hardware and software that results in this tinting: Maybe a photo taken on a certain type of Android device running a specific version of Android turns red on a certain iPhone model running a specific version of iOS.\n\nLuckily, you don't have to wait for Apple, Google, Samsung, or Motorola to issue a fix, depending on where the actual issue is coming from. To return your image to its proper color scheme, open it in the Photos app, tap \"Edit,\" then choose \"Revert.\" This restores the image to its original state, and removes the red filter that was unnecessarily overlayed on top of it.",

    "title": "The Kindle App Now Has Built-In AI, Because of Course It Does",
    "description": "The feature is always on, whether or not you want it to be.",
    "fullText": "It's 2025, so every piece of technology now needs to have an AI component. It doesn't matter if these AI features are useful (though some are), they just need to be there, however ham-fisted or useless they may seem—though the line between those extremes often comes down to user preference. To that end, if you've ever been reading a book on the Kindle app and wished that you could ask your device a question about the text, Amazon has an AI bot for you.\n\nLast week, Amazon announced \"Ask this Book,\" a new AI feature for the Kindle app. Now available on the iOS version of the app, it lets you ask Amazon's AI questions about whatever it is you're reading, whether you bought or borrowed the title. You can highlight a selection from the text to include in you're queries, and ask questions relating the story's plot, characters, relationships, and theme. According to Amazon, all answers will be contextual, presumably meaning they'll all be related to the text at hand, and importantly, all answers will be spoiler-free. That should help avoid the classic mistake of googling a question you have about a book you're reading and spoiling a coming plot twist or character death.\n\nAmazon says Ask this Book is currently active for \"thousands\" of books written in English. As noted, as of this writing the feature is only live in the iOS version of the app, but Amazon is working on bringing it to the Android app, as well as Kindle devices, next year.\n\nIf this sounds like the type of feature you'd be interested in, great! If you don't care for this feature, either as a reader who doesn't want AI getting in the way of their books, a publisher who doesn't want Amazon training its AI on their IP, or a teacher who might see this as a potential cheating opportunity, there's bad news: Once Amazon makes Ask this Book available for any given title, it's permanently available, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. That comes directly from an Amazon spokesperson, who told Publishers Lunch, “[t]o ensure a consistent reading experience, the feature is always on, and there is no option for authors or publishers to opt titles out.”\n\nThat response bothers me for two reasons. One, it's always frustrating when a company introduces a new feature lwithout giving users the option to turn it off. I don't use Apple Intelligence, but I appreciate that Apple lets me turn it off. Meta, on the other hand, forces me to contend with Meta AI, even though I never use it. Amazon seems to be attending the Meta school of user design.\n\nBut what's more, it seems wild to me that authors and publishers don't get a say as to whether this AI bot gets to be active on their books—especially retroactively. It'd even be one thing if authors had to opt-in in order to put their books on the Kindle platform going forward. But to enable it on \"thousands\" of titles made available before Ask this Book was ever a thing is, to me, disrespectful to authors and publishers, to say the least.\n\nInterestingly, Amazon dodged questions from Publishers Lunch concerning licensing rights around Ask this Book, as well as protections for users, which is troubling given generative AI has a habit of hallucinating—or, in other words, making things up completely. Sure, when it's working as intended, the AI can help readers understand things they're confused about, but there's a real chance that the AI will misinterpret questions, misrepresent the text, or straight up lie, which could negatively impact a reader's experience of the work, with potential fallout for both the author and the publisher.\n\nWhile you won't see this feature yet on your Kindle, you will encounter it in the Kindle app. You can either access it from the menu in any book where the feature is available, or by highlighting text in said book. Once you do, Ask this Book will present a list of questions it thinks you might be interested in asking. If none of them do it for you, you can formulate your own questions, and ask followups after the bot answers.",

    "title": "All the Best Ways to Upgrade and Organize Your Garage",
    "description": "If the only thing in your garage is a car, you’re wasting a great opportunity.",
    "fullText": "Outfitting that garage with the right gear is the difference between a useful and organized space and a chaotic black hole of junk. If you want your garage to be a place where you can get work done, where you can actually find stuff, and maybe also where you can park your car, here’s what you should have, ranging from the must-have essentials to some luxuries you could stretch for.\n\nIf you want to get the most of any garage, here’s the short list of essentials:\n\nOverhead storage. An empty garage might seem like endless storage, but it fills up fast. If you don’t want to navigate a maze of junk every time you go in there, some overhead storage shelving is a must.\n\nWall storage. For more readily accessible storage, some bike hooks and wall hooks for yard tools (like rakes and shovels) will keep those things easy to grab but off the floor.\n\nAbsorbent mats. Your car will leak oil and other fluids, and the garage is where you do a lot of messy jobs. A large-format absorbent mat will save you a lot of cleanup.\n\nFire safety. Every space in your home should have a fire extinguisher within easy reach, and your garage is no exception. You might also consider keeping some fire blankets, which are often more effective for small, contained fires.\n\nSports caddy. If you’ve got a collection of balls for every possible sport, plus other implements, having a place to dump them all so they don’t roll around is a must.\n\nTool storage. Whether you go with a classic tool box or a set of magnetic strips on the walls, don’t let your expensive, delicate tools get dirty, damp, and lost.\n\nWorkbench. Even if you’re not a hobbyist or much of a DIYer, having a workbench in the garage is a good idea. If space is an issue, a wall-mounted folding one like this is an ideal solution.\n\nCreeper seat. Similarly, you don’t have to be a total gearhead to appreciate a creeper seat. Working in the garage often means working down low to the floor, so unless you enjoy sitting on he cold, greasy floor for a few hours, a creeper seat is a necessity.\n\nYou can always find an upgrade for any space, and your garage is no exception. Some useful-but-not-essential upgrades include:\n\nRubber door bottom. Your garage door probably isn’t a very good seal. When the weather’s hot or cold, that can make the space uncomfortable. A simple adhesive rubber door bottom provides a nice seal to make the space a little nicer to be in.\n\nClimate control. You don’t necessarily have to install central air or a mini-split in your garage. There are plenty of portable heating and cooling solutions that will keep you comfy while you work without breaking the bank.\n\nTire rack: If you have a growing collection of spare tires, or you’re rotating between all-weather and winter tires regularly, having a stable storage shelf for them is a lot better than stacking them up or having them rolling around.\n\nStopper mats: It’s a universal frustration: trying not to ram into the wall or crush a bunch of stuff every time you pull your car into the garage. If you don’t want a tennis ball hanging from a string, some simple mats like these will let you know when to hit the brakes.\n\nTile flooring: Even if you have a nice floor in your garage—maybe especially if you have a nice floor in there—a protective tile floor is a good idea. It’ll keep everything pristine and protected from damage (from dropped tools, for example).\n\nWant your garage to be even nicer? No problem—here are some very useful add-ons that fall into the “luxury” category for most garages:\n\nSpeakers. These days, you don’t need a whole entertainment system in your garage—your phone and a Bluetooth speaker will do. But the speaker needs to be waterproof and designed for work spaces if you want it to survive.\n\nFridge. If you’re still nipping into the kitchen for a fresh beverage while you’re working in the garage, it’s time to upgrade to a garage-specific fridge.\n\nRetractable extension cords. Necessary? Not really, but very useful: A retractable extension cord keeps wires out of the way when you’re not using them and prevents them from knotting up in maddening ways. Extra bonus: Have an outlet installed in the ceiling of the garage and mount the extension cord up there, too, so you just pull it down when you need it.\n\nUtility sink. Having a place to wash up and clean dirty tools in the garage is a godsend. If the garage isn’t plumbed and you don’t want to sink that kind of cash into it, an outdoor sink hooked up to a garden hose will do the trick.\n\nHoist. Suckers get on ladders and lift with their muscles. Smart folks install an overhead hoist that can lift cargo boxes or other heavy things out of the way with ease.\n\nGarage door screen. It’s nice to open the garage door while you’re working in the warm weather—unless it invites every bug in the universe to assault you. A nice garage door screen lets you enjoy the breeze without the bugs.\n\nLaser guides. If a rubber mat or a tennis ball on a string isn’t high-tech enough for your parking needs, why not install a laser-guided system? You’ll never scrape a door or crush a garbage can again.\n\nPaper towel dispenser. Necessary? Maybe not, but being able to grab a paper towel hands-free as needed just makes garage life easier.\n\nWall-mounted inflator. If you’ve got cars and bikes in your garage, installing a wall-mounted inflator will make keeping tires properly inflated and maintained a breeze.\n\nSeating area. And if you’ve got a large garage—or no car—why not create a comfortable place to sit and relax in-between projects? Some durable outdoor furniture and an outdoor rug are all you need.",

    "title": "What's Good (and What's Overhyped) About the Viral 2-2-2 Workout",
    "description": "The principles are sound, but is it really anything special?",
    "fullText": "If I’ve learned anything about online fitness content in the years I've spent consuming and creating it, it’s this: Stack a bunch of numbers together, and you have a potentially viral workout, from 12-3-30 to 4-2-1.\n\nThe latest is the 2-2-2 workout, which is supposed to reveal the big secret of effectively building muscle after you hit age 40. Unfortunately, after trying it out, I’m not so sure about that.\n\nI’ve been seeing the 2-2-2 workout pop up across the Internet, but all the sources point back to a video from Alain Gonzalez that claims the “2-workout-2-set” method is “getting men over 40 jacked FAST.”\n\nThat’s pretty much the whole pitch: The number 2 comes up twice (I felt like I was going mad trying to find out what the last 2 is for), and it’s aimed at middle-aged men. I’m not a man, but as a middle-aged woman with personal training and weightlifting coaching certifications, I’m in a pretty good positions to evaluate those claims. So let’s take a look at what’s actually in the workouts.\n\nI looked at the PDF Gonzalez offers that describes the program, and in it he does actually say what the many articles about his method did not: what the third “2” stands for. So, the 2-2-2 method is:\n\nTwo full-body workouts per week\n\nTwo reps in reserve on each set\n\nIt’s a fine setup, I think, and probably a lot of people of any gender or age would get stronger using a workout like this. But it also relies on two often misunderstood concepts.\n\nA working set is a set of an exercise that you think of as your “real” work for the day. This means that it does not include warmup sets, or anything else you do to prepare for those working sets.\n\nThis means you might end up doing more than two sets, depending on the exercise. For example, I may not need any warmup sets to do my cable lateral raises (one of the exercises Gonzalez recommends), so that’s just two actual sets. But if I’m supposed to do two hard sets of leg press, I’m not going to leg press a couple hundred pounds cold. I’d start with sets of lighter weights and work my way up—so maybe that will be five sets total for the day, but only the working sets count for the 2-2-2 program.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the PDF calls for seven exercises each day. That’s a minimum of 14 sets you’ll do per workout, with most exercises likely requiring at least one or two warmup sets, and some even more. You’ll also rest two to five minutes between sets. Emphasizing “just two sets” makes the workout sound quick and simple, but in practice, it looks like you’ll probably be in the gym a good while.\n\nReps in reserve, or RIR, is a great way to explain to experienced lifters how hard they’ll be working in a given set. If you’ve never used RIR before, though, there is a definite learning curve. The idea is that you stop an exercise with two reps “in reserve”—that is, reps that you could have done but didn’t. If you’ve done 10 lat pulldowns and you feel like the eleventh would be really hard and the twelfth would be the last one you could possibly do in this set, then you stop at 10. You’ve left those last two reps “in reserve.”\n\nThis is a common, useful way of talking about exercise intensity—see this explainer from the National Academy of Sports Medicine. But you have to have enough experience with that exercise, and with exercising in general, to recognize the signs your body gives you that you have exactly two reps left. Often, beginners will stop too early, and never get the benefits of going closer to failure before stopping.\n\nIf you’re used to using RIR (or RPE, which is a similar concept), this is a fine way of planning your workouts. If you tend to overestimate your abilities, you’ll probably hit RIR 0 (that is, failure) often enough to teach yourself what those last few reps feel like. But if you’re a person who tends to shy away from those harder reps, or if you’ve never really gone all the way to failure on an exercise, RIR is probably not a good tool for you.\n\nAs a lifter and a trainer, I like the idea of 2-2-2...for a specific kind of person. And yes, probably a lot of the “men over 40” in the target audience qualify as that person.\n\nSpecifically, this is a good workout for people who are already experienced in the gym, but can’t reliably make time for more than two workouts per week. You can get a lot done in two workouts, if each workout covers all your major muscle groups, which it does in this plan.\n\nThe routine does have a plan for progression, which is nice—a lot of trendy workout routines do not. You’ll be doing “double progression,” which means you increase reps of an exercise until you feel ready to increase the weight. At that point you’ll be doing fewer reps, so you start adding reps again. That’s a solid approach that doesn’t take much thinking ahead. (It’s also a missed opportunity to add another “2” to the name.)\n\nMy biggest gripe about this workout is just that there’s nothing special about it. It’s basic to the point of being almost common sense: Hey you, do two full-body workouts a week! Make sure each exercise has a few hard sets! Really, no need to overthink it.\n\nThere’s actually nothing special here for “men over 40,” except perhaps that men over 40 are more likely to have kids and other responsibilities taking up their time, and thus will find a twice-a-week schedule convenient. I also find the workout selection biased toward people who stick to machines. On the bright side, you could probably do this whole thing at a Planet Fitness, and that's going to be convenient for a lot of folks. But I find machines boring. (Maybe that's a \"me\" problem.)\n\nIn terms of Gonzalez’s actual workout materials, there are a few things that bug me. One is that he talks about the two-workouts-per-week schedule as if it were strongly supported by science as the best option. In reality, two workouts are fine, but people tend to do better with more. No champion bodybuilder or weightlifter hits every muscle twice a week and chills on the couch the rest of the time. Even most recreational athletes with some kind of goal will do better with three or four workouts. Two is enough for most people’s goals, but it’s not necessarily better.\n\nPromising more results for less work is a staple of the fitness industry, so I’m able to see through it—and of course everybody says their signature workout is the best option. But if you going in thinking the 2-2-2 really is the secret to getting jacked over 40, I beg you to consider that there is never one correct answer to fitness. You can pick any schedule that works each major muscle twice per week, and it will accomplish the same trick.",

    "description": "I am now a morning person.",
    "fullText": "I am not a morning person, and I never have been—well, unless I have to make money. For years, my start time at my old job was 5 a.m. and, against all odds, I made it in every day. Now, I teach a 6 a.m. spin class twice a week after being moved off the more-tolerable late morning shift. Until a few months ago, though, I was sleeping through every alarm on all the other days, even though I knew I should be getting up and going to the gym early as a solid way to start my day. It took me a long time, but I have managed to force myself into being the kind of person who is up before the sun and done with my daily exercise routine before my friends are even out of bed. Here's exactly what I did.\n\nSince starting to teach the 6 a.m. spin classes, I've noticed two undeniable things: I can drag myself out of bed for the promise of money with no problem and my day is measurably better when I start it with a workout. I am just more alert, productive, and all-around pleasant when the morning begins with exercise than I am when it begins with sleeping in. It was obvious I needed to start every day that way, whether or not I was getting paid to do it, but tricking myself into exercising \"for free\" was my first challenge.\n\nThe solution was one you might not like: I had to tie a financial stake to what I wanted to do. Instead of getting money, like I do when I teach, I had to pay money so I would be motivated not to let my investment go to waste. This was a problem because one of the perks of my part-time teaching gig is a free membership at a luxury gym here in New York City. Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but having free and unlimited access to a fancy gym didn't exactly motivate me; it would be there whenever I wanted to go and if I didn't happen to want to go at all, it wasn't like I was losing money on it. So, I started signing up for introductory offers at every studio in my area. Usually, these lasted one to two weeks and cost less than a regular membership at the studio in question would if I weren't on a trial offer. I had paid, but hadn't paid a relative bunch, and that was good enough to start. Up I got each morning, slowly but surely building a habit. The intro offers expired, though, and I'd find myself scrambling to find a new place to go, which upended my routine and wasn't conducive to consistency.\n\nNext, I downloaded ClassPass and set up an autopay for every month, but since my unused credits roll over to the next month, that wasn't as motivating. I took note of how much more consistent I am in a use-it-or-lose it scenario, kept ClassPass because it still comes in handy, but looked for more options. Ultimately, through ClassPass, I found a studio in my area that offers a Pilates-inspired strength training class. I became obsessed with it—but an unlimited monthly membership was a few hundred dollars. I put off getting that because it seemed exorbitant, but in the end, I realized that might be the only way to get myself to stick to the routine that was slowly forming. Eventually, I pulled the trigger. I traded away a small fortune for access to a studio full of something known as \"megaformers.\" I have been in that studio every single weekday morning at 6:30 (except on teaching days, when I run over at 7:30) for a month now. Sometimes, I go at 5:30 just because I can. Who the hell is she? I am not only prepared, but excited, to buy it again going into this next month.\n\nDo you need to spend hundreds on this? Absolutely not. But for me, tying financial stakes to my mission was crucial and, also just from my perspective, they had to be intense. A low-cost, big-box gym membership has never motivated me. What's $25 slipping out of my checking account every month along with all the other subscriptions I've forgotten about? When I've paid a little more to go to gyms that offer free classes, even signing up for morning ones didn't always do it, since there was no fee associated with skipping them. (As a teacher now, I realize exactly how nasty that mindset is, but I'm just being honest.) My subconscious is stubborn, it deeply desires staying in bed, and I had to take an extreme measure to beat it.\n\nFor you, a lower-cost gym membership might work just fine, but I'll caution that what has to go along with the financial investment is a time-based commitment. It's not that I struggle to work out in general; I do it every day, but I wanted to start doing it in the morning, not cramming it in at night or whenever I thought of it throughout the day. That's why paid classes have been so crucial: They're strictly scheduled. I can't just go whenever I want, nor can I decide I don't feel like going when the time rolls around. The combination of paying a noticeable amount and having to be there at a set time is elemental to what I'm doing.\n\nThat leads me to the next big thing I did. Buying classes, packages, a gym or app membership, or whatever else, isn't enough on its own if you don't make space in your life for using them. I had to take a hard look at my schedule. I fell back on a lot of scheduling tips I've written about here, like time blocking and time boxing, plus I started using prioritization techniques to figure out what could be rearranged. The MIT—or most important thing—method was helpful because it allowed me to calculate the impact my daily to-dos have on my larger goals, leaving space for me to acknowledge the positive impact morning workouts have on other parts of my day. With other kinds of prioritization approaches, working out didn't rank as high because it is something a little more optional than the work I have to do to keep a roof over my head, you know? But my goal here was to make more space for it and create a lifestyle that specifically positioned it as a morning activity, so the MIT method helped me center it.\n\nLike the financial investment, this meant something undesirable: I initially tried to get more serious about going to bed early. That is not aligned with who I am in the deepest parts of my soul, and it never has been. To be completely transparent, more often than not, I simply didn't do it. Asleep at 1 a.m. and awake at 5, I have just been tired a lot. I give myself grace with things like this because if I'm too hard on myself about it, I'll demoralize myself and that won't help me with my overall goal. Eventually, if being tired starts to annoy me too much, I'll course-correct and be asleep at 10 p.m. like a smarter person. As it is now, I've been making space in my schedule for some naps (which isn't something I've ever done much of before). Breaks are an important part of overall productivity, as is leaving yourself space to be who you are without trying to make too many drastic changes at once, so the temporary nap-allowance system is just fine. I'm also trying to avoid strenuous activity at night. I can't force myself to go to sleep early, but I can at least stop starting new projects at 11 p.m., which will just make me sleepier the next day than if I am relaxed pre-bedtime.\n\nI've noticed myself making small, subconscious changes even though I haven't become an early-bedtime gal yet. I'm calling it a night a lot sooner than I normally would when I'm out with friends, even though I'm not necessarily going home to sleep so much as I'm just going home not to be out. I also was struck by the inspiration to paint a piece of furniture last night at 11 p.m.. Normally, adherent to the 10-minute and one-more rules that I am, I would have jumped up and done this the moment I thought of it. Last night, I didn't do it, knowing I shouldn't get too involved in something tricky when I needed to be winding down ahead of this morning's Pilates class. These are baby steps, yes, but they're a lot more helpful to developing long-term, sustainable habits than complete personality overhauls are. Those rarely last, but little, incremental changes add up to longer-term success.\n\nThis part is fun, so there's the reprieve. For me, any meaningful life change has to come with little rewards, and I'm not talking about the mental health benefits of exercise, looking better, or feeling more productive after a workout. I'm talking about little treats. First of all, commitment to my new schedule opened up the opportunity to crush my goals with the various apps I use to track my workouts. I am serious about using my Peloton app to track all my workouts, even the ones I don't take through the app or using my Bike, largely because I think it gives me a better data breakdown than when I use the native workout-tracking function on my Apple Watch, but also because it contributes to my daily streak (as of today: 274 days). Getting a workout inputted into the app first thing in the morning secures my streak, which is literally just a number on a screen, but it motivates me.\n\nI have also started using something similar to a SMART goal to track and reward progress. SMART goals are ones that are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound. So, I tell myself things like, \"If I go to class at 5:30 tomorrow morning, I will stop at Dunkin' for a donut on the way home,\" or, \"If I work out every morning this week, I will get myself one new activewear outfit on Sunday.\"\n\nWearing silly little matchy outfits is also integral to my personal process, as it puts me in a good mood before I even leave the house and makes me feel more put-together and capable at the gym, but that might not be true for you. In fact, none of these things specifically need to be for you, but they can be a guideline. The general through line here is that I took the time to consider what I wanted (to wake up early and work out); and what I know about myself (I'm motivated by money, my schedule wasn't conducive to this activity, and I need constant mini-rewards to keep going); then combine those facts into a new, incremental strategy that worked for me. No matter what you want or what motivates you, you can do the same by relying on a few productivity tricks and your own self-awareness.",

    "title": "These Two New iPhone Features Are Coming to iOS 26.3",
    "description": "Apple is already working on the sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "Just three days after Apple released iOS 26.2 to iPhones everywhere, the company is back at it with a new update. iOS 26.3 is official, though only for beta testers. Those brave enough to install Apple's unfinished software on their devices won't find an update packed to the brim with new features and changes, but they will stumble upon two key new features. The thing is, we already knew both of them were on the way.\n\nThis isn't the end all be all for the update, however: Since iOS 26.3 is so new, it's possible testers will discover additional features hidden within the update. In addition, Apple may add new changes in subsequent beta versions. I'll continue to update this article to reflect any new features that reveal themselves, but, until then, here are the two new features we know about.\n\nBack in September, we learned that Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the EU, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAfter three months, we are now getting our first official look at this feature. In this first iOS 26.3 beta, there is now a \"Notification Forwarding\" option in Notification settings. While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nKnowledge of iOS 26.3's second feature is not quite so old. In fact, we only learned about it last week. As it happens, Apple is working directly with Google on an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless.\n\nAs of last week, Google had already rolled out its first test of the feature to Android Canary, but it was nowhere to be found in Apple's betas. Now, we know what to expect: In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Here, iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device, where you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nThis isn't the flashiest beta Apple has ever shipped, but it is possible to install right now. Both the developer and public betas are now available, which means anyone interested can enroll their device in Apple's beta program to give 26.3 a try.\n\nHowever, know the risks before you do. Unfinished software could come with bugs and glitches that could impact your experience using your iPhone. If the software is particularly glitchy, you could lose data when downgrading back to iOS 26.2. If you do decide to install the beta, make a complete backup of your iPhone to a Mac or PC before you do.",

    "title": "I Tested Google’s New Live Translation With AirPods, and It Actually Works Well",
    "description": "You don't need Pixel Buds to translate a live conversation anymore.",
    "fullText": "I can be pretty tough on AI, especially when it's used to make misinformation slop. But as cynical as I may seem, I do acknowledge that there are plenty of useful and beneficial features that AI powers. Take live translation, for instance: Not long ago, the concept of a device that could translate someone else's words directly in your ear as they spoke would seem like some far future technology. But not only is it not a futuristic technology, both Google and Apple have their own takes on the feature that users can take advantage of.\n\nThat said, not all iPhone and Android users alike have been able to use live translate. Both companies have limited the feature to work with their respective earbuds: For Apple, that's the AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3; for Google, that's the Pixel Buds. Without your platform's flagship earbuds, you haven't been able to use live translation, and instead need to stick with the rest of your translation app's experience, whether that be Apple Translate or Google Translate. Lucky for Android users, that's no longer the case for the latter.\n\nOn Friday, Google announced new Gemini translation capabilities for its proprietary translation app. The company says these new updates introduce \"state-of-the-art text translation quality,\" with more nuanced, natural, and accurate translations. Importantly, however, as part of those upgrades, the company is launching a beta where all Google Translate users can access live translation through any headphones—not just Pixel Buds. This initial rollout is only available on the Android version of Google Translate in the U.S., Mexico, and India, though Google says the company will bring the feature to iOS and more regions in the next year.\n\nThis is kind of huge: Companies typically like to keep features like this locked behind their own platform as a marketing tactic. You're more likely to buy Pixel Buds over other earbuds or headphones if you really want to try live translation. However, you don't even need to buy a new pair of headphones to use this feature at all: As long as you have some type of headphones or earbuds connected to your Android device, you can translate conversations on the fly.\n\nI gave this a shot on my Pixel 8 Pro with my AirPods Max, by playing a video of people speaking Portuguese. Set up wasn't the simplest: First, it took forever for the Pixel to recognize my AirPods, despite the headphones being in pairing mode for some time, but that's beside the point. The key issue was getting Google Translate to present the new beta for live translation. When I first opened it, it was using the older live translate feature, which didn't work with my AirPods. I had the latest version running, so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. When it launched, I didn't have live translate at all. Finally, after force quitting and reopening the app, I got a pop-up for the new live translation beta experience.\n\nThe next part was user error: I had my language set to the target language (Portuguese), and vice versa. As such, Google assumed I would be the one speaking Portuguese, and didn't vocalize the English translation. Once I flipped the languages, and confirmed that English would be spoken through my headphones, the feature started working—and well, for that matter. The video I choose was taken from a news broadcast, with two anchors, and various speakers during news segments. Once the video started, I could see Google Translation translating the words on my screen, and, after about four seconds, I heard the audio translated in my hear. Google Translate even tries to match the speaker's voice, and though it certainly isn't a deepfake, it does well enough to distinguish different speakers from one another. It even tried to take on more a serious tone to match the anchor's, versus the more casual tone of one of the people interviewed in a news segment.\n\nI tried a couple of other videos in different languages, but this time, using the \"Detect language\" feature rather than a preset target language. The app was able to recognize this video was spoken in Thai, and this one was spoken in Urdu, and translated both accordingly. And while I can't verify the quality of the translation (I am sadly not fluent in any other language), the experience was overall easy enough to follow. The speed of speech can get a bit slow at times, perhaps because the AI has a lot to process at once, but as long as you turn up the volume on your headphones, it's easy enough to follow.\n\nAll that to say, I'm very interested to give this a try in a real world scenario. Even though my daily driver is an iPhone, I might need to start carrying around my Pixel 8 Pro just in case.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nBernd Leno (Fulham): Excellent for Fulham in their 3-2 win at Burnley. I know the result looks like a close game and Fulham will say they deserved to win, but Bernd Leno made five or six good saves at the start of the game that kept them in it. Burnley will feel hard done by.\n\nMalo Gusto (Chelsea): I'm not the biggest lover of this fella if I'm being honest. I can't work out why I don't rate him but I just don't. But credit where credit is due - he scored a good goal and played well against Everton - who were poor. He seems to be stepping up. A goal and an assist. I have to be as fair as I can.\n\nNordi Mukiele (Sunderland): He was excellent in the win over Newcastle. He got a yellow card but shut down Anthony Gordon, one of the best wingers in the Premier League who will probably start for England at the World Cup, and Mukiele didn't allow him to get anything going. He handled the mental appoach to it fantastically. He got the crowd involved and was part of a monumental victory for Sunderland.\n\nCalvin Bassey (Fulham): He chipped in with a goal at Burnley and might be my favourite personality in football - happy-go-lucky, plays with his heart on his sleeve. He's going to make mistakes but doesn't try to be perfect or polished and it was another dominant display by him. It looks like he's at fault for the first goal but it's actually Antonee Robinson running out to the left for no good reason.\n\nIbrahima Konate (Liverpool): Konate was under a lot of pressure and people were questioning whether he's going to be at Liverpool long-term - whether he's letting the transfer saga get to his head. He stepped up again in the win against Brighton and delivered.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): I'm seeing a lot of talk about the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth being the best game we've seen all year. Amateur-hour defending. But quality with the corner for Casemiro's goal and then that free-kick - you get in team of the week if you spank one of them in the top bin. He deserves that.\n\nIbrahim Sangare (Nottingham Forest): I was struggling to put Forest players in, which is weird when they won 3-0, but I thought Spurs were that bad. So bad you couldn't turn around and say 'these were great players'. But Sangare with a goal and two assists has had a great day for a holding midfielder. He's thriving under Sean Dyche. They lose him now for the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, which is really disappointing.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi (Nottingham Forest): He's got all the ability and potential to be whatever he wants. We need to see more games like this - goals and assists. I thought he was excellent on the day and Spurs couldn't live with him - he ran them ragged.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): The most underrated striker in the Premier League. Two goals in back-to-back games. The kid scores. He comes off after 70 minutes for Alexander Isak. Fantastic signing. He will be pushing Erling Haaland all the way for most goals. This kid is mustard - he's the real deal. Another one who will be looking at the World Cup and thinking he's got to go - he can play off the left-hand side with Kylian Mbappe for France.\n\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa): Villa are going about their business now. They showed West Ham too many opportunities - they won 3-2 away but on another day they lose. Rogers, fantastic first goal. The calmness and poise to turn and swivel on it. The second, knuckleball. You can try that 10 times and it won't go there, right in the top corner. Making a real argument that he should be starting for England in the opening game of the World Cup. He's growing as a player and a leader. It's no coincidence Villa do well when this kid does well.\n\nHarry Wilson (Fulham): Just a player you really enjoy watching. He has no real super strength but got two assists and a goal at Burnley. So calm, so poised. Not the quickest but he'll go past you, and knows he'll go on the left foot but you can't stop him. Wonderful football player.\n\nArne Slot (Liverpool): A massive result against Brighton. It was all about how he handled the Mohamed Salah situation. A lot of pressure on him and Liverpool. He defused the situation perfectly. They got the clean sheet, got the win. Also he managed that Joe Gomez situation - another injury at right-back. Pivotal win for them, and when you look at the table they're seventh. Considering their bad start to the season they're a few points off the Champions League places. They'll feel happy.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "A remarkable, chaotic, mesmerising Premier League thriller at Old Trafford captured the imagination even of the clinical operators in the dugout.\n\n\"Really difficult to explain,\" said Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola. \"But I prefer 4-4 to 0-0.\"\n\n\"Fun,\" was Manchester United counterpart Ruben Amorim's initial observation.\n\nAnalysing for Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher went further.\n\n\"The best game of the Premier League season so far,\" said the former England and Liverpool defender. \"It was almost a throwback to Alex Ferguson's Manchester United with attacking football.\n\n\"It is the best I have seen Man Utd. For the majority of the game, they were absolutely fantastic.\n\n\"For the first time under Amorim - and first time in a long time - I felt like I was watching what Man Utd are supposed to be. Wave after wave attack, but the inability to defend has hurt them.\"\n\nFor the record, Ferguson took charge of two games when United scored four and didn't win.\n\nThe first was a significant factor in his side's failure to win the 2012 title as United threw away a 4-2 lead and drew 4-4 with Everton at Old Trafford.\n\nThe other was Ferguson's very last match, an extraordinary 5-5 draw at West Brom in 2013.\n\nAmorim has a very long road ahead before he can be compared to Ferguson.\n\nBut at least, on a night when his side led twice in the first half, then fought back to get their noses in front again after conceding two in a matter of minutes at the start of the second, and finally had to settle for a point as Bournemouth finished the stronger, he understood what everyone had witnessed.\n\nIn a vibrant first half, the hosts' had the highest non-penalty xG value (2.49), most shots (17) and joint-most touches in the opposition's box (30) of any side in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League match this season.\n\n\"If you understand a little bit,\" Amorim said. \"If you follow the club like I follow the Premier League for so long, you [know you] have not just the duty to try to win the games. The way you try to win the games is so important for the fans.\n\n\"Of course they are desperate to win, but also, I feel that they are desperate to be inspired when they come to Old Trafford.\n\n\"Today was inspiring, I think, also because of Bournemouth. But in the end that's the feeling of frustration of not winning the game.\"",
