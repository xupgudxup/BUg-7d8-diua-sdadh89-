    "fullText": "Pro Football Focus projected the landing spots for five of the top interior offensive linemen in free agency, which includes Pittsburgh Steelers veteran guard Isaac Seumalo.\n\nAccording to PFF's Mason Cameron, Seumalo will predictably head to the Las Vegas Raiders, where the new Klint Kubiak regime will utilize his run-game prowess.\n\n\"Former Seahawks offensive coordinator and new Raiders head coach Klint Kubiak understands the importance of establishing a diverse run game to better allow for shot plays in the passing game through play action,\" Cameron wrote. \"Seumalo’s skill set pairs well with that mentality. The 32-year-old guard has been excellent throughout his career with the Eagles and Steelers.\n\n\"During his three seasons in Pittsburgh, Seumalo showcased his talent as a run blocker in gap (82nd percentile) and zone (92nd percentile) concepts. But where he really sets himself apart is through his ability to sell the run out of play action without overextending, having generated the fourth-highest play-action PFF pass-blocking grade (87.8) among guards over the past three seasons.\"\n\nSeumalo has appeared in 125 games, including 104 starts, during his time with the Eagles (2016–2022) and Steelers (2023–2025). He also earned the first Pro Bowl recognition of his career with Pittsburgh in 2024.\n\nIf Pittsburgh loses out on Seumalo, Buffalo Bills guard David Edwards would make an excellent substitution, with our Steelers Wire free agency scouting report giving fans a better idea of his potential fit.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, including any offseason moves, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers predicted to lose Isaac Seumalo to Raiders, per PFF",

    "description": "Xavier begin its pursuit of a 6th straight state title with two wins, Perry was upset in Round 2 and there's an epic battle being set up in 3A.",
    "fullText": "The Arizona high school girls soccer playoffs are underway, with the first two rounds of the Open Division and the first round for the 3A and 2A tournaments completed.\n\nIt’s called the Open for a reason, and there are five, maybe six teams that have a real shot at lifting the gold ball for the state’s highest playoff classification, which combines the top three conferences into one bracket. But Phoenix Xavier Prep is in the midst of one of the greatest runs ever seen in the state.\n\nThe 6A, 5A and 4A fields are now set following the conclusion of the first two rounds of the Open. It was mostly chalk, but there were a few upsets.\n\nHere's a rewind of the top moments during the week as we look ahead to the rest of the playoffs.\n\nXavier Prep is the five-time defending state champion and the team everyone is chasing. The Gators are seeking to make history – only one other school, Chandler Seton Catholic in 3A, has won six consecutive Arizona girls' soccer titles. No. 5 Xavier is off to a hot start in the Open, routing Peoria Sunrise Mountain in Round 1 and Waddell Canyon View 7-0 in Round 2.\n\nChandler Hamilton and Queen Creek Casteel are two of the teams in the hunt to take down the Gators. Both have a history with Xavier. Hamilton, the No. 1 seed, took down Sahuarita Walden Grove 4-0 and Chandler Arizona College Prep 4-0. Casteel, No. 2, beat Tucson Catalina Foothills 4-0 and Anthem Boulder Creek 4-0. Last season, Casteel came painstakingly close to ending the Gators’ run last year, losing in overtime in the title game. Same for Hamilton, losing 5-4 on penalty kicks in 2024.\n\nScottsdale Chaparral, No. 3, Chandler Basha, No. 4, and Phoenix Desert Vista, No. 11, are also in the mix as contenders.\n\nChaparral has won eight titles under coach Robyn Carlson. The program at Basha has been built into a respectable one by coach Ryan Watrous over the past four years, and the Bears will have a chance in the quarterfinals against Xavier. Desert Vista is the defending 6A state champion.\n\nNo. 8 Gilbert Perry has become a mainstay in the playoffs this decade, reaching the Open semifinals in 2025, the 6A quarterfinals in 2024, the 6A championship in 2023 and 2022 and the 6A semifinals in 2021. The 2-0 loss in Round 2 to No. 9 Gilbert Highland is a rarity for the Pumas and an upset, even though the teams are ranked so closely. Highland is a school filled with top-tier athletes, but it’s been 11 years since the school appeared in a championship final.\n\nWith the Open in the quarterfinals, that means the brackets for 6A, 5A and 4A are now finalized.\n\nPerry falls back into 6A and immediately slots in as one of the favorites to win the 6A tournament as the No. 2 seed. Phoenix Pinnacle, No. 1, is in the mix as well after losing to Desert Vista in Round 2.\n\nIn 5A, Gilbert Campo Verde is the top seed and certainly headlines the group as one of the teams that can win it. But Scottsdale Notre Dame Prep, No. 5, should not be overlooked. The Saints won the 2024 state championship under coach Mike Varela and are a tough out.\n\nQueen Creek Crismon’s Round 1 loss in the Open was technically the biggest upset, with No. 23-seeded Glendale Mountain Ridge beating the No. 10-seeded Rattlers. But that makes Crismon a heavy favorite to go all the way in 4A. Crismon features one of the most prolific players in state history, with senior forward Sydney Droen (144 goals, 112 assists).\n\nAlso watch for No. 2 Tucson Salpointe Catholic, No. 3 Flagstaff Coconino and No. 5 Surprise Paradise Honors.\n\nMeanwhile, two schools in the 3A tournament are setting up what could be a slugfest in the championship game.\n\nNo. 1 Phoenix Northwest Christian cruised in its Round 1 game, winning 14-0 against San Tan Foothills. Northwest Christian is trying to get back on top after a run of three titles in four years from 2019-22.\n\nNo. 2 Gilbert Christian cruised as well, beating ALA Mesa North 16-0. Gilbert Christian has made three championship games since 2020, winning two (2020, 2024).\n\nThe two teams seem to be on a collision course for a competitive final — unless No. 3 Queen Creek Benjamin Franklin has something to say about it.  The Chargers have won two titles in the past four seasons. Ben Franklin beat Page 6-0 in Round 1.\n\nIn 2A, all the higher seeds advanced. No. 1 Phoenix Country Day School beat North Phoenix Prep 2-0 and No. 2 Glendale Prep Academy beat Avondale St. John Paul Catholic II 6-0. Freshman forward Naomi Burge, the third-leading scorer in Arizona, continued her impressive first season with two more goals to make it 51 on the year.\n\nLogan Stanley is a sports reporter with The Arizona Republic who primarily focuses on high school, college and Olympic sports.

    "description": "George Pickens' future is up in the air at the time of writing, and that lends itself to all sorts of scenarios that could potentially play out.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys and George Pickens are getting set for a big offseason of contract talks, and you can bet it won't be smooth sailing.\n\nWith the Cowboys set to franchise Pickens, just as our own Mike Fisher reported back on November 27, that has led some to think the franchise could look to trade the Pro Bowl receiver and get something in return.\n\nIn truth, trading Pickens doesn't seem like a move that winning football teams make, and one could only imagine the backlash if the Cowboys trade Micah Parsons and then Pickens in back-to-back offseasons.\n\nAt the time of writing, we don't get the sense that Dallas wants to trade George, with Fish stating that some sections of people inside The Star would have an aneurysm if that were to happen.\n\nSo that tells you what the franchise thinks of Pickens.\n\nIt is here where NFL Network's Ian Rapoport offers his thoughts on what might entice Dallas to trade Pickens.\n\n“They’re going to franchise tag him, I just wonder what happens next,” Rapoport said. “He had a breakout year. These are the guys you don't let walk in free agency, and he's been great. What I really don't know is, are the Cowboys going to get an offer for Pickens that would allow them to trade him?\n\"They acquired him for a three, what if they franchise-tagged [Pickens], he gets the long-term deal that he wants, and they [Cowboys] get a two back? That's incredible value. I wonder if that's something that would be palatable for the Cowboys.\"\n\nIf I were Dallas' general manager, a second-round pick would not be enough for me to move on from Pickens. In truth, given what we saw George do, not only for the offense as a whole, but for individual players, I'm not sure I'm letting him go at all. Barring a godfather-like offer, of course.\n\nInstead, use the cap space and draft picks to rebuild the defense, while keeping the offense together.\n\nThis isn't the first time we have heard Dallas trading Pickens and getting a second-round pick back, and one thing we know about Rapoport is that he doesn't say things for the sake of it.\n\nSo there might be some merit to his line of thinking. He got that from somewhere.\n\nHow Jerry Jones approaches Pickens' contract will tell us a lot about where the owner's mind is regarding building a roster capable of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nThe offense with Pickens is more than capable of winning it all. It just needs a defense that can complement it.\n\nIf you trade away Pickens, you lose a huge part of what makes your offense great.\n\nAnd in the process, might throw away a chance at finally making that NFC Championship game.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX – Just like that, it appears the Milwaukee Brewers have their third baseman for 2026.\n\nAccording to a report from MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, Luis Rengifo has agreed to terms on a one-year pact worth $3.5 million with another $1.5 million available in incentives.\n\nThe deal, according to Feinsand, also includes a $10 million mutual option for 2027.\n\nAs of early Friday evening, Feb. 13 the Brewers had yet to announce the transaction.\n\nTo see Milwaukee make a move for Rengifo is hardly surprising considering the position had been thrown into tumult since the surprise trade of last season's starter, Caleb Durbin, to the Boston Red Sox on Feb. 9.\n\nDavid Hamilton, acquired in the Durbin deal, and Jett Williams were the most likely candidates for the job heading into camp until the Rengifo addition, with prospects Brock Wilken, Luke Adams and Jesús Made also expected to see time at third.\n\nIn Rengifo, the Brewers are buying low on a seven-year veteran of the major leagues who is coming off a down 2025 after compiling three straight productive seasons for the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nA switch-hitter who turns 29 on Feb. 26, Rengifo hit .238 with nine home runs and 43 runs batted in with an OPS of .622 and 10 stolen bases in a career-high 147 games with the Angels last year.\n\nRengifo's strikeout rate isn't awful (19.2%, 62nd percentile in the majors) but he doesn't walk much, either (6.1%, 24th percentile). In addition, he struggled hitting the ball hard (24th percentile or lower in three key categories) with just 15th percentile bat speed.\n\nDefensively, Rengifo also struggled, accounting for minus-seven outs above average and minus-five defensive runs saved in 76 games at third with a below-average throwing arm.\n\nOne facet of Rengifo's game is right up the Brewers' alley – versatility. He also played 74 games at second base and 10 more spread between all three outfield positions.\n\nRengifo even logged a couple innings at shortstop.\n\nHe represents the second veteran to reportedly agree to terms with the Brewers this week; catcher Gary Sánchez is also expected to come aboard on a one-year deal to serve as backup to William Contreras.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Brewers reportedly agree to deal with veteran infielder Luis Rengifo",

    "fullText": "Ilia Malinin finishes stunning 8th in Olympics singles figure skating: 'I blew it' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf the team event at the 2026 Winter Olympics was Ilia Malinin's introduction to the broader United States sporting fanbase, the men's singles served as something of a coronation.\n\nMalinin, a Vienna, Virginia native, is widely considered to be figure skating's greatest talent. He's the only person to successfully complete a quadruple axel, having pulled off the feat a number of times throughout his still budding career.\n\nMalinin flaunted his talent in the team event, overcoming a shaky short program to lead the Americans to gold. Men's singles, it seemed, would be a cakewalk -- a platform for the 21-year-old to enchant audiences before another gold medal danced along his neckline.\n\nThat didn't happen, though. Malinin suffered one of the biggest upsets in recent Olympic history, missing out on the podium entirely after falling victim to a number of uncharacteristic errors.\n\nSo, just what went wrong for Malinin on Friday afternoon? In short, everything. Here's what you need to know.\n\nMORE: Every mistake that cost Ilia Malinin an Olympic medal in men's singles\n\nMalinin entered the contest with hopes of draping a second golden ornament around his neck. His dreams came crashing during his free skate program, a four-and-a-half minute routine that turned hellish following an early miscue. Malinin attempted to pull off a quadruple axel -- his signature skill. But he was turned away, unable to finish all of his rotations. He settled for a single axel, instead, setting the stage for an unusually nervy display.\n\nThe 21-year-old cratered into the ice shortly thereafter, losing his footing while attempting to land a quadruple toe loop. He tumbled into the slippery white plain once more during his routine. All told, Malinin lost out on 72 points during his jumps. That cost him dearly, seeing him fall into eighth-place, some 37 points shy of gold medalist Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan.\n\nIlia Malinin falls out of the podium in the men's singles final for figure skating.\n\nMalinin finishes in 8th place. pic.twitter.com/c4ZvSrkmIB\n\n— The Sporting News (@sportingnews) February 13, 2026\n\nMORE: Updated Winter Olympics medal count for every country\n\nMalinin was gracious in defeat, congratulating Shaidorov when his score was read.\n\nDespite the heartbreaking finish, Ilia Malinin went over to congratulate the men's singles final gold medal winner Mikhail Shaidorov 👏 pic.twitter.com/Kcti5qFX0I\n\n— The Sporting News (@sportingnews) February 13, 2026\n\nHe then spoke with NBC's Andrea Joyce, where he offered an honest assessment of his display.\n\n\"I blew it,\" Malinin said. \"That's honestly the first thing that came to my mind was 'There's no way that just happened.' I mean, I was preparing the whole season, I felt so confident in my program. ... To just go out and that happens, I have no words, honestly.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he could chalk up his errors to some physical limitation, Malinin was clear.\n\nMORE: Updated medal count for Team USA at 2026 Winter Olympics\n\n\"I just felt ready getting on that ice. But I think that maybe I was too confident that it was going to go well,\" Malinin said. \"Honestly, it happened, I can't process what just happened. It happens.\"\n\n\"I think it was definitely mental. Now, finally experiencing that Olympic atmosphere, it's crazy, it's not like any other competition.\"\n\nMalinin is 21 years old. He'll turned 21 on Dec. 2 of last year.\n\nMalinin could have made his Olympic debut four years earlier. He placed second in the men's singles at the 2022 U.S. Championships, putting him in position to be selected for the U.S. roster as a 17-year old.\n\nDespite his impressive exploits, Malinin missed out on the final roster, with U.S. Figure Skating selectors opting to select veterans Vincent Zhou and Jason Brown over him. Malinin's omission was a controversial one; U.S. Figure Skating argued that Zhou and Brown's body of work superseded Malinin, who had yet to make an appearance at junior worlds, junior Grand Prix or the 2021 U.S. Championships.\n\nMalinin had to settle for a spot on the U.S.'s World Championships roster, instead. He finished fourth in the short program, but fell to ninth after struggling in free skate.",

This is the second straight week that Hampshire has withdrawn from competition after missing Round 5 in Glendale, Arizona, with flu-like symptoms.\n\nThe team has not provided a timeline for his return, but in a news release, the team said he has been \"[ruled] out of upcoming rounds in the SMX World Championship.\"\n\n\"It’s never good to get a mid-morning phone call from Baker’s Factory on a ride day,\" said Nathan Ramsey, Rockstar Energy Husqvarna Team Manager. \"Unfortunately, RJ had a crash, and the handlebars caught his foot in just the wrong way, resulting in a fracture. Our focus now is on the best path forward to get RJ healthy and back racing as soon as possible.\"\n\nHampshire entered Seattle 14th in the Monster Energy Supercross standings.\n\n\"One thing after another,\" Hampshire posted on social media. \"Got back on the bike yesterday after getting over being sick. I slid over this small jump and had a slow/awkward fall that caused me to plant my foot. When I planted it, the end of the handlebars came down right on top of my boot, splitting the buckles. Broke two of the metatarsals and [one's] pretty displaced. Bummed on how it’s gone the last four months, sometimes it comes in waves. I’ll rebuild and get where I know I can be.\"",

    "fullText": "CLEARWATER, Fla. — Turns out, the Philadelphia Phillies were ale-ing last year.\n\nDeciding their relationship ruptured when Nick Castellanos angrily brought a beer into the dugout after he was pulled from a game, the Phillies released the outfielder even though they owe him $20 million for the final season of a five-year, $100 million contract.\n\nDraught was an issue in a season that extended the team’s title drought.\n\nIn a four-page handwritten letter posted Thursday, Castellanos admitted he broke a team rule by bringing a Presidente beer into the dugout last June “after being taken out of a close ball game in front of my friends and family.” Phillies manager Rob Thomson made the move for defense with a 3-1 eighth-inning lead during a 5-2 win at Miami on June 16.\n\n“I’m proud of him because he owned up to what he did and, hey, we all make mistakes,” Thomson said Friday. “Nick had helped us out in a lot of ways here. He’s had some big hits and big plays and helped us win a lot ballgames. So I do, I wish him all the best.”\n\nDuring a season that ended with a Division Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, Castellanos hit .250 — his lowest in a non-shortened season — with 17 homers and 72 RBIs.\n\nAny team can sign Castellanos for the $780,000 major league minimum. Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski had decided Castellanos wouldn’t report to the team for spring training — the 33-year-old did not have a locker assigned and two photos of him in the corridor of player images already had been removed.\n\n“A lot of times when a good player has their role change with the club, it can cause some friction, and his role changed last year from where it was,” Dombrowski said. “I mean you played every single day for a lot years in a row, and so sometimes that can contribute to it. Sometimes then people have debates between themselves where they’re not all on the same page. But when you put all that together, sometimes you just need to make sure that you have a change of scenery.”\n\nCastellanos’ minus-12 outs above average — how many outs they gain defensively over the average fielder at their position, according to MLB Statcast — tied the New York Mets’ Juan Soto and the Los Angeles Angels’ Jo Adell for 108th and last among 110 qualified outfielders.\n\nCastellanos was removed for Johan Rojas, who took over in center as Brandon Marsh moved from center to left and Max Kepler from left to right.\n\n“I then sat right next to Rob and let him know that too much Slack in some areas and too tight of restrictions in others and not (conducive) to us winning,” Castellanos wrote. “Shoutout to my teammates and Howie (Phillies special assistant Howie Kendrick) for taking the beer out of my hands before I could take a sip.\n\nCastellanos said he “aired out our differences” after the game during a meeting with Thomson and Dombrowski.\n\n“The conversation ended with me apologizing for letting my emotions get the best of me,” Castellanos wrote.\n\nCastellanos was benched the next day for what Thomson said then was “an inappropriate comment.” Castellanos wrote the Phillies told him not to divulge details to reporters.\n\n“I was surprised that a lot of people didn’t see what was taking place at the time,” Dombrowski said.\n\nThomson doesn’t regret the messy details didn’t become public at the time.\n\n“I thought it was appropriate what we did,” he said.\n\nCastellanos appeared in 75 of the team’s final 90 regular season games and hit .133 with three RBIs in the four-game Division Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. His production decline led to the decision as much as the beer beef.\n\n“That wasn’t the final or determining factor, because if that was, we would have done that at that particular time,” Dombrowski said.\n\nPhiladelphia secured a replacement in December, agreeing to a one-year, $10 million contract with Adolis García.\n\nReporting for the new season and hoping to win Philadelphia’s first title since 2008, Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber wished Castellanos the best.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of really good memories here over the last four years and he’s had some really big moments with us,” Schwarber said. “Hopefully wherever he goes next, he’s able to keep going out there and keep doing his thing and keep having those big moments.”",

    "description": "The Canadian and Swedish men's curling teams had a heated moment at the Olympics on Friday, as Sweden accused Canada of cheating.",
    "fullText": "The Canadian men's curling team closed out a successful 2-0 day at the 2026 Winter Olympics with a narrow win over Sweden.\n\nBut before a winner could be crowned in Cortina d'Ampezzo, there were tensions between the two teams.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Winter Olympics updates: Quad God misses gold, US women's hockey in action\n\nFollowing the ninth end, Canada and Sweden broke out into a heated verbal confrontation on the ice at the Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium. The incident was sparked by Sweden’s Oskar Eriksson claiming Canada's Marc Kennedy double-touched his rock after releasing it before the hog line.\n\n\"Apparently it’s OK touching the rock after the hog line,\" Eriksson said while clearing the house, according to the Toronto Star. Per the Star, Eriksson's comments were immediately answered by responses of \"who?\" \"I haven’t done it once\" and \"Don’t chirp\" by Kennedy.\n\nCanada closed out its 8-6 win over Sweden with a point in the 10th end, moving them to 3-0 in the round-robin standings.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Ilia Malinin hot mic says Beijing Olympics experience could have prevented 2026 disaster\n\nThe issue the Swedes had, according to Reuters, was that they thought Kennedy and Canada were making contact with the stone beyond the hog line, which is the line on the sheet of ice where curlers must let go of the curling stone during delivery.\n\nWorld Curling has introduced electronic handles on the stones at the 2026 Winter Olympics, a technology piece that will tell officials if double-touching with the stone happened. Eriksson mentioned Sweden thought Kennedy was touching the stone and not the handle containing the sensor, which would not set off the red lights.\n\n\"He asked who we thought was over the hog line and I pointed out who we thought was touching the rock,\" Eriksson said. \"It was obviously not a red light, but some players are touching the rock, according to us. And that's not allowed. ... We told the officials. They came out and they misread the rules, sadly.\n\n\"Because they thought double-touching any part of the rock is OK. And then they found out that was wrong. You can only touch the electronic part of the handle.\"\n\nAsked about the incident following the match, Kennedy said he didn't like being accused of cheating.\n\n\"It's good. It's (a) sport. It's the Olympics. Both teams are trying to win,\" Kennedy said after the matchup, according to Reuters. \"Oskar was accusing us of cheating. I didn't like it. I've been curling professionally for 25 years.\"\n\nHe later added: \"There's hog line devices on there. I don't know. And he's still accusing us of cheating. I didn't like it. So I told him where to stick it.\"\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, World Curling said that umpires had been set at the hog line to monitor deliveries for three ends after the issue was first raised during the game, but that there were \"no hog line violations or retouches of the stone during the observation.\"\n\nBoth teams return to action on Saturday, Feb. 14 for one game each. Canada takes on Switzerland at 8:05 a.m. ET, while Sweden takes on China at the same time.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Canada, Sweden have heated moment in men's curling at Olympics",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have made it clear that they would like to have Aaron Rodgers return for a second season in Pittsbugh, and a 22nd season in the NFL overall. The 42-year-old entered 2025 on a one-year deal with the intention of it being his final season. However, he kept the door open to return in 2026, and now the Steelers await his decision.\n\nIn terms of his performance in 2025, Rodgers threw 24 touchdowns to just seven interceptions and led the Steelers to an AFC North championship. It’s because of that year-long outing that Nick Shook of NFL Media ranked Rodgers as the No. 16 quarterback amongst all 63 to start a game in 2025.\n\n“Aaron Rodgers bested Father Time for much of 2025 and is the primary reason the Steelers even reached the playoffs,” Shook writes. “He produced some of his best games of the last three or four years and can definitely still fill a starting job somewhere in this league if he wants it.”\n\nRodgers was sandwiched between Brock Purdy (No. 15) and Baker Mayfield (No. 17).\n\nShould Rodgers return, he would reunite with his former head coach in Green Bay, Mike McCarthy.\n\nLet us know what you think in the comments. Be sure to bookmark Behind the Steel Curtain for all the latest news, breakdowns, and more!\n\nMason Rudolph sides with Joey Porter on Big Ben comments\n\nAntonio Brown defends Ben Roethlisberger after Joey Porter comments\n\nCam Heyward ends retirement speculation\n\nJoey Porter calls out Ben Roethlisberger for being a bad teammate",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-6, 7-4 SEC) is attempting to end what has been a disappointing losing streak after falling to Missouri 86-85 in one of the more heartbreaking losses this season, surrendering 56 points in the paint, as the last two losses vs. Florida and the Tigers were mainly due to the size differential in the front court.\n\nPlaying in the SEC is never an easy task, and while the Aggies started out 7-1, including Quad 1A road wins over Auburn, Texas, and Georgia, the blowout out loss to Florida was due to poor shooting, while a the three-point road loss to Alabama, followed by Wednesday's one-point loss to the Tigers proved that Texas A&M can't be counted out of any game, but need to play much better defense moving forward.\n\nBefore hosing a winnable midweek matchup vs. Ole Miss, Texas A&M is back on the road to take on No. 19 Vanderbilt, facing a Commodores team that has both looked like a national championship contender and an average SEC team within the span of two weeks, and will be without it's star guard Duke Miles for the fifth consecutive game, combined with guard Frankie Collins, who has been out since early December.\n\nDuke Miles is second on the team in scoring (16.6 PPG), while Vanderbilt is 4-1 without him in the lineup, and is considering a 3-seed or higher in the NCAA Tournament. For Texas A&M, facing a similarly sized team should help the offense find some consistency, and it will be tasked with playing better perimeter defense, as the Commodores are shooting 36% from beyond the arc and nearly 50% from the field.\n\nTexas A&M will face No. 19 Vanderbilt on Saturday at 12:00 p.m. CT. The game will air on the SEC Network.\n\nVanderbilt’s Duke Miles (knee) and Frankie Collins (knee) are both OUT for Saturday’s game against Texas A&M, per Mark Byington.\n\nMiles averages 16.6 PPG and has not played since 1/24.\n\nCollins averages 7.8 PPG and has not played since 12/17.\n\n— Jon Rothstein (@JonRothstein) February 13, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Vanderbilt will be without star guard Duke Miles vs. Texas A&M",

    "description": "Rickie Fowler already has two top-20 finishes this season and heads into Pebble Beach weekend with shot at title",
    "fullText": "PEBBLE BEACH — Rickie Fowler’s primary goal for 2026 is rather simple, summed up in two words. “Feel better.”\n\nMORE: Swifties flock to Pebble Beach\n\nHe would like to play better, too, but it’s hard to have one without the other, and Fowler just didn’t feel good throughout last season as he dealt with a stubborn left shoulder injury. And by stubborn, we mean chronic—something, he said, that has been an issue since high school. Somehow, the six-time PGA Tour winner managed to play well enough to finish among the top 50 in the FedEx Cup standings, ensuring a spot in all of this year’s signature events and allowing him to take an extended sabbatical in the fall to heal.\n\n“I definitely earned the time off with sneaking inside that top 50, so that was a nice bonus,” Fowler said Friday at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. “That was what I was trying to work towards to earn that time off and then be able to get into a position where I could get the body in a better spot and go play this year.”\n\nIncredibly, Fowler had only three top-10 finishes last year, but two of those were in the FedEx Cup Playoffs.\n\nHe obviously is feeling better these days, and after a second-round eight-under 64 at Spyglass Hill, the California native he has a chance to win a tournament that hasn’t been particularly kind to him. At 14-under 130, Fowler is tied for third, one stroke behind Akshay Bhatia and Ryo Hisatsune. He has never finished in the top 10 in this event.\n\nAt least Fowler can claim to have enjoyed a cool celebrity moment—even though it wasn’t during this tournament.\n\n“Maybe one of my first memories, I caddied for [Mark] Wahlberg in the U.S. Open Challenge prior to the 2010 U.S. Open,” he recalled of the event sponsored by Golf Digest on the weekend prior to the championship. “I think we were—I say ‘we’ because I was caddying—but I think Mark was the only one to break 100 [he shot 97], so got that under my belt.”\n\nFowler, 37, is making his third start this year and has a pair of T-18 finishes under his belt. His swing is dialed in—he led the field in strokes gained/approach at 4.782 on Friday—and overall, he is comfortable with his game. He converted nine birdies against just one bogey at Spyglass on another relatively calm day on the Monterey Peninsula.\n\n“I wouldn't say there's a specific part of the game that has either held me back or pushed me forward. Everything's been fairly solid,” he said. “I will say I've done a good job, you know, sometimes on the greens especially over at Pebble can get a little bouncy on the Poa. Spy typically rolls quite a bit better. I've done a good job of just committing and hitting a lot of good putts.\n\n“Yeah, especially when we get weather like this after we got through some of the rain, this is just a fun part of the world to be in.”\n\nAnd especially when you’re feeling better.",

    "fullText": "The Cubs have reportedly agreed to a two-year deal with veteran right-handed reliever Shelby Miller. Fansided’s Robert Murray was reportedly first with the news.\n\nSources: Free-agent reliever Shelby Miller and the Chicago Cubs are nearing a multi-year major-league contract. https://t.co/CpGcbS9bFA\n\n— Robert Murray (@ByRobertMurray) February 13, 2026\n\nMiller, 35, pitched quite effectively last year with the Diamondbacks, posting a 1.98 ERA and ten saves in 37 games before he was traded to the Brewers at the trade deadline, even though he was on the injured list at the time with a right-forearm strain. He returned from the IL in early August and mostly pitched well until a game on September 1 when Miller felt a “pop” in elbow. That turned out to be a torn ulnar collateral ligament, which lead to his second Tommy John surgery. Miller is expected to miss all of 2026 and return in 2027, so this two-year deal is really a deal for 2027 for the Cubs.\n\nMiller is an 11-year veteran who has pitched for ten teams, including the Cubs in 2021. He signed with the Cubs in Spring Training in 2021 and made three mostly-poor relief appearances until he went on the injured list with a back injury. The Cubs released him in May of that year when it was time for him to come off the injured list. Since then, Miller has bounced around with good seasons with the Dodgers in 2023 and Arizona last year and a poor season with the Tigers in 2024.\n\nMiller began his career as starter in the Cardinals system and was traded to Atlanta as part of a package for Jason Heyward in 2014. In 2015, Atlanta dealt Miller to Arizona as part of a package for Dansby Swanson. Miller has also pitched for the Rangers and Pirates. He has not started a game since 2019.",

    "description": "Yankees manager Aaron Boone won’t push for an early return, preferring to have Cole at optimum strength late in the season and October.",
    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. — Yankees ace Gerrit Cole threw his first bullpen of spring training on Friday, may pitch in exhibition games and is on track to return to regular-season action from May to September.\n\nA 35-year-old right-hander, Cole had Tommy John surgery March 11 with Los Angeles Dodgers team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of discussions between myself, the Yankees and Dr. ElAttrache,” Cole said. “With a full Tommy John reconstruction surgery, the target’s always between 14 and 18 months so that really hasn’t changed and that’s what the research says.”\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone won’t push for an early return, preferring to have Cole at optimum strength late in the season and October.\n\n“We want to make sure we give him the proper time to make sure he is good and ready to come back, built up in a smart way,” Boone said. “Don’t want to speed things up for the sake of a couple starts at the front end that could affect the overall product.”\n\nCole threw his first bullpen in October following surgery. He pitched at Steinbrenner Field with a beard — the Yankees relaxed their facial hair policy last year.\n\n“It’s been long and tedious, like most people’s experiences. As we get closer to the end, things start to gain a little momentum,” Cole said. “I just kind of am doing exactly what I’ve been told. So when I’m told to push, I push. When I’m told not to, I don’t.”\n\nThus far, his elbow feels better than it did two years ago.\n\n“It feels really good,” he said. “It feels different than it has been in quite some time.”\n\n“Everything looks like it’s coming out free and easy — command. He just looks to be in a really good place,” Boone said. “You know that diver that dives off the high board and just goes in the water and makes like no splash? That’s Gerrit on the mound.”\n\nCole altered his windup, putting his hands over his head. Before he was hurt, he stopped at his chest.\n\n“It feels good,” he said. “Just throwing on the backfields during the summer and tried it out. I’ve had little idiosyncrasies that have changed over the years from still hands to a drop or hands off of the body, close to the body. I think I generally just like the rhythm of it.”\n\nHis last official outing was in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series that Oct. 30. He pitched in two spring training games in 2025, the last on March 6.\n\n”Some silver linings, you get more family time,” Cole said. “I miss that outlet of working hard and feeling exhausted every five days.”\n\nAfter re-signing Paul Goldschmidt to a $4 million, one-year contract on Thursday, the Yankees have 24 of the 26 players from last year’s Division Series roster — all but relievers Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, who left as free agents and signed with the Mets.\n\nLeft-hander Ryan Weathers, acquired from Miami, appears to be the most significant addition.\n\n“From a macro standpoint, I think we assessed last year’s team as a really good team. I think it played very well. It ultimately fell short,” Cashman said. “In a micro standpoint, when you’re looking at individual decisions that add up to in theory ‘running it back,’ which is the term we’re hearing so much of and understandably so, I think it’s more you engage the current marketplace and it’s an acknowledgement: A, I think we had really good players that were great competitors and B, when I started trying to match up in the marketplace via trade or free agent signs, we wound up comfortable with every individual choice of whether it’s retaining, bringing back, reacquiring.”\n\nWithout a World Series title since 2009, the Yankees lost to Toronto in last year’s Division Series.\n\n“Certainly not apologetic of the team we had last year,” Cashman said. “It was a really strong team. A lot of people, experts in the game expected — not expected but predicted could win a world championship.”\n\nRight-hander Rafael Montero agreed to a minor league contract. The 35-year-old was 1-2 with a 4.48 ERA in 59 relief appearances last year for Houston, Atlanta and Detroit.\n\n“There’s some things we really liked that he was doing last year,” Boone said. “Maybe some small adjustments we can make to help him and hopefully he can push himself into the mix.”",

    "description": "Geoff Ogilvy joined GOLF's Subpar podcast to discuss his favorite golf courses, the 2026 Presidents Cup, the PGA Tour schedule and more.",
    "fullText": "There are few current or former pros who boast the same combination of on-course success and design chops as Geoff Ogilvy.\n\nOgilvy won eight times on the PGA Tour, including the 2006 U.S. Open, and is now a member of OCM golf course architects (along with Mike Cocking and Ashley Mead). He’s also about to captain the 2026 International Presidents Cup team at Medinah No. 3, a course OCM recently renovated.\n\nOgilvy, 48, was the guest on this week’s episode of GOLF’s Subpar podcast and discussed that recent reno, this year’s Presidents Cup and his love of golf course architecture. One question he was asked focused on his favorite courses from a design perspective.\n\n“Royal Melbourne [in Australia] is great,” he said. “It’s pretty doable for the average player. But it’s really hard for [pros], especially when the pins are tough. … If you miss it in the wrong spot, it’s a bit like the Masters, you just magnify your error. Every time you make an error you just have more trouble trying to get back on track. Royal Melbourne does that in a really subtle way and it catches up with you.”\n\nOgilvy said that while he loves Pine Valley in New Jersey — which has long been GOLF’s top-ranked course in the world — he says it’s too difficult for most golfers but probably the best course in the world for great players.\n\nHe’s also a big fan of the Old Course in St. Andrews.\n\n“I think [the Old Course] gets better every time you go around and you sort of learn something more,” he said. “It’s shaped by nature and the way people played the game rather than shaped by a person. You can play it conservatively all day and you’ll hit 16-17 greens in regulation — no one can hit 17 in two — but you’ll hit most greens in regulation. But you’ll have 50-footers all day, so then you’ll get braver and braver and you’ll start taking on the bunkers and out of bounds and then you’ll start making birdies and think this place is pretty simple, but then you’ll get burned and hit into the bunker and make a triple and then you go back to being conservative again. You seem to go in these cycles. The higher the quality your shot, that’s how much easier your next shot is. That place does it better than anywhere.”\n\nTo listen to the entire podcast with Ogilvy, click here, or watch on YouTube below.\n\nThe post Geoff Ogilvy on his favorite designs (and what makes them great) appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "The February 7 edition of \"AEW Collision\" helped set up not only the following Wednesday's huge episode of \"AEW Dynamite,\" which saw two title changes, but also Saturday's \"Grand Slam: Australia.\" Despite the excitement for things to come in AEW, the show saw a decrease in viewership from the previous week.\n\nAccording to Wrestlenomics, the February 7 episode of \"Collision\" drew an average of 388,000 viewers, down 21 percent from the previous week's average of 492,000 viewers. The show earned a 0.07 in the ever-important ages 18-49 demographic, which was no change from the January 31 show.\n\nThe episode versus the trailing four weeks average was positive in terms of viewership, up 15 percent from the average 339,000 viewers. Compared to this time last year, the average viewership for \"Collision\" is also up, to the tune of 16 percent from the February 2025 average of 335,000 viewers. This episode's rating versus the trailing four weeks average was also positive, up 75 percent from the average 0.04. Compared to this time last year, however, the rating is down 22 percent from an average of 0.09.\n\n\"Collision\" saw then-AEW Women's Champion Kris Statlander chose the stipulation for her \"Dynamite\" match against Thekla, and the champion decided on a strap match, which would ultimately see her downfall in days ahead. Elsewhere on the show, Marina Shafir and Wheeler Yuta got a victory ahead of their hair-versus-hair match against \"Timeless\" Toni Storm and Orange Cassidy at Grand Slam. The main event saw Tommaso Ciampa successfully defend the TNT Championship against Roderick Strong and Claudio Castagnoli.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Part 3 of @wiltfongjr’s Bears roster turnover series focuses on the tight ends. Does Chicago have the best duo in the league?",
    "fullText": "Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson changed his offensive scheme from what he used in Detroit to better utilize his roster, but a few principles remained. He wants to run the ball, use play action, and get his tight ends involved. He also expects his tight ends to be versatile so that he can line them up anywhere on the field.\n\nIn 2025, the Bears used the sixth-highest percentage of 12 personnel (1 running back, 2 tight ends) in the NFL and the fifth-highest percentage of 13 personnel.\n\nJohnson’s offense will continue to evolve schematically, but I can’t see Ben deviating too far from his use of tight ends, which makes this an important position that needs quality depth.\n\nHere’s how the Bears’ tight end room currently shapes up.\n\nColston Loveland – Signed through 2028* – Loveland was one of the most dynamic rookies in the NFL, and this was after a slow start to the season. He flashed elite traits and appears primed to push for the Pro Bowl next season. His athleticism makes him a perfect “move” tight end, but he didn’t seem to mind lining up as the Y and blocking either. It’s easy to see why the Bears valued his skill set at 10 overall in the draft, and why his ceiling is even higher than that of a perennial Pro Bowler.\n\n*Bears have the fifth-year option for 2029.\n\nCole Kmet – Signed through 2027 – The Bears could save about $8 million if they move on from Kmet, but I think it’s more likely they rework his deal and sign him to an extension. Kmet has become a reliable in-line blocker, but he’s athletic enough to line up wide or in the backfield. He’ll likely never approach the 73 receptions he had in 2023, but he plays an important role in Johnson’s offense.\n\nLoveland and Kmet make up one of the best tight end duos in the NFL.\n\nDurham Smythe – Free agent – The 30-year-old veteran played in a quarter of the Bears’ offensive snaps (293) and the sixth-most snaps on special teams (230). I can see the Bears bringing him back on another one-year deal.\n\nThe next three players spent time on Chicago’s practice squad in 2025 and signed reserve/futures contracts.\n\nStephen Carlson – Signed through 2026 – Carlson has been with the Bears since 2023, but he’s only appeared in three games. He’s a solid veteran option to call up from the practice squad, but at 29 years old, he’s probably never going to crack a 53-man roster.\n\nNikola Kalinic – Signed through 2026 – The 29-year-old began his career in the CFL in 2019, and the Bears are his fourth NFL team since 2022. He played in two games for the Bears in 2025, making 3 special teams tackles.\n\nQadir Ismail – Signed through 2026 – The Bears are his fifth NFL team since being a Ravens UDFA in 2024. At 6’6”, 232 pounds, he’s a good athlete who started his collegiate career as a quarterback for Villanova and finished it as a wide receiver for Samford. His dad, Qadry, was a ten-year veteran in the NFL.\n\n2026 OUTLOOK – Assuming Kmet stays, the Bears won’t be addressing this position with big money in free agency or a high draft pick. However, some bottom of the depth chart competition should come from a UDFA or two.\n\nWhat do you think will happen at tight end this offseason?",

    "description": "Nick Rallis returns as DC under new head coach Mike LaFleur.",
    "fullText": "While many Arizona Cardinals fans lose their minds over the decision to have Nick Rallis return as the team’s defensive coordinator, it’s obvious new head coach Mike LaFleur paid more attention to what affected the Cardinals in 2025 than those fans did.\n\nIn an interview with Cardinals reporter Dani Sureck after being introduced to the media 10 days ago, LaFleur was asked the impression the team’s defense had on him after playing against them six times in the last three seasons.\n\n“We've had some rough days against this defense,” he said.\n\nFor those who are guffawing at that comment and have serious cases of collective amnesia, consider that the Rams scored a total of 23 points in the two 2024 games against the Cardinals.\n\nAs for the troubles last season, LaFleur addressed that when he said, “Just going back to this year (2025) because every year changes, when we played them the first time, I think it was Week 11, maybe Week 12 from an NFL season standpoint, but our 11th game. And I remember (quarterback) Matthew (Stafford) coming into me on that Tuesday saying this doesn't look like their record. This looks like a really good defense because there are players there.”\n\nOf course, as many understand but not those that reside in the coaches-are-bad bubble, LaFleur obviously did when he noted, \"Unfortunately a lot of them weren't out there, particularly in that back half of the season. So that's my job and our job as a building to figure out how we can make sure that those best players are consistently out on the field.\"\n\nReality in the NFL is that game planning and in-game calls on both sides of the ball are based on what players are capable of and who is available. The facts are that during the 2025 season, 21 defensive players missed 161 games. Eleven were on a reserve list with an injury during the season. In the final nine games, 19 players missed 82 games. That can't be ignored even though many people do.\n\nAs LaFleur said in a statement Friday, “Nick is someone I have always had great respect for, especially going against him in the division over the last three years. During the interview process, I expressed that he was someone I held in high regard and would be very interested in talking to about the position.\n\n“I’ve had the chance to meet with him and pick his brain over the last couple weeks and am even more impressed than I was before. I know the respect he has from coaches around the league and especially with the players on this team and that says a lot to me.”\n\nEven if the loud outside narrative believes they know more than those that watch hours and hours of tape while actually working and grinding in the sport.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. — As Gerrit Cole threw his first bullpen of spring training on Friday morning, a crowd of reporters made their best efforts to get a look through the mostly-covered fence that encaged the rehabbing righty.\n\nWhile those with cameras took turns sharing limited peepholes in order to snap a shot of Cole, who underwent Tommy John surgery last spring, the contingent that stood behind him enjoyed an unimpeded view. The group included manager Aaron Boone, pitching coaches Matt Blake and Desi Druschel, bench coach Brad Ausmus and guest instructor Ron Guidry, who all watched Cole consistently reach the mid-90s as he simulated two innings of work.\n\nCole, who had already thrown some bullpens in New York and California over the offseason, saw his velocity hit at least 96 mph, and he threw his full arsenal to Austin Wells.\n\n“He looked like a Cy Young pitcher,” the catcher said of Cole, who won the award in 2023. “He looked smooth and in control. He looked confident in his ability.”\n\n“Was nice and easy,” Guidry chimed in.\n\nBoone agreed with those assessments, likening an in-command Cole to a “diver that dives off the high board and just goes in the water and makes no splash.”\n\n“He looked like Gerrit Cole,” the manager added.\n\nCole also came away pleased, calling his session “well executed” while noting that his reconstructed elbow “feels really good.”\n\n“It feels different than it has been in quite some time,” he continued. “Feel is subjective, so we’ll have to see how it plays out.”\n\nSo far, all has gone according to plan for the 35-year-old, who battled elbow inflammation in 2024 before tearing his ulnar collateral ligament around this time last year. But while Cole has looked sharp thus far, Boone made it clear that the Yankees won’t be rushing him back or pushing him harder than he needs to be.\n\nCole, meanwhile, reiterated that full Tommy John reconstruction comes with a 14-18-month timetable.\n\n“So it really hasn’t changed,” Cole said, meaning he’s looking at returning sometime in May, the earlier end of the spectrum, or June.\n\nEarlier this week, Boone said that Cole is scheduled to start facing live hitters in “a couple weeks” and could “potentially” get in games before spring training ends. Cole said the latter goal is realistic, but that isn’t set in stone.\n\nCole is doing his best to stay present, as he is still in the midst of what he said has been a “long and tedious” process. That said, he’s certainly longing for real games after sitting out the entire 2025 season.\n\n“I just miss playing,” he said. “I miss that outlet of working hard and feeling exhausted every five days.”\n\nWhenever Cole does return, the Yankees will be banking on him being the best version of himself.\n\nThe club didn’t add another frontline starter this offseason despite some others having injury and workload concerns, partly because they have Cole coming back. But Tommy John surgery can come with setbacks, rust and even prolonged struggles — look at how Atlanta’s Spencer Strider fared last year — which is why Cole doesn’t want to get ahead of himself.\n\n“I’m a confident guy,” Cole said. “I have high expectations for my execution internally, but overall, in terms of performance and expectations, I don’t really have any set goals or numbers or things like that. It’s been working really well to just stay day-to-day and execute the task at hand, so I think the challenge is to continue to do that as things become more exciting and as things start to get rolling more and more.”\n\nBoone, however, isn’t going to doubt that Cole can return to form.\n\n“I’m not going to put any ceiling on what Gerrit could do once he’s back and in the rotation,” the skipper said, noting the high success rate of Tommy John surgery.\n\nSome have wondered if Cole will return with new experiments that he concocted during his down time, but the cerebral pitcher said not much has changed, aside from him having more time to lift in the weight room. Cole didn’t reveal any new pitches, and he said that his mechanics remain mostly the same.\n\nThere is one exception, as he’s now starting his windup by bringing his hands over his head.\n\n“It feels good,” Cole said when asked about the tweak. “I generally just like the rhythm of it.”",

    "fullText": "In a new viral AI video, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise pummel each other on a rooftop in a cinematic action sequence.\n\nIt's not a trailer for a new blockbuster, and it's not actually Pitt and Cruise, though it looks a lot like them. The video is so realistic, in fact, that the clearest sign it's made with AI is the dialogue.\n\n\"You killed Jeffrey Epstein, you animal! He was a good man!\" Pitt says as he punches Cruise.\n\n\"He knew too much…\" Cruise replies.\n\nYou can see why Hollywood's most prominent trade organization is not happy about it.\n\nThe scene was created using Seedance 2.0, a new AI video-generation model released Thursday by ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.\n\nThe tool and the hyper-realistic videos of Hollywood actors and characters that users are creating with it have gone viral in China and are now catching the attention of Americans.\n\nJeffrey Epstein knew too much pic.twitter.com/12u8PQH9nt\n\n\"It's happening fast,\" Elon Musk said in response to a video generated using Seedance and posted to X, a reference to the speed at which artificial intelligence is advancing.\n\n\"We're cooked,\" another X user said.\n\nThe reaction from Americans is reminiscent of the buzz around DeepSeek, a Chinese company that unveiled an AI reasoning model in January last year that rivaled OpenAI's ChatGPT and other top models, stunning the biggest names in Silicon Valley and ratcheting up the competition between the United States and China in the race to dominate AI innovation.\n\nSeedance 2.0 is another shot across the bow of American AI companies. Its multimodal capabilities span text, image, audio, and video inputs and give creators control over metrics such as lighting, shadows, and camera movement.\n\nIn another viral scene, a deepfake version of Walter White — of Breaking Bad fame — points directly at the viewer and says, \"You think you're in control.\" It's a line that feels less like dialogue and more like a taunt.\n\nSeedance 2.0 is absolutely insane. Done with @chatcutapp pic.twitter.com/xk8xcBw6da\n\nThe uncanny representations of Hollywood actors, as well as characters from the Avengers and other major movie franchises, immediately raised copyright concerns.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association, the trade group representing major Hollywood studios and streaming services, released a statement on Thursday accusing ByteDance of infringement on a \"massive scale\" in a \"single day.\"\n\n\"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,\" Charlie Rivkin, the chairman and CEO of the MPA, said in a statement.\n\nOpenAI's AI video generation tool, Sora, which can also create AI versions of actors and characters, has also raised copyright issues.\n\nLike with so many of AI's latest tools, however, it can be hard to put the genie back in the bottle.",

    "fullText": "Thinking about using ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity to collect your thoughts for an email to your lawyers? Don't assume your chat will stay confidential.\n\nA federal judge ruled on Tuesday that prosecutors could access Claude chat transcripts generated by Brad Heppner, a finance startup founder accused of defrauding a company out of $150 million.\n\nThe chats occurred after Heppner received a subpoena, hired lawyers, and learned that he was a target of prosecutors, his lawyer said in court.\n\nHeppner, who helped start the finance firm Beneficient, was arrested last year and charged with wire and securities fraud for conduct that allegedly led to the downfall of GWG Holdings.\n\nInvestigators seized \"dozens of electronic devices\" when they arrested Heppner at his Dallas mansion, prosecutors said, and Heppner's lawyers have insisted that 31 chats with Anthropic's Claude bot on those devices are privileged.\n\n\"Mr. Heppner — using an AI tool — prepared reports that outlined defense strategy, that outlined what he might argue with respect to the facts and the law that we anticipated that the government might be charging,\" his lawyer said.\n\n\"The purpose of his preparing these reports was to share them with us so that he could discuss defense strategy with us.\"\n\nEven though Heppner had privileged conversations with his lawyers, Judge Jed Rakoff said he \"disclosed it to a third-party, in effect, AI, which had an express provision that what was submitted was not confidential,\" according to a transcript of the hearing.\n\nThe government noted that Claude's privacy policy specified that chats could be disclosed. Prosecutors also said that the chats couldn't be protected by the \"work product privilege,\" which can guard materials prepared at a lawyer's direction, because Heppner's lawyers didn't ask him to use Claude.\n\nThe decision has lawyers buzzing.\n\n\"My gut reaction is that the decision is directionally correct,\" Moish Peltz, an attorney whose post about the decision ricocheted around X, told Business Insider. \"There's a lot of materials that should be kept as privileged that people are putting into AI.\"\n\nThe proliferation of chatbots where people are inputting sensitive legal information, another wrote, has created \"a discovery nightmare.\"\n\nNoah Bunzl, an employment lawyer, told Business Insider that people might find it \"somewhat shocking\" that their legal confidences could be lost by sharing them with a chatbot.\n\nThe case isn't the first where an executive's use of a chatbot was the subject of legal debate.\n\nIn November, PC Gamer reported on a dispute involving the acquisition of a video-game company, where a company official's use of ChatGPT to try to avoid paying an earn-out was mentioned in court records.\n\nAnd after The New York Times sued OpenAI for allegedly violating its news article copyrights, a judge required OpenAI to retain millions of chat logs to potentially review them for copyright infringement.\n\nBunzl said he has noticed that in civil discovery, lawyers are increasingly asking for their adversary's AI chats. It's \"a whole other world of discoverable information,\" he said.\n\nStill, attorneys at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, who analyzed the Heppner decision, said it was the first they were aware of where someone's use of an AI tool may have resulted in \"a loss of privilege\" over privileged material. They said courts may view businesses' use of purpose-built AI tools differently.\n\nArlo Devlin-Brown, a white-collar defense lawyer, told Business Insider he thought AI models could potentially improve attorney-client information. But given the ambiguity in the law, people have to be vigilant.\n\n\"Until the law has been clarified, lawyers should caution their clients that inputting otherwise privileged information into an AI tool could risk exposure in litigation,\" he said in an email.\n\nRepresentatives for the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and Anthropic, and lawyers for Heppner, didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Yardeni has touted his \"Roaring 20s\" thesis before, retierating his view this week that the economy and markets will remain strong through this decade.",
    "fullText": "Ed Yardeni thinks the US is in the midst of the \"Roaring 20s,\" which will carry the economy through the rest of the decade without a recession.\n\nIn a video update on Friday, the founder of Yardeni Research re-upped his bullish thesis, noting that he sees no reason for the US to tumble into a recession in the coming four years. His market views have been similarly bullish. In recent years, the economist has predicted the Dow to hit 60,000 and the S&P 500 to rise to 8,000 by the end of the decade.\n\n\"We've got four more years to go. The end of the decade is the end of 2029,\" he stated. \"I'm still thinking that we're not going to have a recession between now and the end of the decade.\"\n\nYardeni noted the primary reason for his bullishness is the sheer resilience that the US economy has shown, which he measures by the frequency of recession. He noted that he doesn't think the US has seen an actual one since 2008.\n\n\"It's been hit by a lot of shocks and yet it continues to grow,\" Yardeni stated of the US economy. \"We had one recession that lasted all of two months back in 2020, but that was not really a legitimate recession.\"\n\nThe US economy's ability to keep chugging along has been a boon for the stock market, which has been enjoying in a nearly two-decade-long secular bull market. Yardeni highlighted the progress made by many S&P 500 members, which enjoyed significant growth for most of 2025.\n\nWhile some high-growth S&P stocks have struggled recently due to AI-related fears, Yardeni isn't concerned about this bearish trend persisting, adding that he thinks market strength will remain intact.\n\n\"I think we can also conclude that because of the resilience of the economy, earnings have been remarkably resilient for the S&P 500 and indeed they've been so during the current uh growing 2020 scenario,\" he noted.\n\nYardeni also expects real GDP growth to continue into 2026. He predicts that this year's GDP will expand by 3.5% to 4.5%, citing gains in productivity.\n\nThe economist acknowledged that the 4.5% figure may strike some as overly optimistic, but he maintained that it fits within his broader Roaring 20s model and forecast.\n\n\"That might be the outlook actually for the rest of the decade if things continue to go along as we're expecting,\" Yardeni added.",

    "description": "The nature of the dispute with the Department of Defense, including what Scale AI is seeking, is unclear.",
    "fullText": "Meta-backed artificial intelligence training company Scale AI is suing the Department of Defense.\n\nThe nature of the dispute, including what Scale is seeking, is unclear. Most of the documents, including the complaint, were filed on January 30 and are sealed. The lawsuit has not previously been reported.\n\nCase documents are expected to include classified information at the \"secret/no foreign\" level, according to one of the few unsealed documents.\n\nThe US is the only named defendant. Another AI company, Enabled Intelligence, joined as an intervenor defendant — a third party that voluntarily joins a suit to protect their interests.\n\nIn the fall, Scale lost a bid for a contract worth up to $708 million from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, part of the DoD, to Enabled Intelligence. The contract, which could last up to seven years, was the agency's largest data-training agreement yet. It includes work with the Pentagon's signature AI effort, Maven.\n\nIn late December, Scale filed a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office against the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Scale's bid protest was dismissed in late January, two days before the company sued in the Court of Federal Claims. The GAO does not typically publish information on routine protest dismissals.\n\nIn 2024, Scale won a $24 million, one-year contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to work on data labeling for Maven.\n\nA Scale spokesperson declined to comment on the DoD lawsuit, saying it \"relates to a recent procurement decision.\"\n\n\"Scale AI stands firmly with Secretary Hegseth and the Department of War in their mission to get frontier AI capabilities into the hands of warfighters. We are committed to ensuring the procurement process reflects the high standards required for our nation's most critical AI initiatives,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAttorneys for Enabled Intelligence and the DoD did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nScale has signed several multimillion-dollar contracts with the DoD since 2020. In March, the startup announced it was working with defense tech startup Anduril and Microsoft to deploy AI agents in the US military under a DoD program called \"Thunderforge.\" In August, Scale announced a $99 million contract to develop AI tools for the Army.\n\nThe company is best known for its data labeling business, which has helped Big Tech clients like Google and Meta improve their AI chatbots. In June, Scale received a $14.3 billion investment from Meta in exchange for a 49% stake in the startup.\n\nScale's former CEO, Alexandr Wang, wrote an open letter to President Donald Trump after his second inauguration, outlining five ways the president could advance AI in his first 100 days. The then-Scale exec wrote that he wanted the US government to emulate tech giants by spending more on data and compute and noted Scale's work with the DoD. Wang, who left Scale to join Meta's Superintelligence Labs as chief AI officer, also attended the president's AI dinner at the White House in September.\n\nSince Meta's investment, Scale has laid off 200 employees, or 14% of its workforce, lost major clients including Google and xAI, and has been battling a swarm of newer entrants trying to poach its clients and workers.",

    "fullText": "She attended the designer's fall runway show wearing a high-neck halter gown made from gauze-like fabric.\n\nIt wrapped around her body, creating a subtle see-through effect, and its skirt extended into a short train.\n\nShe wore it with a fuzzy jacket that she carried around her waist.\n\nShe made an appearance at the Tory Burch fall/winter runway show wearing a preppy look from the brand. It comprised a white pleated skirt with a black, button-up blouse tucked in.\n\nUnfortunately, the two pieces sat loosely on Anderson and appeared too formal.\n\nHer leather belt, sheer tights, pointed heels, and black purse added some fun to the look, but the base layers were ultimately too simple for them to work.\n\nWhile entering the Ralph Lauren show, Reinhart was photographed wearing a brown tweed blazer as a top with a thick brown belt holding it closed at the waist.\n\nShe also wore a long black skirt covered in leather fringe, which added texture and contrast to the ensemble.\n\nHigh black boots and a small brown purse completed the fun, fashion-forward look.\n\nAlso at the Tory Burch show, Seyfried wore a golden, long-sleeved blouse atop a blue midi skirt with silver stripes. She also wore white heels with silver adornments and carried a blue purse.\n\nThe mix of two metallic shades with blue tones created a unique, fun color combination that complemented her hair and skin tone.\n\nOutside the Tory Burch runway show, the Olympic gymnast was photographed wearing an oversize blue jacket with a form-fitting wrap skirt in a vibrant red shade.\n\nThe two pieces were drastically different in style, and they overwhelmed her petite frame. They also didn't match the lime-green top she wore or her black accessories.\n\nThe \"Stranger Things\" actor attended the show in blue jeans, a button-up top, and a leather jacket that matched his sneakers and Coach purse.\n\nThe latter piece was especially fun. It featured a prominent pocket reminiscent of a coin purse and two keychains that looked like miniature books.\n\nMcLaughlin has been one of the best-dressed men at New York Fashion Week so far.\n\nThe model sat in the stands wearing skinny black pants with a billowing blouse. The semi-sheer white garment had a high neckline, balloon sleeves, and extra fabric at the waist that extended into a train.\n\nThe top piece was dramatic and memorable, while her pants were perfectly tailored to highlight her dramatically pointed heels.\n\nFor the Michael Kors runway show, the actor wore an all-white ensemble that included trousers, a loose-fitting blouse, sneakers, and a trench coat.\n\nThe outfit would have worked for him if it featured more than one color. Because the entire ensemble was stark white, each piece blended into the others, creating the illusion that he was wearing a baggy jumpsuit.",

    "fullText": "History suggests more pain may stil be coming for bitcoin.\n\nIn a note to clients this month, strategists at Ned Davis Research said they saw potential downside ahead for the world's top crypto, even after major selling that's hammered the crypto in recent months. Should its bear market become a full-blown bitcoin winter, the coin could drop to as low as $31,000, according to Pat Tschosik, NDR's chief thematic strategist, and analyst Philippe Mouls.\n\nBitcoin, which has tumbled 44% from its October peak, traded around $69,180 on Friday. Should the coin fall to the $31,000 mark, that implies the crypto falling another 55% from its current levels.\n\nTschosik and Mouls said their analysis of past bitcoin drops had led them to expect a 70%-75% peak-to-trough decline in the crypto should the current sell-off escalate into winter.\n\nAcross bitcoin winters dating back to 2011, bitcoin has dropped an average 84%, NDR said. The average bitcoin winter has also lasted an average of 225 days, Tschosik and Mouls added, though it's only been 129 days since bitcoin peaked in early October.\n\nTschosik and Mouls noted that a winter wasn't necessarily guaranteed, given that bitcoin has more institutional buyers than in the past, which could create greater stability in bitcoin's price.\n\n\"Notice the winters/major bears are getting slightly less severe over time in terms of percent decline and we think that will continue,\" they said of their price forecast.\n\nTalk of more pain for crypto has picked up in recent weeks as bitcoin's decline has steepened. John Blank, the chief strategist at Zacks Investment Research, speculated that the coin could drop to as low as $40,000, given that the average crypto winter lasts for over a year. Stifel predicted last week that the full decline could take it to around $38,000.",

    "description": "Personnel won't be able to fully process all the data available on the modern battlefield. That's where artificial intelligence applications come in.",
    "fullText": "Army leaders say the modern battlefield is so saturated with sensors and networked weapons generating more data than soldiers can realistically process on their own that artificial intelligence is needed to meaningfully sort it all.\n\nFor years, the Army's focus was on fielding more sensors for battlefield information and awareness, but now the service is also having to think about information overload and managing the massive amounts of data coming in.\n\nDuring a recent US Army and NATO exercise in Europe, troops used a homegrown AI system to consume and sort data. The value wasn't strictly that the AI could do it faster but rather that it could remember context and patterns that humans couldn't.\n\nThe case from the Dynamic Front exercise is another example of how the US military is increasingly implementing AI and automation into everything from enemy attack simulations to paperwork.\n\n\"The modern battlefield, what we're already seeing across the globe, it is swimming in sensors, and we are drowning in data,\" Col. Jeff Pickler, the Army 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force commander, said at a media roundtable on Dynamic Front.\n\nThere aren't enough people to decipher all the available information, he said. \"They will never be able to fully process all of that.\"\n\nThe software aimed at addressing that problem remains in beta testing. In the next iteration of Dynamic Front — which will merge with another exercise, Arcane Front, to pair technology experimentation with theater-level combat rehearsals — Army leaders say they intend to test the AI at a larger scale.\n\n\"If we're looking at a target set in the European theater where we think we're going to need to process upwards of 1,500 targets a day, that's beyond the human scope,\" Pickler said. \"The answer to the equation there is in AI and automations.\"\n\nDuring a potential large-scale conflict in Europe, AI could assist in locating and assessing those targets.\n\nThe system can do this quickly, but the speed isn't the main benefit. AI can remember patterns that humans might forget or not even notice. Pickler gave an example of AI realizing that unrelated shipping reports, a local power outage, and a fertilizer delivery together might suggest missile fueling activity.\n\n\"So the difference isn't seconds versus minutes — it's minutes instead of months. Not because the machine scans quickly, but because it keeps context across sources that humans can't hold in memory,\" Pickler said after the roundtable.\n\n\"It doesn't replace analysts by reading faster,\" he said, \"it replaces the weeks analysts spend reconnecting information spread across thousands of reports.\"\n\nIn a conflict scenario, that could mean analysts reach a clearer picture of the battlefield faster. Correlations between data gathered from different sensors could surface more quickly. If an adversary were fueling, arming, or moving weapons in ways that were not immediately obvious, AI could help flag those links.\n\nHumans, though, would still decide how to respond.\n\nSoldiers have seen success with iterating on the current AI model, the Army said. It's been retooled during testing, and humans remain in the loop, reviewing outputs at multiple stages.\n\nThe goal is to continue increasing the overlap the model would have with human-produced information. In a targeting example, a milestone would be if AI achieved 90 to 95% agreement with humans on 100 target sets.\n\nThe Army's push for AI and automation is also driving the development of its Next Generation Command and Control software, a priority initiative.\n\nThe technology being developed by vendor teams including Anduril, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin uses AI and machine learning to provide commanders and soldiers with real-time data on ammunition levels, maintenance needs, intelligence feeds, targeting, and simulated enemy attacks.\n\nBut AI is also changing other aspects of how the Army works. Autonomous features in drones, weapons, and targeting might be at the forefront, but behind the scenes, personnel are using new tools, redesigned workflows, and data integration for recruiting, maintenance, and inventors. These are manual tasks that the service believes can be improved with AI.",

    "fullText": "LTK, a Softbank-backed startup and creator economy unicorn, let go of some staff on Thursday as part of a reorganization, a company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe cuts were designed to refocus LTK's business around its revamped brand platform and to account for structural changes to internal teams like marketing, according to the company.\n\nThe job reductions, which hit a variety of roles including software engineers and staffers who worked with creators, affected a low single-digit percentage of LTK's overall head count, which numbers over 550 employees, they said.\n\n\"LTK recently completed a targeted organizational restructure to ensure we are aligned around the skills and priorities required for our next phase of growth,\" the spokesperson said. \"This was not a broad-based layoff, but a strategic realignment focused on strengthening performance and positioning the business for long-term success.\"\n\nLTK, previously known as RewardStyle, was founded around 15 years ago by president Amber Venz Box. The company, which says it's profitable and doubled its EBITDA in 2025, has raised a little over $300 million in its lifetime. Most of that capital came in a 2021 round from SoftBank's Vision Fund 2, which valued the startup at $2 billion.\n\nOver the last decade, LTK has established itself as one of the leading players in affiliate marketing, building a network of influencers who promote products on social media in exchange for commissions.\n\nRecently, the company has made a series of moves to establish itself beyond social media affiliate marketing.\n\nThe company relaunched its app for influencer-driven shopping, called LTK, in early 2025, to add more consumer-facing features as it sought to build its own brand identity with consumers.\n\nIn late 2025, the company announced it was revamping its platform for brands, offering features such as creator discovery and performance tracking at no cost. LTK makes money by collecting a commission on sales. The company said that over 1,000 brands have been onboarded onto the platform.\n\nLTK is one of several creator economy startups that have focused their businesses on e-commerce. Other big players in the space include affiliate platform ShopMy and live-selling app Whatnot, which in October raised $225 million at an $11.5 billion valuation.",

    "title": "Who is North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's daughter, Kim Ju Ae, and why is she appearing more in the media?",
    "description": "Little is known about Kim Ju Ae, but recent appearances with dad Kim Jong Un fueled questions about whether she may be the next to lead North Korea.",
    "fullText": "The daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been showing up in headlines and rare public appearances in recent weeks — once again fueling speculation that the child is being groomed to be Kim's heir apparent.\n\nIn a February 12 closed-door briefing with the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, lawmakers were told the daughter has been described to be in the \"successor-designate stage,\" Lee Seong Kweun, a South Korean lawmaker, said, according to a report from The Associated Press.\n\n\"In the past, (NIS) described Kim Ju Ae as being in the midst of 'successor training.' What was notable today is that they used the term 'successor-designate stage,' a shift that's quite significant,\" Lee said, according to the report.\n\nKim's daughter, who is believed to be around 13 years old, has made several high-profile appearances in recent years, which is a rare move for the secretive family. The daughter was first seen in images shared by state media in November 2022.\n\nThat unexpected public display has raised questions around whether the North Korean leader is signaling the next heir to the Kim dynasty, though experts have previously said that it's too early to speculate — especially as the seat is typically reserved for a male heir.\n\nStill, little is known or has been confirmed about the daughter herself. Kim's private life, including the names of his children, are generally regarded state secrets.\n\nHere's what we know so far about Kim Jong Un's daughter.\n\nHer real name was never revealed by state officials or outlets.\n\nThe first person to acknowledge the existence of Kim Jong Un's daughter was NBA player Dennis Rodman, who developed a relationship with the North Korean leader during his 2013 visit to Pyongyang.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian, he revealed that Kim Jong Un and his wife Ri Sol Ju had a baby.\n\n\"I held their baby, Ju-ae, and spoke with Ms. Ri as well. He's a good dad and has a beautiful family. Kim told me, 'I'll see you in December,'\" Rodman told the outlet.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Radio Free Asia, local governments in the cities of Jeongju and Yongsong have ordered women named Ju Ae to change the names on their birth certificates — another indication that may confirm the daughter's identity.\n\nThe South Korean National Intelligence Service believes Ju Ae was born around January 2013, according to The Chosunilbo, aging her at around 13 years old.\n\nJu Ae is believed to be the second child, according to the National Intelligence Service.\n\nKim Jong Un and Ri Sol Ju may have had their first child in the summer of 2010 and a third child around the beginning of 2017. Both of their sexes remain unconfirmed.\n\nSouth Korean lawmakers have said they've received tips that the first child may be a boy, CNN reported.\n\nWhen the North Korean state media outlet KCNA released pictures of Ju Ae at the missile testing site, the agency reported that Kim Jong Un was there \"with his beloved daughter and wife.\"\n\nDuring a banquet celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army in February, Rodong Sinmun reported that Kim Jong Un arrived at the lodging quarters with his \"respected daughter\" — a title also conferred on the North Korean leader in the report.\n\nAccording to former CIA officer Andrew Kim, who was involved in diplomatic efforts between the US and North Korea, Kim Jong Un may have made a rare comment about his personal life to the then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo back in April 2018.\n\n\"'I'm a father and a husband. And I have children,\" the former CIA officer recalled Kim Jong Un telling Pompeo. \"'And I don't want my children to carry the nuclear weapon on their back their whole life.' That was his answer.\"\n\nKim Ju Ae was first unveiled to the public in images released by the state media in November 2022.\n\nThe images showed the father-daughter pair touring an intercontinental ballistic missile testing site. A few months later, she was seen, front and center, at official gatherings, including an anniversary banquet for the North Korean army.\n\nThe public display of Kim's daughter is a notable break from tradition as Kim's private life is generally treated as state secrets.\n\nA verified photo of Kim Jong Un wasn't revealed until he was around 26 years old in 2010, a year before the death of his father, Kim Jong Il.\n\nExperts have speculated whether Kim Jong Un was signaling his next successor with the repeated public showings of Ju Ae.\n\nCheong Seong Chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, previously told CNN that the daughter's appearance at the testing site and the state outlet's description of the \"beloved\" daughter could be the latest sign that Kim Jong Un has chosen his next heir.\n\n\"Considering these, there is no longer any doubt that Kim Ju Ae has been appointed as the successor to Kim Jong Un, and it is necessary to pay attention to how this will affect North Korea's domestic and foreign policies in the mid- to long-term, and how North Koreans will accept the succession of the fourth generation,\" Cheong said.\n\nBut Duyon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, DC, warned that it's too early to draw conclusions.\n\n\"We can only speculate at this point,\" Kim told The Associated Press,\"(Kim Jong Un is) obviously showing her off intentionally and, at a minimum, he seems to be trying to reiterate the importance, status, and legitimacy of a direct Kim bloodline offspring. It's too soon to assume that she will be his heir because the son has always succeeded the throne in North Korea.\"\n\nThere has been speculation about Kim Jong Un's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, being a potential contender.\n\nCurrently, Kim Yo Jong serves as the only woman on the State Affairs Commission, North Korea's policy-making body.\n\nThe South Korean National Intelligence Service previously said in 2020 that the sister could be the country's \"de facto second in command,\" CNN reported, citing Kim Byung-kee, a South Korean parliament member who attended a briefing with the agency at the time.\n\nDavid Straub, a former senior diplomat at the US embassy in Seoul, told The Daily Beast that Kim Jong Un's recent flaunting of his daughter may be a troubling sign for the leader's sister if he truly is considering putting Ju Ae at the top of the hierarchy.\n\n\"Kim had both his uncle and his half-brother murdered,\" Straub told the outlet, referring to Kim Jong Nam, who was assassinated in Malaysia in 2017 with a chemical nerve agent. Kim Jong Nam was widely considered to be the next leader of North Korea after Kim Jong Il.\n\n\"I'll bet everyone in the Kim clan remembered, perhaps especially Yo Jong,\" Straub said.",

    "description": "Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses could be equipped with facial recognition, and an internal memo reportedly says we're all too distracted to care.",
    "fullText": "Since Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses launched in 2021, there's always been a lingering, controversial question about whether they could be used for facial recognition.\n\nThe question has surfaced again more recently, according to a New York Times report on Friday. And this time, the story says, there's a reason the company thinks it could add facial recognition without kicking up too much of a fuss: because we're all busy worried about so many other things going on in the world.\n\nIt's not clear whether Meta will follow through on the plans. \"While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature — and some products already exist in the market — we're still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out,\" Erin Logan, a Meta spokesperson, told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nSince their launch, the Meta Ray-Ban glasses have been a surprise hit, with Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica saying it tripled sales in 2025 and is struggling to keep up with demand.\n\nIn 2024, some Harvard students rigged Meta Ray-Bans to perform facial recognition by sending camera photos to a third-party service for scanning. At the time, Meta was adamant that people understand the glasses themselves weren't performing facial recognition, and that this wasn't a capability of the device itself. Which was true, but a truth somewhat orthogonal to the public horror about the idea of people using facial recognition glasses in public.\n\nThus far, legal and privacy issues surrounding facial recognition, not technical limitations, have kept the feature at bay. So what's changed?\n\nThe New York Times viewed a document that gives us a clue:\n\nThis is straight out of the playbook for a celebrity announcing their divorce during the Super Bowl to minimize attention. Basically, at least one person at Meta was apparently considering the fact that — waves hands — so many other horrors are going on in the world that people will be too distracted to focus on this.\n\nAnd what, exactly, might this unnamed Meta person be assuming are the \"other concerns\" keeping civil society groups' resources focused? I have some ideas:\n\nFrankly, any of these is a big enough distraction to keep me from complaining about facial-recognition glasses!",

    "title": "Gary Marcus calls out viral AI essay as alarmist 'hype'",
    "description": "AI researcher Gary Marcus said Matt Shumer's viral essay, \"Something Big Is Happening,\" oversells the current capabilities of AI models.",
    "fullText": "If that viral essay about AI had been printed on paper, there's a good chance AI researcher Gary Marcus would've ripped it up in disgust.\n\nMarcus acknowledges something is happening in AI — just nowhere near the scale described in the recently viral essay, which predicted a looming disruption \"worse than COVID.\"\n\nMarcus, who on X criticized the essay written by entrepreneur and investor Matt Shumer as having \"not a shred of actual data,\" dismissed its contents as alarmist in an interview with Business Insider.\n\n\"Hyped-up views have gotten us into a bad place, possibly one that's going to lead to a serious economic recession or something like that,\" Marcus told Business Insider. \"And I guess I think that one should work from the facts rather than just trying to cause an alarm.\"\n\nIn his essay titled \"Something Big is Happening,\" Shumer, whose past startup sells a subscription-based AI-assisted writing tool, warned that AI would upend not just software engineering, but most jobs done \"on a screen.\" Shumer also has a small VC fund.\n\nMarcus said that while AI will replace some labor and affect jobs, the process will be much slower than what Schumer and others are describing.\n\nAI can do some things well and help speed up work, but it's just not near the point of replacing humans, Marcus said.\n\n\"AI can do a small subset of the tasks, and that sometimes speeds up human beings and things like that, but it rarely does all of what a human being can do in any particular domain,\" he told Business Insider. \"This will change over time, just to be clear. It is likely that AI will replace most human labor over the next century, but it's not likely that it will over the next year or two.\"\n\nCompanies that move too quickly to replace jobs with AI are likely to find themselves in a similar position as Klarna, Marcus said. In 2024, Klarna touted an AI assistant that could do the equivalent work of 700 people. By May 2025, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, long a proponent of AI, said that \"as cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality.\" He added that \"investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.\"\n\n\"Six months or a year later, they come back with their tails between their legs because it turns out that the AI systems don't do things as well as the human,\" Marcus said. \"So, I'm not saying that there's nothing going on. I'm not saying that there's no value in these AI systems, but they're premature.\"\n\nKlarna told Business Insider that the number of its customer service queries handled by AI has increased \"as it gets better at more complex requests,\" and the company \"has not reversed or scaled back its AI strategy.\"\n\nMarcus said that the more likely outcome in the short-term is not that AI will replace junior employees but rather that executives think it's capable of doing so — and make what could ultimately prove to be a costly gamble.\n\n\"The biggest thing I think junior people have to worry about right now is a misapprehension by the C-suite that these techniques work better than they actually do,\" Marcus said.\n\nAs of Friday morning, Shumer's post has been viewed more than 80 million times on X alone. In a Substack post expanding on his criticisms, Marcus called Schumer's post \"weaponized hype.\"\n\n\"The general impression that he conveys is basically that the sky is falling now, and at most, I think what's really happening is the junior people are under some threat, and I think that threat is actually exaggerated,\" Marcus told Business Insider.\n\nShumer previously told Business Insider that he wrote his essay in part to reach people like his dad, who may be skeptical or avoid AI entirely. He felt compelled to warn them about what might be on the horizon, even \"if there's just a 20% chance of it happening.\"\n\nMarcus's biggest critique of Schumer's post is that it doesn't take into account current data and research showing that AI still has a long way to go, and that it didn't present the full context behind a famous Model Evaluation & Threat Research graph assessing AI progress.\n\nHe said that other studies, including a June 2025 paper published by Apple's Machine Learning Research Group, found limitations in what current models can do.\n\nMarcus also said that many leading AI CEOs who have made bold predictions about the future of work have failed to deliver on past ones. He points to xAI CEO Elon Musk's frequent rosy outlook on the number of robotaxis Tesla will put on the road (Musk once said one million by 2020) and to Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton's 2016 statement that the world should stop training radiologists. (Last May, Hinton told The New York Times that his prediction was poorly worded and that while he was wrong on the timeline, the general direction for AI's capabilities in radiology was correct.)\n\n\"What they have all learned to do is to sell the rosiest picture possible, and the media rarely calls them out,\" Marcus told Business Insider.\n\nOn Thursday, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman made waves by predicting that most, if not all, white-collar tasks could be automated within the next year and a half.\n\nOne of the industries Suleyman mentioned is accounting. Marcus isn't convinced.\n\n\"Think about accounting in particular,\" he told Business Insider. \"Even one mistake can cost a client hundreds of thousands of dollars or get them sent to jail or whatever. Accounting is a business that is built on accuracy. If you're not accurate, you don't have a business.\"",

    "title": "I used to be proud of only sleeping 3 hours because I worked so much. Now I realize health is freedom, not wealth.",
    "description": "After years of extreme work and little sleep, a founder explains how health data revealed hidden risks and pushed him to rethink success.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tyler Smith, founder of Hundred Health. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI used to brag about how little sleep I got. It felt like a superpower: I could sleep just three or four hours a night, and still operate at a very high level.\n\nThat helped me get ahead early on. As a teen, I bused tables and sold firewood. By the time I was 19, I bought a house (which was possible because it was the subprime mortgage days). Having a mortgage gave me real responsibility at a young age.\n\nIt also got me thinking about a career. I couldn't believe how much my real estate agent made on the sale. Her commission was about $13,000 — which seemed like $1 million to me at the time — and I thought she didn't do a very good job. I realized that if I did good work in real estate, I could make even more.\n\nI dropped out of college to get into real estate. During the financial crisis, I found a niche helping banks sell foreclosures. In 2006 and 2007, I oversaw about 1,000 home sales a year and managed triple that number of properties.\n\nI was working 14-hour days, seven days a week. It wasn't a good life, but I was young enough that it didn't matter. I fueled myself on energy drinks and embraced the fact that work was my life.\n\nTo help scale, I developed software to track my business's transactions. Other brokerages inquired about what I was using, and soon I had clients paying $2,000 or $5,000 a month to use the software.\n\nI was in the right place at the right time with the right product as real estate transactions went digital. By 2012, that software, SkySlope, was doing $12 million in annual revenue. In 2017, Fidelity bought a majority stake, valuing the company at more than $80 million.\n\nThat deal meant that I had enough money to never work again. I'm wired to build, though, so I planned to use my financial freedom to focus on something with purpose: a mission-driven business.\n\nWhen I was 39, my wife and I were trying to have a child. I took a biological age test, which said my biological age was 47. That stopped me in my tracks, because my own father had died suddenly of a heart attack at 47.\n\nThe test showed me that what I was telling myself wasn't true. I was working out and eating relatively healthy. I looked fit, but the data showed that what was happening inside my body didn't match what was on the outside.\n\nOnce I saw that data, I couldn't ignore it. I spent well over six figures hiring a top-notch healthcare team. My wife and I rented a 2,000 square-foot unit in Sacramento, which we transformed into our own personal wellness center. It had IV infusions, a hyperbaric chamber, a red light bed, cold plunges, massagers — basically anything you can name in the health and fitness world.\n\nWe were building a home in Napa and wanted to know which equipment we would actually use. We spent about $700,000 fitting out the Sacramento space, and eventually over $1 million building the wellness center in our home.\n\nToday, I use the red light bed, oxygen therapy, and cold plunge almost daily. Other therapies — like massagers and bikes — didn't make the final cut. I love the results of the hyperbaric chamber, but don't like lying in it for an hour, so for now, that's out of rotation.\n\nI changed everything about my health and fitness, and because of that, everything in my life changed: my muscle mass and energy levels went through the roof, and my mood improved. I felt better than ever, and friends began to notice.\n\nI know not everyone has the money and access I do. Most people have more data about their health than ever due to smart watches and wearable monitors, but they don't have a team of doctors helping them use that information.\n\nI started Hundred Health not only to provide data, but also to offer a personalized plan for what to do with it. I used to think that wealth was freedom, but now I know that health is — and I would like to help more people access that.",

    "description": "Get your hands on the latest Kindle Paperwhite for much cheaper.",
    "fullText": "Presidents' Day sales are around the corner, and the deals are coming in early; right now, Amazon has the latest Kindle Paperwhite from 2024 in \"Like-New\" conditions for $114.99 (originally $143.99). This Paperwhite in new condition would cost you $159.99, making the refurbished version a much cheaper choice to get while it lasts (discounted Kindle Paperwhites usually sell out quickly).\n\nThe Kindle Paperwhite is the most popular reading tablet from Amazon, and it's the best for most people, according to PCMag's \"outstanding\" review. It offers many improvements over the 11th-generation version from 2021—mainly a larger seven-inch display and a much faster boost in performance. It still retains all of the great attributes that made the previous version great, like a fully waterproof design with an IPX8 rating, enough storage to hold more than 10,000 books, and unlimited cloud storage. If you want an ad-free experience with some better features, get the Signature Edition.\n\nIf you're not sure if this is the right Kindle for you, check out the Colorsoft version—it offers color, so it can make reading manga or comics more lively. We also have a breakdown of every kind of Kindle to help you decide. If you already own the 11th generation, there might not be enough here to warrant an upgrade, unless you just want the latest Amazon has to offer. However, any devices older than that may be worth an upgrade for features like Bluetooth compatibility, which is great for audiobooks.\n\nThe screen features a 300 ppi (pixels per inch) display with 16 levels of background lighting, and optional warm lighting as well. I use this feature to read before bed and not strain my eyes. I also love the absurdly long battery life. This one is estimated at up to 12 weeks on a single charge, depending on your use and brightness settings.",

    "title": "The Easiest (and Cheapest) Ways to Turn Your Attic Into Useful Storage Space",
    "description": "Finishing an attic is expensive and time-consuming, but if all you need is a little extra storage, it's not necessary.",
    "fullText": "If you own a home with an unfinished attic, you’ve probably thought about all that precious space and how you might make it more useful. Your attic already serves an important purpose in temperature and moisture regulation in the house, of course, but that doesn’t mean it can’t do more. If you’ve got the budget, you can transform an attic into a bedroom or office space, or a crisp, well-lit storage option.\n\nIf you don’t have the budget to really build out your attic, though, you can still make it into a more useful space, even if it’s small or slightly scary. With just a few modest purchases (and possibly some sweat equity), you can make your attic an ideal storage space.\n\nYour first step towards making your attic useful is to make it safe to walk around. Even if your attic is shallow and standing up straight is impossible, having a stable surface will reduce your chances of falling through the ceiling.\n\nPutting down plywood or oriented strand board (OSB) is a cheap and relatively easy option, but it’s also labor-intensive and pretty permanent. If you want a faster solution, floor panels like these from Attic Dek are sized to fit most standard joist spacings and are designed to just snap together, allowing you to quickly drop a floor into place without needing to cut them. They come with screws, and it’s a good idea to secure them in place, but if you just need a temporary floor that can bear weight (up to 250 pounds) you can just click them into place and bolt them down later.\n\nIf your attic isn’t wired up or lacks light fixtures, you don’t need to hire an electrician and spend a mountain of cash. Just pick up one or two of these rechargeable ceiling lights and stick them to the ceiling or overhead joist (literally—you place a magnetic sticker on the ceiling and that holds the light in place—no screws required). It’s motion-activated, so every time you haul yourself up into the attic, the light will come on and save you from stumbling about in the dark.\n\nOnce you have a sturdy, safe floor in your attic, you can start installing storage options. You could, of course, just pile up some boxes or bins and call it a day, but you can do a lot better than that without breaking the bank:\n\nInstalling some hanging rods designed for slanted surfaces (like an attic ceiling or rafters) will give you the option of hanging clothing or storage bags without cluttering up the floor.\n\nA few cheap, adjustable shelving units like this one can add all the shelf space you need to keep bins of stuff organized and off the floor, making it easy to store or retrieve items.\n\nIf your attic is tight and trusses make it difficult to store anything, you can install some truss-friendly shelving. This can be a relatively easy DIY job involving screwing some support brackets into the trusses (as seen here). If you don’t have a floor in your attic, you have to avoid placing heavy storage boxes or bins directly on insulation—compressed insulation isn’t very effective. You can purchase some truss brackets that support plastic bins or other storage boxes off the floor.\n\nOnce you’ve got storage, you need a way to get stuff up into the attic, which can be more challenging than you expect. Carrying awkward, heavy boxes up flimsy, pull-down attic stairs is a recipe for accidents, so consider rigging up some mechanical assistance. You can spend a fair amount of money on a fancy lift system that will make bringing stuff up to your attic pretty easy, but if that’s too rich for your blood, you could opt for a simpler winch system that will allow you to haul up to 440lbs of stuff up there at a time. If that’s still a little too much, you could also opt for a classic pulley system, using good old-fashioned mechanical advantage to get your stuff up into the attic.",

    "fullText": "There isn’t that much of a difference between OpenAI and Anthropic. Both are big foundational AI companies. Both have changed how we think about information, code, and work. Both have very similar valuation metrics. Heck, both even have the same investors. One is chasing growth, margins, and building a real business. The other is chasing astronomical destiny. One is a consumer company with 800 million daily users. The other is an enterprise-focused company selling to businesses. The key difference is that one is focused and the other is doing way too many things.\n\nThe real story is that Anthropic, despite its woo-woo ideas about the future, AI ethics, and post-AI morality, is on its way to building up a real money machine. So what can we learn from Anthropic’s recently announced funding? The company raised a whopping $30 billion at a self-disclosed valuation of $380 billion. If you look at the chart, you can see the valuation multiples are surprisingly close. Scratch the surface, and spot the differences.\n\nHere is what stood out to me and why it matters.\n\nHighlights from the Anthropic press release:\n\nWhat’s more interesting is that Anthropic projects positive cash flow by 2027. OpenAI projects $14 billion in losses in 2026 alone, cumulative losses of $115 billion through 2029. Anthropic simply needs to keep doing what it’s already doing. \n\nIf anything Anthropic’s press release also makes it clear that the two companies couldn’t be more different. OpenAI in comparison has 800 million users. Impressive. But since only about 5 percent pay, it needs to monetize through advertising. And since they are building their own infrastructure, OpenAI needs to raise even more money.\n\nMuch as I would like to believe Anthropic’s press release, I am old school. Big numbers deserve to be questioned.\n\nI am pretty certain Anthropic will be asked these, or somewhat similar, questions when they go on the roadshow for the IPO. Anthropic’s decision to release these numbers in its fundraising press release is indicative of their seriousness about going public. Why does this matter beyond the numbers?\n\nWhoever goes public first sets the standard.\n\nAnthropic has already hired Wilson Sonsini to advise on an IPO. If it files first, it puts real numbers in an S-1. Revenue mix, margins, cost of compute, path to profitability. Public markets care about these things in ways that private rounds do not. Every analyst covering OpenAI’s eventual offering will use Anthropic as the yardstick. This will be a problem not just for OpenAI but for everyone else selling AI to businesses.\n\nI use both products. I pay them both the max amount of money as an individual and I find value in both of them. At present, if I was forced to pick one, I would go with Anthropic. But that is for now. I am not very loyal to one or the other. If OpenAI was doing better for me, guess which chatbot will stay open longer, and which API will get more use? But in the first quarter of 2026, Anthropic seems the best-positioned company in a race where the finish line keeps moving. Elon is having a hissy fit over their funding. That tells you who is the leader. OpenAI is burning cash like a Concorde burned fuel.\n\nWelcome to 2026, when AI’s big boys have to start wearing their big boy pants and show their true worth.",

    "description": "Growing opposition to vaccines in the U.S., driven by recent government policy changes, makes it difficult to see a return on investment in vaccine development, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said this week.",
    "fullText": "Moderna is scaling down its investments in vaccine development as the U.S. market grows increasingly hostile to immunizations, CEO Stéphane Bancel told Bloomberg News at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n“You cannot make a return on investment if you don’t have access to the U.S. market,” Bancel told Bloomberg, noting that high-level headwinds have made the vaccine market “much smaller.” In particular, the CEO pointed to regulatory roadblocks and diminishing support from health authorities as key problems for Moderna and the vaccine space more broadly.\n\nMoving forward, Bancel told Bloomberg that Moderna will no longer put money into late-stage vaccine studies, though it remains unclear if the CEO was speaking of all vaccines or just those for infectious diseases.\n\nIn a note to investors on Thursday, analysts at Jefferies said Bancel “seems inclined to develop [Moderna’s] Phase III vaccines in oncology/rare diseases,” particularly in high-risk patient populations, while “potentially deprioritizing its pre-Phase III vaccines for infectious diseases.” There are at least 11 of these infectious disease programs that could be put on the back-burner, the analysts noted.\n\nVaccines, Jefferies added, “still have one of the highest ROIs.”\n\nOverall, deprioritizing its infectious disease programs “could help [Moderna] trim costs at a faster clip, providing great visibility to 2028 cash breakeven guide,” Jefferies said.\n\nSince Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. took leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services in February 2025, he has enacted a stream of policies that have made immunization less accessible to Americans and curtailed the industry’s ability to develop new vaccines.\n\nIn May last year, for instance, Kennedy officially removed COVID-19 from routine immunization guidelines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women. Then, last August, he scrapped 22 mRNA vaccine research projects, including contracts with major developers such as Pfizer, Sanofi, AstraZeneca and Moderna.\n\nKennedy has additionally put in position officials who have also thrown up vaccine roadblocks. One key lieutenant, for instance, is CBER Director Vinay Prasad, who last month penned an internal FDA memo claiming that at least 10 children had died “because of” COVID-19 vaccines. Prasad has yet to provide evidence for this claim, and an internal safety review from the FDA stated that the figure is likely overblown.\n\nAt the CDC, Kennedy in June unilaterally emptied the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, before reforming it over the next couple of months with known vaccine critics.\n\nBancel joins Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla in criticizing Kennedy and his “anti-science” policies. Also at Davos, Bourla earlier this week referred to HHS’ vaccine policies as “almost like a religion.”\n\nModerna, which has weathered successive quarters of declining earnings, has been heavily affected by these policy headwinds. In May, the company withdrew the approval application for its combination vaccine for flu and COVID-19. Weeks later, Moderna lost a government bird flu contract potentially worth more than $760 million after HHS terminated the project.\n\nIn the months that followed, Moderna implemented a number of measures to slow its cash burn. These include a 10% workforce reduction in July and the discontinuation of three mRNA vaccines in November.",

    "title": "No, a Sauna Isn't a Substitute for Exercise",
    "description": "A sauna also cannot detox you or melt your fat away.",
    "fullText": "Spending time in a sauna can feel good, but it can also entail a little bit of suffering; after all, if the weather outside were the same as the temperature in a sauna, you’d probably want to hide out in the air conditioning all day. There’s something about unpleasant bodily experiences that makes us think they must be good for us, somehow, and so the sauna has gained a healthful reputation that it doesn’t entirely deserve. Here’s a rundown of what a sauna can and can’t do for you.\n\nIt is technically true that you can lose weight by sitting in a sauna, but that’s not because your body is torching fat; it’s because you’re sweating, and sweat is made of water, and water weighs something. As soon as you rehydrate—which you should—the scale will go right back to where it was at the beginning. After all, as I've discussed in the context of exercise, sweating doesn’t mean that you got a good workout or that you burned calories. It just means you were hot.\n\nPeople who sell saunas and sauna services like to talk up their calorie-burning benefits, but there’s no evidence to suggest you burn significantly more calories sitting in a hot room than you would sitting on your couch at home. Some more skeptical websites cite a modest figure of 1.5 to 2 times as many calories as you would burn sitting at room temperature, but without a citation. If true, that’s about the same as the difference between sitting and standing—so you can skip that trip to the sauna and just spend half an hour standing around.\n\nSo why does your fitness tracker say you burned a ton of calories in the sauna? First of all, don't bring your phone in the sauna, it's bad for the battery. But since you did anyway, I'll explain. The calorie-burning algorithms on your watch are built to estimate your calorie burn from your heart rate under the assumption that you are exercising. If your heart rate increases but you are not exercising, the calculations aren't correct. The calorie burn during exercise comes from the fact that muscles all over your body are contracting over and over again. That is simply not what's happening when you sit in the sauna.\n\nIt’s 2026 and we as a society should be over this “detox” concept, which has been debunked time and time again. Ordinary inconveniences like being tired sometimes aren’t due to some secret toxins that are constantly poisoning you, and even if you do have health issues due to toxins, you should seek medical treatment and not expect smoothies or saunas to cure you.\n\nSaunas and exercise both heat up your body and make you sweat, but there aren’t many similarities aside from that. Remember, exercise makes us stronger and improves our cardiovascular endurance (giving us a higher VO2max, for example). Sweating in a hot room doesn’t do that.\n\nEven this rundown from an exercise science researcher, whose headline draws parallels between running and sitting in a sauna, includes the following disclaimer: \"Before you contemplate cancelling your gym membership and investing the savings in a Jacuzzi, know that regular saunas or baths are unable to replicate all the health benefits of exercise training, such as promoting fat loss and increasing muscle mass. Using hot baths or saunas shouldn’t be considered as a substitute for exercise.\"\n\nWhat that researcher does point out, after the disclaimer, is that there are a few lesser-known benefits of exercise that seem to be related to the increase in body heat and heart rate, rather than from the more obvious strain on our lungs or muscles.\n\nWhen your body temperature rises, blood vessels near the surface of your skin dilate (get wider) and this process may help cell growth and repair. In other words, simply raising body temperature may be good for your blood vessels. That's not something we normally think about, but healthy blood vessels are a part of a healthy cardiovascular system.\n\nIf you find saunas relaxing—and many of us do—that can be a health benefit in itself. Now, this isn’t as concrete a benefit as it’s sometimes made out to be. You’re not going to cure your depression or reverse your heart disease just by relaxing in a sauna every now and then. But if you enjoy your sauna sessions, they could certainly contribute to lowering your stress levels and improving your mental health. Pro tip: If you don't have access to a sauna, a hot bath may have a lot of these effects as well.\n\nFor other medical conditions and athletic uses, the pros and cons of a sauna come down to the pros and cons of heat itself. If you have sore muscles, heat often feels good, so athletes often enjoy sauna sessions.\n\nSome skin conditions respond well to the dry air of a sauna, while others can be exacerbated by dry air but could feel better with the humid air of a steam room. Use common sense and check with your medical provider if you want to use a sauna to manage a health condition.\n\nIf we’re talking about health benefits, it’s only fair to discuss risks as well. Saunas are reasonably safe, but people with medical conditions are often advised to steer clear, or to talk to a doctor before deciding to spend time in a sauna. This may include you if you are pregnant, have unusually high or low blood pressure, have epilepsy, or are taking stimulants, tranquilizers, or mind-altering drugs. Spending time in a sauna has also been linked to temporarily lowered fertility because heat impairs the production of sperm.\n\nThe main danger of a sauna is that you could overheat or dehydrate; severe heat illness and dehydration can both be life threatening, and people have died in saunas. Alcohol makes you more susceptible; half of the people who died in saunas, according to a Finnish study, were under the influence of alcohol. (The authors argue that the biggest danger is not alcohol itself, but allowing a drunk person to be in a sauna alone.) So if you choose to spend time in a sauna, be smart about it. Hydrate well, don’t go alone, and don’t expect the sauna to do things that saunas can’t do.",

    "description": "Some users are not happy.",
    "fullText": "They actually did it. OpenAI officially deprecated GPT-4o on Friday, despite the model's particularly passionate fan base. This news shouldn't have been such a surprise. In fact, the company announced that Feb. 13 would mark the end of GPT-4o—as well as models like GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini—just over two weeks ago. However, whether you're one of the many who are attached to this model, or you simply know how dedicated 4o's user base is, you might be surprised OpenAI actually killed its most agreeable AI.\n\nThis isn't the first time the company depreciated the model, either. OpenAI previously shut down GPT-4o back in August, to coincide with the release of GPT-5. Users quickly revolted against the company, some because they felt GPT-5 was a poor upgrade compared to 4o, while others legitimately mourned connections they had developed with the model. The backlash was so strong that OpenAI relented, and rereleased the models it had deprecated, including 4o.\n\nIf you're a casual ChatGPT user, you might just use the app as-is, and assume the newest version tends to be the best, and wonder what all the hullabaloo surrounding these models is all about. After all, whether it's GPT-4o, or GPT-5.2, the model spits out generations that read like AI, complete with flowery word choices, awkward similes, and constant affirmations. 4o, however, does tend to lean even more into affirmations than other models, which is what some users love about it. But critics accuse it of being too agreeable: 4o is at the center of lawsuits accusing ChatGPT of enabling delusional thinking, and, in some cases, helping users take their own lives. As TechCrunch highlights, 4o is OpenAI's highest-scoring model for sycophancy.\n\nI'm not sure where 4o's most devoted fans go from here, nor do I know how OpenAI is prepared to deal with the presumed backlash to this deprecation. But I know it's not a good sign that so many people feel this attached to an AI model.\n\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "description": "Attackers are impersonating ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok.",
    "fullText": "AI-powered browser extensions continue to be a popular vector for threat actors looking to harvest user information. Researchers at security firm LayerX have analyzed multiple campaigns in recent months involving malicious browser extensions, including the widespread GhostPoster scheme targeting Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. In the latest one—dubbed AiFrame—threat actors have pushed approximately 30 Chrome add-ons that impersonate well-known AI assistants, including Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and \"AI Gmail.\" Collectively, these fakes have more than 300,000 installs.\n\nThe Chrome extensions identified as part of AiFrame look like legitimate AI tools commonly used for summarizing, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance. But once installed, they grant attackers wide-ranging remote access to the user's browser. Some of the capabilities observed include voice recognition, pixel tracking, and email content readability. Researchers note that extensions are broadly capable of harvesting data and monitoring user behavior.\n\nThough the extensions analyzed by LayerX used a variety of names and branding, all 30 were found to have the same internal structure, logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure. Instead of implementing functionality locally on the user's device, they render a full-screen iframe that loads remote content as the extension's interface. This allows attackers to push changes silently at any time without a requiring Chrome Web Store update.\n\nLayerX has a complete list of the names and extension IDs to refer to. Because threat actors use familiar and/or generic branding, such as \"Gemini AI Sidebar\" and \"ChatGPT Translate,\" you may not be able to identify fakes at first glance. If you have an AI assistant installed in Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner, and search for the ID below the extension name. Remove any malicious add-ons and reset passwords.\n\nAs BleepingComputer reports, some of the malicious extensions have already been removed from the Chrome Web Store, but others remain. Several have received the \"Featured\" badge, adding to their legitimacy. Threat actors have also been able to quickly republish add-ons under new names using the existing infrastructure, so this campaign and others like it may persist. Always vet extensions carefully—don't just rely on a familiar name like ChatGPT—and note that even AI-powered add-ons from trusted sources can be highly invasive.",

    "description": "Booing at football is an accepted part of the game. It's been around since time began, but are fans increasingly booing their own team?",
    "fullText": "Booing at football is an accepted part of the game. It's been around since time began, as normal now as pre-match pints and half-time pies.\n\nFor players and match officials it is what they have come to expect at some point in their careers. But are fans booing their own team and manager more nowadays? And if so, why?\n\nThis season we've seen some high profile examples in the Premier League, most notably with Thomas Frank on the receiving end of disgruntled Spurs fans.\n\nBefore his seemingly inevitable sacking the Dane was booed by home supporters once again - Tuesday's 2-1 defeat by Newcastle proving to be the final straw.\n\nWith Tottenham having won just two of their past 17 league matches, Frank himself acknowledged he understood the frustration of fans in one of his final interviews.\n\n\"I understand the frustration, I also understand the easiest thing is to point at me.\"\n\nFrank is not alone. Arne Slot and his players have had similar treatment at times this season, albeit from a much smaller number of the Liverpool faithful.\n\nIt's not just at Premier League games either. In the Women's Super League Brian Sorensen couldn't fail to hear the disgruntlement from sections of Goodison Park as Everton's dismal run of form led to his eventual sacking.\n\nWayne Rooney, who made headlines in 2010 after hitting out at England fans for booing the team, remembers being booed quite a lot in his career.\n\n\"It's always been there. Fans obviously have their opinions and sometimes they're with you and sometimes they're against you,\" he said.\n\n\"It's probably just picked up a little bit more now with more TV cameras, with social media and with phones filming from the stands.\n\n\"Obviously if a player or a player's family is getting abused at stadiums then it can become more of an issue, but generally I think booing is fine.\"\n\nLike his former England team-mate, Joe Hart agrees it's part of the game.\n\n\"You get booed by the away fans,\" said Hart. \"That's kind of par for the course. I've probably received a few from home fans in my time - not many. If I was being booed I was probably doing something wrong!\"\n\nBoth players think booing has always been there. But did it affect them?\n\n\"Maybe it did at the time,\" says Hart. \"I've got no scars from it though, put it that way. I was very much focused on what I was doing so whether I was getting applause or boos it didn't make any difference to how I tried to play the game.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool, Spurs and Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy also remembers difficult moments during his career.\n\n\"At Fulham when we were fighting relegation there were lots of boos,\" he explains. \"You have to take it as a challenge. You have to want to overcome it rather than go the other way and let it affect you, drain your energy and put fear into your play.\n\n\"I always felt like it was a challenge to overcome it, to try and do better. I think if you're playing Premier League football and you're at that level that's your job to do so.\n\n\"We all love it when the fans are singing your name when you've scored the winner or when the team's winning - you can't have just one and not the other.\"\n\nWhy do we boo in the first place? The answer lies in thousands of years of human evolution.\n\nStephen Smith is chair of the British Psychological Society's Division of Sport and Exercise Psychology.\n\n\"We love to believe we are logical, rational animals at the pinnacle of evolution but that's not how we work,\" Smith said. \"85-90% of human decisions are irrational, illogical and completely emotionally driven.\n\n\"When fans boo they make a sound which is guttural and vibrates through the bones, which means it has to be deep. It sounds like a hunting animal and it goes to the heart of our DNA.\n\n\"Emotions feed through a crowd like nothing else. Emotions are infectious. It only needs one or two people to start leading the booing and if someone else starts doing it you want to fit in with the tribe.\n\n\"The emotional part of the brain kicks in and says 'right, I want to display my emotions, the tribe around me are doing it with this behaviour, I'm going to fit in with them'. Booing is the most natural behaviour to show that you're displeased.\"\n\nSmith also thinks the psychological relationship between clubs and fans has changed.\n\n\"Previously there was almost an agreement that existed between fans and the club. They wanted you in to come and support the team, wear the colours and support the boys, but they weren't going to rip you off in terms of the cost.\n\n\"Clubs nowadays have changed that model, that psychological contract between club and fans is broken.\n\n\"They've said 'we're just going to treat you as any other customer, all we're interested in is what you have in your wallet, we're not actually interested in your loyalty to the club'.\"\n\nSo is booing your own team and manager ever justified? The fans we spoke to have mixed feelings.\n\nSpurs supporter Ali Speechly says she would never do it but can understand why some fans do: \"I've booed the ref during the game, but I don't think I've ever booed the manager.\n\n\"I think there's definitely a correlation between ticket prices and booing. When you're spending a lot of money on a product and you're not satisfied with that product then you feel more entitled as a consumer - rather than a fan - of voicing your disappointment and your frustration.\"\n\nFellow Spurs fan Darren Harvey says he would boo if the team was consistently bad.\n\n\"I would tend to feel similar to most other fans and therefore if there was booing and I agreed I'd probably go with it.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like certain things are quite funny to be part of a group and you don't think until afterwards that maybe you shouldn't have done that, you just get carried away in the moment.\"\n\nA Manchester United fan we spoke to is less keen, however: \"I heard the boos at Arsenal when they lost to United and I think they're spoilt fans to be honest.\n\n\"You shouldn't really boo your team, you should stick with them through thick and thin.\"\n\nOne supporter, who wishes to remain anonymous, thinks alcohol and drugs play a role.\n\n\"Because you can't drink, fans get tanked up before they come to the match and that creates more of a problem.\n\n\"I was at the Euros final when England lost to Italy. I witnessed men snorting cocaine right in front of me. The use of alcohol and drugs means fans don't care how they come across.\"\n\nThere is no doubt the mainstream media - including the BBC - plays a role in highlighting booing when it takes place.\n\nIn the case of Frank, the fact a large number of Spurs fans have booed this season is newsworthy and therefore inevitably makes headlines.\n\nSocial media plays a huge role too. Influencers - some with hundreds of thousands of followers - can help to spread a certain narrative.\n\nSpeechly says that probably makes fans more likely to boo: \"On social media, the people who get the most traction are the ones who are spreading negativity.\n\n\"Some people whip up a bit of a frenzy and lots of fans follow these people. They then go into the stadium having read and consumed that narrative online and they're already pre-fuelled with that rage.\"\n\nThis is where it gets tricky. It's difficult, perhaps impossible, to prove whether fans are booing their own team and manager more these days.\n\nCompared with a generation ago it's a safe bet to say booing is talked about more nowadays because of the proliferation of media. It's probably hard for fans to escape all that noise.\n\nLet's get the final word from someone who has been on the receiving end of boos.\n\n\"In an ideal world it makes no sense because if its anything that's likely to affect your players' performance and then affects your team's result why would you do it?\" says Murphy.\n\n\"But we don't live in this idealistic world where everyone is logical. The passion of football fans is what makes the game great.\"\n\nFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you",

    "fullText": "NBA legend Chris Paul has announced his retirement after being released by the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe 40-year-old, widely regarded as one of the sport's greatest point guards, was a 12-time NBA All-Star and 2006 Rookie of the Year.\n\nOne of only seven players to enjoy an NBA career spanning 21 seasons, Paul also helped the United States claim Olympic gold medals in Beijing in 2008 and then four years later in London.\n\n\"This is it! After 21 years I'm stepping away from basketball,\" he posted on Instagram., external\n\n\"Mostly I'm filled with so much joy and gratitude! While this chapter of being an 'NBA player' is done, the game of basketball will forever be ingrained in the DNA of my life.\n\n\"I've been in the NBA for more than half of my life, spanning three decades. It's crazy even saying that.\"\n\nPaul, who was nicknamed the 'Point of God', averaged 16.8 points, 9.2 assists, 4.4 rebounds and two steals a game during a 1,370-game career that started at the New Orleans Hornets in 2005 and effectively ended after a second spell at the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nHe also featured for the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, the Phoenix Suns and the Golden State Warriors, but never played on an NBA championship-winning team.\n\nHe came closest to a gold ring in 2021, when Phoenix reached the NBA finals, only to lose to the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nPaul, who retires second in NBA history for both assists (12,552) and steals (2,728),\n\nhad not played since 1 December, with the Clippers trading him to Toronto earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Senior, Ipape, Hughes, Davis, Lam Goals: Cook 3\n\nTries: Jenkins, Croft Goals: Hankinson 3\n\nLeigh Leopards hit the ground running in Super League with an impressive five-try win against Leeds Rhinos.\n\nAdrian Lam's side took command of the game between teams who finished third and fourth last season as tries from Innes Senior and the outstanding Edwin Ipape had them 10-2 up at half-time.\n\nIn a game where tempers simmered and Leeds' Harry Newman claimed he was the victim of an eye gouge, the Rhinos threatened to get back in the game as prop Cooper Jenkins replied to tries from Jack Hughes and Matt Davis early in the second half.\n\nLachlan Lam put the seal on a convincing win to end Leigh's sequence of four successive defeats against Leeds, for whom Brodie Croft added a flattering late consolation try.\n\nTaylor-Wray stars as Warrington beat St Helens\n\nCatalans kick off 2026 with muddy win over Giants\n\nThe Rhinos went into the game with nine players missing through injury, including reigning Man of Steel Jake Connor, but edged ahead early on as Chris Hankinson's penalty was their reward for sustained pressure as Leigh struggled with the new, stricter interpretation of the ruck rules.\n\nAfter that ragged start, the Leopards burst into life as Ipape broke, Bailey Hodgson injected pace and Lam had the presence of mind to hurl a pass to Senior for a good finish on his Super League debut for the hosts.\n\nIpape was causing havoc and when he led another attack and fed Joe Ofahengaue, the Papua New Guinea international was on hand to grab the offload and force his way over.\n\nAny words of hope from Leeds coach Brad Arthur at half-time quickly dissipated as, from the restart, Riley Lumb dropped the ball and Hughes kicked ahead to score, with Davis adding another as the Rhinos defence again wobbled.\n\nJenkins burst through two tackles to expose the Leigh defence for the first time and score, and with a glimmer of hope Leeds went forward.\n\nNewman furiously claimed his eye had been gouged following a tackle and with tempers fraying he was sin-binned shortly afterwards following a clash, with Davis following him for his part in the melee.\n\nAnother Lumb error handed Leigh territory and Ipape dummied to go right, switched left, and Lam gathered his pass and swivelled out of Tom Holroyd's attempted tackle to seal the win, although Croft gave Leeds' travelling support something to cheer late in the game.\n\nLeigh coach Adrian Lam told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\n\"First home game, with a few new faces in our team, so it was important that we won in front of our own fans in a sold-out stadium.\n\n\"The game went in patches depending on how the referee refereed the game, and I'm not a fan of it. There were too many stoppages and I didn't really need to make any changes in the game because we had time-outs, and checking decisions, and six-agains. Just frustrating, but they can influence the outcome quite easily.\n\nOn Lachlan Lam and Adam Cook partnership: \"They're going to be great together. I'm confident it will come good but it will take Adam and any new player coming over roughly 10 weeks to find their feet. I'm pretty excited about what's going to happen between those two.\"\n\nLeeds head coach Brad Arthur told BBC Radio Leeds:\n\n\"I was really happy with our effort, our fight, and thought we had some good periods of physicality, but some detail… two scrappy tries that you can't afford at this time of the year, some red-zone penalties giving teams a leg-out, at times a bit disjointed with the ball.\n\n\"[Missing nine players] takes away some of your cohesion with the ball. Jake [Connor] has been in there the whole time and you take him out and young Browny [George Brown] who last week had to play full-back because we didn't have a full-back when it would have been nice to play him at half last week.\n\n\"They're not excuses, just reasons why, but I said to the group that we kept fighting hard. We weren't at our best with some of the execution.\"\n\nLeigh: Hodgson; Senior, Niu, Brand, Charnley; Cook, Lam; Trout, Ipape, Mulhern, Ha;ton, Alick-Wienke, Ofahengaue\n\nInterchanges: Hughes, Davis, Badrock, Horne, O'Brien.\n\nLeeds: Miller; Lumb, Newman, Hankinson, Hall; Croft, Brown; Jenkins, O'Connor, Holroyd, McDonnell, O'Neill, Watkins.\n\nInterchanges: Nicholson-Watton, Levi, Cassell, Littlewood.",

    "description": "After the announcement that he will manage both Northern Ireland and Blackburn Rovers this season, how will Michael O'Neill juggle two jobs?",
    "fullText": "It's something you normally only see in video games, but Michael O'Neill will manage both club and country for the rest of the season.\n\nThe news that O'Neill would join Blackburn Rovers on a short-term deal until the end of the campaign comes just six weeks before Northern Ireland's World Cup play-off semi-final with Italy.\n\nNorthern Ireland have not featured at a World Cup in 40 years and are underdogs to beat both the Italians, and then either Wales or Bosnia-Herzegovina, to reach the finals.\n\nAt his new role with Blackburn Rovers, his job is to guide the club out of the relegation places in the Championship with 15 games left.\n\nThere's a lot on the line for O'Neill with club and country, so how will he juggle both jobs?\n\nO'Neill to juggle Blackburn & Northern Ireland roles\n\nGeorgia v Northern Ireland to be behind closed doors\n\nNorthern Ireland supporters could be forgiven for having a sense of deja vu, after O'Neill took charge of Stoke City in November 2019 in a deal that was set to have him guide NI into the Euro 2020 play-offs alongside his duties at the Championship club.\n\nHowever, the Covid-19 pandemic pushed the play-offs back and O'Neill's sole focus became Stoke City, until he made a full-time international return in 2022.\n\n\"This opportunity came to light and it was something that appealed to me,\" O'Neill said on his Blackburn opportunity.\n\n\"Having had discussions with the IFA and with Blackburn, we felt it was something that was feasible, and that was the most important thing for both parties.\n\n\"It's something that I believe I'm capable of doing and both parties will benefit from it.\"\n\nHaving so much on the line for both Northern Ireland and Blackburn has left people questioning how he can balance the two responsibilities.\n\nNorthern Ireland fans spokesperson Gary McAllister told BBC Sport that O'Neill's dual role had \"not been well received\" by supporters, but the 56-year-old does not have any concerns.\n\n\"If I felt for one minute it would distract [from the Italy game], I wouldn't have taken the opportunity,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"And I wouldn't have done that to Blackburn Rovers, either. It's important they have my focus.\"\n\nFor O'Neill to make the opportunity work, preparation has been key. He will take over day-to-day training at Blackburn - alongside Damien Johnson, Steven Davis and Phil Jones - and a lot of his groundwork for the World Cup play-off has already been sorted.\n\nO'Neill said he and his team had studied the Italians, which led him to say \"I don't think there will be any surprises\" from Gennaro Gattuso's side, adding he has already been to Bergamo to visit Atalanta's stadium for the fixture.\n\nHe said: \"November to March is a long period of four months which leaves you with a lot of downtime.\n\n\"The reality of the situation is we've done a lot of work on Italy and we've watched them as much as we can watch them.\n\n\"All the preparation is in place for our training base, so really between now and the game in March, I would just be watching games and watching players.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland face Italy on 26 March - just five days after Blackburn Rovers take on Championship leaders Middlesbrough, and O'Neill feels it will be business as usual after that game as he hopes his NI squad come through their final fixtures unscathed by injury.\n\nHe said: \"I know my squad extremely well. I know pretty much the squad that I'll pick for March and I know pretty much the team that I hope to pick in March as well.\n\n\"I'll be sitting in the hotel on 21 March after Blackburn Rovers have played Middlesbrough hoping that my squad's all going to turn up, and that's something that's not in my control.\n\n\"For me, the benefit of being on the grass will sharpen me coming into the games in March, instead of coming in after four months and having to be in the technical area.\n\n\"I don't see really any downside to it.\"\n\nWhile O'Neill will job share until the end of the season, he doesn't feel an international manager could go part time, and the opportunity with Blackburn came about at an ideal time.\n\nNorthern Ireland's last game was against Luxembourg in November, and O'Neill says he has made the most of that time to prepare Northern Ireland for Italy.\n\nFrom next season, the September and October international windows will be combined into a quadruple header.\n\n\"I don't think it's possible to do it on a part-time role, but I think a situation like this is possible to do, or else I wouldn't try to do it,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"I think that it's feasible to do it at this time in the season, but it wouldn't be something that would be feasible to do September, October and November, because you're rolling into the games much quicker.\"\n\nO'Neill added that the four-month gap between World Cup qualifying and the play-off made the opportunity become a reality.\n\nIt all comes back to preparation and organisation.\n\n\"I think the biggest difference [to the Stoke City situation in 2019] is the fact that we're so well prepared already for Italy,\" he said.\n\n\"That gives me comfort then to look at this opportunity.\"\n\nO'Neill has been brought in at Blackburn to save the club from dropping into League One for the first time since 2018.\n\nHowever, success with his club could cause issues on the international stage.\n\nO'Neill has consistently spoken about having Northern Ireland's players playing at the highest level, but a significant number of players will be going up against O'Neill's Rovers to avoid the drop.\n\nAt Sheffield Wednesday, who seem doomed after their points deduction earlier in the season, goalkeeper Pierce Charles has been a positive in a difficult and injury-hit year.\n\nMoving up the table, there is a strong Northern Ireland contingent at Oxford United, with Brodie Spencer, Jamie Donley, Jamie McDonnell and Ciaron Brown.\n\nOne point above Blackburn, Terry Devlin's Portsmouth are also in danger while Isaac Price, who has been such a key player for O'Neill with Northern Ireland, is far from safe at West Brom.\n\nHowever, for O'Neill, he said he isn't \"having that blood on my hands\" and the fate of those clubs lay with their respective managers.\n\n\"At the end of the day, my job is to do the best I can for Blackburn Rovers,\" he said.\n\n\"The lads who manage those respective clubs, their job is to do the best for their clubs as well. I don't think that's an issue at all.\"\n\nO'Neill refused to be drawn on his future beyond the end of the season but said there was no guarantee he would join Blackburn if he kept them in the Championship.\n\nHis comments on the part-time international management rule that out as a long-term option, so his future in the summer will be either club or country, and not both.\n\n\"The agreement is in place as to the end of the season and we're not looking any further than that at this moment in time,\" O'Neill said.\n\nO'Neill is contracted until the end of the Euro 2028 finals, and although he said there is a release clause in his contract, he still harbours ambitions to reach that tournament with Northern Ireland.\n\n\"I'm ambitious as a manager and I want to manage at the highest level I can,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"This is not about leaving Northern Ireland. It's not about that.\n\n\"It's about an opportunity that's been presented to me, which I think I'm capable of doing in the time frame that we've discussed.\"",

    "fullText": "Tries: King, Taylor-Wray, Hopoate, Thewlis Goals: Sneyd 4\n\nTries: Welsby, Sailor, Feldt Goals: Hastings\n\nCai Taylor-Wray put in a breakthrough performance as the young Warrington Wolves full-back inspired his side to an opening night Super League win over St Helens.\n\nThe 19-year-old, filling the boots of Matt Dufty who left the club last month, scored a try from a lung-busting run and was crucial in two more as the Wire earned their win in a fantastic encounter at a sold-out Halliwell Jones Stadium.\n\nToby King slid over the line to put the Wire ahead before Taylor-Wray ran in while Albert Hopoate rounded out the half.\n\nJack Welsby and Tristan Sailor touched down in quick succession as St Helens turned the game on its head but Josh Thewlis hit back to put the shine on a thumping win for the hosts, with Kyle Feldt running in a late consolation shortly before the hooter.\n\nCatalans kick off 2026 with muddy win over Giants\n\nLeigh impress in opening victory over Leeds\n\nKing's opener came after a sustained spell of pressure from the Wire with Hopoate prospering from a wayward goal-line drop-out, with George Williams going on to provide the offload for King to power over the line.\n\nIf that was good, their second try was even better - after picking the ball up deep in his own half, Taylor-Wray raced in from 70 metres and outran Saints full-back Welsby to the line.\n\nTaylor-Wray was in the mix once more as he showed incredible pace to weave his way through the St Helens defensive line as the Wire went on to feed Hopoate through to score at the corner.\n\nSaints thought they had hit back when Welsby went over but, under new rules brought in this season, the try was reviewed by video referee Chris Kendall after the fact despite being given on the field.\n\nUpon viewing the try again, however, Kendall ruled it out having judged that David Klemmer obstructed Kelepi Tanginoa in the build-up and Saints had another chalked off soon after following an Alex Walmsley double movement.\n\nSaints continued their pressure and were rewarded when Welsby dummied Liam Byrne to go over but, as he extended his right arm out during grounding, he suffered what looked to be a painful shoulder injury which ruled him out for the final 20 minutes.\n\nJackson Hastings missed the extras but atoned soon after when he put in a pinpoint kick towards Sailor who dotted down under the posts with ease.\n\nBut Hastings' night got worse soon after when the former Man of Steel and St Helens debutant was sent to the bin for barging into Taylor-Wray shortly after he offloaded for Thewlis to score Warrington's fourth try of the evening.\n\nWarrington Wolves boss Sam Burgess:\n\n\"I think it was a good night all round for the club. It was the biggest crowd for a long time and a sellout. The connection between the club, the team and town has grown over the off-season and I thought the players played with great spirit tonight.\n\n\"I thought Cai had a bit of an indifferent night. He did some amazing things on the ball that we've all seen but there's some parts of his game that he's still young and raw with.\n\n\"He made errors tonight and he's going to make them all year long. We're just going to have to be patient with that. We're happy to see him develop. He's not going to be the finished article just yet but what he does bring is that he's exciting for us. He's a great player to watch and coach.\"\n\n\"I thought we dipped our toe in the water defensively, which is unlike Saints. Maybe you try and have a little think about what the reason for that would be. Maybe it's overconfidence.\n\n\"We came in with a spring in our step to be honest. We were really confident and ultimately I thought Warrington did a really good job. They were more aggressive than us. They were a lot quicker around the ruck.\n\n\"We didn't move quick enough defensively, we didn't put our bodies in front enough. We lost the ruck and you get what you deserve in that respect. Never doubt that the boys would still be fighting and would come out. We had three disallowed tries and came out over the whitewash a couple of times so they kept fighting which is good.\"\n\nWarrington: Taylor-Wray; Thewlis, King, Hopoate, Smith; Williams, Sneyd; Yates, Walker, Byrne, Stone, Harrison, Currie.\n\nInterchanges: Sipley, Crowther, Philbin, Tanginoa.\n\nSt Helens: Welsby; Feldt, Robertson, Macdonald, Cross; Sailor, Hastings; Klemmer, Clark, Delaney, Wright, Whitley, Shorrocks.\n\nInterchanges: Lomax, Walmsley, Host, Dagnall.",

    "fullText": "Wendy’s is closing several hundred U.S. restaurants and increasing its focus on value after a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter.\n\nThe Dublin, Ohio-based company said Friday that its global same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 10% in the October-December period. That was worse than the 8.5% drop expected by analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nU.S. same-store sales fell even further in the fourth quarter. Wendy’s said late last year that it planned to close underperforming U.S. restaurants, but it gave more details about those closures Friday.\n\nWendy’s said it already closed 28 restaurants in the fourth quarter and ended 2025 with 5,969 U.S. locations. It expects to close between 5% and 6% of its U.S. restaurants – or 298 to 358 locations – in the first half of this year.\n\nThose actions come on top of the closure of 240 U.S. Wendy’s locations in 2024. At the time, the 57-year-old chain said many of its locations are simply out of date.\n\nLike McDonald’s, Taco Bell and other rivals, Wendy’s also plans to emphasize value as it tries to win back inflation-weary customers.\n\n“One learning from 2025 around value, we swung the pendulum too far towards limited-time price promotions instead of everyday value,” said Ken Cook, Wendy’s interim CEO and chief financial officer, in a conference call with investors.\n\nIn January, Wendy’s introduced a permanent “Biggie Deals” value menu with three price tiers: $4 Biggie Bites, $6 Biggie Bags and an $8 Biggie Bundle. Cook said Wendy’s also has new products coming this year, including a new chicken sandwich.\n\nWendy's said its revenue fell 5.5% in the fourth quarter to $543 million. That was higher than the $537 million analysts had forecast.\n\nWendy's expressed confidence that its U.S. turnaround plans and international growth will help arrest its sales slide this year. The company said it expects global systemwide sales — which includes sales at both company-owned and franchised restaurants — will be flat this year. Systemwide sales fell 3.5% last year.\n\nWendy's shares rose nearly 5% in mid-day trading Friday.",

We'll savour that.\n\n\"But like we did last time, back burner now for the FA Cup, concentrate on the league.\"\n\nFor star man Ollie Rathbone, the goal is to keep aiming for the stars.\n\n\"The club's on an incredible journey and we just want to keep adding to that,\" Rathbone told BBC Match of the Day Wales.\n\n\"It's another special night, and it's good to get back to winning ways at home.\"\n\nHaving hoped for time to savour Wrexham's progress, Parkinson's ruthless streak swiftly returned to the fore, as it has done so often during his glorious reign at Stok Cae Ras to date.\n\nWhen asked about memorable nights becoming standard, the 58-year-old responded: \"Let's not get too blasé about it, but listen, we've had so many great nights here and we want more.\n\n\"We're greedy, why shouldn't we be?\"\n\nThe Wrexham manager is only too aware that his side have a strong chance of drawing a Premier League team in the fifth round.\n\nAnd while his wish was ultimately for another home tie in the last-16, goal scorer Windass had a different outcome in mind when it comes to Monday's draw.\n\n\"Hopefully not a big team away because you don't touch the ball,\" said Windass.\n\nIt was a disappointing night for the 1,269 away supporters in north Wales as they saw their side fail to register a single shot on target.\n\nKieran McKenna's starting line-up showed 10 changes from the Tractor Boys' 2-1 win at Derby County six days earlier - fully emphasising the Northern Irishman's desire to put his best resources into securing a top two spot in the Championship.\n\nThe Ipswich boss had no regrets over his decision to make wholesale changes as his side remain firmly in the hunt to clinch an immediate return to the top-flight.\n\n\"Look, it was good players coming into the team. When you make a lot (of changes) at the same time, players who have not had a lot of minutes or need minutes, you're not going to be at your absolute best,\" he told BBC Match of the Day Wales.\n\n\"I know the reasons why we've done it. For me, the right reasons for the football club and I believe in the players who came in. The whole group will be stronger for it.\n\n\"We have 16 league games now in a really short space of time and we're going to need all of those boys.\n\n\"We're disappointed for the supporters that we couldn't go through but we'll use the lessons from tonight that will stand us in good stead for the weeks ahead.\"",

    "description": "After Igor Tudor agrees to take charge of Tottenham for the remainder of the season, BBC Sport takes a look at what supporters can expect to see from his side.",
    "fullText": "Igor Tudor has agreed to take charge of Tottenham for the remainder of the season, so what can supporters expect to see from his side?\n\nFollowing his appointment as interim head coach, Tudor's first game in charge will be a significant one as Spurs host north London rivals Arsenal in the Premier League on 22 February.\n\nThat will allow the 47-year-old less than a week to attempt to implement his style of play once the players return to training on Monday - and they could be in for a shock.\n\n\"His style is intense,\" George Boxall, a football journalist based in Marseille, where Tudor managed between 2022 and 2023, tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"The players do a hell of a lot of running. There's lots of intensity, lots of pressing.\n\n\"He is a really strong personality and he could be a good appointment for Tottenham if they feel they need an electroshock.\"\n\nTudor has been out of work since being sacked by Juventus in October 2025 and is set for his first spell in England, after previously taking charge of clubs in Italy, France, Turkey, Croatia and Greece.\n\nHe is tasked, first and foremost, with easing Tottenham's relegation fears, after a 2-1 loss to Newcastle in Thomas Frank's final match on Tuesday left them five points above the bottom three.\n\nHaving earned a reputation as a no-nonsense defender during a playing career in which he won 55 caps for Croatia and made more than 150 appearances for Italian giants Juventus, there is one certain non-negotiable for Tudor as a manager.\n\n\"He asks his players to run a lot. In a previous interview he said 'If you don't run, you don't play',\" says L'Equipe journalist Pierre-Etienne Minonzio.\n\n\"In his one season in Marseille it was always the same way of playing - 3-5-2 - and it was great to watch.\n\n\"It was not easy because Marseille's best player was Dimitri Payet, a very gifted player but not well-known for running, and he didn't play.\n\n\"It was a joke in L'Equipe - if Igor Tudor had Lionel Messi in his squad, Messi would not play!\"\n\nTudor's sole season in France saw Marseille finish third behind Paris St-Germain and Lens, despite surpassing the club's points total from the previous campaign when they finished second.\n\n\"He did pretty well in Ligue 1. What I liked is that he doesn't try to be liked. He is very direct, says what he thinks and doesn't try to be attractive. There is no seduction,\" says Minonzio.\n\n\"It is the same with the players. He keeps his distance and his obsession is to make training intense with a lot of running so they can be physically fit for the game.\"\n\nTudor won back-to-back Serie A titles with Juventus in 2001-02 and 2002-03, also starting in the 2003 Champions League final, which his side lost to AC Milan.\n\nHaving begun his management career with former club Hajduk Split, Tudor had spells with Galatasaray, Udinese, Marseille and Lazio before he replaced Thiago Motta at former club Juventus in March 2025.\n\nInitially appointed as interim head coach, Tudor was given the job full-time after leading Juventus to a fourth-placed finish in Serie A and Champions League qualification.\n\n\"Tudor is an aggressive manager and that is also what he demands from his clubs,\" says Italian football journalist Daniele Verri.\n\n\"A lot of pressing. When he conquers the ball, he goes vertical. Big strong defenders. He likes to play on the wings. But the main characteristic is being aggressive.\n\n\"Juventus brought him in because he was a former player and they wanted Juventus DNA, someone fans could identify with due to his past, being aggressive, vertical, fighting hard.\"\n\nBut, according to Verri, Damien Commoli's arrival as Juventus' general manager that summer led to growing tension.\n\nTudor was sacked after just seven months following an eight-game winless run, leaving The Old Lady eighth in Serie A and 25th in the Champions League's league phase.\n\nHe departed with eight wins in 17 league games for a win rate of 47.1%.\n\n\"Commoli and Tudor never really got on. Tudor wanted more say during the transfer market, he wanted Kolo Muani to stay and that didn't happen,\" says Verri.\n\n\"He kept changing the starting 11 and that brought uncertainty. Tension grew. Tudor criticised what Juventus did in the market during press conferences, and openly criticised the players after the Lazio defeat before he was sacked.\n\n\"After a relatively good start, he lost control of the team and they stopped performing. The fans were obviously not happy, they are used to winning.\n\n\"Juventus never really had the impression they could take the next step with Tudor.\"\n\nAnalysis by BBC Sport senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel\n\nFirst of all, they wanted an interim head coach until the end of the season. And that immediately narrows the field down.\n\nWithin that, the Spurs hierarchy were looking for someone with top level managerial experience who plays attacking football.\n\nAfter reviewing their options, it is understood Spurs felt Tudor fit the bill for a few key reasons.\n\nHe has experience of working at some top European clubs – and managing big name players.\n\nTudor's reputation is for aggressive football with an attacking intent. This element was particularly important to Spurs after criticism of their style of play under Frank.\n\nTottenham are also said to have admired his work improving teams on a short-term basis.\n\nFor example, his Lazio team were unbeaten in the league for his first two months after he joined.\n\nAt Juventus, he lost only one of his first nine games. In his first full season, he was unbeaten for his first eight matches. His downfall came quickly, however, following that run after losing three away games in a week – to Real Madrid, Lazio and Como.\n\nTudor will be an interim manager and it is thought that they will be looking to secure a different, long-term option in the summer.\n\nHowever, like with Michael Carrick at Manchester United, it may well be an intriguing conundrum if he hits the ground running and sustains a good run of form through what is left of the season.\n\nHajduk Split (2013-2015): In charge for 70 games with a points per game (PPG) average of 1.63, winning the Croatian Cup in 2012-13\n\nPAOK (2015-2016): 45 matches with 1.51 PPG\n\nKarabukspor (2016-2017): 21 matches with 1.29 PPG\n\nGalatasaray (2017): 34 matches with 1.79 PPG\n\nUdinese (2018): Four matches with 1.75 PPG\n\nUdinese (second spell, 2019): 21 matches with 1.33 PPG\n\nHajduk Split (second spell, 2020): 18 matches with 1.56 PPG\n\nHellas Verona (2021-2022): 36 matches with 1.47 PPG\n\nMarseille (2022-2023): 48 matches with 1.83 PPG\n\nLazio (2024): 11 matches with 1.91 PPG\n\nJuventus (2025): 24 matches with 1.58 PPG\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "A fan group has condemned homophobic chanting as a \"stain on our game\" after multiple arrests were made during the FA Cup fourth round match between Hull City and Chelsea on Friday.\n\nSpectators were warned over the PA system to stop discriminatory chanting late in the first half of the match at Hull City's MKM Stadium, and that CCTV inside the ground was being monitored.\n\nA second-half update confirmed that action had been taken, including arrests.\n\nThe club did not confirm the number of arrests made. BBC Sport has contacted Humberside police for comment.\n\nAn on-screen message displayed inside the ground read: \"There has been discriminatory chanting from fans inside the stadium. This is unacceptable and must cease immediately.\"\n\nIt comes after Hull City reiterated in a statement on Thursday that \"any chanting of a homophobic, racist or discriminatory nature is entirely unacceptable and will not be tolerated\".\n\nThe club added: \"Any supporter found engaging in such behaviour will face serious consequences, including immediate ejection from the stadium, the possibility of a banning order, and potential criminal prosecution.\"\n\nChelsea Pride, the club's official LGBTQ+ supporter group, said in a statement: \"Tonight, homophobic chanting was once again directed at our supporters. This is utterly unacceptable.\n\n\"We acknowledge that Hull City made stadium announcements, confirmed CCTV was being monitored, and that arrests have been made. Action matters. Accountability matters. Consequences matter.\n\n\"But let us be clear, the fact that this chant is still being heard in 2026 is a stain on our game.\"\n\nPremier League club Chelsea beat their Championship opponents 4-0 to reach the fifth round.\n\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior said he had been unaware of the chanting as he was focused on the game, but added: \"Any discriminatory language in any form about anything is unacceptable, so I hope it gets dealt with.\"\n\nRosenior continued: \"The fourth official mentioned something to me, but I was so focused on the game. I honestly don't know what's happening.\"\n\nHull City manager Sergej Jakirovic said: \"This is not a place for this, for sure, in the stadium and also in public as well. This is not good.\n\n\"The stadium is not a place for that and this is the reason why they have been arrested.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Why Anthony Elanga is loving his time at Newcastle following his £55m move from Nottingham Forest in the summer.",
    "fullText": "Anthony Elanga's eyes light up.\n\nThe Newcastle United forward is talking about the inordinate amount of time he spends in his \"man cave\".\n\nBut you won't find a game console, stocked fridge or pool table in there.\n\nThis is Elanga's recovery room.\n\n\"My partner won't be too happy about that,\" he said. \"But she knows and appreciates it a lot.\n\n\"It's that extra 1% I'm always trying to find. That will pay off. I've always told myself that.\"\n\nSo much so, after completing his £55m move from Nottingham Forest last summer, and finding a home in the North East, Elanga set about kitting out his new house with a gym, hyperbaric chamber, red light therapy bed, sauna, plunge pool and, even, a 3G football pitch.\n\nThe forward works with a strength and conditioning coach, sports therapist and chef, and had a similar set-up during his time at the City Ground, where he had a hand in 18 goals during an injury-free campaign last season.\n\nElanga has not hit such heights for Newcastle yet, but his determination to succeed has been a constant and he put in his best performance for the club in the 2-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday night.\n\n\"There's still so much more to come,\" he vowed.\n\nGreat attitude but goals have dried up - what's happened to Woltemade?\n\nNewcastle confirm £55m signing of Forest winger Elanga\n\nIt has clearly been a period of huge change for Elanga on and off the field.\n\nAs well as joining a new club, the 23-year-old recently became a father for the first time.\n\nIt was the proudest moment of his life.\n\n\"Bringing Blair into this world and raising her here, it's probably the best feeling ever,\" he said.\n\n\"She's a little Geordie who's going to be raised in Newcastle. She's going to have the accent as well, which is nice.\n\n\"I just can't wait for her to be walking around and touching the football, hearing her talk, having her integrate with other kids here in Newcastle. It's hard to describe. I wouldn't change that feeling for the world.\"\n\nBlair's arrival has clearly given Elanga added perspective.\n\nIt has taken the Swede - like so many before him - a little while to adapt to the intensity, structure and detail of life under Eddie Howe.\n\nNot least during a relentless fixture schedule, where there has been little time to physically train in recent months.\n\nFollowing one or two groans from the terraces, it got to the point last month where Howe said that Elanga needed to feel \"safe\" at St James' Park and \"free to express himself\".\n\nThe supporters responded by singing Elanga's name and encouraging him during a brief cameo against PSV Eindhoven just a few days later.\n\nThey did so once again after he scored his first goal for the club versus Manchester City earlier this month, and after he was substituted during the victory at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday night.\n\nNo wonder Elanga took his time to come off the field after he saw his number go up.\n\n\"I made sure to walk even slower,\" he smiled. \"If I could have stayed there, I would have.\"\n\nIt was a night where Howe received the biggest ovation of all from the away end.\n\nThe Newcastle head coach previously admitted he was not doing his job \"well enough\" following a bruising 3-2 defeat against Brentford last week.\n\nIt led to a lot of soul searching behind the scenes, and the players knew they had to step up.\n\n\"We always want to fight for the gaffer because we know what he has done for each and every single one of us as players,\" Elanga said. \"I've been here for seven months, but I've felt like he's improved me so much.\n\n\"There are things people don't see on the training ground, but he's helped me so much it's unbelievable. He was one of the reasons I wanted to come here because I knew he would improve me as a player.\n\n\"Going on the pitch, we always want to fight for him, even more so that game against Tottenham. Yes, we did that but can we do it again, again and again?\"\n\nThat question has repeatedly been asked of this side throughout a rollercoaster campaign.\n\nNewcastle reached a third EFL Cup semi-final in four years, are favourites to progress past Qarabag into the last 16 of the Champions League and have an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Aston Villa to look forward to on Saturday.\n\nBut Howe's side are 10th in the Premier League for a reason.\n\nThey have won just three away games in the top-flight all season, and only relegation-threatened West Ham have dropped more points from winning positions than the Magpies (19).\n\nNewcastle have been desperately searching for a sustained run of form - individually and collectively - and Elanga is the first to admit that he is \"not where I want to be just yet\".\n\nBut the forward lives by the French saying précis pas pressé, which translates as precise not rushed.\n\nHe feels like he \"couldn't ask for a better place\" to develop.\n\n\"I just want the fans to know I'm committed and the rest will naturally follow,\" he said.\n\n\"Every time I pull on that shirt, there will always be heart and desire – every touch, every tackle, running back, running forward.\n\n\"They expect that from the team as well so hopefully we can continue to build, stay consistent with what we do and remain positive because if you do so, I'm sure we will be fine.\"\n\nElanga has already come full circle at Newcastle as he prepares to return to Villa Park, the scene of his debut on the opening day.\n\nThere is a place in the FA Cup fifth round at stake and getting back to Wembley one day is a source of inspiration for Elanga after he watched on from afar as Newcastle ended a 70-year wait for a major domestic trophy by winning the EFL Cup last season.\n\n\"I could see they were building something special,\" he added. \"This group is very unique.\n\n\"It's probably one of the tightest groups I've ever worked with. The togetherness is unreal here. It just shows with what they did last season.\n\n\"I just wanted to be a part of that. I was at Forest last season and on the outside looking in at what they were cooking here at Newcastle. It just made me want to come here.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

I'm committed to big fights only.\n\n\"I'm the champion, this is a voluntary defence, and I chose this.

    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Bob Evans, the chain of family-style restaurants founded and headquartered in central Ohio, has a new owner.\n\nNew York-based investment firm 4×4 Capital announced on Feb. 4 that it has acquired Bob Evans Restaurants. The deal transfers ownership of the 78-year-old brand from San Francisco-based private equity firm Golden Gate Capital. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nBob Evans operates more than 400 restaurants in 18 states and employs more than 15,000 people. The company is based in New Albany and traces its roots to a 12-stool diner opened in 1948 by founder Bob Evans in Gallipolis, Ohio.\n\nDublin keeps Irish Festival ticket prices unchanged for 2026\n\n“We are proud of what we accomplished in partnership with Golden Gate Capital and excited to begin this next chapter with 4×4’s hands-on partnership,” said Mickey Mills, the restaurant chain’s CEO, who will continue to lead the brand. “Together, we look forward to investing in and enhancing our operations, guest experience, and brand.”\n\nGolden Gate Capital purchased Bob Evans in 2017 for $565 million. At the time, the firm split the restaurants from Bob Evans Farms, the brand’s consumer-packaged good business, which was acquired by Post Holdings for $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Golden Gate explored a potential $600 million sale of the restaurant chain, though a transaction did not materialize. Reports in 2024 indicated the company had hired investment bank Kroll to oversee another sale process.\n\n“We are truly grateful to the terrific team at Bob Evans for their strong stewardship of this iconic brand,” said Neale Attenborough, a managing director at Golden Gate. “We wish the team all the best as they enter their next phase of growth.”\n\n‘Love is Blind’ fans buzzing over central Ohio ties\n\nBob Evans boasts itself as a farm-inspired, family-style restaurant brand known for breakfast offerings, such as its Farmer’s Choice Breakfast, and roasted turkey dinners.\n\n4×4 Capital, founded in 2018, focuses on investing in middle-market consumer goods and services companies across North America. The firm said it takes an active ownership approach aimed at accelerating growth and operational performance.\n\n“What truly sets the Bob Evans brand apart is its distinctive hospitality, welcoming ambiance, and fresh, flavorful food — delivering real value for the whole family,” said Gustavo Assumpção, co-founder and partner at 4×4 Capital, who will serve as executive board chair. “We look forward to partnering with Mickey and the team to maximize long-term growth.”",

    "description": "Fox News analyst Andrew McCarthy says Justice Department's failed attempt to charge six Democratic members of Congress amounts to intolerable abuse of power.",
    "fullText": "A conservative lawyer issued a blistering takedown of President Donald Trump’s attempt to prosecute six Democratic members of Congress.\n\nAndrew McCarthy, a Fox News legal analyst and National Review editor, said an effort by the Justice Department to criminally charge the Democrats made another Trump impeachment more likely.\n\nTrump was impeached twice during his first term in office. In each case, he was acquitted on all counts by the Senate.\n\n“The president will be impeached promptly if Democrats retake control of the House after the November midterms, an outcome his abuses of power have also made highly likely,” McCarthy wrote in a column published in the National Review Wednesday.\n\n“That will be the legacy of yesterday’s reported failed attempt by the Trump Justice Department to criminally charge the ‘Seditious Six,’ as the Democrats in question were labeled by Trump supporters.”\n\nMcCarthy personally characterized Trump’s attacks on the six Democrats as “intolerable” and “impeachable.” He wrote that there was “no plausible justification for the proposed indictment” against Sens. Mark Kelly (Ariz.) and Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) and Reps.

    "title": "Hiding pace? Too slow? What pre-season testing told us",
    "description": "BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson assesses what we learnt  - and what we didn't - from the first pre-season test in Bahrain.",
    "fullText": "There were two key talking points at the first of two pre-season tests in Bahrain - whether the new cars were still \"Formula 1\", and the performance of the new Red Bull engine.\n\nFour-time champion Max Verstappen said the revised cars and engines had turned the highest level of motorsport into an exercise in \"management\".\n\n\"As a pure driver, I enjoy driving flat out,\" Verstappen said. \"And at the moment, you cannot drive like that. A lot of what you do as a driver, in terms of inputs, has a massive effect on the energy side of things. For me, that's just not Formula 1.\"\n\nThe reigning world champion Lando Norris did not agree, saying the new cars were \"a lot of fun\" and pointing out that Verstappen was welcome to race somewhere else if he didn't like it.\n\nMercedes' George Russell - who has a tense relationship with Verstappen and a friendly, wind-up one with Norris - was somewhere in the middle.\n\n\"If you've got the best cars for us to enjoy, it doesn't mean it's going to give the best racing,\" said Russell. \"And you can argue potentially the racing will be a bit more chaotic.\"\n\nRed Bull advantage 'pretty scary', says Russell\n\nIf you watched the hour's worth of coverage shown on television at the end of each day, you might have been wondering what all the fuss was about.\n\nThe cars are clearly different in some ways from previous years, but they still look and sound recognisably like F1 cars on a superficial level.\n\nIn the cockpits, though, they are very different, as a consequence of the biggest regulation change in the sport's history.\n\nThe cars, engines and tyres are all built to new rules this year and they are running for the first time on carbon-neutral sustainable fuel.\n\nThe engines are at the heart of the drivers' concerns, whether enjoying the cars or not.\n\nThe cars are energy starved - the electrical part of the engine now produces about half its total power, while the batteries are about the same size as last year.\n\nThe various ways of recovering the energy so it can be deployed to maximum lap-time effect are changing the traditional sense of what being a racing driver is about.\n\nThe demand for energy recovery is forcing teams to run the electrical motors against the engines along the straights and in the corners.\n\nThat means the engines have to rev high in the corners, so drivers are using lower gears. As Russell pointed out, drivers have to take the corners in ways that maximise energy use over a lap, rather than simply go as fast as they can at all times. As a consequence, they will not always be on the limit of grip.\n\nVeteran Fernando Alonso, a two-time world champion who is regarded by his peers with the highest possible levels of respect, said the team's chef could drive his car around Turn 12, so far below the limit was he in the attempt to save electrical energy.\n\n\"Here in Bahrain, Turn 12 has historically been a very challenging corner,\" Alonso said, referring to an uphill right-hand sweep towards the end of the lap.\n\n\"You used to choose your downforce level to go Turn 12 just flat. So you remove downforce until you are in Turn 12 just flat with new tyres and then in the race. So it was a driver skill, decisive factor to go fast in a lap time.\n\n\"Now in Turn 12 we are, like, 50km/h slower because we don't want to waste energy there and we want to have it all on the straights.\n\n\"So to do Turn 12 at 200km/h instead of 260, you can drive the car, the chef can drive the car at that speed.\n\n\"So I understand Max's comments. But at the same time this is Formula 1 and it has been always like that.\n\n\"Now it is the energy, last year or two years ago, when he won all the races, it was downforce. He could go in the corners at 280km/h and we could go in the corners at 250km/h because we didn't have the downforce.\"\n\nAlonso urged caution before jumping to too many conclusions at this early stage of the new rules.\n\n\"We still love motor racing, we still love competing and for the regs I understand there is less input by the driving skills,\" he said, \"but I think after three or four races maybe we have a better idea.\"\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nJudging competitiveness in testing is always difficult because there are so many variables and teams do not reveal the specification in which they run their cars. Indeed, in many cases teams may try to deliberately fool people.\n\nBut that did not stop Red Bull's rivals noticing something striking about their new engine - it seemed able to deploy more energy for longer on a more consistent basis than other teams.\n\nAlthough Verstappen set only the seventh fastest absolute lap time of the test, Russell said Red Bull's underlying pace was \"pretty scary\".\n\nHe said that, on current evidence, Red Bull were \"going to be ahead\" at the first race, adding: \"We hope we can catch up.\"\n\nRed Bull technical director Pierre Wache rejected this analysis, saying \"clearly the top three teams - Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren - are in front of us\".\n\nRace simulations are usually the best way of judging relative pace, and there Verstappen was consistently gaining about 0.6secs a lap on Norris on the straights when they were running concurrently. Fuel loads and engine modes are not known, of course.\n\nBut the quickest race simulation of the week was done by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, who had the edge on pace over Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari when running at the same time on Friday.\n\nHamilton was matching the pace set by team-mate Charles Leclerc the day before, which was a chunk quicker than Norris was managing at the same time.\n\nThe complication here is that there may well be an element of politicking involved, because in the background there is a rumbling row about the engine rules, with Mercedes at its centre.\n\nTheir rivals believe Mercedes have found a loophole in the rules defining the engines' compression ratios. The claim is that this allows them to comply with the rule that dictates the compression ratio is measured at ambient temperature, but then run the engine on track at a higher ratio by clever exploitation of thermal expansion.\n\nFerrari, Honda, Red Bull and Audi are said to be pushing for a ruling from the FIA before the first race that would stop this.\n\nSo when Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff described Red Bull as the \"benchmark\" on the first day of the test, there were those who wondered whether he was doing so in an attempt to persuade the powers that be that a rule change before the first race was not necessary.\n\nBut perhaps Mercedes' rivals were playing this game, too. Verstappen described Wolff's remarks as \"a diversion tactic\". Leclerc said he believed Mercedes were \"hiding a lot more\".\n\nOn the competitive picture, according to Leclerc, Red Bull and Mercedes were at the front, with Ferrari a little behind, \"but it doesn't seem to be too much of a gap for now\". World champions McLaren, he said, were \"a little bit more difficult to understand\".\n\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella urged people to \"just be careful looking too much into what we see in testing. However, early indications from a competitiveness point of view, definitely put Ferrari and Mercedes at the top of the list in terms of those that seem to be ready from a performance point of view in particular\".\n\nAston Martin 'look four seconds off top teams'\n\nBehind the top four, there appears to be a gap of in the region of 1.5 to two seconds before a midfield group comprising Haas, Alpine and Audi, followed by Racing Bulls and Williams. At the back are Cadillac and Aston Martin, who are the one team being completely transparent about their performance.\n\nThere is so much attention and expectation on Aston Martin, with Alonso at the wheel, design legend Adrian Newey at the helm since March, and Honda their new works engine partner.\n\nBut the year has started badly. The car is way off the pace - around four seconds, Alonso's team-mate Lance Stroll said on Thursday.\n\nBreak that down over the lap using GPS data available to all teams, and it seems about 1.5secs of it is from the engine and the rest from the car, which performs worse the slower the corner gets.\n\nHow, one might wonder, is this possible?\n\nThe answer seems to be a combination of the car design process being behind, partly because of Newey's late arrival, partly because the team are building their own gearbox for the first time ever, and Honda being behind because… well, there is no clear answer to that one.\n\nHonda officially pulled out of F1 at the end of 2021, and dismantled much of its engine department before changing its mind in 2023. But it still had people working on upgrading its existing engine in the meantime, and its lead time for the new regulations has not been very different from Red Bull's, and yet the Japanese company seem to be nowhere in comparison.\n\nAlonso was not happy about Aston Martin's performance on Thursday, throwing his gloves down at one stage after getting out of the car. And who can blame him?\n\nThis could be his final season in F1. He is 45 in July and out of contract at the end of the year. Spending it at the back was not what he was expecting.\n\n\"Definitely we are not in the position we wanted to be,\" Alonso said, pointing out they had been late to start testing, that reliability was still not good, and that was costing them time to hone the car.\n\nThe former F1 driver Pedro de la Rosa, who has been with the team as long as Alonso and has now been appointed team representative to take some of the load off Newey, said: \"Looking back is always easy. If we had possibly started earlier, if Adrian would have been here not 2 March, but a few months earlier, if Honda wouldn't have gone and then come back - it's ifs and buts.\n\n\"Bottom line is we are slow. We're not where we want to be. Let's get a plan together. Let's look ahead, not back [at] what went wrong.\n\n\"It was many reasons. The important thing is that we we know what they are. That's what gives us the confidence that slowly, gradually, the difference will shrink.\"\n\nFastest lap times, Bahrain test one\n\n1 Kimi Antonelli (Ita) Mercedes one minute 33.669 seconds\n\n2 George Russell (GB) Mercedes 1:33.918\n\n3 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Ferrari 1:34.209\n\n4 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 1:34.273\n\n5 Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren 1:34.549\n\n6 Lando Norris (GB) McLaren 1:34.669\n\n7 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1:34.798\n\n8 Oliver Bearman (GB) Haas 1:35.349\n\n10 Franco Colapinto (Arg) Alpine 1:35.806\n\n11 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Audi 1:36.291\n\n12 Isack Hadjar (Fra) Red Bull 1:35.610\n\n13 Gabriel Bortoleto (Brz) Audi 1:36.670\n\n14 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Alpine 1:36.765\n\n15 Alex Albon (Thi) Williams 1:36.793\n\n16 Liam Lawson (NZ) Racing Bulls 1:36.808\n\n17 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Cadillac 1:36.824\n\n18 Carlos Sainz (Spa) Williams 1:37.186\n\n19 Arvid Lindblad (GB) Racing Bulls 1:37.470\n\n20 Lance Stroll (Can) Aston Martin 1:38.165\n\n21 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Aston Martin 1:38.248\n\n22 Sergio Perez (Mex) Cadillac 1:38.653\n\nF1 2026 cars in pictures at Bahrain testing\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?\n\nListen to Back at Base on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "Chelsea striker Liam Delap turns in \"top\" performance in the 4-0 win over Hull City with a hat-trick of assists after missing a sitter.",
    "fullText": "Liam Delap started to celebrate when he thought he had ended his eight-match Chelsea goal drought in his side's 4-0 hammering of Hull City in the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nThe problem was the ball hadn't crossed the line after he had blocked a clearance from home keeper Dillon Phillips.\n\nIt summed up the frustration for the 23-year-old striker, who joined Chelsea in the summer following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship in a deal worth £30m.\n\nDelap has failed to convince Blues fans so far, netting just twice in 23 appearances and his last goal coming in a 2-1 defeat at Fulham in early January.\n\nIt looked like he had ended that run in the 23rd minute of the tie at the Championship promotion hopefuls, where he had a loan spell in the 2023-24 season.\n\nWith the game still goalless, Delap pressured Phillips into a mistake as he tried to clear and the ball looped up, struck the underside of the bar and bounced down onto the goalline.\n\nYet he showed no urgency to put the rebound into the net.\n\nFirst Delap raised his arm to celebrate, then appealed to the officials, before collecting the loose ball and having a shot blocked by the recovering Phillips.\n\nDelap, though, recovered impressively from the error to finish the match with three assists as Pedro Neto's hat-trick and an Estevao Willian strike sent eight-time FA Cup winners Chelsea into round five.\n\nAnd he was able to joke about the bizarre moment afterwards as he told BBC One: \"I swear on my life I almost ran off [the pitch].\n\n\"I thought it went in and then I was waiting for the ref to blow his whistle. Obviously, I should have waited for the ref to blow his whistle. It's silly from me but yeah, crazy.”\n\nPremier League record goalscorer Alan Shearer, speaking on BBC One during commentary of the game, said: \"Goodness me. What is Delap doing?\n\n\"It is as if he is thinking, 'I have all the time in the world'. He ambles to it and he takes his time. What are you waiting for?\n\n\"Liam Delap has not had a good four minutes. He has given it away twice and missed a sitter. Delap has been poor and he has been given the opportunity tonight. Delap looks very lazy, his performances have to improve.\"\n\nNeto hat-trick helps Chelsea beat Hull to reach fifth round\n\nArrests made after discriminatory chants at Hull City\n\nThe former Manchester City striker has started just two of Chelsea's last nine Premier League games, but was handed a chance by Liam Rosenior, with in-form forward Joao Pedro dropping to the bench.\n\nAnd despite Delap's misjudgement, the Blues boss praised the forward for his response and part in the success.\n\nThe ball he played to Neto for the opening goal in the 40th minute was the first pass he had completed in the final third, having lost possession eight times beforehand.\n\nHis second assist for Estevao came after some brilliant hold-up play, while he teed up Neto for the second time at the MKM Stadium with a powerful drive into the box.\n\nRosenior called Delap's performance \"top\" and said: \"To be a number nine, especially in a system that we play, it's not always about yourself.\n\n\"It's about bringing other people into play. It's about sometimes making sacrifice runs so other players get the space.\"\n\nAnd former Blackburn and Newcastle striker Shearer added: \"Delap recovered well from that start and has been instrumental in the win. He deserves a lot of credit for that.\"\n\nEx-Manchester City defender Micah Richards hopes Delap can \"replicate that in the Premier League\".\n\n\"I think Liam Delap's game was brilliant,\" he told BBC One. \"What I liked about it, is when Hull set up in this five, Delap was thinking if he could get into the space.\"\n\nWhile Delap must wait for his next goal, former Spurs and Manchester City midfielder Michael Brown added on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Delap can do anything. He is like a throwback and is that all-around number nine.\n\n\"He is very effective when he is on his game. He is good in the air, he can hold the ball up well, he can defend and he can finish.\n\n\"I think he is another outlet. Chelsea now have a plan B if they want to use it and that could be an option.\"\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Matt Weston cements his status as the best skeleton racer in the world, making history by winning Olympic gold in emphatic fashion in Cortina and securing Team GB’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Games.",
    "fullText": "Standing at the top of the winding Cortina sliding track with Olympic gold in his sights, Matt Weston knew what he had to do.\n\nHaving laid the foundations for skeleton gold on Thursday - tidying up errors from his first run to produce a statement second, each time setting the track record - the Briton merely needed more of the same on Friday.\n\nWhat he produced was not only a masterclass in sliding but also a remarkable display of composure and focus to clinch gold - Team GB's first medal of the Games - and cement his place at the top of the sport.\n\n\"It means everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally, I've worked so hard for this,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But everyone back home - my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone who has sacrificed everything for this. I've missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment. It feels amazing. Hopefully I made you proud.\"\n\nWeston set a track record on all four of his runs and could have eased off in his final attempt having already built a significant margin of 0.39 seconds, but ramped things up on what was ultimately a victory lap lasting 55.61secs, finishing with a sensational overall time of 3:43.33.\n\nIt left an almost impossible task for the chasing pack and Germany's Axel Jungk finished 0.88secs behind to take silver, while compatriot and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer secured bronze, 1.07secs behind Weston.\n\nThe pressure to deliver was there. The 28-year-old from Redhill was the heavy favourite to top the podium in Italy having dominated the sport in the past four-year cycle, but no British man had won an Olympic skeleton gold medal before.\n\nHe also carried the weight of Team GB teetering on the edge of overall disappointment at the Games, having been tipped for a record medal haul at Milan-Cortina but watching those ambitions begin to slip away.\n\nWeston blocked out the noise of 'helmet-gate', of seeing his peer Vladyslav Heraskevych disqualified from the competition just moments before the first heat, and of the disaster that was Beijing 2022, where GB failed to win a skeleton medal for the first time since 2002.\n\nHe put it all aside to add the Olympic crown to his two World Championship titles and three Crystal Globes - the overall World Cup trophies.\n\nFour years ago, it was a different story.\n\nHis overwhelming disappointment at missing out on the Olympic podium almost led to him quitting the sport and he told BBC Sport earlier this year he has had to teach himself to \"love the pressure and expectation\".\n\nFrom speaking to friends and family to knowing when to rest and eating lots of pasta, Weston has figured out the secret to his own success, and now he's reaping the rewards.\n\nThe new champion knows what it feels like to walk away from an Olympics empty-handed, having finished 15th at his maiden Games in Beijing.\n\nKnowing he did not want to feel that again, he has worked on switching his mentality and says that has paved the way for his success.\n\nIn 2023 he became Britain's first men's world champion in 15 years, taking silver the following year but reclaiming his title in 2025.\n\nHis first World Cup title came in 2024 and he has been unrivalled since, earlier this year becoming the first man to defend the trophy twice - winning five of the seven races this season and finishing second in the other two.\n\nArriving at this Games as reigning world, European and World Cup champion, the pressure was on to deliver.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston told BBC Sport after run two on Thursday.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nHe represented England at taekwondo as a teenager, winning various medals at national level, but a back injury brought that particular sporting career to an end.\n\nHe was also a gifted rugby player but, like many skeleton racers, it was through a talent identification programme that Weston discovered his love and aptitude for the winter sport nine years ago.\n\nQuickly rising up the sport came with its own issues and, following that disappointing result four years ago, Weston had to learn to embrace the pressure and, once winning became the norm, carry the weight of being the favourite.\n\nThat attitude has served him well in Italy as he has been able to block out the noise, pointing to enjoyment as the key to his success.\n\nIt has not just been on the track where Weston has blocked out the noise.\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by discussion around the British team's desire to a wear a new helmet design in Italy.\n\nThey ultimately lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), banning them from wearing their new helmet.\n\nWeston and team-mate Marcus Wyatt, who was also tipped for success but finished ninth, were confident it would not make a difference, pointing to the triumphs they have enjoyed all season.\n\nThat came before Weston saw Ukrainian Heraskevych disqualified moments before the men's competition started on Thursday.\n\nAnd after a week of no medals for the British team in Italy, pressure on Weston gradually increased.\n\nBut he knew what he needed to do to win gold, stating he would settle for nothing less in Cortina.\n\nThat doesn't always mean being the first to arrive at the track and the last to leave.\n\nHe sat out Wednesday's final training runs in favour of a rest, opting for some light stretching and mental respite by speaking to his fiance about anything other than sliding.\n\nPlus, eating a lot of pasta, abiding by his motto \"pasta makes you faster\".\n\nUltimately, skeleton training is tricky, particularly for a British athlete.\n\nWith no ice tracks in Britain - only a push-start track at the University of Bath - a lot of time is spent in the gym working on speed and explosiveness to improve that all-important start.\n\nWith one run down the icy track taking less than a minute, it means the British sliders spend around two and a half hours per year actually completing runs and a lot of time visualising the track, understanding the twists and turns to make for a seamless run.\n\nBut Weston has got his rituals down to a tee and not only is he the first British man to win winter gold since Christopher Dean topped the ice dancing podium alongside Jayne Torvill in 1984, but also the first British man to win skeleton gold.\n\nHis success may not end there, as he partners Amelia Coltman in the mixed team event, newly introduced for Milan-Cortina, on Sunday.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Ilia Malinin, the red-hot favourite for men's figure skating gold at Milan-Cortina 2026, suffered a nightmare as he fell twice and missed out on the medals entirely.\n\nIn a remarkable men's free skate, many of the major medal contenders struggled with their routines. Of the final six athletes, five suffered falls.\n\nThe only one to skate clean, Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan, was left stunned as he won gold – his country's first Winter Olympic gold in 32 years.\n\nYuma Kagiyama of Japan, regarded as Malinin's nearest rival for gold, fell on a quad flip and had to settle for silver. Bronze went to his compatriot Shun Sato.\n\nThe USA's Malinin finished eighth after a horrendous free skate in which he visibly crumbled under the pressure.\n\nCompeting in his first Olympics, the 21-year-old arrived with the nickname 'Quad God' having become the only skater to successfully land the quadruple axel.\n\nThe move requires a skater to launch themselves into a jump, spin four and a half times in the air, and cleanly land backwards.\n\nBut Malinin did not pull out this move at all in the Games, although it was registered in his planned elements. Indeed, in this final he only performed a single axel, to groans from the crowd.\n\nAnd, going for a quad lutz, he fell to the ice in a moment that made the Olympics stop.\n\nNo-one expected it. And certainly no-one thought he would fall again, but he did just that two elements later.\n\nAt the end, Malinin grabbed his hair and put his hands to his knees. As he left the ice he could only shake his head on the verge of tears. The Quad God, mortal.\n\nWeston wins emphatic skeleton gold for first GB medal\n\nVonn needs more surgery but 'feels more like herself'\n\nMalinin had come in for some criticism at these Games, particularly around his performance in the team event, in which he was outscored by Kagiyama in the short program before errors in the free skate – in which he had not originally been expected to compete - almost allowed Japan to scoop gold.\n\nReacting to the pressure, Malinin's team took him out of the Olympic bubble to train 35 miles away in Bergamo before the men's event as they hoped it would help him reset.\n\nAnd his cleaned-up performance in the individual short program – finishing five points ahead of the field – seemed like that that of a man in no mood to lose his two-and-a-half-year unbeaten competition streak.\n\nHis lead into the free skate was ominous – this is where Malinin dominates. At the Grand Prix Final, he was third after the short but still finished 30 points clear of the field after the free, landing seven quads.\n\nUsually, he has such an advantage because of a deadly combination of fearlessness and ability. His program for the free skate has a much higher technical score than any of his rivals, and judges will give extra credit for ambition while also rewarding with a higher component score.\n\nBut this was a timid routine. The quad axel subbed for a single, a quad loop reduced to a double. Dreams, turned to rubble.\n\nOn his quad salchow, he only executed a double, then fell. Reality hit, just like the ice.\n\nMalinin's free skate was the 15th best of the night. It earned just 156.33 points, more than 40 behind Shaidorov.\n\nHe performed a backflip for the crowd's entertainment, but it seemed like a forlorn call to the good times of only last week.\n\nIn the team event he had also landed the first legal backflip at an Olympic Games since US champion Terry Kubicka in 1976 - after which it was banned for safety reasons.\n\nThanks in part to skaters like France's Surya Bonaly - who performed the move illegally but successfully at Nagano 1998 - the backflip is now legal again.\n\nMalinin became the first to land it at the Games on only one foot and did the flip again in the short program.\n\nBut really, none of that mattered. And after the scores came in, Malinin went straight to Shaidorov to congratulate him.\n\nThis is Kazakhstan's first Winter Olympic gold medal since Lillehammer 1994, when Vladimir Smirnov won the men's 50km cross-country skiing. That was 10 years before Shaidorov, 21, was born.\n\nAfter a slight slip on the quad lutz, Shaidorov kept his head when all about were losing theirs and produced two clean quad techniques of his own.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "\"I don't need to motivate these players, they are fully aware where we are in the league and what we have done,\" said Manchester City manager Andree Jeglertz.\n\n\"Our attacking play was marvellous throughout the whole game. I'm really impressed and proud.\"\n\nThese comments came after his side had thrashed Leicester City 6-0 to regain their 11-point lead at the top of the Women's Super League.\n\nManchester City have won 14 of 16 games this season, including all nine of their home league matches, only dropping points in defeats at Stamford Bridge and Emirates Stadium against the defending WSL and European champions respectively.\n\nLast Sunday, they were stunned in losing to Arsenal but against Leicester showed their reaction to a rare setback with a superb performance against the league's bottom side.\n\nWhile the chasing pack all have at least one game in hand, City's closest challengers Manchester United are 11 points behind, Chelsea 12 and Arsenal a further point behind in fourth.\n\nWhile those three teams are fighting for Champions League places, it feels a stretch to imagine any of them stopping City claiming their second WSL title.\n\nIndeed against Leicester, despite scoring six, a rampant Manchester City side will be disappointed not to have got more.\n\nThey had 31 shots on goal with 15 on target, recording an xG of 4.61 and an astounding 232 passes in the final third, all highest totals for a WSL side this season.\n\nThis result increased their goal difference to +34, almost twice as good as next best Manchester United (+18) and made it 47 goals from 16 games, an average of 2.94 per game.\n\nMan City go 11 points clear in WSL after thrashing Leicester\n\nManchester City's desire for excellence can be summed up by the attitude of Lauren Hemp, who was player of the match after supplying two assists and creating 11 chances for her team-mates.\n\nAsked how satisfied she was, the England winger replied: \"Yeah, but no goal - I think I need to practise my shooting! But I am really happy to contribute where I can.\n\n\"We are really pleased. We've got a really confident group, everyone is contributing and the substitutes got involved too.\"\n\nMissing out on a Champions League spot last season means Manchester City have played 22 games in all competitions this season while, at the end of this weekend, rivals Chelsea will have played 25, Arsenal 27 and Manchester United 28.\n\nThe squad looks fresh as a result of the extra rest, none more so than star striker Khadija Shaw, who has scored 15 league goals this season, surpassing the 12 she scored last campaign.\n\nEven with the Asia Cup on the horizon and the departure of key players such as Yui Hasegawa, they look well equipped to prosper. Record signing Sam Coffey made her first start in this game and impressed in midfield.\n\nOn Sky Sports, ex-Manchester City captain Steph Houghton noted her old side's determination to succeed this season.\n\n\"There is always an added pressure when you are top of the league with a big points difference, and as a player you naturally feel in those first few days after being beaten [by Arsenal],\" she said.\n\n\"That was the perfect reaction.\"\n\nWith six games left, Manchester City need 12 points to claim the title. If results go their way, they could even win it at Old Trafford in three games' time on Sunday, 29 March.\n\nMaybe that would be enough to satisfy Jeglertz and this hungry group of players.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "Circuit Judge Mark Hayes has ruled in favor of Spartanburg County in a years-long dispute over the prominent display of a Confederate flag near I-85.",
    "fullText": "A Confederate flag that has been on prominent display along Interstate 85 in Spartanburg County has been ordered to fly no longer, according to a ruling by Judge Mark Hayes.\n\nOn Jan. 29, Hayes rejected the Adam Washington Ballenger Camp #68, Sons of Confederate Veterans' appeal of a decision by the Spartanburg Planning and Development Department, which said the 120-foot flagpole was in violation of county regulations.\n\nThe flag was located on Teaberry Road, near I-85.\n\nAccording to the county, because the lot was vacant and had no primary use, such as a residence or business, the “accessory” use of the flagpole was noncompliant with land-use rules.\n\nIn 2023, the Spartanburg County Board of Zoning Appeals ruled in favor of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, overturning the county's decision.\n\nThe matter then went to the circuit civil court, with the county seeking to overturn the zoning appeals board’s decision.\n\nThe Confederate flag has long been a politically contentious symbol in South Carolina. Critics point to its connection to white supremacist groups and the South's history of slavery. Flag defenders have described it as a symbol of regional pride and respect for their ancestors.\n\nWhile the flag's display along I-85 -- in a location where more than 80,000 passed by on an average day -- sparked controversy, the flag flew for many years in a place of even greater prominence: the South Carolina statehouse.\n\nThe Confederate flag was placed atop the statehouse in 1961 in a move to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Civil War.\n\nIt was also in the midst of the Civil Rights era, and Southern states were resisting the push for equality for Black citizens. The flag became a symbol of that resistance for many.\n\nMore: Debate over Confederate flag took on psychology of its own\n\nSouth Carolina kept the Confederate flag flying above the statehouse until 2000, when a compromise was reached to place a smaller version of the flag on the Confederate soldier monument in front of the Capitol building.\n\nThe compromise followed years of debate over the flag's meaning and its appropriateness as a state symbol.\n\nIn 1999, the national NAACP called for a boycott of South Carolina, putting economic pressure on the state.\n\nEventually, the state's business leaders signaled support for removing the flag from the statehouse dome.\n\nFormer Gov. Nikki Haley called for its removal from the statehouse grounds altogether in 2015 after white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine people inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n\nThe flag could once be seen driving south on I-85 and was located off Teaberry Road in Spartanburg County.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Greenville News: Spartanburg County Confederate flag along I-85 ordered to be removed",

    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — A four-vehicle crash in Downtown, Columbus resulted in at least one death, a fire, and caused Interstate 71 North to close Friday morning.\n\nAccording to police, one vehicle traveling in the wrong direction caused a four-vehicle crash that then started a fire on I-71 North, near the East Broad Street exit. Columbus Fire Chief Jeffrey Geitter told NBC4 that one person was hospitalized in critical condition. Columbus police later confirmed that one person died.\n\nLive updates: Milan Cortina Olympics, February 13\n\nIn a released incident report, police state that a black Chrysler Town & Country was traveling southbound in the northbound lanes when it struck a Ford F-150 and a semitruck traveling in the north. A few minutes after the initial crash, a Ram 1500 slowed to avoid the crash, but was hit from behind by a second semitruck.\n\nThe crash was captured on ODOT traffic cameras. NBC4 edited the clip to show the initial crash involving the wrong-way driver and the moments before the vehicle involved in the second crash caught fire.\n\nThe driver of the Ram was hospitalized in critical condition, but later pronounced dead. The drivers of the semitrucks were not injured, while the driver of the Chrysler ran away.\n\nOne of the vehicles was engulfed in flames when emergency crews arrived and all northbound lanes on I-71 were closed since the incident, which occurred just after 2 a.m. Additionally, exit ramps from I-70 to I-71 North were also closed.\n\nThe highway reopened at 9 a.m. Friday after a seven-hour closure.\n\nMatt Bruning, Press Secretary for the Ohio Department of Transportation, told NBC4 that following the Columbus Division of Police investigation, ODOT will review the area.\n\n“There is a lot with this crash that obviously is very concerning and we’ll certainly be waiting to see what the investigation shows occurred and look at is there anything else that could be done from an engineering standpoint and we do that with literally every fatal crash,” he said.\n\n.01% of all crashes in Ohio are wrong-way crashes, according to Bruning.\n\n“It’s very rare we have these types of crashes, but when they happen, they’re very serious and that’s why ODOT takes them so seriously,” he said. “We work very closely with the law enforcement agency that’s investigating that crash to find out how did that driver start going the wrong way, where did that occur, and then we’ll look at are there other counter measures we could put in place. In many cases, there are not.”\n\nBruning said since 2022 the number of wrong-way crashes in Ohio has decreased. He also said over the years the department has taken various steps to try and prevent wrong-way crashes. Those include signage, reflectors, and wrong-way detection technology in certain locations.\n\n“There are a lot of questions certainly we’ll have that hopefully Columbus police are able to find the person and ask those questions because we have them and I’m sure a lot of other people for various reasons have those questions as well,” Bruning said.\n\nAny person with knowledge of the involved vehicle or driver is encouraged to contact the Accident Investigation Unit at (614) 645-4767. Persons wishing to remain anonymous may contact Central Ohio Crime Stoppers at (614) 461-8477.",

    "description": "A record-breaking gravitational wave signal let scientists \"listen\" to a distant black hole merger and put Einstein's gravity to its toughest test yet.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nScientists have used the loudest gravitational-wave signal ever recorded to put Albert Einstein's more than 100-year-old theory of gravity to its toughest test yet — and once again, it passed.\n\nThe signal, called GW250114, came from the merger of two black holes — each about 30 times the mass of the sun — about 1.3 billion light-years from Earth. The event caused ripples through space-time, called gravitational waves, which washed over Earth on Jan. 14, 2025, and were detected by the U.S.-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).\n\nScientists say the event closely resembles the one that resulted in the first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015. That suggests the black holes in both mergers were similar in size and distance from Earth.\n\nHowever, this new signal was recorded with roughly three times the clarity of that groundbreaking 2015 discovery, allowing scientists to test Einstein's theory of general relativity more rigorously than ever before.\n\n\"It was very clearly the loudest event,\" Keefe Mitman, a postdoctoral researcher at the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science and co-author of the new paper, told Live Science. \"This one event provided more information than everything we've seen before regarding certain tests of general relativity.\"\n\nThe signal's exceptional clarity stems from a decade of steady upgrades to the detectors, Mitman said. Those improvements reduced noise from sources that once interfered with cosmic signals, including seismic vibrations and even passing trucks. As a result, the detectors were sensitive enough to the minuscule distortions in space-time — changes 700 trillion times smaller than the width of a human hair — caused by the recently detected black hole merger.\n\nThe findings are detailed in a study published Jan. 29 in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nBecause the recently detected signal was so clear, Mitman and his colleagues could zoom in on a fleeting stage after the merger known as the \"ringdown.\" During this phase, the newly formed black hole briefly vibrates — much like a struck bell — emitting gravitational waves in distinct patterns, or \"tones,\" that encode key properties of the black hole, including its mass and spin.\n\nIn GW250114, researchers detected the two primary tones predicted for such a merger. Each tone yielded an independent measurement of the black hole's mass and spin — and both matched, effectively verifying general relativity, the team reported in the study.\n\nFor the first time, scientists also confidently identified a more subtle, short-lived \"overtone\" that appears right at the start of the ringing — another feature long predicted by general relativity.\n\n\"This event made it very, very obvious that, indeed, this prediction of general relativity was present in the signal, which was really exciting,\" Mitman told Live Science.\n\nHad the measurements disagreed, he added in a statement, \"we would have had a lot of work to do as physicists to try to explain what's going on and what the true theory of gravity would be in our universe.\"\n\nEarlier analyses of the same event, published in September 2025, confirmed another major prediction rooted in general relativity that Stephen Hawking proposed more than 50 years ago. Hawking predicted that a black hole's surface area — the size of its event horizon — can never shrink, even though enormous amounts of energy escape during a merger as gravitational waves.\n\nIn GW250114, scientists estimated that the two original black holes had a combined surface area of about 93,000 square miles (240,000 square kilometers) — roughly the size of Oregon. After the merger, the resulting black hole had a surface area of about 155,000 square miles (400,000 square km) — closer to the size of California — which is consistent with Hawking's prediction.\n\nDespite general relativity's repeated success at describing large-scale cosmic phenomena, physicists suspect the theory cannot be the complete description of gravity in our universe. For example, it cannot explain dark matter or dark energy, which are needed to hold galaxies and their clusters together and to explain the universe's accelerating expansion, respectively. Nor does it reconcile cleanly with quantum mechanics, the framework that governs nature at the smallest scales.\n\nScientists hope gravitational waves from energetic black hole mergers might someday show subtle deviations from Einstein's predictions, which could potentially reveal new physics.\n\nThe ringdown phase is especially promising for such tests, Mitman said. Many \"beyond-Einstein\" theories predict slightly different vibration patterns during the ringdown phase — so measuring more than one tone, as his team did with GW250114, can help scientists place constraints on any possible deviations from general relativity.\n\nIf a discrepancy were to be found, researchers could compare the data with predictions from alternative theories of gravity to determine which, if any, matches reality.\n\n\"There has to be some way to resolve this paradox to make our theory of gravity consistent with our theory of quantum mechanics,\" Mitman said in the statement.\n\nNext-generation detectors, including the proposed Einstein Telescope in Europe and the U.S.-based Cosmic Explorer, will be 10 times more sensitive than current facilities. In addition to detecting more events like GW250114, these detectors will be able to observe lower-frequency gravitational waves, which correspond to more massive black holes, thereby allowing scientists to probe entirely new classes of these cosmic behemoths.\n\n—Science history: Gravitational waves detected, proving Einstein right — Sept. 14, 2015\n\n—The universe is rippling with a faint 'gravitational wave background' created by colliding black holes, huge international study suggests\n\n—Unproven Einstein theory of 'gravitational memory' may be real after all, new study hints\n\nResearchers are also looking ahead to the European Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which is expected to observe gravitational waves from supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Planned for launch in 2035, LISA is expected to detect a flood of events and could reveal dozens of distinct tones within a single black hole merger event, Mitman said.\n\n\"We're living in the regime where we don't have enough data, and we're kind of just twiddling our thumbs waiting for more data to come in,\" Mitman said. \"Once LISA is online, we'll be overwhelmed.\"\n\nIf funding for gravitational-wave science continues, he added, \"we're going to see more and more of these golden events and really start to learn wonderful things about the nature of gravity in our universe.\"",

    "title": "JD Vance: A Prisoner of the Caucasus",
    "description": "Pietro A....",
    "fullText": "The vice president’s trip adds fuel to regional fires.\n\nIf there is one characteristic that defines the erratic and incoherent “Donroe Doctrine” of President Trump, then it must be the principle that “might makes right” in international politics. The Trump administration has little need for international law. It is willfully and blatantly disregarded and, indeed, discarded. Instead, from Greenland to Gaza, from Venezuela to Iran, the “law of the jungle” reigns supreme.\n\nThe essence of the “Donroe Doctrine” can be observed in the administration’s approach to both war and peace. An example of the latter is what occurred earlier this week when Vice President JD Vance flew to the Caucasus in a bid to bolster American influence and pressure on Iran’s northern frontier, at a time when tension between Washington and Tehran has never been higher. Amid profound domestic crises in the US, it would seem prudent to avoid dragging America into such far-flung adventurism, in a part of the world that is virtually unknown to most Americans. Yet there was Vance, stoking tensions with a large regional power—Iran—and a massive atomic superpower—Russia—all while quietly sanctioning democratic decline and ethnic cleansing in the post-Soviet Caucasus.\n\nVance’s Caucasian itinerary consisted of two of the three South Caucasus states—Armenia and Azerbaijan. Georgia, once the favorite of American neocons, was conspicuously avoided. In 2008, its president, Mikheil Saakashvili, had bungled his way into a confrontation with Russia at the behest of the Bush administration. Facing a bear-like reaction from Moscow, Tbilisi was left in the lurch by Washington. While Georgia has since learned from this painful episode, Armenia’s Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan’s Ilham Aliyev have decided to try their luck at the “Saakashvili” approach, with ample encouragement from President Trump. It is at their own peril that they ignore the clear warnings from Russia and Iran against any American presence on their borders.\n\nVance arrived first in Armenia, flying into Yerevan from Milan on a rainy Monday afternoon. A major part of his visit was to reinforce American commitment to the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP). Hailed by the Trump administration as a “historic” project to bring peace to the region, the known details of this initiative indicate that it is more likely to bring war than peace. TRIPP involves Armenia effectively relinquishing control of its crucial southern border with Iran to a joint US-Armenia company (with the US holding a 74 percent stake) for a period of 49 to 99 years.\n\nNaturally, any plan to establish a long-term US or NATO presence on Iranian and Russian frontiers is bound to raise alarms in Moscow and Tehran. Yet in Yerevan Vance not only brushed aside such concerns but even pledged to export $9 billion in the sphere of civil nuclear cooperation, in remarks that raised more questions than answers in Armenia. Observers of the vice president’s press conference with Pashinyan were treated to a stream of empty platitudes of “peace,” even though only a declaration of intent has been signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Indeed, despite Pashinyan’s confident assertion that peace had been definitively established between Baku and Yerevan under President Trump, the fact remains that a formal peace agreement has never been inked between the parties. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan continues to advance territorial claims on Armenia.\n\nVance failed to utter a single peep about Pashinyan’s abuses in office. Despite being catapulted to power in 2018 on proclaimed promises of political reform, Pashinyan instead embarked on a course of de-democratization. Under his neoliberal administration, poverty and inequality have worsened and corruption has flourished. Freedom of speech has come under assault, leaving Armenia with one of the highest pre-trial detention rates in Europe. The democratic right of the Armenians of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) to self-determination—the cornerstone of Armenia’s 1988 Karabakh movement—was betrayed by the PM to the whims of an aggressive Azerbaijan. Even the Armenian Apostolic Church, the country’s foremost religious institution with roots extending back to the time of Christ, has not been spared Pashinyan’s wrath. Despite widespread public trust in the church, Pashinyan’s government has arrested an Armenian bishop and three Armenian archbishops, including the beloved Archbishop Mikael Ajapahyan. Samvel Karapetyan, a prominent supporter of the church, has also been arrested. Even the patriarch of the church—Catholicos Karekin II—has come under attack.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Vance was mum on the sorry state of Armenian democracy. Instead, he took a page from the playbook of Walter Duranty and openly endorsed Pashinyan, emphatically stressing the government’s commitment to “markets” and “prosperity.” “All too predictably, the allegedly devout, pious, believing Catholic US vice president whispered not a word of protest against Pashinyan’s jailing of clergy of the Armenian Apostolic Church,” noted James Carden, a former State Department adviser for the Obama administration. “Instead, these and other unjustly imprisoned will be sacrificed on the altar of TRIPP—none of which redounds to the interests of the Armenian or American people.” Even the most potentially redeeming element of Vance’s trip to Armenia—his visit to the Armenian Genocide monument at Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan—was marred by controversy. Vance, who was accompanied only by his wife, Usha, and not by Pashinyan, laid flowers at the monument’s eternal flame and posted about it on Twitter/X, only to delete the post soon after, out of fear of offending NATO member Turkey.\n\nWhile in Baku, Vance met with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and inked a strategic partnership agreement with him. “For us, it’s a great honor to be a strategic partner to the most powerful country of the world—[the] United States of America,” Aliyev underscored in his press conference with Vance. The Azerbaijani president likewise boasted of “cooperation in defense sales” with the US, a remark likely to be viewed critically in Tehran, given fears of Israeli use of Azerbaijan as a potential “forward base” against northern Iran. For his part, Vance praised Aliyev, noting that “other than President Trump, the only leader in the world that has really good relations with both the Turks and the Israelis is President Aliyev.”\n\nAs in Yerevan, Vance sidestepped the “inconvenient” matter of Baku’s democracy deficit, alluding only to the atrocious state of affairs when referencing the fact that Aliyev’s wife, Mehriban, now absurdly serves as the country’s vice president. “Hopefully that doesn’t give the [US] second lady any ideas,” remarked Vance, in a joke censored by Azerbaijani state television. Nothing was mentioned about Azerbaijan’s pervasive problem with political prisoners and dissidents, such as Bahruz Samadov and Igbal Abilov, to say nothing of the 19 Armenian prisoners languishing in Baku’s jails, such as Ruben Vardanyan. Behind closed doors, Vance reportedly raised the issue of the latter group to Aliyev, but Aliyev’s response is unknown. The vice president did praise Azerbaijan’s army for having “some of the toughest and fiercest troops anywhere in the world,” although he failed to mention that this same army had ethnically cleansed the indigenous Christian Armenian population of Artsakh in September 2023.\n\nNaturally, the Vance visit failed to impress Moscow or Tehran and, by any objective measure, has only succeeded in antagonizing the two Eurasian giants. As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warns that US-Russian relations are “moving in the wrong direction,” the clouds of war continue to gather over Iran. Thus, rather than promoting “peace,” the Vance tour of the Caucasus will only add fuel to the fire of regional tension, signaling a continuation of the reckless interventionism that has come to define US foreign policy in the post–Cold War era.",

    "description": "Bloomberg reported on the stunning numbers in a Thursday article, noting that Russia is now losing more men than it is able to recruit.",
    "fullText": "(Bernat Armangue/Russian Presidential Press Service/AP photos)\n\nRussia’s Vladimir Putin lost twice as many soldiers in January of 2026 as the Soviet Union lost during its entire campaign in Afghanistan in the 1980s, pointed out CNN’s Jim Sciutto this week.\n\nBloomberg reported on the stunning numbers in a Thursday article, noting that Russia is now losing more men than it is able to recruit.\n\nAlex Wickham, the UK Political Editor for Bloomberg, shared the report on X and noted, “ Russia sustained around 9,000 more battlefield losses than it was able to replace in January, according to assessments from Western officials.” Wickham continued:\n\nThe development signals Ukraine’s new strategy of killing more Russian soldiers than the Kremlin can replenish via recruitment is having some success.\n\nRussian forces were unable to achieve any significant gains on the ground in January even as they took these very heavy losses, the officials said.\n\nAbout 35,000 Russians were KIA in December, roughly equal to Moscow’s monthly recruitment, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nBut in January Russian losses exceeded recruitment.\n\nBloomberg’s reporting put Russian losses for January just around 44,000 dead on the battlefield, a number Sciutto made even more eye-popping with added context. The Soviet Union lost some 14,500 to 23,000 troops between 1979 and 1989 fighting in Afghanistan, although estimates vary.\n\nSciutto shared Wickham’s post and wrote, “In a single month, Russia had twice as many soldiers KIA as its entire ten-year war in Afghanistan, which helped bring down the USSR. The losses are staggering.”\n\nIn a single month, Russia had twice as many soldiers KIA as its entire ten-year war in Afghanistan which helped bring down the USSR. The losses are staggering. https://t.co/IlzR8Fi4uQ\n\n— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) February 12, 2026\n\nWickham added some additional analysis on what Russia’s losses mean for the ongoing war in Ukraine: “While the situation is difficult for Ukraine, especially for civilians without heating, Russia is taking incredibly high losses for no reward. At the current rate it will still take Russia two years to fully take Donetsk Oblast, according to the assessments. It raises further questions for Putin’s ability to make a breakthrough on the ground, despite the Russian narrative – at times echoed by Trump – that its victory is inevitable. It suggests Ukraine still has leverage in negotiations.”\n\nThe post Bombshell Report Finds Putin Lost Twice the Number of Troops In January as the Soviets Lost In 10 Years Fighting In Afghanistan first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The sports media is ignoring the story, but wealthy sports figures are all over the Epstein files.\n\nChild sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein did not want to ingratiate himself only to billionaires. He wanted to spend time with people who shaped the culture, and as we saw during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show, nothing shapes the culture quite like the athletic industrial complex.\n\nThe website Front Office Sports went through the latest tranche of hurriedly redacted Epstein files, and it is shocking just how many NFL franchise owners are in these e-mails and assorted documents. They include—and this is a partial list—Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots; Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants and first cousin of Jessica Tisch, the current New York City police commissioner; Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins; Zygi Wilf, owner of the Minnesota Vikings; and Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons. There are more NFL owners in the Epstein files than attended the Super Bowl.\n\nDenials have already been sputtered, and the owners’ public relations machines are working in overdrive to deny that they are anything more than incidental acquaintances of Epstein. But how many were actually friends with Epstein is less relevant than the fact that everyone who associated with Epstein ignored and excused what was often happening in plain sight around them. And as hard as their PR mavens are working to deflect attention, the sports media is working just as hard to ignore it all.\n\nAfter all, who could possibly imagine that Kraft would be involved in anything illicit when it comes to exercising power over young women? ESPN has essentially not covered the sports figures involved with Epstein. There are scant few articles under the byline “ESPN News Services,” which draws from the Associated Press. There has been no investigative journalism or televised commentary on one of their yak-fests. When one considers that the NFL now owns a portion of ESPN, not to mention that the NFL is central to much of its programming, the network’s blasé attitude toward the story is odious.\n\nEven more damning in the released files is the repeated presence of LA 2028 Olympic chairman Casey Wasserman. He says he did nothing wrong, though two Los Angeles supervisors and two members of the City Council have now called for him to resign from his role with the Olympic organizing committee. LA City Council member Monica Rodriguez said that Wasserman represents “a threat to the integrity of the games.”\n\nWassermans’s clients are already leaving his talent agency in protest. Olympian Abby Wambach and popstar Chappell Roan have dropped Wasserman and are calling for him to step down from the agency that bears his name.\n\nOf course, by any moral marker, Wasserman should not be allowed within 500 yards of the Olympics (or a school). His e-mails to Epstein’s partner in child trafficking, Ghislaine Maxwell, date back 20 years and include unredacted tidbits like, “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” LA Mayor Karen Bass, however, has not joined the call for him to disappear from the 2028 Games, already being called “The Epstein Olympics.”\n\nThe unconvincing excuses for keeping Wasserman at his post include the difficulty of replacing the chair of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee at this late of a date, as well as his ability to raise corporate cash. After what the organizing committee described as an “internal investigation,” Wasserman, whose grandfather Lew Wasserman was one of Hollywood’s most powerful people, is staying on as chair. We need to fight to see every page of the Epstein files with only the names of the survivors and victims redacted—but that is not enough. To paraphrase journalist Nolan Higdon, it is becoming more and more difficult to “shield the architects of the second Gilded Age”—and they deserve no such protections.\n\nThe Epstein files have exposed that global elites have never been wealthier and more influential, but they’ve become drunk on power after decades of plunder. This second Gilded Age isn’t ending until the exposure is total and its criminal offenders are frog-marched out of the owners’ boxes.",

    "fullText": "Southern California will experience a mild, sunny warming trend through Sunday before a series of three cold storm systems arrive starting Monday.\n\nCoasts and valleys will reach the low 70s this weekend; Monday’s storm could drop up to 2 inches of rain in lower elevations and 4 inches in mountains.\n\nMeteorologists are still determining the exact moisture levels of the third potential system expected to hit the region on Thursday.\n\nLOS ANGELES - Southern California is bracing for a significant shift in weather as three powerful storm systems are forecast to end a warm dry spell, bringing heavy precipitation and hazardous conditions through late next week.\n\nA warming trend fueled by light offshore winds will occur from Friday through Sunday, according to the latest NWS forecast.\n\nDuring this window, coastal areas and valleys should see highs in the upper 60s to low 70s, while mountain and inland areas will remain in the 50s and 60s.\n\nThe NWS has identified Sunday as a \"transition day\" before the first and strongest of two storm systems arrives from the northwest.\n\nThis initial wave is expected to deliver the heaviest rainfall on Monday, with 1 to 3 inches forecast for coastal and valley regions and 2 to 5 inches in the mountains.\n\nThe storm will also bring a risk of thunderstorms, strong winds, and high surf. Snow levels will initially sit around 6,500 feet but are expected to tumble as colder air moves in.\n\nA second storm is slated for Tuesday into Wednesday, followed by a third on Thursday.\n\nFriday – Sunday: Mild warming trend with peak temperatures on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nSunday Night: The first storm system reaches the Central Coast.\n\nMonday: Widespread heavy rain and the start of the \"wettest\" period of the week.\n\nTuesday – Wednesday: The second storm arrives; snow levels begin to drop significantly.\n\nThursday: A third system may impact the region, though moisture levels are unconfirmed.\n\nWhile the timing for the first storm is relatively certain, the NWS notes that \"it’s always difficult to time these features 4 or more days out,\" particularly regarding the exact end of the second system.\n\nWhile debris flows are a major concern, the precise locations of the most intense rain rates within burn scars remain difficult to pinpoint until the storm is closer.\n\nSnow levels are expected to undergo a dramatic change as the week progresses.\n\nWhile the snow level will start near 6,000 feet on Monday, it is forecast to fall to between 3,000 and 3,500 feet by Wednesday.\n\nThis could lead to significant snowfall in lower mountain passes and potentially hazardous driving conditions.\n\nClear drainage: Ensure gutters and storm drains are clear of debris to prevent localized flooding.\n\nMonitor burn scars: Residents near recent burn areas should stay alert for weather updates and be prepared to evacuate if debris flow warnings are issued.\n\nAvoid the surf: Stay away from rock jetties and the water, as large breaking waves and dangerous rip currents are expected.\n\nPrep for snow: If traveling through mountain passes Tuesday or Wednesday, carry tire chains and an emergency kit.\n\nThis report is based on information from the National Weather Service.",

    "description": "The agency, which regulates U.S. passports, began issuing cease and desist orders to not-for-profit libraries in late fall, informing them they were no longer authorized to participate in the Passport...",
    "fullText": "NORWICH, Conn. (AP) — The U.S. State Department has ordered certain public libraries nationwide to cease processing passport applications, disrupting a long-standing service that librarians say their communities have come to rely on and that has run smoothly for years.\n\nThe agency, which regulates U.S. passports, began issuing cease and desist orders to not-for-profit libraries in late fall, informing them they were no longer authorized to participate in the Passport Acceptance Facility program as of Friday.\n\n“We still get calls daily seeking that service,” said Cathleen Special, executive director of the Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut, where passport services were offered for 18 years but ceased in November after receiving the letter. “Our community was so used to us offering this.”\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the order was given because federal law and regulations “clearly prohibit non-governmental organizations” from collecting and retaining fees for a passport application. Government-run libraries are not impacted.\n\nThe spokesperson did not respond to questions as to why it has become an issue now and exactly how many libraries are impacted by the cease and desist order. In a statement, they said, “passport services has over 7,500 acceptance facilities nationwide and the number of libraries found ineligible makes up less than one percent of our total network.”\n\nThe American Library Association estimates about 1,400 mostly non-profit public libraries nationwide could potentially be affected, or about 15% of all public libraries, depending on how many offer passport services.\n\nDemocratic and Republican members of Congress from Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Maryland are pushing back, sending a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month asking him to extend the existing program until Congress finds a permanent solution.\n\n\"In a time when demand for passports is surging, libraries are among the most accessible passport acceptance facilities, particularly for working families and rural residents,” the members wrote.\n\nThe lawmakers' letter said people will have to travel long distances, take unpaid time off from work or forgo getting a passport when demand is surging due to Real ID requirements. If Republicans in Congress impose strict new voting rules, citizens could need their passport or birth certificate to register. People fearing immigration agents are also increasingly carrying passports to confirm their citizenship.\n\nThey said the change is particularly disruptive to their states, where many public libraries are structured as nonprofit entities. They predicted some libraries, which benefit financially from passport processing fees, will have to lay off staff, cut programs or close their doors if not allowed to continue providing passport services.\n\nPublic libraries are organized differently in each state. In Pennsylvania 85% of public libraries are non-profit organizations, versus being a department of a local municipal government. In Maine, it's 56%; Rhode Island, 54%, New York, 47% and Connecticut, 46%, according to the American Library Association.\n\nPennsylvania Reps. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat, and John Joyce, a Republican, have proposed bipartisan legislation that would allow 501(c)(3) non-profit public libraries to continue to serve as passport acceptance facilities by amending the Passport Act of 1920. A similar companion bill is pending in the Senate.\n\nDean, who first learned about the policy change from a library in her district that has provided passport services for 20 years, called the State Department's interpretation of the law “nonsense.”\n\nIn Joyce's rural, south-central Pennsylvania district, the Marysville-Rye Library is one of only two passport facilities serving the 556-square-mile Perry County, according to the letter to Rubio. Now the county courthouse will be the only remaining option.\n\nThe State Department noted that 99% of the U.S. population lives within 20 miles of a designated passport processing location, such as a post office, county clerk's office or government-run library authorized to accept in-person passport applications.\n\n“Should the removal of an ineligible facility affect passport services, we will work to identify new eligible program partners in the impacted area,” the agency spokesperson said.\n\nBut Special said the Norwich post office had often referred people to her library for passports when someone needed service outside regular hours or had children who needed to be watched and entertained while their parent filled out the paperwork. Library staff also assisted applicants with language barriers.\n\n“And now the burden falls on them to do all of it and that’s tough on them,\" she said of the post office down the street. \"I don’t know how they’re keeping up, to be honest, because it was such a popular service with us.”",

    "fullText": "(FOX40.COM) — The Sacramento Police Department is continuing its investigation into the tragic death of a 3-year-old boy.\n\nOfficers arrived at the 3300 block of Douglas St. around 12:30 p.m. Thursday for a medical aid call. They said they first found the child with serious injuries.\n\n“Despite life-saving measures, that boy was pronounced deceased on scene by fire personnel,” Allison Smith, a spokesperson for the Sacramento Police Department, said.\n\nPolice said the investigation is just beginning.\n\n“Currently, this is a suspicious death investigation and the Sacramento County Coroner’s Office will release the identity of the deceased after next of kin have been notified,” Smith said.\n\nFOX40 asked Smith about the nature of the child’s fatal injuries.\n\n“Right now, I just have preliminary information,” Smith said. “They were serious injuries in nature and enough to unfortunately cause them to pass away on scene.”\n\nOfficials also could not confirm whether or not any weapons were found at the scene.\n\n“We can tell you we’ve been in contact with the family members,” Smith said. “I don’t know specifically who was at home with the boy when this all occurred, but someone appeared to be at home and they contacted the fire department.”\n\nPolice said the scene appears to be contained, which means they do not believe there is any imminent threat to the public.\n\n“This is a tragic incident,” Smith said. “Any time a child dies, it’s difficult — unimaginably difficult for the family and everybody who responded to the scene … first responders, family members, loved ones.”\n\nOne neighbor, T. Henderson, has lived in the area for about ten years. She said this is the first time she’s seen something like this happen there.\n\n“It almost makes me want to cry,” Henderson said. “I’m still really in shock that this is actually happening this close to home.”\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact the Sacramento Police Department.

    "description": "It can take months to treat the fungal infections, which were first reported in the U.S. in 2024",
    "fullText": "Minnesota is seeing the largest outbreak of sexually transmitted ringworm in the U.S., with infections disproportionately affecting men who have sex with men.\n\nMore than 30 confirmed or suspected cases of the fungal infection have been reported in the state since last July, according to the Minnesota Department of Health, and all were within the Twin Cities metropolitan area.\n\nThe ringworm - known as trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII, or “TMVII” - was first reported in New York City in June 2024.\n\nMinnesota’s Health Department said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is aware of other sporadic cases in larger cities across the U.S.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Public Health previously said the first patient with TMVII had traveled to California before he was diagnosed in New York.\n\nTMVII has been circulating in Europe and among people who traveled to Southeast Asia for sex tourism for several years, but is not currently considered widespread in the U.S.\n\nTMVII is the only known sexually transmitted fungal infection, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nSometimes confused for eczema or psoriasis, TMVII spreads through skin-to-skin contact or exposure to fungal spores. The ringworm can spread through genital contact, as well as to the face, bottom, torso, arms and legs.\n\nIt can cause painful and itchy red, coin-like rashes, sometimes with bumps or pimples on top.\n\nInfections can vary in severity, sometimes leading to complications even with treatment.\n\nPatients may see lesions and open sores that increase the risk for secondary bacterial infections and lead to harmful inflammation.\n\n“Some patients might develop painful and persistent rashes that can lead to scarring or worsening infections that need to be treated with antibiotics,” health officials warned last month.\n\nDiagnosing TMVII infection requires advanced testing, although most labs have trouble distinguishing TMVII from two other fungal infections known as T. mentagrophytes and T. interdigitale, according to the CDC.\n\nPatients may require weeks or even months of oral medication, and people should avoid using steroid creams, as they will worsen TMVII infection.\n\nTo prevent exposure, people should avoid sexual contact if they or their partner has a new rash and avoid sharing personal items, such as clothing, towels, bedding and razors.\n\nItems should be washed and dried on high heat, and fungal spores can be killed with common disinfectants or strong detergents.\n\nPeople who believe they have a rash should make sure it is covered with bandages or clothing and wash their hands with soap after touching the infected area to reduce the risk of spread to other areas of the body.\n\n“While the overall public health risk is low, state health officials say MSM, people who use anonymous apps, and people with a history of sexually transmitted infections may be at higher risk,” according to the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
