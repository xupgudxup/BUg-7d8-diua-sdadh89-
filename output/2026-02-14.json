    "description": "FC Bayern stumbles to another win, extending their lead but leaving a lot to desire.",
    "fullText": "Bayern Munich maintained its lead atop the Bundesliga table following a 3-0 win over 16th-placed Werder Bremen, thanks to an early brace from Harry Kane and a third from Leon Goretzka in the second half. Here are some observations from the game.\n\nThe scoreline may be misleading, but this was not a particularly impressive showing from the Rekordmeister. Bayern faced issues in maintaining possession and controlling the midfield — largely due to a rather poor performance from Joshua Kimmich that has become somewhat characteristic of the German following his ankle injury in November last year. Bayern allowed Bremen far too much space while on the counter and did little to press and win back the ball. The style of play seemed uninspired and sloppy, with far too many mistakes that could have cost Bayern against a better opponent. Kimmich seemed to lose almost every duel he was a part of, and the midfield completely failed to constrict the home team, allowing Bremen to make it into Bayern’s box quite often and fairly easily. While the team did well going forward, the constant dispossession made the game a relatively unpleasant watch, given what fans have come to expect of a Bayern under Vincent Kompany.\n\nDespite Bayern’s repeated attempts to help Bremen create chances, they too were completely ineffective. Bremen played a very poor game in the first half (following the initial few minutes), failing to take advantage of Bayern’s lack of resistance in the midfield. It is no surprise that they are fighting relegation at present. Following the break, they seemed far hungrier, having added an extra forward despite being 2-0 down to help them exploit the spaces Bayern offered in many desperate attempts to score. Bremen also felt more structured in the second half, but were still quite susceptible to the slightest of Bayern’s press and failed to combine with much success in the face of goal.\n\nA lot of Bayern’s tardiness can be put down to the lineup. Far from Bayern’s best with key missing players, the team lacked the fluidity on the ball and the structured play. Kompany’s late substitutions certainly helped fix this issue, suggesting that more work needs to be done building chemistry with the non-regulars. All in all, Kompany did not put his best foot forward (and fairly so, in a game that Bayern was almost certain to win from the get-go) — which meant fans were treated to a slow, lackluster Bayern performance for most of the game. Nonetheless, the team got the job done.\n\nHaving established the faults in Bayern’s game, there were quite a few positives too. Lennart Karl put in a fantastic shift in the first half, winning a penalty and masking the absence of Michael Olise. Karl’s game was a pleasant and much-needed surprise following his rather lackluster showings as of late.\n\nGiven the midfield’s repeated failures, the defence was forced to bail Bayern out far too often, yet they did just that and more. Kim Min-jae seemed to be an impenetrable wall. This was one of Kim’s best performances at Bayern, constantly recovering or clearing the ball at the final moment. Jonathan Tah, who recieved the captain’s armband towards the end of the game, also deserves fair praise for his shift. Josip Stanišić started off strong, but quickly fell into his ways and began misplacing a fair few passes and losing possession. Konrad Laimer’s never-ending press was a breath of fresh air amongst a team that rarely put pressure on Bremen. Jonas Urbig, who came on for Neuer (following a presumed calf injury), also had a decent showing with a solid save.\n\nAlphonso Davies and Jamal Musiala both showed their class, making an immediate impact as they came on in the middle of the second half. Their involvement in Goretzka’s goal shows exactly why they are the best at what they do, combining quickly and so effectively to move the ball around in dangerous positions. They rejuvenated the team and brought with them a ferocity that seemed lost for vast parts of the game.\n\nOh, and it was cool to see Tom Bischof in midfield for once. Glad Kompany still sees a future from him.\n\nKane is firmly on track to come very close to Robert Lewandowski’s seemingly untouchable 41-goal record. Another fantastic penalty goal from the forward gave Bayern the lead, which he doubled with a screamer from outside the box. Kane constantly has fans in awe, and his first-half performance was no different. Aside from his scoring exploits, he played a great long pass to Luis Díaz that should have ended in a goal to further add to his playmaking catalogue. He did it again to put Serge Gnabry through on goal in the second half, and unfortunately, this, too, didn’t make it to the back of the net.\n\nPardon me if I’ve been sounding like a broken record. But Kane is quite easily the best striker in the world.\n\nSerge Gnabry had an abysmal showing today. He could not put a foot right, hesitated to shoot far too often, and wasted many of Bayern’s strongest chances. This comes as no surprise to those familiar with him. Gnabry has long been inconsistent and incompetent. There were very clear voices against the extension within the fanbase, and yet the club went ahead with it regardless, and now they will have to bear the consequences. Gnabry’s early-season purple patch has come to an end for yet another season, leaving fans to watch a player who moves far too slowly and feels prosaic on the ball. Consistently poor decision-making and shooting ability that has taken a dip (until next season, when it will inevitably return to accompany a brief run of games heavy with goal involvements before he gets injured, plays much worse, and the cycle continues).\n\nIt is a wonder if the Bayern management watches him play. Because such performances fail to justify the hefty wages he comes with.\n\nThat’s all for today’s observations. Do you agree? Disagree? And did you catch the subtle J. Cole reference? Tell us everything in the comments below. See you next time!",

    "description": "England got back to winning ways against Scotland but their T20 World Cup hopes look slim unless there are significant improvements, writes Matthew Henry.",
    "fullText": "Harry Brook's laugh as he began his post-match press conference said plenty.\n\n\"We haven't quite made it as easy as we would have liked so far,\" the relieved England captain said.\n\nAfter three games at this T20 World Cup, England have escaped against Nepal, been thrashed by West Indies and now come through a nervy win against Scotland.\n\nBeat Italy on Monday and they will be through to the Super 8s.\n\nFrom there, two wins from three, one of which could be against Zimbabwe, would be enough to reach a World Cup semi-final. Reach that point and anything can happen, or so they say.\n\nEngland edge to victory to leave Scotland on brink\n\nTucker's 94 keeps Ireland's World Cup hopes alive\n\nEngland have, of course, also been here before.\n\nThey have won three World Cups, two in the 20-over format and the 50-over competition in 2019, and on each occasion they lost at least once before going on to lift the trophy.\n\nAcross the nine previous men's T20 World Cups, only once, India last time around in 2024, has a team gone through the tournament unbeaten.\n\nA defeat at this stage, or an unconvincing performance like the one put in on Saturday in Kolkata, does not decide the eventual outcome.\n\nIndia were 77-6 against the United States, Australia were beaten by Zimbabwe and the much-fancied South Africa almost chucked away a winning position against Afghanistan in a tournament that has been more competitive from the start than any of its previous iterations.\n\nBut that does not mean poor performances can simply be ignored.\n\nYes, reach your peak at the right time.\n\nYou still have to show you are capable of reaching the top when tackling the foothills.\n\nOpener Phil Salt said on Friday \"nobody can live with\" England when \"we are at our best\" but they remain a long way from it.\n\nThis five-wicket victory margin, sealed with 10 balls to spare, suggested a more comfortable afternoon than England had in reality.\n\nAgain there was jeopardy - Jos Buttler failing to reach 40 for the eighth time for England this year, Salt offering too much famine amid the feast, an uncertainty among batters when the ball moves and, most worryingly, another refusal to learn while the game is in its flow.\n\nEight of Scotland's 10 wickets fell as batters attempted to sweep, pull or heave the ball into the leg side. Having watched that, Jacob Bethell, Brook and Sam Curran took it upon themselves to ensure more catching practice was offered.\n\nIt is no surprise Tom Banton, who missed with a sweep early on and then put the shot away entirely, went on to be England's highest scorer and match-winner.\n\nBanton's knock was a breakthrough moment for a batter who, having been handed a debut aged 20 in 2019, had only made four fifties across his 36 previous innings.\n\nHere he looked far more mature than he did back on that tour of New Zealand, or the home summer that followed and his success pushes away any doubts over the make-up of the top order.\n\nBen Duckett's route into the XI appears to have been blocked.\n\nThere have been other positives for England over the past week in India.\n\nJofra Archer was more threatening, more accurate, against Scotland after conceding 90 runs combined against Nepal and West Indies.\n\nHaving rehired fielding coach Carl Hopkinson after the whoopsies spread through the squad during the Ashes, England's catching has also been immaculate and Curran, this dismissal aside, has proven dependable in crucial moments.\n\nBut still England are clinging to the hope that something will eventually click, that something will simply fall into place and provide them with their first complete performance of the competition.\n\nIt may come - possibly, should they beat Italy, on a flight back to the comfort of Sri Lanka where they won 3-0 before this trip - but right now England do not seem entirely clear where to look.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Brook, asked why his side have not found their groove. \"Things haven't seemed to have clicked so far yet.\"\n\nBrook was part of England's squads at the 2022 and 2024 World Cups, which both began badly before turning in differing directions.\n\nIn 2022, England lost to Ireland but responded by comprehensively beating a New Zealand side that just thrashed hosts Australia by 89 runs.\n\nEngland need a similar performance soon to reboot their tournament because right now it feels more akin to their efforts in 2024, when their only wins came against Oman, Namibia, the United States and West Indies.\n\nEngland reached the semi-finals on that trip around the Caribbean but were beaten each time they faced the real contenders - Australia, South Africa and India.\n\nIn truth, the spark from England's white-ball sides has been absent going back much further, ever since that night in Melbourne in November 2022.\n\nIt was absent at the 2023 World Cup, in the Caribbean in 2024 and at the Champions Trophy in Pakistan last year when the hiring of Brendon McCullum as white-ball coach failed to raise them from their slump and they left without winning a match.\n\nBrook says it is the \"belief\" in the squad that makes him confident this tournament would be more like 2022 than 2024.\n\n\"We've been in this situation before where we have lost a game early and World Cups aren't always smooth sailing,\" he said.\n\nOutside of the dressing room, that belief is waning.\n\nIf Brook cannot find it then coach McCullum must because an underwhelming run to the semi-finals did not save former coach Matthew Mott his job in 2024.\n\nSalt thinks England can beat anyone on their day and it is time for them to pinpoint a date in the calendar.\n\nMost of sport's successful teams have had an arrogant streak. Crucially, though, it needs to be earned.\n\nThe Scotland win ensured they remain alive but England have no chance of winning this World Cup if they do not improve.",

    "description": "Following the three-team format that the NBA is utilizing, who makes this year's fantasy All-Star team?",
    "fullText": "The All-Star break is a great opportunity for teams to reset. With less than two months until the playoffs, players get a chance to recover from nagging injuries and coaches can reset mentally before the final stretch of a lengthy regular season.\n\nFantasy managers get the opportunity to do the same. A week off from scouring the waiver wire as soon as you wake up. The fantasy playoffs in many leagues will start March 2, which means there are only a couple weeks left until the postseason. Start making moves now to maximize your games played during your playoffs.\n\nWaiver wire adds can push your team to a championship, but you can only be in that situation if your stars are healthy and dominating. For this year’s fantasy All-Stars, I went with players that have been both excellent and available. The games played minimum is set at 35, so roughly two-thirds of a player’s possible games played. That led to some studs not making the cut, such as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid and Austin Reaves, even if they have all been incredible and can be difference-makers down the stretch if healthy.\n\nUsing the NBA’s new All-Star roster format of Team World, Team USA (old guys) and Team USA (young guys), we have our 24 fantasy All-Stars. Having a team with a few of these guys likely means you’re sitting near the top of your standings and preparing for the postseason (unless you have some ridiculous bad luck, which happens in fantasy).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Jokic headlines Team World. He missed about a month with a knee injury, which was unfortunate, but he is back to dominating already. He has been the best player in fantasy basketball of the 2020s, which hasn’t changed this season.\n\nThe reigning MVP missed the final five games before the All-Star break, but he only missed two games prior to that and has been dominant all season. His counting stats are slightly down from last season, but he has been even more efficient.\n\nSan Antonio has managed Wemby’s minutes for most of the season, but he has still been able to replicate his production from last season while being even more efficient. He has the Spurs just three games out of first in the West.\n\nDoncic was still incredible last season, but after a tumultuous year for him, he has gotten back to producing like he did during the 2023-24 season. LeBron James has been better recently, but both he and Austin Reaves have missed time this year. The Lakers are 5th in the West because of how dominant Doncic has been.\n\nMurray is making his first All-Star appearance this weekend, and he has also had the best fantasy season of his career. He is averaging career highs in points, rebounds, assists and three-pointers per game while also posting the best field goal percentage of his career. Everyone else in Denver has missed significant time this year, but Murray has kept them afloat.\n\nAfter struggling during the 2024-25 season, Markkanen bounced back in a big way this year. He’s averaging career highs in points, assists and steals in what has been arguably the best statistical season of his career. Hopefully we’ll get to see him keep it up down the stretch of this season.\n\nWith Fred VanVleet (knee) sidelined for the season, Sengun has stepped up as the primary facilitator in Houston. He is averaging career highs in assists, steals and blocks, which has helped him lead the Rockets to the 4th-best record in the West.\n\nIn his second season, Sarr has taken drastic strides on both ends of the floor. His field goal percentage is up over 10 percent from last year, and he is posting career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. He’s going to be a fantasy star for a long time. Unfortunately, he’s set to miss some time with a hamstring injury.\n\nThe most (pleasantly) surprising thing about Leonard cracking this list is that he has played enough games. He has missed some time, but he has been available for most of the year and has been playing some of the best basketball of his career. He is averaging career highs in points and three-pointers per game while also shooting the best free throw percentage of his career.\n\nMitchell is averaging a career high in points per game to go with the best field goal percentage of his career. The Cavs are 17-5 over their last 22 games, and Mitchell will look to take his team further in the playoffs with his new backcourt partner James Harden.\n\nThe man that has singlehandedly been keeping the Warriors afloat in recent years just keeps on getting it done. He missed the final five games entering the All-Star break but has been mostly available this season. Surprise, surprise, he’s leading the league in triples per game again.\n\nHarden’s 25.0 points per game this year are his highest average since the 2019-20 season, when he led the league with 34.3 points per game. He’s not that MVP caliber player that he once was, but he has had an excellent year and will look to keep that going with the Cavs down the stretch of this season.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to matter what jersey KD is wearing. He’s going to put up an efficient 25 points per game. He’s only missed five games this season, which is impressive at 37 years old. Durant is clearly still one of the best scorers in the NBA.\n\nMPJ’s value in Denver deteriorated, which led to him being shipped to Brooklyn for Cam Johnson. This is the first time in his career that he has been a top scoring option, and he has taken advantage of the opportunity, averaging career highs in points, assists and three-pointers per game.\n\nBridges’ usage is down this season, but he is posting a career high in assists per game while also averaging his most steals per game since his second year in the league. He has cooled down in recent weeks, but he’s done enough over the course of the season to make this list.\n\nIf White’s field goal percentage wasn’t below 40 percent for the first time in his career, we’d be looking at White as a top-10 player in fantasy basketball this season. He is averaging career highs in points, assists, steals and blocks. Boston is 2nd in the East entering the All-Star break, and White has helped them have success without Jayson Tatum.\n\nSomehow, Maxey just keeps getting better. He is averaging career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and three-pointers per game. The 76ers are officially his team, though the reemergence of Joel Embiid will give them a chance to really make some noise in the East. We’re officially in fantasy superstar status for Maxey.\n\nMurphy has been one of the lone bright spots in New Orleans this season. He is averaging career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and three-pointers per game, though that hasn’t been enough to make this team competitive. Hopefully this right shoulder injury won’t keep him sidelined for the rest of this season.\n\nEdwards seems to improve on something every season, but this year he simply became a better scorer. His rim, mid-range and three-point percentage are all the best marks of his career, which had led to a career-high in points per game.\n\nToronto has been much better as a team this season, and Barnes has been a big part of that. He’s having the most efficient scoring season of his career while still stuffing the stat sheet across the board. There aren’t many players in the league that are more tailored for fantasy basketball than Barnes.\n\nJohnson made a huge leap last season, but he has somehow done it again this year. He’s second in the league in both double-doubles and triple-doubles while also averaging a bunch of career highs across the board. Atlanta handed him the keys by dealing Trae Young to Washington, and Johnson has taken advantage.\n\nDetroit has the fewest losses in the league entering the All-Star break, and Cunningham has been at the center of it all. The efficiency has been average, but he has poured in the counting stats across the board. He may not win the award, but there is a reason Cade is in the middle of the MVP race.\n\nAfter only playing 32 games last season, Holmgren has barely missed time this year and has been excellent for fantasy managers. He’s averaging career highs in points and rebounds per game while also ranking in the top-five in blocks per game.\n\nIf anyone saw this list during the preseason, George would be the biggest surprise, but he has been that good. He has taken a monster leap forward on offense after being behind Isaiah Collier in the rotation to end last season. George was one of the best late-round picks this year, and he should continue to dominate when he returns from this ankle injury.",

    "fullText": "In the last three drafts, Brian Gutekunst has selected two quarterbacks on Day 3. The Green Bay Packers general manager drafted Sean Clifford in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft and Michael Pratt in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nWith Jordan Love's backup, Malik Willis set to hit the open market and fetch a big payday, the Packers could be in the market to invest another Day 3 pick as they look to find a new backup for Love.\n\nLet's dive into some Day 3 quarterbacks who could be targets for the Packers during the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe winningest quarterback in college football history started his collegiate career at South Dakota State University, where he helped guide the Jackrabbits to two national championships. He has that \"it\" factor and he's not going to sink the ship. He'd keep Green Bay’s offense on track if he were forced into action. Much like Willis, the former SDSU quarterback can do damage with his legs. This past season at Iowa, he picked up 49 first downs with his legs. During his time in Brookings, he picked up 146 first downs on the ground and also had 60 runs of 10-plus yards.\n\nMark Gronowski is tough as nails.

The southpaw quarterback threw for 2,719 yards and 16 touchdowns. Payton added 777 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. A former baseball player, Payton has the arm strength to rip throws into tight windows. He's able to navigate the rush and make accurate throws on the move. He has good acceleration when he gets outside the pocket and runs with the determination of a running back.\n\nNDSU QB Cole Payton is one of those draft, stash, & “develop” QB prospects you take mid draft. \n\nCrazy throw right here lol. Multiple reasons to buy in and see what you can mold him into. pic.twitter.com/RYnL21qVyW\n\n— Damian Parson💰 (@DP_NFL) February 6, 2026\n\nMrton has a quick setup and gets the ball out quickly. He sees the field well and understands where his outlets are. He's athletic in the pocket and comfortable making throws outside the pocket. He's got good zip on short and intermediate throws and shows good accuracy. Over the past two seasons, Morton threw for 5,900 yards and 47 touchdowns.\n\nBehren Morton is a productive and multi-faceted QB with elastic arm action, placing among nations leaders in categories of both efficiency and explosiveness@BehrenMorton also sits among the top of @TexasTechFB record books for career passing yds + total offense #WreckEm https://t.co/JHBsJ9lQ8t pic.twitter.com/cGLixeoPrd\n\n— Shane Coughlin (@Shane__Coughlin) January 10, 2026\n\nThe transfer from Boise State, Green passed for 5,868 yards and 34 touchdowns during his two seasons at Arkansas. Standing at 6-6 and 229 pounds, Green looks good off the bus and he has a rocket for an arm. Now it will be up to an NFL coaching staff to harness that natural arm strength and help him spray the ball accurately all over the field. Green can do damage with his legs, rushing for 1,379 yards and 16 touchdowns during his two seasons with the Razorbacks.\n\nA Texas native, Robertson started his collegiate career at Mississippi State before transferring to Baylor. This past season, Robertson threw for 3,681 yards and 31 touchdowns. He's a natural gunslinger with easy-looking arm talent. He has a quick reaction to get the ball out and on time.\n\nUSD's all-time leader in passing yards and completions is going to impress teams when he gets in front of them. He's a leader and an impressive individual off the field. At 6-5, 225 pounds, the USD quarterback is well built. He finished this past season with 2,876 yards and 26 touchdowns. The Minnesota native and Iowa State transfer has ties to Green Bay. Bouman's father, Todd Bouman, a long-time backup NFL quarterback, spent a minute with the Packers in 2006 as the team's backup quarterback after Aaron Rodgers got injured.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: 6 QB targets for Packers on Day 3 of 2026 NFL Draft",

    "fullText": "In the immediate aftermath of the Chicago Bears’ playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams and the game-losing interception on which DJ Moore seemed to run a poor route, I decided I’d had enough.\n\nAll the effort questions, the statistical regression, the ducking of the questions about it after it happened. Yeah, I was ready to see Moore traded pretty much as soon as it could be done.\n\nIt actually only took about a week for me to change my mind, or at least to back off the more aggressive part of my take.\n\nAfter all, any debate about his effort should also include the fact that it’s probably a wonder he’s even on the field most weeks. We’ve seen him stick around after taking crushing blows to his back, turning his angle 90 degrees, and pulling up lame. (He’d already come back from the blue tent in that Rams game, as people have noted since then.) Ryan Poles has also praised his toughness and the way it carries over to his teammates.\n\nDoes he need to be better? Yeah. I’m sure he’d be the first to tell you that. Is he still a good player? Also yes.\n\nWhich brings me to where I am now with Moore.\n\nThe Bears should listen to phone calls on Moore’s availability, as they should for most players not named Caleb Williams. And, unless a team offers something Poles can’t refuse, they should politely hang up the phone and let Moore redeem himself next season. Because I can already feel it: his 2026 campaign is aligning perfectly with the Bears’ overall tear-stuff-up arc I’m seeing develop.\n\nYou could hear it from Moore himself when he and Williams won the NFL Honors award for Moment of the Year on that walk-off TD catch against the Packers in Week 16: “We can look forward to causing havoc to the league next year,” he said on stage while accepting the award.\n\nCaleb Williams' Hail Mary to DJ Moore is the Next Gen Stats Moment of the Year 🐻 @awscloud\n\nNFL Honors on NBC/NFL Network\nStream on @NFLPlus & Peacock pic.twitter.com/yiOgQuqf8V\n\nWe. Doesn’t sound like a guy who wants to be anywhere else.\n\nThen, you have head coach Ben Johnson getting snubbed for Coach of the Year in the most egregious way possible, earning just one vote for the turnaround job he just pulled off in Chicago.\n\nYou have people regularly saying Drake Maye would be a Chicago Bear right now if you were to re-draft the 2024 class.\n\nYou can only imagine how motivated these guys are going to be to prove everyone wrong. That especially goes for Moore, who just failed to reach 1,000 receiving yards two seasons in a row for the first time in his career. He’s been too good a player in his career to go out like that, and he still has \n\nMoore just got his first taste of being on a winning team, and it didn’t end quite the way he or the Bears wanted. But more than just about any player on the roster aside from Williams, he now had something to prove in the most desperate way. And we’ve seen what he can be when he’s at his best.\n\nSo you know what? I’m invested. I love a good comeback story. Don’t trade Moore. Let him stew on this frustration. Let’s see if it drives him, and the Bears, to new heights. If going through this rough patch means we get 1,300-yard DJ Moore back, a little pain might’ve been worth it.",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola has delivered an honest assessment of City’s performance following our 2-0 FA Cup win over Salford.\n\nThe Blues booked our place in the fifth round of the competition with a hard-fought success over the Ammies at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nAn own goal from the visitors’ Alfie Dorrington after sixth minutes gave the hosts a strong start, but it took until the 85th for City to find a second when substitute Marc Guehi poked home from close range.\n\nDespite the four divisions separating the teams, it was a closely fought cup tie at the Etihad – and Guardiola says his side didn’t read the game situations quick enough to hurt our opponent.\n\n“After 2-0 [was better]. We didn’t read the spaces where they were. Always the spaces we attack depends on where the defend and we didn’t read it.\n\n“We have to spend a lot of time to make the process quicker and better. The only good news is we go through.\n\n“Would be nice to say that mentally we’re exhausted but this is our job and we have to do what we have to do.\n\n“We didn’t read the spaces, that’s why everything was flat and slow and it was not good.”\n\nCity’s FA Cup tie with Salford was our 14th outing since the turn of the year as we continue to fight on four fronts in 2025/26.\n\nAlthough Guardiola admitted it’s been mentally and physically taxing period for his side, the Catalan believes fatigue wasn’t the cause of the Blues flat display against the Ammies.\n\nHe added: “It has been tough but not just this two weeks, since November it’s been every three days and that’s a lot.\n\n“I know what they want it but we didn’t read what we should do and that sometimes happens. I know how to defined my players.\n\n“Maybe we didn’t transmit what we should do. Max Alleyne cannot drop them, Rayan on the left is better.\n\n“It’s not the point, when they are on the left and tight, we have to move the ball quick to the opposite side and we didn’t do it. That’s why it was boring.”",

    "fullText": "Ciro Ferrara believes that Juventus’ players will not require much motivation to face Inter Milan in the upcoming clash. Both clubs are preparing for the latest edition of the Derby d’Italia, which promises to be another thrilling encounter.\n\nThe reverse fixture this season produced seven goals, with Juve narrowly securing victory in a high-scoring affair. The Bianconeri will be eager to claim wins in both meetings, though achieving this will be challenging given Inter’s ambition to secure the Serie A title once again.\n\nInter have performed well throughout the season and currently occupy the top of the standings, giving them a significant opportunity to challenge for the championship. Despite their advantage, the team recognises that any fixture against Juventus is inherently demanding, and they will need to demonstrate their quality on the pitch.\n\nJuve, meanwhile, understands the importance of the game and is fully aware of its intensity. The players are expected to be highly motivated, and the match represents a crucial test of their ability to compete with one of the league’s strongest sides.\n\nLuciano Spalletti (Photo by Enrico Locci/Getty Images)\n\nLuciano Spalletti will focus on preparing the team tactically, ensuring they are ready for the challenges posed by Inter. However, Ferrara does not anticipate that the Bianconeri will require additional motivational guidance. Speaking via Tuttojuve, he said:\n\n“Perhaps, in some circumstances, there’s no need for the coach to prepare for the match from a motivational standpoint. He certainly prepares it from a technical and tactical standpoint, but from a motivational standpoint, these are games that prepare themselves.”\n\nThe Derby d’Italia is a fixture that inherently inspires intensity and focus, and Juventus’ squad is expected to respond accordingly. While tactical preparation remains essential, the historical significance and competitive nature of the match are likely to drive the players’ determination, ensuring a fiercely contested encounter between two of Italy’s leading sides.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani’s English may be getting better, but he doesn’t plan on getting rid of his interpreter anytime soon.\n\nAt spring training in Glendale, Arizona, on Friday, Ohtani was asked by Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register if he would continue to need the services of Will Ireton, his interpreter.\n\nEarlier this year, Ohtani accepted his National League Most Valuable Player Award, and he gave his acceptance speech in English.\n\nThe two-minute-long address prompted Plunkett to wonder if Ireton “would soon be out of a job.”\n\nLucky for Ireton, Ohtani dismissed the idea.\n\n“I still need him because there might be some bullies out there that might give me some weird questions that I’m sure he can handle,” Ohtani said\n\nPlunkett added that Ohtani then gave him “the first side-eye of the spring.”\n\nOhtani may be coming off back-to-back World Series championships, but he’s not taking his foot off the gas.\n\nNot only is the squad going for what would be the first three-peat in nearly 30 years, but Manager Dave Roberts said he expects Ohtani to compete for the Cy Young Award.\n\nOhtani last received votes for the Cy Young in 2022, when he was still with the Los Angeles Angels, but at least one other MLB superstar thinks the two-way player’s pitching may be overhyped.\n\nBlue Jay Vladimir Guerrero Jr. said Ohtani “wasn’t that tough to hit” in last year’s World Series.\n\nWhile Ohtani struggled on the mound in his two games and gave up a big home run to Guerrero, he also struck the Toronto slugger out twice.\n\nAnd the World Series may have been an aberration for Ohtani on the mound. Earlier in the playoffs, he famously hit three home runs and struck out 10 batters in the same game, the first time an MLB player has ever accomplished that feat in the playoffs.\n\nAnd that performance made waves beyond baseball, with some calling it the best single performance by a player in any sport.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal lead Manchester City by four points at the top of the Premier League table, yet many of the Gunners’ supporters remain uneasy. In recent seasons, City have dominated the title race, with themselves and Liverpool sharing the championship between them since 2018.\n\nLiverpool, despite being the defending champions, has not matched their usual standards this term, which has strengthened the perception that this could finally be Arsenal’s season. The Gunners have placed themselves in a strong position and will be determined to ensure they capitalise on the opportunity.\n\nIn previous campaigns, Arsenal have fallen short in decisive moments, and their recent reduction to a four-point advantage has heightened anxiety among some supporters. With 12 matches remaining, the margin for error is slim, and any dropped points could quickly shift the balance of the title race.\n\nThe players at the Emirates Stadium understand the importance of maintaining focus and composure. Consistency, discipline, and mental resilience will be essential if they are to convert their current position into a league triumph. The closing stages of the season often test a squad’s depth and resolve, particularly when facing a rival with Manchester City’s experience and pedigree.\n\nPep Guardiola has acknowledged the psychological dimension of the title race. Speaking via Metro Sports, he said:\n\n‘I would prefer to be in the position Arsenal are in than our position.\n\n‘If I would be in the position with four points in front of second, with 12 games left, I would not be relaxed. Imagine being four points behind, I am less relaxed.\n\n‘I would still prefer to be in the position Arsenal are in than we are.’\n\nGuardiola’s comments underline the tension on both sides of the contest. While Arsenal hold the advantage, Manchester City’s pursuit ensures the race remains intense. The coming weeks will likely determine whether the Gunners can withstand the pressure and secure the title ahead of their closest challengers.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!

    "fullText": "Washington saw its flickering NCAA Tournament hopes fully extinguished with a dispiriting home less to Penn St this week. What once looked like a drive to the finish now looks frighteningly like the Dawgs having to play out the string against the fellow Big 10 bottom-dwellers. The Huskies welcome one of those bottom-dwellers to Alaska Airlines Arena on Saturday evening when the Minnesota Golden Gophers (11-13, 4-9) come to Seattle.\n\nThe Gophers are led by big, versatile guard Cade Tyson. The 6’7” averages over 19 points, 5 rebounds, and 2 assists per game while shooting 49% overall and 39% from three. He has a bizarre shooting split with 45% from outside at home and 18% on the road (but many more games and attempts at home pulling up the average). The Gopher offense focuses on ball movement, with four players averaging between 2.4-4.5 assists per game and another four with more than 4 3PA per game. First-year HC Niko Medved has shown improvement, but the formula has not translated into many wins in conference. After early wins against Iowa and Indiana, the Gophers have lost eight of their last nine, although the one win was over a top-10 Michigan St team.\n\nOverall, the Gophers have been poor away from home, only beating Northwestern outside of Williams Arena. Does that show a unique talent against purple teams, or can the Dawgs bounce back from the Penn St game? The game will tip off at 6:00 PM PT and will air on NBC Sports/Peacock.",

Instead, Makhachev successfully defended his title against replacement opponent Renato Moicano, and then left the lightweight division to move up to 170 pounds.\n\nAnd now that he’s gone, Tsarukyan believes no one in the lightweight division can outwrestle him.\n\n“Right now, at 155? Nobody,” Tsarukyan told Demetrious Johnson when ’Mighty Mouse’ asked him who could outwrestle him. “I shouldn’t worry. It was Islam, but he went up.”\n\n“He doesn’t waste energy,” Tsarukyan added. “He’s so calm, too.”\n\nThat’s high praise coming from Tsarukyan, who is one of the premier grapplers in the UFC at the moment.

    "description": "Could the Cowboys look to trade UP in the 2026 NFL Draft?",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NFL Draft quickly approaching, mock drafts and draft conversation are at their peak. For the Dallas Cowboys, who currently do not own a day two pick in the draft, many fans and analysts are looking at potential trade back scenarios from the 12th or 20th overall pick to pickup an additional second- or third-round pick on day two.\n\nBut Zach Wolchuk of 105.3 The Fan asked an interesting question on Twitter on Thursday that got the brain spinning. Could the Cowboys use their two first-round picks this year to move up in the draft, while also picking up a day two pick with their trade partner?\n\nIn Wolchuk’s scenario, he asked if people would be okay trading the 12th and 20th overall pick to the Cleveland Browns for the 6th and 39th overall pick? In most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent. But in this draft class that is substantially weaker than most, first round grades will likely max out at around 14. So realistically, the player the Cowboys would be drafting at 20 will more than likely have a second-round grade. If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nIn most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent.

If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nDallas trades the 12th and 20th (616 value points) overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft to Cleveland for the 6th and 39th (599 value points) overall pick. Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the sixth overall pick and edge rusher R Mason Thomas with the 39th overall pick.\n\nDallas trades the 12th, 20th, and 215th overall pick (617 value points) to the New Orleans for the 8th, 42nd, 73rd, and 189th (618 value points) overall pick. Using Pro Football Focus’ draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the eighth overall pick, cornerback Colton Hood with the 42nd overall pick, and linebacker Jacob Rodriguez with the 73rd overall pick.\n\nDallas offers the 12th, 20th, and 150th overall pick (629 value points) to Kansas City for the 9th and 74th overall pick and cornerback Trent McDuffie (619 value points). Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. with the ninth overall pick and safety Kamari Ramsey with the 74th overall pick.\n\nWith both the New York Giants and Washington Commanders picking inside the top 10 and unlikely to hand their divisional rival a blue chip talent, that leaves just a handful of spots that make sense for the Cowboys to consider. Given the value it would take to move into the top five, th Cowboys only have a few options to consider, but those couple options could give the Cowboys a chance at a player they would not be able to consider at 12, while also landing a quality player on day two and/or three.\n\nThere are only a few players likely to motivate the Cowboys to trade up in this draft. Ohio State safety Caleb Downs being one. Miami edge rusher Reuben Bain Jr. being one. But players like Texas Tech edge rusher David Bailey, LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane, and Ohio State linebacker Sonny Styles are also a few names to consider in this exercise.",

    "title": "Phillies All-Star One and Dones: The 1940s Part 1",
    "description": "A decade of irrelevance produced many one-time All-Stars",
    "fullText": "In honor of the Philadelphia Phillies playing host to the 2026 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Citizens Bank Park, we here at The Good Phight are launching a yearlong series that focuses on the history of the Phillies and the All-Star Game. Check back regularly for posts about the Phillies participation (or lack thereof) in the Midsummer Classic over its history.\n\nLast time in this series, we learned about the three players from the 1930s Phillies era that appeared in one career All-Star game. Today, we’ll move on to the 1940s. To be completely transparent, there were a lot of them in this decade, as the Phillies were not a particularly good ballclub then (shocker I know), so we’re going to break them up into two posts.\n\nA 5’11 third baseman from Indiana, Merrill “Pinky” May signed with the New York Yankees upon graduating Indiana University in 1932. May was a star centerfielder at his alma mater and served as c0-captain of a Big 10 Championship team his senior year. College was also where he was bestowed the nickname of “Pinky” due to his face often turning bright red when he was angry. The Yankees sent May to the minor leagues to begin his professional career, and unfortunately for May, that is where he would remain throughout his Yankees tenure. May advanced as high as Double-A Newark by 1935, but he was trapped there through the 1938 season.\n\nThat was when May was drafted by the Phillies out of the Yankees farm system. He would go on to make his MLB debut with Philadelphia in 1939 at the fresh young age of 28. May appeared in 135 games with the Phillies his rookie year, hitting .287 with 32 extra-base hits, despite suffering a late spring training injury on March 30th when he twisted his spinal column chasing a pop-up.\n\nMay got off to a strong start in 1940, as he was hitting .330 with 24 RBIs through the end of June. Despite the Phillies having the worst record in baseball at 23-44 at the time of the All-Star game, the Phillies sent four representatives to the game, and May’s performance was good enough to be one of them. He was joined by pitchers Hugh Mulcahy (more on him later) and Kirby Higbe as well as manager Doc Prothro at Sportsman’s Park in St. Louis.\n\nNone of the Phillies player representatives started, but May did find his way into the game as a defensive replacement in the sixth inning for the Dodgers’ Cookie Lavagetto with the National League leading 3-0. May came to the plate in the bottom half of the inning to face the Tigers’ Bobo Newsom and flew out to center in a full count. The Phillies third baseman got another chance to hit in the bottom of the eighth with a runner on third and two outs. But the first pitch from Cleveland’s Bob Feller hit May, putting runners at the corners for the Cardinals’ own Terry Moore, but Feller erased the threat with a strikeout. Nevertheless, despite the Phillies’ rather small impact, the NL went on to beat the AL by a final score of 4-0.\n\nMay went on to finish the 1940 season hitting .293 with a .954 fielding percentage at third. He would play three more years for the Phillies, hitting a very pedestrian .264 with a .667 OPS. Then in 1944, the 33-year-old May enlisted in the Navy where he played for the Great Lakes Naval Station team before being deployed to the Pacific theater of World War II. While there, May played for baseball teams that entertained soldiers fighting on the front lines. He was eventually stationed on the island of Tinian, where his makeshift home was less than 100 yards from an airstrip where he watched American B-29 bombers take off for bombing runs over Japan. One such plane he witnessed take off in 1945 was the Enola Gay leaving on its mission on August 6th to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.\n\nAfter the war, May returned to the Phillies but never again appeared in a Major League game. He was released by Philadelphia on May 7th, 1946, and rather than sign with the Pirates as a third baseman, May decided to pursue a managerial career. He first served as a player-manager for the Pirates Single-A affiliate in Albany before moving to the Cleveland organization through 1962. He then had his final stops in the systems of the Yankees and Reds, during the latter of which May became the last person to manage Satchel Paige in 1966 with the Peninsula Grays of the Carolina League. May then made his way back to the Cleveland organization where he managed his son Milt before finally retiring in 1972.\n\nLike his teammate May, Hugh Mulcahy was also a representative of the Phillies at the 1940 All-Star game. Nicknamed “losing pitcher”, Mulcahy led all of baseball in losses twice in six seasons with the Phillies. At the time of the All-Star break in 1940, Mulcahy had a 7-10 record but that was despite a solid 3.44 ERA. That was even after Mulcahy allowed eight runs in just 1.1 IP against the Giants a mere four days before the All-Star game. Luckily for Mulcahy, his numbers were still good enough to get him named to the NL’s team. Unluckily for him however, he did not see the field in the game.\n\nThat bad luck seemed to foreshadow much of his next calendar year. Mulcahy returned to the Phillies after the break and won his first five starts, all of which were complete games, to bring his season record above .500 for the first time since June 27th. But the reality of playing on the 1940 Phillies came crashing back down on Mulcahy, as he then embarked on a twelve-game losing streak that started on August 4th and didn’t end until Mulcahy’s last start of the season on September 27th. He didn’t pitch as bad as one might think over such a streak though, as he averaged over 7 innings pitched per start, including two starts where he pitched past the ninth inning, but nevertheless Mulcahy still sported a 4.90 ERA over that span and allowed five or more runs in five of those starts.\n\nThe hits kept coming (literally and metaphorically) for Mulcahy. He finished the 1940 season with a respectable 3.60 ERA but led all of baseball in losses with 22 and surrendered the most hits of any pitcher with 283. That season would be Mulcahy’s last until 1945, as his bad luck was capped off by being drafted into the Army on March 8th, 1941, notably becoming the first MLB player drafted into the military. The date of which Mulcahy was drafted had the added touch of bad luck by occurring nine months before the United States’ entry into World War II. It was also right on the eve of Mulcahy possibly being bought by the Brooklyn Dodgers, who finished second in the NL in 1940, for the price of $75,000. The timing ended up costing Mulcahy five full seasons in the Majors, having left for the Army at age 26 and returning at age 31.\n\nUltimately, Mulcahy would pitch in only 23 more MLB games after being honorably discharged by the Army on August 5th, 1945. He played in Philadelphia until asking for and being granted a release following the 1946 season. Mulcahy then signed with the Pirates who ultimately released him on May 11th after appearing in only two games. He then bounced around the minor leagues for the Chicago White Sox before retiring in 1951 and embarking on a career as a pitching coach.\n\nNot many people may have ever heard of Danny Litwhiler, but he continues to impact the game today in ways you wouldn’t expect. A Ringtown, Pennsylvania native and Bloomsburg University graduate, Litwhiler originally signed with the Detroit Tigers organization in 1936. He suffered a pair of major injuries to his ankle and knee over the next few years, resulting in Litwhiler being released by the Tigers in 1939. He joined his brother at a tryout for the Baltimore Orioles, and after waiting for a promised call that never came, finally discovered that the scout that wanted to sign him was John Ogden, who in the meantime had been hired as general manager of the Phillies and wanted to sign him to play in Philadelphia instead.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Dutch outfielder made his MLB debut with the Phillies in 1940 after recovering from knee surgery stemming from his injury with the Tigers. He appeared in just 36 games but hit .345 with 5 home runs. Littwhiler got down ballot MVP votes in his first full season in 1941 when he finished the year hitting .305/.350/.466. He wasn’t as impressive in 1942, as he was hitting just .265 by the end of June, but Litwhiler had not yet committed an error in the outfield after having a Major League leading 14 errors the previous year.\n\nThat defensive improvement was good enough to earn Litwhiler a spot at the All-Star game as the 21-54 Phillies lone representative at the Polo Grounds. The National League was defeated 3-1 thanks in large part to a two-run homer in the first inning from Rudy York of the Tigers, but Litwhiler was actually able to see some action. He entered the game as a pinch hitter in the sixth and hit the first pitch he saw from Detroit’s Al Benton into right for a single. His effort was quickly erased though, as the Cardinals’ Jimmy Brown grounded into a double play.\n\nLitwhiler returned to the Phillies and finished the season hitting a very pedestrian .271/.310/.389. However, he became the first player in MLB history to play a full season without recording an error, a remarkable accomplishment considering his previous history of poor defense. Perhaps part of that success could be due to his fielding glove’s fingers being tied together by rawhide, the first time any player had done that to a glove in the Majors.\n\nThe following year, Litwhiler and fellow outfielder Earl Naylor were traded to the Cardinals in exchange for Herman Coaker Triplett, Dain Clay, and Elvin “Buster” Adams, all of which were also outfielders. The surprise trade of Litwhiler angered the Phillies fanbase who were given a “frothing-at-the-mouth argument that will enable them to take their minds off war worries for a few minutes” according to Stan Baumgartner of the Philadelphia Inquirer. Baumgartner wrote in the paper that fan reaction was very “bitter” and even talked to one man with a Texas accent who remarked “I saw that Clay play in the Texas League- and if he’s a big leaguer, I’m a storm trooper.”\n\nThings worked out pretty good for Litwhiler at least, as he was a member of the 1944 World Series champion Cardinals while the Phillies continued to wallow in loathing and self-pity. Litwhiler, who was previously ineligible for military service due to his knee injury, was accepted for limited service in the Army in 1945 and rose to be recreation director for the 10,000 soldiers stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington state. He returned to the Cardinals in 1946 but was traded to the Boston Braves whom he started for on Opening Day 1947. That day was rather significant, as it was the day Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the team Litwhiler’s Braves were playing against that day.\n\nLitwhiler played for four more seasons in the Majors, having been traded to the Reds in 1948 and playing his last game with Cincinnati in 1951. He then embarked on a coaching career that started in the minor leagues but soon moved to college ball. During his time coaching is when Litwhiler created numerous inventions that are still in use today, such as the JUGGS radar gun and Diamond Grit, the drying agent that grounds crews use during rain delays. His prototype radar gun and his tied rawhide glove are both enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nAlan Cohen, Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) biography for Pinky May\n\nEvansville Press, June 1st, 1932\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer, July 2nd, 1940\n\nJames C.

Black just completed his third year at Vanderbilt and had been elevated to co-defensive coordinator. pic.twitter.com/PxeggZcNJ1\n\n— Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) February 14, 2026\n\nThe move to hire Black comes just over a week after Michigan lost its previous defensive tackles coach, Lou Esposito, who joined Jesse Minter’s staff with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nBlack comes to Michigan after working at Vanderbilt as the defensive line coach for the Commodores, a position he had held since 2022. Prior to that, he had been the defensive line coach at Toledo from 2019 to 2021. He has also worked at Carthage College and Notre Dame during his career. A native of Cincinnati, Black played his college football at Indiana from 2008 to 2012. He had a brief stint in the NFL as well, playing for the Cincinnati Bengals for one season.\n\nEarlier this offseason, Whittingham and Michigan had hired former Utah assistant Lewis Powell to work specifically with the defensive ends. Instead of putting more on Powell’s plate or promoting from within to fill Esposito’s role, Michigan did well here to snag a defensive tackles coach from an SEC school that’s had quite the turnaround under Clark Lea over the last three years. Prior to taking the job at Michigan, Black’s role at Vanderbilt had been expanded, with him previously being named a co-defensive coordinator.\n\nBlack will have his hands full right away with the development of Trey Pierce and Enow Etta, who will be shouldering much more of the load up front this season, with Rayshaun Benny, Damon Payne, and Tre Williams all exhausting their eligibility.",

She made the most of her minutes, though, with a full-speed backcheck to break up a high-danger chance in the first period. Then, in the final five minutes, Poulin scored her first goal of the tournament and the 18th of her career, which tied Hockey Hall of Fame forward Hayley Wickenheiser for the most goals at the Olympics.\n\n“It’s huge,” said head coach Troy Ryan about Poulin’s return. “I don’t think there’s anybody in this event that I’d want back in our lineup more than Poulin.”\n\nCanada’s next game will be the Olympic semifinals on Feb. 16.\n\nAt Friday’s practice, head coach Troy Ryan said he initially anticipated Poulin would skate in a non-contact jersey. But after extended conversations with the team’s medical staff, she was cleared to be a full participant. That Poulin was able to return less than a week after a heavy hit by Czech forward Kristýna Kaltounková is a testament to the work Canada’s captain does behind the scenes.\n\n“She trains like nobody else,” said Ryan. “So she puts herself in these situations where she can rebound from situations like this and still find ways to contribute and have an impact.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nToronto Sceptres, Minnesota Frost, Vancouver Goldeneyes, New York Sirens, Montreal Victoire, Ottawa Charge, Seattle Torrent, Boston Fleet, Olympics, Women's Hockey, Women's Olympic Ice Hockey, Olympics, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Michigan football has found its replacement for Lou Esposito.\n\nThe Wolverines are expected to hire Vanderbilt defensive line coach Larry Black as the school’s new defensive tackles coach, two people with knowledge of the situation but not permitted to speak publicly on the decision since it's not yet official, confirmed to the Free Press.\n\nThe hiring was first reported by ESPN's Pete Thamel.\n\nBlack, 36, served as Vanderbilt's defensive line coach for the past four seasons, with the addition of run defense coordinator duties in 2025. He was recently promoted to co-defensive coordinator heading into the 2026 season.\n\nTHE SCANDAL: Connor Stalions NCAA penalty: Appeal of 8-year ban shot down\n\nBlack played at Indiana (2009-13), where he finished with 127 tackles in 48 games. He has some Midwest ties as a coach, too, having served as both a graduate assistant and assistant defensive line coach at Notre Dame (2016-18) and then as defensive line coach for for Toledo from 2019-21.\n\nWhile much of Vanderbilt's improvement the past two seasons came on offense, there was a notable step forward on defense, too, with the Commodores' run defense going from 104th nationally in 2023 to 18th in 2025, allowing just 108.2 yards per game last season. Likewise, the Commordores' per-game sack average jumped from 1.75 (101st nationally) in 2023 to 2.39 (36th) in 2025.\n\nHe replaces Esposito, who departed for the Baltimore Ravens' defensive line job under former U-M DC Jesse Minter, now the coach in Baltimore. Esposito spent two seasons in Ann Arbor after his hiring from Memphis, producing several NFL players (including first-round NFL draft picks Mason Graham, Kenneth Grant and third-round pick Josaiah Stewart).\n\nBlack will work with edge coach Lewis Powell, who joined U-M's staff after having worked for new coach Kyle Whittingham in Utah.\n\nTony Garcia is the Wolverines beat writer for the Detroit Free Press.

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — On Valentine’s Day at the Milan Cortina Olympics, a renewed supply of free condoms for the athlete villages was promised by the organizers after going short during the week.\n\n“We can confirm that condom supplies in the Olympic Villages were temporarily depleted due to higher-than-anticipated demand,” the Italian organizing committee said in a statement Saturday. “Additional supplies are being delivered and will be distributed across all villages between today and Monday.”\n\nProviding condoms for athletes has been a gift from organizers — and a constant fascination to the world — for decades.\n\nWhile 300,000 condoms were provided for more than 10,500 athletes at the 2024 Paris Summer Games, the original stock was much lower for these Winter Games.\n\n“I think 10,000 have been used, 2,800 athletes — you can go figure, as they say,” International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said Saturday. “It clearly shows that Valentine’s Day is in full swing in the village.”\n\nReports of no condoms in week one of the games followed an absence of plush toys of the official mascots, Milo and Tina, in the opening days. They proved more popular than expected in the official Olympics merchandise stores.\n\nCondoms are traditionally popular for Olympic athletes to take home from as “a kind of gift” to friends, Alpine skier Mialitiana Clerc said Saturday.\n\n“I’m not so shocked. I saw it in Beijing already,” said Clerc, who also competed for Madagascar four years ago at the Winter Games in China. “There were some boxes with a lot of condoms at the entrance of every building where we were staying at the village.\"\n\n\"Every day, everything was (gone),” she recalled about Beijing at an IOC news conference Saturday to promote its scholarship program that helps hundreds of athletes to train and qualify for the Olympics.\n\n“I already know that a lot of people are using some condoms or just taking them to give to their friends outside of the Olympics because it’s a kind of gift for them,” Clerc said.\n\nThere should be no further shortage in Italy until the Winter Games closing ceremony Feb. 22.\n\n“They will be continuously replenished until the end of the games to ensure continued availability,” the local organizing committee said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "My 2026 NBA Slam Dunk Contest predictions and NBA picks for the event, featuring Carter Bryant, Jaxson Hayes, Keshad Johnson, and Jase Richardson.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest is a far cry from the days of Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, and Steve Francis battling it out.\n\nThis year’s field is full of lesser-known, lightly used players, so finding betting value in tonight's Slam Dunk Contest predictions requires a closer look.\n\nThat’s exactly what I’ve done with my NBA picks for Saturday, February 14, featuring Miami Heat forward Keshad Johnson.\n\nBefore wagering on the Slam Dunk Contest, be sure to familiarize yourself with the latest rules for the 2026 edition:\n\nFour players will compete in a two-round competition.\n\nFive judges will score each dunk based on a score ranging from 40 to 50.\n\nThe two dunkers with the highest combined scores from their first two dunks advance to the finals.\n\nThe final round will consist of two dunks by each dunker, with the highest composite score being crowned the champion.\n\nIn the event of a tie, there will be one additional round of dunks. If the event is still tied, then the judges will be empowered to declare a winner by majority vote.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Carter Bryant is the favorite in this field of relative unknowns. The 6-foot-6 rookie wing was taken 14th overall by the San Antonio Spurs largely because of his explosive athleticism.\n\nBryant boasts a 39.5-inch vertical, but he hasn’t seen much playing time in San Antonio, and there isn’t much game footage of him dunking. As a result, it’s hard to see much value at his current price.\n\nJaxson Hayes is an intriguing entrant, but there are reasons for skepticism. Historically, taller players have struggled in this competition (Dwight Howard being a notable exception), and Hayes isn’t exactly positioned as a fan favorite.\n\nThe 7-footer plays for the Los Angeles Lakers and was recently suspended one game for pushing a mascot. He also dealt with a domestic violence case earlier in his career. All things considered, this is a pass for me.\n\nKeshad Johnson is another explosive wing who has seen limited minutes with the Miami Heat.\n\nStill, the 6-foot-6 forward boasts a ridiculous 42-inch vertical, and some of his in-game dunks this season have been truly eye-popping...\n\nMy pick to win the NBA Dunk contest. 🏀🏆\n\nKeshad Johnson +320pic.twitter.com/LrQWUVP7ST\n\n— Andrew Caley (@Covers_Caley) February 13, 2026\n\nJase Richardson is the best storyline in the field. He carries the longest odds in this competition, even if there’s no true long shot. The 6-foot-1 rookie guard has seen limited minutes with the Orlando Magic this season.\n\nThe intrigue? He’s the son of two-time Slam Dunk champion Jason Richardson.\n\nRichardson appears to have inherited his dad’s leaping ability, and don’t be surprised if he pays homage to some of his father’s iconic dunks. At this price, there’s legitimate value.\n\nIt was a close call between Richardson and Johnson for me, but there’s more evidence of Johnson throwing down explosive dunks in actual NBA games.\n\nI’ve always believed that great in-game dunkers tend to translate well to this competition — think Vince Carter or, more recently, Derrick Jones Jr.\n\nBoasting an insane vertical, I’m expecting some jaw-dropping slams from Johnson on Saturday night.\n\nBest bet: Keshad Johnson to win (+320 at bet365)\n\nMichael Jordan, Jason Richardson, Nate Robinson, Zach LaVine, and Mac McClung are the only players in history to win the Slam Dunk Contest in back-to-back years.\n\nAt age 18, Kobe Bryant is the youngest player to win the Slam Dunk Contest (1997).\n\nJohn Wall is the last player to make an All-Star team and win the Slam Dunk Contest in the same year (2014).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "description": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts specifically named Tanner Scott as the most impressive pitcher after his first bullpen.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts specifically named Tanner Scott as the player who looked the best during the Dodgers’ first day of spring training.\n\nScott joined the Dodgers ahead of the 2025 season on a four-year, $72 million deal, but struggled through his first season in L.A.\n\n“Tanner Scott looked fantastic,” Roberts said. “It’s one day, but the stuff, the delivery was as good as I’ve seen from him and that includes all of last year.”\n\n“…He had a lot of stuff going on internally, with his body, that we addressed at the end of the season, so I think that might have bled into some cleaning up of some mechanics, but the ball was coming out differently than I remember it.”\n\nThe Dodgers invested in their bullpen this offseason partly due to Scott’s shortcomings. If he can show All-Star-level stuff in 2026, the Dodgers could have one of the better bullpens in MLB.\n\nScott had a 1.75 ERA through 72 appearances before coming to the Dodgers, but didn’t show any sign of his past self during the 2025 season.\n\nHe had a 4.74 ERA through 61 appearances last season, converting just 23 of his 33 save opportunities in 2025. He had only blown six saves in his previous two seasons, and had never blown more than seven in a single year.\n\nScott missed out on the postseason entirely, spending the Wild Card series off the roster and undergoing a procedure during the NLDS which kept him out for the remainder of the postseason.\n\nAfter the Dodgers signed All-Star closer Edwin Diaz in Dec. 2025, Scott effectively lost his title as the team’s closer.\n\nRoberts also commented on how the Dodgers could use the left-hander in the coming season.\n\n“Yeah, exactly,” Roberts said when asked if Scott would be used in more matchup-centric situations. “Being able to use Tanner [Scott] in any inning is going to be good for him.”\n\nHe is still a capable reliever, and will certainly play a part with the Dodgers in the coming season.\n\nDo you think Tanner Scott will improve after his rocky 2025 year?",

    "fullText": "Clemson walked into Cameron Indoor knowing nothing would come easy, and the first twenty minutes proved exactly that. The Tigers head into halftime trailing Duke 31-26 in a physical, grind-it-out opening half that featured cold shooting, heavy defensive pressure, and brief scoring runs on both sides. With Clemson still within striking distance, a handful of key trends have defined how this game has unfolded so far.\n\nGet on up there, RJ📈\n\n📺ESPN pic.twitter.com/CcSKRZ8I8A\n\n— Clemson Basketball (@ClemsonMBB) February 14, 2026\n\nWhen Clemson’s perimeter shots aren’t falling, someone has to manufacture offense. That someone has been RJ Godfrey. The senior forward has attacked downhill with purpose, absorbing contact, finishing through traffic, and forcing Duke’s defense to collapse around him. His willingness to put his head down and play through bodies has produced some of the Tigers’ most dependable looks, giving Clemson a steady pulse offensively in a half where rhythm has been hard to find.\n\nGodfrey’s physicality has also set a tone. While Duke has controlled stretches with length and ball pressure, Godfrey’s interior presence has prevented the game from slipping away, keeping Clemson within striking distance by turning effort into points.\n\nThe Tigers are giving Duke too many clean looks from the perimeter. The Blue Devils have already put up eighteen three-point attempts in the first half alone. That kind of volume is dangerous against a team with this much shooting talent.\n\nEven though Duke is sitting at six of eighteen from beyond the arc, the opportunity count is the red flag. Clemson cannot allow that many rhythm threes and expect to survive for forty minutes. For context, that is more three-point attempts than Clemson allowed in the entire Virginia Tech loss, and only a handful shy of what NC State took in the overtime game, which ended 80-76 NC State.\n\nIf Duke continues to generate open perimeter looks, eventually those shots will start falling at a higher clip. Clemson has to tighten closeouts and shrink the space on the wings in the second half.\n\nClemson’s outside shooting has been a problem, and Duke deserves real credit for it. The Tigers are just one of nine from three in the first half, with the Blue Devils flying out on shooters, switching cleanly, and taking away rhythm looks.\n\nAt the same time, Clemson has not helped itself. Several perimeter attempts have come too late on the shot clock or off balance, turning possessions into quick empty trips. Duke’s pressure is speeding Clemson up, and the Tigers are settling instead of hunting paint touches and kick outs.\n\nBrad Brownell joins ESPN College GameDay ahead of Clemson vs Duke https://t.co/TRwkJREsQI pic.twitter.com/4Y3cUV4UAq\n\n— Clemson Wire (@Clemson_Wire) February 14, 2026\n\nIf Clemson wants its offense to open up in the second half, it starts with better shot selection and forcing Duke’s defense to collapse before launching from deep.\n\nContact us @Clemson_Wire on X, and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Clemson Tigers news and notes, plus opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Clemson Wire: Three takeaways as Clemson down five at halftime at Cameron Indoor",

    "description": "The Badgers are not too far out of first place in the Big Ten.",
    "fullText": "The Wisconsin Badgers pulled off another impressive win on Saturday, beating the No. 10 Michigan State Spartans 92-71 at home, capping off a week with two Top 10 wins.\n\nIt’s been a strong last six weeks for the Badgers, who have won nine of their last 11 games, which includes wins over No. 2 Michigan, No. 8 Illinois, and No. 10 Michigan State. Sneakily, the Badgers have improved to 18-7 on the year and 10-4 in the Big Ten, which is good for fourth in the conference.\n\n60 days ago, this Badgers team wasn’t like the one we see today. They had come off some tough losses in the non-conference schedule and were non-competitive in ranked games against BYU (98-70) and Nebraska (90-60). Heading into January with zero Quad 1 wins, the Badgers season looked disappointing, especially after an ugly blowout against Purdue in a game that got busted wide open in the second half.\n\nBut Wisconsin put together one of the most impressive wins of the season in a 91-88 road win over Michigan, and things have really turned around from there. With the Badgers getting hot recently, are they a dark horse for the Big Ten title?\n\nLet’s look at the standings real quick.\n\nWisconsin is currently three games out of first place in the Big Ten, and they have the tiebreaker over Michigan with the regular-season win. When you look at the Badgers remaining schedule, they’ve got two tough games coming up against Ohio State (road) and Iowa (home). Those could be two Quad 1 opportunities.\n\nAfter that, it’s a West Coast road trip to face Oregon, which has gone 1-12 in the Big Ten, and Washington, which has gone 4-10 in the Big Ten. Wisconsin comes back home to face 3-10 Maryland before ending its season at Purdue, which will be a very difficult game.\n\nLet’s just say Wisconsin splits its next two games. There’s a likelihood they’re 4-1 over their next five heading into that Purdue game, which puts them at 14-5 in the conference. If they win all five, that’s 15-4 in the Big Ten.\n\nLooking at the other top contenders, Michigan is evidently the biggest threat to the Big Ten title. They’ve got only one loss all year (Wisconsin), and they’re the No. 2 team in the country at 23-1. But the Wolverines do get some challenges late in the year. They play Purdue at Mackey Arena, face Duke in Washington D.C., play UCLA, face Illinois and Iowa on the road, and host Michigan State to end the year. That’s quite a tough schedule.\n\nIllinois, which has three Big Ten losses, is facing Indiana (home), USC (road), UCLA (road), and Michigan (home) as its toughest remaining challenges.\n\nNebraska, which has lost three of its last four, has arguably the easiest remaining schedule of the contenders. They play Iowa twice and visit both USC and UCLA as well.\n\nPurdue’s still got some tough games, facing Michigan, Michigan State, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio State, and Wisconsin. So a path to some losses is there.\n\nWisconsin is still three games back of Michigan. But the path to a Big Ten title is slowly starting to reveal itself with less than a month left in the season.",

    "fullText": "Valter Walker has put out a public call for a fight against his brother Johnny Walker in the UFC, challenging him to move up to his division.\n\nThe Brazilian fighter appeared at Karate Combat 59 in Miami, where he secured a quick submission win over Zion Clark. Straight after the fight, he began pushing for a bout with his older brother.\n\nWhile Johnny is six years older and already well-known in the UFC, his recent results at light-heavyweight have been inconsistent. Valter wants him to step up to heavyweight, where they could finally face each other.\n\nAfter his quick win over Zion Clark, Valter Walker wasted no time in calling out his next opponent – even if it happened to be his own brother. He mentioned he wanted Johnny by his side in Miami, but claimed family matters kept him away.\n\nIt’s easy to read it as a joke, but Valter spoke with conviction, doubling down on his callout during the post-fight interview.\n\nKarate Combat president Asim Zaidi tried to line up the bout for their March 28th event in Russia. But Valter seemed focused on making it happen inside the UFC instead.\n\n“I’m really upset because I called my brother to come here with me and he didn’t come,” Valter said after the fight. “Look, Johnny isn’t here. I want to crush him! I have a kind of strange relationship with my brother now.”\n\n“I want to finish him off, I want to break his foot. I want to bring Johnny here and show him who the real Walker is… Everyone knows he has to ask his wife for permission. If his wife lets him, we’ll fight. I don’t care where – show me the money and I’ll kill everyone and destroy everything.”\n\n“This is just the beginning. I’ll beat him here and in the UFC too,” he added. “I’m just getting started. Come to heavyweights kid [Valter is six years younger]. I’ll show you who the real heavyweight is.”\n\nIt’s a fight that would catch the attention of many, but both brothers are already tied up with upcoming bouts. Johnny is set to face Dominick Reyes at UFC 327 in Miami this April, while Valter is scheduled to return a few weeks before that.\n\nValter, riding a streak of four straight wins by heel hook, is booked to fight Marcin Tybura on March 28 at UFC Seattle. But if both men keep winning and the rivalry keeps building, a brother vs brother matchup could be hard for the UFC to ignore.\n\nAljamain Sterling reveals tweak he believes can guide Merab Dvalishvili past Petr Yan\n\nUFC BJJ Champion calls out Arman Tsarukyan over talk of Tom Hardy match\n\nTom Aspinall admits ‘I don’t know if I’d be able to do that again’ after double-eye surgery",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Jordan Stolz is 2 for 2. There's a chance 4 for 4 might not be far behind.\n\nThe American speedskating star added his second gold medal in two attempts at the Milan Cortina Olympics by sprinting to victory in the men's 500 meters on Saturday.\n\nStolz joined Eric Heiden as the only skaters to win both the 500 and 1,000 meters at the same Olympics. Heiden did it at Lake Placid in 1980, a full 24 years before the 21-year-old Stolz was born.\n\nWhile Stolz has been wary about comparing himself to Heiden, who won a record five races nearly five decades ago, he hardly seems intimidated by the challenge. Racing in the penultimate pairing, the Wisconsin native's time of 33.77 seconds gave him his second Olympic record in four days. He did the same while capturing the 1,000 meters on Wednesday.\n\nJenning de Boo of the Netherlands took silver, just as he did in the 1,000. Canada’s Laurent Dubreuil got the bronze in 34.26.\n\nNext up for Stolz is the 1,500 meters on Thursday, and the mass start on Feb. 21.\n\nThe party in Brazil this week isn't limited to the annual Carnivale in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAlpine skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen delivered the first gold medal by a South American athlete at the Winter Olympics by surging to victory in the giant slalom.\n\nThe 25-year-old, whose father is Norwegian and mother is from Brazil, posted a two-run time of 2 minutes, 25 seconds, beating defending champion Marco Odermatt of Switzerland by 0.58 seconds. Odermatt’s teammate, Loic Meillard, earned bronze on the snowy and slippery Stelvia course.\n\n“I was skiing with my heart, and when you ski the way you are, anything is possible,” Pinheiro Braathen said. \"The only thing that matters to me is that I remain who I am. I am a Brazilian skier who became an Olympic champion.”\n\nMaren Kirkeeide's first Olympic biathlon race ended with a dismal 49th-place finish early in the Games.\n\nHer second went far, far better.\n\nThe Norwegian earned gold in the women’s 7.5-kilometer sprint, clearing all 10 of her shots before crossing the finish line in 20 minutes and 40.8 seconds, just ahead of Oceane Michelon of France 3.8 seconds back. Lou Jeanmonnot missed one but held on for the bronze, 23.7 seconds back.\n\n“I wanted to try my best, and I got some positive feedback from the coaches, and then I got some extra motivation, and it helped me all the way to the finish line,” Kirkeeide said.\n\nJeanmonnot now has a full set of medals in Italy. She took silver in the 15-kilometer individual race and was part of France's gold medal-winning mixed relay.\n\nA snapped ski binding by Sweden created an opening in the women's cross-country relay. Norway was more than happy to zip through it.\n\nThe Norwegians pulled off a stunner to claim gold in a discipline dominated by the Swedes. Sweden entered the race having won seven out of nine possible medals so far up at the course in Tesero.\n\nThe Swedes were leading during the second leg when Ebba Andersson broke her binding and fell. Forced to ski with just one ski at one point, she lost valuable time.\n\nNorway finished the 4 x 7.5-kilometer race in 1 hour, 15 minutes and 44.8 seconds, 50 seconds ahead of Sweden. Finland earned the bronze, more than a minute back.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "The Netherlands’ House of Representatives advanced a legislative proposal on Thursday to introduce a 36% capital gains tax on savings and most liquid investments, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe legislation reached the 75-vote threshold required to advance, with 93 lawmakers voting in favor of it, according to the House tally.\n\nUnder the proposal, savings accounts, cryptocurrencies, most equity investments and gains made from interest-bearing financial instruments are subject to the tax, whether or not the assets are sold.\n\nCritics say the bill will drive capital out of the Netherlands and into jurisdictions with more favorable tax laws, as investors seek a flight to safety from confiscatory taxation.\n\nThe Dutch Senate must also pass the bill before it is signed into law, which will take effect in the 2028 tax year, if it is passed, but many investors in the crypto community are already sounding the alarm and predicting capital flight from the country.\n\nInvestors say the tax is out of touch and will backfire\n\n“France did this in 1997 and saw a massive exodus of entrepreneurs leaving the country,” Denis Payre, co-founder of logistics company Kiala said.\n\nCrypto market analyst Michaël van de Poppe said the proposal is “the dumbest thing I've seen in a long time.”\n\n“The number of people willing to flee the country is going to be bananas,” he added, echoing the calls of other industry analysts and executives.\n\nAn investor starting with 10,000 euros ($11,871) who contributes 1,000 euros per month over 40 years would end up with about 3,320,000 euros by the end of the 40 years, according to Investing Visuals.\n\nHowever, the new 36% tax reduces the total amount after 40 years to about 1,885,000 euros, a difference of 1,435,000 euros, Investing Visuals said.\n\nCrypto industry and tech executives in the United States voiced similar concerns about California’s proposed wealth tax on billionaires.\n\nThe proposal outlined a 5% tax on an individual’s net worth above the $1 billion threshold, igniting a torrent of backlash and tech entrepreneurs announcing that they were leaving the state of California.\n\nMagazine: Best and worst countries for crypto taxes — plus crypto tax tips",

    "fullText": "Twitter's latest consensus on inevitability: now that large language models can write code, everyone will become a software developer.\n\nPeople, you see, have problems, and software solves problems, and AI removes the barrier between people and software, therefore everyone will build their own software.\n\nIt's a syllogism, after a fashion, but its premise = so wildly disconnected from how actual humans behave that it borders on fantasy.\n\nBecause the average punter does not want to build software.\n\nThey don't want to prompt software.\n\nThey don’t want to describe software.\n\nThey don't particularly want to think about software.\n\nThey want to tap, swipe and scroll with zero friction and next-to-zero cognitive input.\n\nThey want their problems to go away, and they would very much prefer if that happened without them having to open a terminal, a chat window, or anything else that reminds them of work.\n\nThis is damn-near universally applicable.\n\nThere's a deep assumption embedded in the \"everyone will build\" thesis, that most people are latent creators held back only by technical barriers. Remove the barriers, and creation floods forth. But we've run this before. Desktop publishing tools became accessible in the 1980s with the Macintosh and PageMaker. Did everyone start designing their own newsletters? A handful did, and the rest continued to hire designers or, more commonly, didn't make newsletters at all. WordPress has made it trivially easy to build a website for over twenty years now, and the vast majority of small business owners still pay someone else to do it, or they use a template and never touch it again.\n\nThe people excited about vibe coding are, almost by definition, people who were already interested in building things, and they're projecting their own enthusiasm onto a general population that has repeatedley demonstrated a preference for buying solutions over building them.\n\nAnd why wouldn't they prefer that?\n\nBuilding things is cognitively expensive, whether or not it’s financially viable.\n\nAnd even when the technical barrier falls to zero, the conceptualisation barrier remains. You still have to know what you want, specify it clearly, evaluate whether what you got is what you wanted, and iterate if it’s not. That's work // effort and for most people it is accompanied by functionally zero dopamine.\n\nAn old joke: the hardest part of building software is figuring out what the software should do. This has been true for decades, and AI hasn't changed it. If anything, AI has made the problem more visible. When the bottleneck was writing code, you could blame the difficulty of ~programming for why your project never got off the ground. Now that an AI can write code in seconds, the bottleneck is clearly, embarrassingly, you // me // us.\n\nThis is the part that the AI manics keep skating past. They demo an app built in ten minutes and declare that software development has been democratized. But the demo is always something with a clear spec: a to-do list, a calculator, a simple game with obvious rules. The rest of the world’s problems don't come pre-decomposed into clean specifications.\n\nThe rest of the world may not even be able to fully articulate what’s broken and what they want fixed.\n\nMost folks don't want to build a custom CRM.\n\nI couldn't be more excited about what this era unlocks.\n\nThey want to They don't want to create their own budgeting app. They want Mint or YNAB to do the job. The entire SaaS economy exists as proof that people will pay monthly fees to avoid having to build or even configure things themselves.\n\nAnd is there anything wrong with that preference?\n\nThe division of labor exists for good reasons, and Adam Smith figured this out in 1776 and he was a good deal smarter than a good many of us.\n\nWhat people will actually do with AI is use AI-enhanced versions of existing products, with smarter search and better autocomplete inside the tools they already have. The revolution won't look like a hundred million people vibe coding custom apps. It'll look like existing software getting better at understanding what users want and doing it for them, which is what good software has always tried to do.\n\nThe tech industry has a long history of confusing what power users want with what everyone wants. The folks on AI Twitter who are building apps every weekend with Claude and GPT are having a great time, and the tools they're using are the same ones I’m obsessing over most of my waking hours. But we are a self-selected sample of tinkerers and builders, and the conclusions they're drawing about the general population say more about their own relationship with technology than about anyone else's.\n\nMost people, given a magic wand, would not wish for the ability to write software. They'd wish for their sofware to work properly without them having to do fuck-all.",

    "fullText": "Many people bought the devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages\n\nWhat happens to the data that smart home cameras collect? Can law enforcement access this information – even when users aren’t aware officers may be viewing their footage? Two recent events have put these concerns in the spotlight.\n\nA Super Bowl ad by the doorbell-camera company Ring and the FBI’s pursuit of the kidnapper of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, have resurfaced longstanding concerns about surveillance against a backdrop of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. The fear is that home cameras’ video feeds could become yet another part of the government’s mass surveillance apparatus.\n\nRing’s Super Bowl ad appeared intended to inspire hope: a neighborhood harnessing the power of technology to find a lost dog: a distraught girl misses her pet, Milo, who has gone missing. Gone are the times of putting up “missing” posters. Simply posting Milo’s photo through the Ring app automatically alerts a host of nearby cameras to use AI to look for a match, the ad says. A neighbor then arrives on their porch with Milo, safe and sound. As they reunite, feel-good music plays. But the reference to the AI-powered feature Search Party, meant to mimic the activity of a real one, quickly triggered comparisons with a dystopian Black Mirror episode. Viewers wondered: if the company could quickly access hundreds of Ring cameras in a neighborhood to find a dog, what’s stopping it from targeting a person in the same way?\n\nIn Guthrie’s case, the FBI released a video Tuesday showing a masked person at her doorstep. But the footage appears to have been retrieved from a Google Nest camera that officials previously said was disconnected and lacking an active monthly subscription for premium features. Without a subscription, users cannot typically store footage. The publication of the footage from Guthrie’s home indicated that law enforcement could still access “residual data located in backend systems”, in the words of FBI director Kash Patel; cybersecurity experts have said this may be because doorbell cameras often have back-ups stored in a cloud. It’s currently unclear whether law enforcement used a warrant.\n\n“There’s a very distinct and marked difference between what you have access to – in terms of whether you’re paying for it or not – and what the company has access to,” said Chris Gilliard, a data privacy expert who has researched how wearables and smart doorbells are contributing to mass surveillance.\n\nNew images in the search for Nancy Guthrie:\n\nOver the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff’s Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie’s home that may have been lost,… pic.twitter.com/z5WLgPtZpT\n\nRing, owned by Amazon, and Nest say they comply with law enforcement requests for data, including footage, when it’s legally required and in instances where there’s a threat to someone’s life. Ring also says that federal law enforcement doesn’t have direct access to the data from the doorbell camera, telling Wirecutter in a statement that “Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them”. Ring has also said that the feature advertised as being able to find dogs can’t currently detect human biometrics. Nest has said in a transparency report that the company would not instantly hand over data to a federal agency with a search warrant. “We’d analyze the request to be sure the warrant wasn’t overly broad, then we’d make sure the information they requested was within the scope of the warrant,” the company stated.\n\nThere’s been a swift backlash, as people have become more aware of surveillance concerns tied to smart home devices. Many people bought these devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages. Lawmakers from across the aisle condemned Ring’s Super Bowl ad, with the US senator Ed Markey writing in an open letter on Wednesday that “it’s not hard to imagine the ways that Amazon – or law enforcement – could abuse this feature”. TikTok influencers called on people to “smash” their Ring doorbells, and Redditors shared tips on trying to get refunds on old Ring devices from Amazon. Graphics circulating on social media stated: “Your ring camera is an ICE agent.”\n\nRing appears to be feeling the heat. On Thursday, Amazon announced that Ring had cancelled its partnership with Flock Safety, which runs a network of automated license plate readers across the US. Flock says it does not give ICE or the Department of Homeland Security direct access to its systems, but news reports have documented an ongoing loophole: cases in which local law enforcement has used Flock’s tool in aiding federal immigration authorities.\n\nRing said in a blog post that the integration with Flock would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated”. The company also stated that no customer videos had ever been sent to Flock, since the integration never launched, stressing a commitment to making neighborhoods safer.\n\nData-privacy advocates are not convinced by Ring’s commitment to community safety, though. “Ring is just trying to protect its bottom line,” said Jeramie D Scott, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s surveillance oversight program. Without additional federal protections, Scott worries Ring will continue to expand its surveillance capabilities despite the recent backtracking.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Ring has faced criticism over data protection. “Ring has a history of playing it pretty loose with people’s privacy rights,” said Beryl Lipton, senior investigative researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission charged the company with “compromising its customers’ privacy by allowing any employee or contractor to access consumers’ private videos and by failing to implement basic privacy and security protections”. This, in turn, allowed hackers to “take control of consumers’ accounts, cameras, and videos”. Ring agreed to pay $5.8m in a settlement with the FTC.\n\nRing still has many partnerships with police, and with the return of its founder, Jamie Siminoff, who is now CEO, the company appears to be doubling down on its original emphasis on fighting crime. Siminoff said last year that his cameras can almost “zero-out crime”, though experts like Gilliard are skeptical. After Siminoff’s return, the company partnered with body-camera maker Axon to restart a tool that allows police to request footage through an online portal.\n\n“These companies – their typical strategy is to consistently push the envelope in small ways to acclimate us to more invasive uses of these things,” Gilliard said.",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Team Textpattern is pleased to announce the release of Textpattern 4.9.1, available for immediate download.\n\nTextpattern 4.9.1 is a patch release with security fixes, some patches & refinements to functionality introduced in Textpattern 4.9.0, a fix for MariaDB 11.8 users, and sundry bug fixes.\n\nIf you have a Textpattern website, we recommend upgrading to Textpattern 4.9.1 to fix 2 reported security issues. Both issues were reported to us by third-party security researchers. We are grateful to both researchers for their considerations in responsible reporting and co-ordinated disclosure.\n\nMany thanks to Jan Jeffrie Galvez Salloman, aka ‘0xj4n’ for responsibly reporting an issue relating to an authenticated stored XSS vulnerability. We are grateful for their clear and thorough report in outlining the issue, which allowed Textpattern developers to efficiently reproduce the issue, isolate a fix and resolve it. At the time of article publication, we are anticipating a CVE reference for this issue. This article will be updated to reflect the CVE details when we have them.\n\nVersions of Textpattern prior to 4.9.1 are affected by this issue, and upgrading is highly recommended.\n\nMany thanks to Federico Frascino for responsibly reporting an access control regression issue relating to article management. We are grateful for their clear and thorough report in outlining the issue, which allowed Textpattern developers to efficiently reproduce the issue, isolate a fix and resolve it. At the time of article publication, we are anticipating a CVE reference for this issue. This article will be updated to reflect the CVE details when we have them.\n\nTextpattern 4.9.0 is affected by this issue and upgrading is highly recommended.\n\nVersions of Textpattern prior to 4.9.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nAs with all Textpattern upgrades, please refer to the current Textpattern system requirements and ensure you have known-good backups of your site files and database, including all uploaded content such as images & files. Before you make any changes, please refer to the accompanying release notes in HISTORY.txt to ensure you understand what has changed in this release, along with any releases that may have been skipped. You can check your current Textpattern version from the bottom of any page on the admin-side.\n\nThank you to everyone who contributed to this and prior Textpattern releases with reporting & resolving bugs, providing & improving language translations and overall improvements to the Textpattern ecosystem. We’re grateful to all contributors offering us their expertise, time, attention, words, donations, signal boosting, evangelism, cheerleading and all other activities that fuel our project.\n\nTextpattern’s infrastructure and continued development is kindly supported by DigitalOcean, 1Password and BrowserStack. We are grateful for their ongoing involvement & support for Textpattern, and our global community of authors, publishers, designers and administrators. Thank you!\n\nThere is no spyware, adware, user tracking or other junk in Textpattern. We work hard to keep Textpattern fast, nimble, secure and ready for pretty much anything you can throw at it. You can show your appreciation by sponsoring Textpattern on GitHub or supporting Textpattern on Open Collective. Alternatively, you can donate to Team Textpattern with PayPal.\n\nWe have a friendly forum for a Textpattern sites showcase – tell us what you’ve made with Textpattern, we’d love to hear from you. Even a ‘hello!’ or ‘thanks!’ helps us to gauge how far Textpattern has travelled, so don’t be a stranger.\n\nTextpattern 4.9 requires a minimum of PHP 5.6 as part of the system requirements, though using a vendor-supported PHP version is highly recommended. There are notable performance gains with modern PHP versions, as well as a variety of security considerations.\n\nYou can download Textpattern 4.9.1 from textpattern.com or GitHub. Both locations provide the same compressed archive files, along with checksums for validating your download.\n\nTextpattern 4.9.1 is available as a .zip archive intended for single-site instances. Most Textpattern administrators will find this archive format appropriate for their needs.\n\nTextpattern administrators wishing to use Textpattern’s multi-site capabilities or having a preference for a UNIX/Linux-centric archive format can download either the .tar.gz or .tar.xz archive as they include the necessary extra multi-site support files and symbolic links.\n\nFrom Textpattern 4.9.0, we offer a .tar.xz archive for further byte savings. The XZ compression format’s storage algorithm provides a considerably smaller download than the .tar.gz archive. The unpacked contents of the .tar.xz archive are identical to the .tar.gz archive’s unpacked contents.\n\nYou can download Textpattern 4.9.1 from textpattern.com using the following links,\n\nPlease refer to the Textpattern INSTALL.txt for a comprehensive walkthrough. This file is included in the Textpattern archive and linked here for your convenience.\n\nWe have a forum thread dedicated to Textpattern 4.9.1 feedback. We gather field reports from fellow Textpattern administrators and users that may assist or guide you with upgrading.\n\nPlease refer to the Textpattern UPGRADE.txt for the upgrade procedure. This file is included in the Textpattern archive and linked here for your convenience.\n\nAs with any software update, please ensure you verify working backups of Textpattern sites you are upgrading before undertaking any modifications. This includes the Textpattern database and files, plus any file and/or image uploads.\n\nThe vast majority of Textpattern upgrades are smooth sailing and occur without incident, but on the rare occasion something does go astray it’s preferable to safely restore the known-good version from your full site backup and troubleshoot any issues while your site continues to be available on the prior version.\n\nTextpattern 4.9.1 is the first patch release of the 4.9 branch. It follows less than 1 month after the release of Textpattern 4.9.0 in December 2025. The relatively short release cadence is a result of two security issues discovered in the administration area of Textpattern.\n\nIn addition to addressing the security reports, we have improved article image handling and thumbnail generation based on user feedback. MariaDB 11.8+ users encountered a UNIXTIME() issue with Textpattern 4.9.0. While we do not officially support MariaDB at the present time, we acknowledge that many hosting organisations provide MariaDB in place of Oracle MySQL, and accordingly we have resolved the reported UNIXTIME() issue.\n\nWe are considering support scope for MariaDB in future releases of Textpattern. We will communicate any support changes in due course.\n\nWe are confident that Textpattern works well on modern MySQL & PHP, and we will continue to work towards patch releases of Textpattern 4.9 to provide compatibility with PHP’s annual release and MySQL’s next Long Term Support (LTS) release scheduled for mid-2026. By the end of 2026, we expect to have general availability for PHP 8.6 and MySQL 9.7.\n\nThe Textpattern HISTORY.txt outlines changes for this and all previous Textpattern releases, along with their respective release dates. We recommend you read the list of changes to understand how this may affect your current sites, especially if you’re upgrading from older versions. Please note that while upgrades from very old releases of Textpattern are possible, you may need to perform a multi-stage upgrade.\n\nIf you require clarification on any aspect of the release notes, we recommend you seek advice before starting a site upgrade. The Textpattern support forum is an excellent place to start, and the Textpattern user documentation provides examples, explanations and background information.\n\nThe following lists are cherry-picked items from the HISTORY.txt to provide an overview for interested parties.\n\nWe are particularly interested in feedback on these areas:\n\nWe have a dedicated support forum thread for Textpattern 4.9.1 feedback where Textpattern users, experts & developers gather and address feedback. We are grateful for all feedback, even a short confirmation that your upgrade(s) completed as expected is appreciated.\n\nWe maintain Textpattern issues at GitHub if you would like further insight into where we’re heading with this release and future work.\n\nIf you find anything not working correctly or wish to propose improvements, please file a report on GitHub. There are templates for feature requests and bug reports.\n\nThe Textpattern demo has been updated to offer Textpattern test drives. The demo sites are rebuilt every few hours using the Textpattern auto-installer.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this release and it serves you, your sites and clients well!\n\nThank you for your interest in Textpattern!",

    "fullText": "Wall Street Journal says Claude used in operation via Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies\n\nClaude, the AI model developed by Anthropic, was used by the US military during its operation to kidnap Nicolás Maduro from Venezuela, the Wall Street Journal revealed on Saturday, a high-profile example of how the US defence department is using artificial intelligence in its operations.\n\nThe US raid on Venezuela involved bombing across the capital, Caracas, and the killing of 83 people, according to Venezuela’s defence ministry. Anthropic’s terms of use prohibit the use of Claude for violent ends, for the development of weapons or for conducting surveillance.\n\nAnthropic was the first AI developer known to be used in a classified operation by the US department of defence. It was unclear how the tool, which has capabilities ranging from processing PDFs to piloting autonomous drones, was deployed.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, but said any use of the AI tool was required to comply with its usage policies. The US defence department did not comment on the claims.\n\nThe WSJ cited anonymous sources who said Claude was used through Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, a contractor with the US defence department and federal law enforcement agencies. Palantir refused to comment on the claims.\n\nThe US and other militaries increasingly deploy AI as part of their arsenals. Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. The US military has used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years.\n\nCritics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed.\n\nAI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US.\n\nThis more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”.\n\nThe Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk. The defence department also uses a custom version of Google’s Gemini and OpenAI systems to support research.",

    "title": "The crucial first step for designing a successful enterprise AI system",
    "description": "How to identify the first iconic use case for an enterprise AI transformation.",
    "fullText": "Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?\n\nAt Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.\n\nOur methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.\n\nMistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.\n\nFirst, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.\n\nFor example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.\n\nSecond, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.\n\nThird, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.\n\nFinally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.\n\nThis means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.\n\nEnterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.\n\nRepresentatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.\n\nMoonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.\n\nFuture investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.\n\nTactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.\n\nQuick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.\n\nBlue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.\n\nHero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.\n\nOnce a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.\n\nThis step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.\n\nOnce this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.\n\nDuring this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.\n\nAfter the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.\n\nBut none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.\n\nIt’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.\n\nThe path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.\n\nThis content was produced by Mistral AI. It was not written by MIT Technology Review’s editorial staff.\n\nFour ways to think about this year's reckoning.\n\nBacklash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.\n\nThe viral social network for bots reveals more about our own current mania for AI as it does about the future of agents.\n\nDiscover special offers, top stories,\n upcoming events, and more.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kat Smith, 35, who has lived abroad since 2015. Smith, the founder of Away Abroad, a website for female travelers, currently lives in Trieste, Italy, with her husband. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI think people don't always believe me when I say it, but living abroad has always felt more fun to me. I love the cultural challenges, the language barrier, the different food, and the process of figuring out the day-to-day.\n\nI'm originally from Conyers, a small town just outside Atlanta. In high school, I moved to Athens, Georgia. It was a typical small, suburban place — there weren't many people traveling internationally. Certainly, no one was moving abroad the way I eventually did.\n\nWhen I was 18, between graduating from high school and starting at the University of Georgia, my parents basically forced a gap semester on me. They came home from a dinner party one night and were like, \"Instead of going to college, you're going to Guatemala.\"\n\nI did not want to go, but hindsight is 20/20.\n\nGoing to Guatemala was the best thing that could have happened to me. While I was there, I met a Peace Corps volunteer. Spending time with them and being in the country changed my perception of the world and opened my eyes to what was even possible.\n\nWhen I got back and started university, I met with an advisor who had also served in the Peace Corps. After talking with him more, it just felt like the right path for me.\n\nIn 2013, almost exactly a month after I graduated from university, I joined the Peace Corps and left the US for Ecuador.\n\nAt the time I applied, you didn't really have much say in where you went. I basically said, \"Send me anywhere in the world,\" and they sent me to Ecuador. During training, they placed me in a community based on my skill set and the community's needs.\n\nI ended up in Tumbaco for 3 months for training and then in Arenillas, a really small town in the southwestern province of El Oro, where I lived for about two years.\n\nWhen my service ended, a friend of mine and I hitchhiked through the Peruvian Amazon and ended up working at an eco-lodge in the middle of the rainforest for a few months.\n\nAround that time, in 2015, my dad was like, \"Okay, you haven't been home in almost three years. I'm buying you a ticket—you're coming to visit.\" So, begrudgingly, I went back to the US.\n\nI remember feeling reverse culture shock more intensely than I ever felt culture shock. It completely caught me off guard. All of a sudden, the US didn't feel like home anymore. I felt like I didn't fit in.\n\nI also knew I wasn't the same person I'd been when I'd left, which created an internal conflict. I don't want to be that dramatic, but I had a different mindset, and trying to be the old me was hard.\n\nOver the years, I've lived in Panama City, been to Colombia, worked on a yacht in the South of France, and backpacked through Eastern Europe for a couple of months. I also backpacked between Vietnam and Thailand, and taught English in South Korea.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of all of that, I fell in love and got married in Colombia in 2018. Not long after, my husband and I moved to Vietnam, where we stayed for three years while I was teaching English, before leaving in 2021 because of COVID restrictions.\n\nAfter Vietnam, we went back to the US for a while. We bought a van, converted it, and traveled up and down the West Coast. I loved nature, but after a few months, I was ready to leave again.\n\nSo we tried Albania next. We stayed for a couple of months, but it didn't feel like the right long-term fit. Instead, we kept moving and spent time around the Balkans — traveling through Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia.\n\nLooking back, I've made a few mistakes along the way.\n\nOne of the things I cringe about most is how I treated my friends and family back home. I was pretty insensitive about their choices — friends who just wanted to graduate, buy a house 10 minutes from where they grew up, and settle into a typical, structured, no-surprises kind of life. I think I judged that because I felt like what I was doing was so extravagant.\n\nBut honestly, I was a bit of a brat about accepting other people's paths.\n\nI did something similar with my family, too. I didn't really consider what it meant for them when I left. I was so focused on what it meant for me, and not necessarily on how it was affecting everyone around me.\n\nIn 2023, we moved to Italy for a job opportunity for my husband. He has an EU Blue Card — basically a work permit for skilled workers — and I'm on a family reunification visa linked to his.\n\nWe've been living in Trieste for the past 2.5 years. Trieste is fantastic, but it's also an up-and-coming city that's gotten really expensive, fast. Even in the short time we've been here, we've seen a big jump in costs. Our rent, for example, increased by $308 a month, which still feels crazy.\n\nOur apartment is really nice: one bedroom, one bath, open floor plan, and close to everything. I'm really into nature, and we have a beautiful view of the sea and the hills. We were paying $1,423 a month, and now it's $1,732.\n\nThat rising cost of living is one of the reasons we started looking at other places — just to get more for our money.\n\nWe ended up buying an apartment in Belluno for $260,955, and we'll move in April. Belluno is a much smaller town, kind of a gateway to the Dolomites, and it sits north of Venice. We're big mountain people, and the Dolomites are genuinely my happy place. Being closer to them means we can hike and snowboard more regularly without a long drive, which was a huge perk for us.\n\nAlthough we didn't choose Italy initially and only moved here for my husband's job, there are a lot of reasons we've chosen to stay rather than move on like we typically do after a few years.\n\nItaly has a strategic geographic position. I love living smack dab in the middle of the world. Not only is this exciting adventure-wise, but it's also meant more people have been able to visit us, including our parents, who aren't as keen on the long-haul flights.\n\nOn top of that, the culture clicks for both of us. As an intercultural couple, we have different triggers, things we look for, and things we want to avoid. Northern Italy has provided the perfect balance for us.\n\nI really hope Italy can be our home base, at least for the foreseeable future. But I also know myself: If, two years from now, it doesn't feel right, we'll pivot. I'm not setting a deadline; it's more about whether it still feels like home. And right now, it does.",

    "description": "I thought I would be a fun, relaxed grandma. But my mornings are filled with the chaos of getting six kids to school, and it's breaking me.",
    "fullText": "I turned 57 this year. I always thought that by this point in my life, I would be taking bucket-list trips, tending a garden, and writing the novel I've always known was in me. Instead, my days are filled with wiping noses and every surface imaginable while keeping tabs on everything from medications to musical instruments.\n\nMy husband and I now live with our adult daughter and her six children, and because it makes the most sense, I take care of the kids, the house, the dog, and everything else while the other two adults go to work.\n\nOne day, when my daughter had to take five hours of mandatory overtime, and I was losing my cool at hour 10 of juggling meltdowns and messes, it hit me. I wasn't the fun, easygoing, they-grow-up-so-fast-so-nothing-is-worth-getting-upset-about Grammie anymore. I had become the person holding everything together, and if nothing changed, I was going to burn out.\n\nOn a typical morning, I hit the ground running at 6 a.m. My daughter is able to take the first grader to the bus stop before work, so I'm \"only\" responsible for five kiddos most mornings.\n\nAfter getting myself dressed and ready, I take the dog out and feed him, and then get my oldest grandson ready for the bus that picks him up at our door.\n\nThat's when everything goes as it should. But when the 14-year-old misplaces his headphones, the dog gets frantic because of an early morning Amazon delivery, and the commotion wakes the toddler, it can feel like there's no way I'll make it through the day. Even then, the work doesn't end when the workday does. It simply shifts into a different part of the day.\n\nI would take a bullet for every single member of my family. But the load is heavy, and I carry a lot of guilt for the moments I mourn the version of midlife I thought I would live.\n\nIt's not that my daughter or my grandchildren are a burden; they've all been through more heartache and struggle than most people could imagine, and I'm so thankful we can provide emotional support.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said I don't sometimes long for the clean, quiet home I used to wake up to. My longing for that other life sometimes admittedly makes me cranky with my grandkids.\n\nA series of steps helped me change the way I show up without breaking myself down. I set an (almost) concrete bedtime for myself, completing tasks, chores, and self-care by 9 p.m. This gives me a little time to read or catch a podcast before getting to sleep at a decent hour.\n\nThe extra rest also allows me to get up a little earlier. Now, I have at least 30 minutes of quiet alone time while everyone else is still sleeping. It helps me start the day feeling grounded, rather than immediately pouring from an empty cup. I've experienced a huge shift in my attitude, and it seems to set the tone for everyone.\n\nI've also started following some of the life advice I often give to the kids, like \"Done is better than perfect.\" I'm working on not holding myself to expectations I would never put on others. While I still won't allow things to pile up until they're unmanageable, I'm learning to be OK with leaving a load of laundry in the dryer for tomorrow.\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned in my nearly six decades on this planet, it's that life rarely goes as planned. Letting go of dreams is tough, especially when we're sold a picture of how midlife ought to look — but whether it defines you is your choice.\n\nI'm choosing to embrace my current purpose and see the significance in helping to shape the hearts and minds of six amazing human beings.\n\nThis chapter of my life is messy, exhausting, noisy, and chaotic. But at the heart of it all is unconditional love, and the simple truth I carry with me is that there's nowhere else I'd rather be.",

    "description": "In this Saturday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about the booming mini economy of public breakups.",
    "fullText": "I know, I know, it's Valentine's Day, so who wants to read about breakups? Hear me out. Today isn't just about love; it's about every part of a relationship — the meet-cute, the intoxicating limerence, and even splitting up over soup. Meet the breakup economy.\n\nBusiness Insider's Juliana Kaplan writes about how breaking up in public is still a thing, and many are choosing restaurants, bars, and coffee shops to do the deed. It's not only affecting the two people sitting at the table. Waitstaff are also taking notice and trying their best to navigate what happens when someone suddenly leaves the table.\n\nChef Gabrielle Macafee encountered this exact scenario when she worked at a Brooklyn restaurant serving a small tasting menu. After a couple walked in looking \"morose,\" the man stood up and left halfway through the $130 meal.\n\n\"My teammates and I were like, wait, how do we handle this? He's gone. You can only hold the food for so long,\" Macafee told BI's Kaplan, who added that the woman still seated paid for both meals. \"We offered to send her the rest, but obviously, she just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.\"\n\nIf you do find yourself giving the \"it's not you, it's me\" speech in public, dating coach Julie Nguyen advised picking a neutral spot, such as a park, and avoiding regular haunts you both frequent. \"You don't want either of you to feel dread going back, or tie bad memories to a spot they love. A neutral, quiet outdoor setting is the best play,\" she added.\n\nLane Denbro, a former line cook, said that if you're not in total shock at what's happening, be thoughtful of the staff, the servers, and the bartenders. \"If you're going through a breakup, make sure to tip well, because the service staff in the back of house, we're going to try to support you however we can,\" Denbro said.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mila Wagner-Sanchez, a freshman at Stanford Univeristy, who uses Date Drop, a new dating app created by Henry Weng, a Stanford senior. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a 19-year-old freshman at Stanford University. I wasn't sure what to expect on campus — whether people would be actively dating or not. I have friends on both sides of the spectrum; some are more focused on school and friendships, and some are in relationships.\n\nBut I initially found Date Drop through my friends.\n\nIt was one of those week one things — everyone was getting to know each other, and we all decided it could be fun if we signed up together.\n\nI've never been on a dating app like Hinge or Tinder, but I was surprised by the complexity of the questions that Date Drop asked. The questions on Date Drop were like: \"What do you do for fun,\" \"What are you doing academically,\" \"Do you have any age, height, or ethnicity preferences,\" and so on.\n\nIt also asked whether you preferred long-term or short-term relationships, and how many kids you wanted. It was very comprehensive. There was even an open-ended question asking me to describe my perfect date.\n\nAnyone on campus can sign up — from freshmen to seniors to grad students. We have another similar platform on campus called Marriage Pact that matches once a year, but Date Drop matches weekly.\n\nAlso, if you want to get to know someone, you can enter their info, or if you want to try to match two people, you can influence the algorithm. For example, you can play matchmaker and enter the info for two people across the hall from each other that you want matched. It never tells you who has put you into Date Drop; it'll say that someone has \"shipped\" you with someone else.\n\nThe first time, I was matched with a friend of mine, which was fun. We treated it as a friend date and went out to get coffee at a coffee shop that was giving out free drinks to Date Drop dates.\n\nI was matched a second time, but that person didn't reach out, so it went nowhere.\n\nAfter that, I had other stuff going on, like midterms that I needed to focus on, and Date Drop had kind of lost its novelty. Most of my friends had a similar experience.\n\nStanford is smaller, so I think it's easier to get to know people than it is at a state school. There's more of a community, and the chances of you knowing a friend who knows your Date Drop or a friend of a friend are high. A lot of people have similar interests, which makes it easier to strike up a conversation than it might be at a bigger school.\n\nOur generation has grown up on online platforms and sees them as a way to connect with others. It's definitely a culture shift. I also think it's not bad to try something new. You never know what's going to happen, and I think a lot of us go into it with that mentality.\n\nWhile I didn't find a match, I'd be open to doing it again in the future. I do know a couple of Date Drop couples. I'd do it again if it were something my sophomore year dorm wanted to do together, as a way to get out there and meet people.",

    "description": "Esther Perel, a renowned couples therapist, author, and podcast host structures her work day to include socializing as much as possible.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Esther Perel, a renowned couples therapist, bestselling author, and podcast host. Perel lives in New York City and travels the world for speaking engagements. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have been interested in psychology since I was about 14. I wanted to understand myself, my family, and my surroundings. So, becoming a therapist was quite an obvious choice for me.\n\nI started working with large groups, then moved to families, then couples. In particular, I was interested in interracial, intercultural, inter-religious couples and families — families in cultural transition. What is sexuality in the culture, and how does it enter into the family culture and the couple's relationship?\n\nI spent 35 years in my therapy office, alone. At one point, I started to feel that the office was getting small. Therapy is not democratic; it's not accessible to many people who need it.\n\nI wrote \"Mating in Captivity\" (2006) and \"The State of Affairs\" (2017). Then, I started bringing people into the sessions, and that's the podcast. \"Where Should We Begin?\" was doing live anonymous couples therapy sessions at scale, all over the world, for free.\n\nIt's not therapy, but a way to bring the insights that happen in the office into the public square. Then I decided to step out of the office myself and go onstage to recreate the experience at scale with thousands of people.\n\nI created a card game during the pandemic because I wanted to give people something playful that helps them connect. I recorded courses on conflict and desire because for every book I wrote, people would then say, \"And then what do I do?\"\n\nRight now, I am working on a new tour and a few other projects that I'm keeping to myself until they happen. Although I live primarily in New York and spend a few months a year in Europe, I travel in bursts, and always with either a family member or friend. I mix pleasure and purpose, work and personal. I'm going on an adventure with someone.\n\nI still have a therapy practice, one or two days a week. I've never stopped because I think it's very important to keep close to the craft, and not just to become a storyteller.\n\nI get up around 7 to 7:30 a.m. As soon as I wake up, I need to move to feel calm. It's a bit of a paradox.\n\nI do yoga four times a week. I'm part of a group of friends who started practicing together during the pandemic. For six years, we've never missed a class. We do it in person and on Zoom, so wherever one is, one can join. It's very grounding and strengthening.\n\nA bunch of us in the group happen to be teachers. I became one by default — I've never been trained as one, but I know how to repeat what my teachers have said to me.\n\nOn other days, I exercise, also with a friend. It motivates me and makes me accountable. Alone, I would be a lazy bum. I'd be getting ready, then spend the day futzing around and never get there.\n\nI very rarely get a coffee outside. I like to make it, sit down, and look at who texted me in the middle of the night, since people in my life are in different time zones. Who am I waking up to this morning?\n\nFor breakfast, I eat grapefruit, yogurt, and berries, and on occasion, eggs.\n\nI don't start work before 10 a.m. so that I have time to do what I like to do in the morning. I work partly at home and partly at Magnificent Noise's podcast studio.\n\nMy work days are nicely segmented:\n\nI try to create a focus for the day so that I don't have to see patients and go to meetings when I'm in clinical mode. Still, I sometimes have to switch modes in such drastic ways that it's a bit jarring.\n\nIt's a lot to juggle. I have an amazing team of people that I work with, who are very knowledgeable about the different things that I do. I cannot do any of this alone.\n\nWhen I was exclusively working as a clinician, I often would say, \"I miss working with others.\" Now, I'm never just doing one thing. It's a very rich day, which I really missed back then.\n\nMuch changed after the pandemic. I don't have a practice office anymore. I practice from my home or go to other people's offices.\n\nSometimes, we meet outside, and we walk.\n\nIt's fantastic. When you're in motion, you experience your thoughts differently, and you respond differently to the person talking to you. You're not face-to-face; you're side-by-side, so the parallel position gives you a whole other interaction.\n\nSometimes, we stop, we sit down. We continue the session by the river. There's water floating by. That too is very calming. There's this intersection between beauty and calmness and motion and the depth of what you are reflecting upon at the same time.\n\nWhat I like about clinical work is that every human being is a whole universe opening up to you. It's an endless exploration. The psyche, the mind, the body, the painful and the joyful, the breaches and the connection, the people who suffered from too much attention, and the people who suffered from too little. I can't think of a subject that would be more diverse in its interests.\n\nI don't always take a lunch break. In general, I prefer to end the day earlier.\n\nI have very few routines when it comes to food. Most of my meals are home-cooked. I eat lots of nuts and fruit. I'm a major bread-and-cheese person, and sometimes a slice of both is a good lunch, too.\n\nToday, I cooked up a bunch of different vegetables. I made some chicken so it would last for two or three days. I am a big soup maker in the winter, and I like salads in the summer.\n\nI usually stop working around 5 p.m.\n\nI love movies. I love theater. I go with friends into the world to see art — paintings and performances. Probably, I'm at a theater two or three times a week. I saw the Broadway production of \"Oedipus\" twice. I just thought it was pertinent, current, exquisitely well-acted, beautifully written.\n\nI socialize, too. Meeting people for dinner, inviting them over. When I spend so much time on a screen, I like to see people in real life.\n\nI'm in a movie and book club as well.\n\nWe recently read \"Train Dreams\" by Denis Johnson. We've read Roberto Bolaño, Rachel Cusk. We're reading Muriel Spark for next month.\n\nFor the movie club, we just discussed \"The Worst Person in the World\" — I had just seen \"Sentimental Value\" by the same director, Joachim Trier. We've done the movie club every three weeks for the past six years — that's a lot of movies with a great group of people who have a lot to say.\n\nPlus, you have your homework, and you're not just going to read articles and social stuff. These little structured pieces of my life that actually invite real exploration and connection.\n\nAt night, I talk to my husband. I also go to look at the messages that I didn't catch for the day. I often spend the last half hour or hour on my phone. It's not the best. I sit on the couch, and I look at my calendar for tomorrow and who I'm meant to connect with.\n\nI rarely scroll through social media. I'm in a few different WhatsApp groups, so I see what's happening in my social world. That's how I unwind.\n\nI'm quite relational. Fundamentally, if I want to do something, I instantly think, \"Who do I want to do this with?\" Then, I organize the activity with that sociability. They are completely intertwined.",

    "fullText": "US presidents rode Lincoln limousines for most of the 20th century until the 1980s, when the Reagan administration switched to Cadillacs.\n\nThe latest model of the presidential limousine was commissioned by the US Secret Service in 2014 and used for the first time in 2018 by President Donald Trump.\n\nDesigned to look like a longer version of a Cadillac XT6, the chassis of the car is actually that of a Chevrolet Kodiak truck produced by General Motors, NBC News reported. The vehicle weighs around 20,000 pounds and cost around $1.5 million to build.\n\nWhile details about the limousine's security measures remain classified, NBC News reported that the vehicle features a night-vision system, tear gas firing capabilities, and door handles that can be electrified to prevent intruders.\n\nThe windows are believed to be 3 inches thick, and the vehicle's armor is around 8 inches thick.\n\nThe limousine's secure communications system can dispatch the launch codes for nuclear weapons.\n\nThe seal, featuring an eagle holding an olive branch and 13 arrows in its talons below a banner reading \"E Pluribus Unum\" (\"Out of many, one\"), appears on both the interior and exterior of the passenger door.\n\nThe interior features water bottle holders and plush leather seats. Previous presidential limousines have also included a fold-out desk, according to the US Secret Service.\n\nPresidential limousines are transported by military cargo aircraft, such as US Air Force C-17s, for use during the president's travels, according to the US Secret Service.\n\nSome presidents have used the Washington, DC, \"End Taxation Without Representation\" license plates, while others have removed the slogan.\n\nBiden and Trump rode to the 2025 inauguration ceremony together in the presidential limousine.\n\nAhead of a meeting on August 15, 2025, to discuss the war in Ukraine, Trump and Putin unexpectedly rode in the car together. The ride lasted fewer than 10 minutes and offered the leaders the opportunity to talk privately. Putin was seen smiling from within the vehicle.\n\n\"It is safe to say that this car's security and coded communications systems make it the most technologically advanced protection vehicle in the world,\" the assistant director for the US Secret Service's Office of Protective Operations said in a statement on the organization's official website.",

    "description": "After trying the signature burgers from McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King, I liked the smoky flavor of Burger King's Whopper the most.",
    "fullText": "As a food reporter, I've tried and tested many burgers over the years.\n\nBut for my latest taste test, I decided to go back to basics.\n\nWhile I've compared the biggest burgers at fast-food chains and practically every fast-food double cheeseburger, I wanted to see if the signature burgers from three of America's most beloved chains really are classics.\n\nI tried the McDonald's Big Mac, the Wendy's Dave's Single, and the Burger King Whopper to determine which is best in terms of taste and value.\n\nArguably the most iconic fast-food burger, the Big Mac is a staple on McDonald's menu. Created by owner and operator Jim Delligatti of Pittsburgh in 1967, the first \"Big Mac\" featured a triple-decker burger and sold for 45 cents, according to McDonald's.\n\nThe burger rolled out across the US in 1968 and quickly became the chain's signature burger.\n\nToday, an estimated 900 million Big Macs are sold each year around the world.\n\nThe Big Mac cost me $8.29, excluding tax, at my local McDonald's in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThe burger I received was mostly lettuce, which covered up the flavors of the cheese, meat, and sauce. I wanted more of a tangy flavor from ketchup, mustard, or simply more Big Mac sauce.\n\nThe mouthfeel of the burger was noticeably dry — I think a lot of that could be remedied if the burger wasn't so bottom-heavy with its toppings.\n\nThe cheese and layers of Big Mac sauce were all toward the bottom of the burger, rather than the top, which meant the dry bun and burger were hitting the roof of my mouth with little to no flavor or moisture happening.\n\nWhile I understand that this is the most iconic burger on the McDonald's menu — and that preparation can vary slightly by location — it is by no means my favorite.\n\nNext time, I'll order a Quarter Pounder.\n\nNamed after Wendy's founder, Dave Thomas, Dave's Single is Wendy's signature burger. It is available in multiple sizes, from a single to a triple-stacked burger.\n\nIt features one of Wendy's signature square patties and is the chain's take on a classic cheeseburger.\n\nThe burger cost me $8.74, excluding tax, at my local Wendy's in Brooklyn.\n\nIt was practically dripping with sauces, which I didn't necessarily mind. Some of the flavors were slightly covered up by the two condiments, but I thought the cheese was tangy and the onions cut through the sweeter elements of the burger.\n\nThere was also a generous serving of pickles and a large slice of tomato.\n\nHowever, if I had to change one thing, I might remove or ask for a half-serving of mayonnaise.\n\nI thought it was an overall solid choice for a late-night snack.\n\nBurger King's signature burger has been around for decades. Released in 1957, just four years after the chain opened, the Whopper was 37 cents compared to Burger King's original burger, which cost 18 cents.\n\nWhoppers — and all Burger King burgers, for that matter — are flame-grilled, giving their burgers a distinct smoky flavor.\n\nFor the sake of this experiment, I decided to order a Whopper with cheese to ensure a fair comparison with the other signature burgers.\n\nThe Whopper cost me $9.17, excluding tax, at my local Burger King in Brooklyn.\n\nRight away, I could tell this burger was going to pack tons of flavor. Thick layers of ketchup and mayonnaise oozed out of the sides of the burger, while the bun was large and held the other ingredients together perfectly.\n\nThe lettuce, tomatoes, and onions all tasted very fresh, adding a delicious crunch to the burger.\n\nThe burger patties had a smoky, savory flavor that made the sandwich taste fresh off the grill. I also thought the patty's shape, which was larger in circumference but flatter than some of the other burgers, made the sandwich easier to eat.\n\nOverall, I think the burger was worth the higher price tag.\n\nWhen comparing the three signature burgers, I found myself feeling like a fast-food-eating Goldilocks: One burger was too dry, one was too moist, and one was just right.",

    "description": "Le Labo is a cult-favorite fragrance brand. Men are especially big fans of its scents, and say their favorites include Another 13 and Thé Matcha 26.",
    "fullText": "If you know, you know: Le Labo is, subtly, one of the brands men are obsessed with — and that's exactly the point.\n\nThe cult fragrance brand has quietly become one of the most powerful players in the perfume industry. Its unisex fragrances are packaged in unassuming bottles, and you won't find them at big-box beauty retailers like Sephora and Ulta Beauty.\n\nStill, fragrance fans swear by it. Scents like Santal 33 have become mega hits, and its boutique stores are must-visit destinations for those serious about scent.\n\nMen especially love Le Labo and have shared their recommendations across Reddit and TikTok, where the brand has become shorthand for taste.\n\nSo Business Insider asked a few men to share the Le Labo scents they spray on their skin again and again. Here are their top five favorites.\n\nMicah Ronald, a 19-year-old college student in Arizona, was looking for fragrance recommendations on TikTok about six months ago when he came across rave reviews of Le Labo.\n\nHe bought the $135 discovery kit and instantly became a fan of Another 13.\n\n\"It's a fresh, clean scent that doesn't smell too much like laundry,\" he said.\n\nLe Labo describes the perfume on its website as a hypnotizing and \"addictive dirty potion.\" When I tried it, I smelled jasmine, citrus, vanilla, and musk.\n\nMalcolm Walker-Hendricks, 30, who is based in Quebec and works in sales and content creation, said Another 13 is his favorite scent \"without a doubt or hesitation.\"\n\n\"It reminds me of being in Lisbon, Portugal, because it's very light, airy, and sweet, with a little twang,\" he said. \"I probably use it as much as I drink water in a day.\"\n\nBrendan Jordan is a 29-year-old content creator based in Pennsylvania. Though he'd heard about Le Labo years ago, he tried its scents for the first time at a Saks Fifth Avenue store last year.\n\nSince then, Thé Matcha 26 has become his \"go-to scent for the summer and spring.\" It features notes of fig, vetiver, and orange.\n\n\"I like the organic warmth that it has on the skin,\" Ronald said. \"As soon as I tried it, I knew I would want to wear it every day. It's a scent that you catch little whiffs of for hours.\"\n\nThat's also partly why the scent has become a favorite of Austin Goode, a 30-year-old videographer from Utah.\n\n\"Out of all my fragrances, I get the most compliments on Thé Matcha 26,\" he said.\n\nCameron Cooper, 25, is a content creator and model based in Los Angeles. He discovered Santal 33 for the first time in 2023.\n\n\"It's sweet and salty, but also musky,\" he said. \"It's an attractive scent, and I was very drawn to it. My wife gifted me a bottle of it to wear on our wedding day and honeymoon.\"\n\n\"Anytime I smell [Santal 33], it takes me back to that time, which is really sweet,\" he added.\n\nSantal 33 was released in 2011 and remains one of Le Labo's most popular scents. It's made with notes of iris, violet, sandalwood, and leather.\n\nIn October, Cooper tried Thé Noir 29 for the first time. The scent, featuring notes of musk, black licorice, and light tobacco, has since become his daily fragrance.\n\n\"It's very tea-like, but it also has this nice vetiver smell and a musk at the end,\" he said. \"The scent profile is just intoxicating.\"\n\nJordan is also a fan and said he likes to wear it for nights out. Walker-Hendricks, on the other hand, wears Thé Noir 29 seasonally.\n\n\"It's really good in colder weather because it gives you that warm, almost overwhelming feeling of being near a campfire,\" he said.\n\nLe Labo's Lavande 31 is intended to \"knock all preconceived notions of lavender on its head,\" according to the brand's website.\n\nIt does exactly that with notes of lavender, moss, musk, and citrus zest.\n\nThat's why Walker-Hendricks and Cooper both say they like to wear it as the weather warms.\n\n\"I like floral scents, so [Lavande 31] is a cool one for spring,\" Walker-Hendricks said.",

    "title": "Parents are still worried about sitting together with their kids on planes. Here are 8 tips to make sure you do.",
    "description": "Airline family seating rules vary widely. Here's how parents can increase their chances of sitting together when flying with children.",
    "fullText": "Traveling in a group can be a challenge, and confusing airline policies can make the experience even more of an ordeal. For adults, being separated on a flight is an inconvenience. But for families with young children or caregivers of travelers with special needs, sitting apart on the plane can be a crisis.\n\nFor many years, families have favored Southwest Airlines for its open seating policy, which allows travelers to choose their own seats in boarding order. But Southwest switched to assigned seating on January 27 after more than 50 years of flexible seating, joining virtually every other commercial airline. Moving forward, all Southwest passengers will have designated seats and board the plane accordingly.\n\nIf sitting together on the plane is important for your family, here's how to ensure you always get seats together.\n\nConcerns about families being separated on planes have grown so common that federal regulators have taken notice. In 2024, the Department of Transportation proposed a rule prohibiting US airlines from charging parents additional fees to sit next to children under 13. While that proposal has not yet become law, it highlights how significant the issue has become for travelers.\n\nFor now, airline policies vary. The DOT maintains an airline family seating dashboard summarizing family travel policies across 10 major US carriers. Alaska, American, Frontier, Hawaiian, and JetBlue guarantee family seating for eligible children at no additional cost, while Allegiant, Delta, Southwest, Spirit, and United do not.\n\nThe simplest and most reliable way to sit together is to choose your seats when you purchase your tickets.\n\nDuring the booking process, most airlines display a seat map that allows travelers to select exact locations. Take the time to click through each passenger on the reservation and assign seats individually. Tools like SeatMaps.com can help you get an idea of the aircraft layout and choose seats with desirable features like extra legroom or window views.\n\nSome airlines automatically block adjacent seats when minors are included on a reservation, while others attempt to make adjustments closer to departure. Reviewing these policies in advance can help you choose an airline and avoid surprises after the fact.\n\nPro tip: If you've chosen an airline that charges for advanced seat assignments, you may be able to recoup some of those costs with a good travel credit card that comes with annual travel credits toward eligible expenses. You may also avoid seat selection fees if you have elite status with that airline or if you purchase higher fare-class tickets.\n\nWhenever possible, book everyone together in one transaction. This simple step makes it much easier for customer service representatives to assist if problems arise.\n\nKeeping all family members on a single reservation is another essential strategy for ensuring you're seated together, unless you're experienced travelers with very specific reasons for separating your bookings. In fact, some airlines like Alaska require you to be booked on the same reservation with your children in order to be eligible for the guaranteed seat selection policy.\n\nAirline computer systems do not automatically recognize separate bookings as part of the same group, even when the passengers share a last name, and it's far harder to identify seating needs or make changes across multiple reservations, especially if you need to change your flights for any reason.\n\nPro tip: If you've already purchased your flights across different reservations, a quick call to customer service can help you link them.\n\nLow-cost basic economy tickets can be tempting, especially for larger families trying to keep travel expenses down, but these fares come with significant drawbacks that impact seating choices.\n\nMost basic economy tickets do not allow advance seat selection, even if you're willing to pay for the privilege. Instead, seats are assigned automatically, often at check-in, after all the higher-paying passengers have had their choice.\n\nFor parents, basic economy creates unnecessary uncertainty since you're far more likely to end up with scattered seat assignments, especially on airlines that don't guarantee family seating.\n\nPro tip: If you can't avoid basic economy, contact your airline immediately after booking to let them know you're traveling with minors. Some carriers will make notes on the reservation or allow you to upgrade your tickets to a fare class that offers seat selection.\n\nThere are pros and cons for families considering connecting flights. For families with little kids, layovers can offer a chance to stretch in the airport and get some of the wiggles out.\n\nBut if it's extremely important to you to sit together during your travels, your safest bet is to book the most direct route, especially during busy travel periods. That way, you only have one flight to worry about instead of two or even three.\n\nPro tip: If connecting flights are your only option, do your homework ahead of time to ensure you know which gate you're arriving into, which gate your next flight departs from, and make sure you budget enough time to purchase food, traverse the airport, and everything else you need to do before showing up to board your flight on time.\n\nPurchase your flights as early as possible to give yourself the greatest flexibility in seat selection, since the best seats get snatched up as flights fill. If you have no choice but to buy last-minute tickets, contact your airline as soon as you've booked your tickets to ensure they know you're traveling with little ones.\n\nChoosing less popular travel times can also improve your chances of finding good seats together. Flying on Christmas Day itself, for example, can often be easier than fighting the holiday travel crowds the weekend prior.\n\nPro tip: Many travelers avoid early-morning or red-eye flights, which tend to be less full than routes operating during peak travel hours.\n\nEven after you've selected your seats, it is important to monitor flight reservations periodically, even if you haven't gotten a notification that anything is amiss. Aircraft substitutions and schedule changes are common and can disrupt previously assigned seating.\n\nFor example, if your original flight is scheduled on a larger aircraft that's later swapped for a smaller plane, you can easily end up in different seats even though your flight number and reservations remain the same.\n\nChecking the reservation a few times in the weeks leading up to departure lets you spot any problems early, while there's still time to correct them. Airline mobile apps make this process easy, and often allow free adjustments if better seats become available.\n\nPro tip: If you start seeing inclement weather reports, you can also proactively reach out to your airline to change your flights before you are rescheduled. That way, you may be able to stay at home in comfort and peace instead of spending an exhausting day at the airport getting nowhere.\n\nThe best-laid plans can still go awry — but having extra time on hand can make all the difference when resolving unexpected issues, such as seating changes due to last-minute equipment swaps.\n\nCustomer service agents at the airport typically have more tools at their disposal on the day of travel than phone representatives do beforehand. Calmly explaining the situation and courteously emphasizing that you are traveling with minors often prompts agents to look for workable solutions.\n\nMake sure you read all the fine print carefully before you travel, so you know your rights. That way, you'll know your options should a situation arise that requires immediate decision-making.\n\nPro tip: If a problem remains unresolved by boarding time, parents still have options. If the seats you booked aren't available and a satisfactory solution can't be found, you can usually request to be booked on a later flight at no additional cost or request a full refund.",

    "description": "My grandparents' 54-year marriage has taught me valuable lessons about relationships, like the importance of making time for individual interests.",
    "fullText": "My grandparents, whom I call Papa and GG, have been together since they were teenagers and married for 54 years.\n\nAs I've grown up, I've realized the secret to their lasting love hasn't been perfection or grand gestures. Instead, it's in finding joy and meaning in life's small, everyday moments.\n\nTheir marriage has taught me how powerful a gentle, consistent love can be, and how beautifully it can shape everything around it.\n\nHere are three of the biggest lessons I've learned from them that I hope to bring into my own relationships.\n\nWhether it's by going on a spontaneous camping trip or navigating retirement together, my grandparents delight in discovering new things about each other.\n\nBoth avid readers, they often will sit beneath their orange tree and share quotes from their books. After long Sunday walks through the park, they also like to continue their running card game of gin rummy, laughter, and nostalgic stories tumbling between them.\n\nEven after decades together, they also eat dinner with each other nearly every night, eager to unravel each other's thoughts, feelings, and experiences.\n\nMy grandparents have found a variety of ways to show each other they care.\n\nEvery morning, for example, my Papa clips the \"Love Is…\" comic strip from the newspaper and places it on the kitchen counter for GG. He also writes poems, scribbled on notepads, painted on rocks, or sent as random texts throughout the day.\n\nMeanwhile, GG often sends photos of heart-shaped stones or leaves she finds on her walks, and they both leave handwritten notes in each other's suitcases when they travel.\n\nPhysical affection anchors it all, though. There's rarely ever a moment when they aren't holding hands or resting a head on a shoulder. They often seem to do it without even realizing, as though one another is as constant and grounding as gravity.\n\nIn my opinion, one of the reasons their relationship still feels so alive is because they never stopped making room for their individual interests.\n\nGG started playing mahjong in retirement and now competes in tournaments, and Papa likes to play golf around the world.\n\nInstead of resenting or fearing change, they celebrate each other's passions, and watching each other reinvent themselves sustains their mutual excitement.\n\nThese days, it can be hard to sift through the barrage of conflicting advice on how to find and cultivate long-lasting love.\n\nStill, witnessing my grandparents build a life out of tiny kindnesses — notes slipped into suitcases, breakfast cartoons, and shared laughter — has shown me the recipe is simpler than we think.\n\nI see how extraordinary it is to share life's simplest joys, to choose a partner who is real, steady, and kind. That level of devotion is an everyday miracle, and I try to weave those threads into my own relationships.\n\nI send handwritten letters back and forth with my friends and family, and my boyfriend and I collect concert tickets, printed menus, and postcards from trips and dates we've experienced.\n\nThese items are arranged in a collage in my apartment, ink-stained and wrinkled, but tangible proof of the love my grandparents have taught me to sow.",

    "fullText": "I love my fiancée so much that I proposed to her twice.\n\nIt wasn't because I didn't believe my lover — who is admittedly far out of my league — the first time she said yes, nor was it my pesky perfectionism rearing its demanding head because not every detail went according to plan.\n\nRather, certain aspects of our engagement didn't quite meet our expectations.\n\nThere are a lot of things my fiancée and I fondly reflect on when we talk about the day we got engaged — the location in her hometown, New York City; the perfect fit of her rose-gold ring from a nearby jeweler; the violinist who flawlessly played her favorite songs.\n\nHowever, at the same time, it felt sabotaged by some people in our lives who were emotionally standing in our way instead of celebrating us. I was also at the pinnacle of my unhealthiest self, both mentally and physically.\n\nSeeing the pain behind my eyes while looking at the photographs from that otherwise special day eventually became too much to bear.\n\nAs the weeks passed, I kept feeling that we deserved another special day, one completely focused on our love, without a damper from self-consciousness or unsupportive connections.\n\nSo, I planned a second proposal about two years after the first.\n\nI felt inspired as I planned another proposal to my fiancée.\n\nIn the two or so years since the first engagement, we'd eliminated a lot of the stressors that had been holding us back. For one, I'd lost a significant amount of weight and was mentally in a much better place.\n\nNow, I had a chance to profess my undying love for the woman of my dreams again, this time unbothered by others' opinions and with the renewed confidence that comes with drastically improved health.\n\nInstead of heading back to NYC, I set my sights on proposing during the Disneyland trip we'd been planning.\n\nShe had no idea what was to come as we drove to Anaheim, California, with a bubbly Disney playlist serving as the soundtrack to our adventure.\n\nWithin the magical confines of Main Street, USA, I got down on one knee and renewed my commitment to the same loving promises I shared the first time around.\n\nI expressed my excitement for our coming marriage, and once more promised her forever. Again, she said yes.\n\nInstead of buying another engagement ring for the occasion, I surprised her with a piece of jewelry that matched the ring she already had.\n\nThen, we headed to the Plaza Inn for a vegan meal surrounded by many of my fiancée's favorite Disney characters. It felt magical.\n\nA second proposal wasn't necessary, but it was worth it in every way to see the bliss on my fiancée's face as we created another beautiful moment together.\n\nNow, we have even more wonderful memories to reflect on, and the best part is, the day was entirely about us and our love.\n\nTruthfully, I recommend a second proposal to anyone who felt their first attempt wasn't as magical as they deserved.\n\nWhether you lost the ring, forgot to say the best parts of your speech, or just had an even better idea, a second proposal could show your lover that you're recommitting to them in a romantic and innovative way.\n\nMaybe it's unconventional, but we live in a time when breaking free from tradition is becoming the norm, whether it's as simple as living together before marriage or as milquetoast as having food trucks at a wedding.\n\nSo why not propose to the love of your life a second time? It's a way to remind them how much you want to marry them — and it could be the start of another great chapter.",

    "description": "The author organized a party for her dad's 90th birthday. After he had a heart attack, it looked as if it would be canceled. But it went ahead anyway.",
    "fullText": "My father has always been a sociable person who loves nothing better than chatting with relatives, friends, and ex-colleagues.\n\nSo it seemed like a fun idea to throw him a surprise party for his milestone 90th birthday at a cricket club in the English town where I grew up.\n\nOur intention was \"go big or go home,\" and my sister, Alison, and I asked dozens of people to join the celebration.\n\nWe decided on a newspaper theme because Dad was the former editor in chief of a local newspaper. I spent hours designing the invitation, emphasizing that the event was top secret, and using the font of an old-fashioned typewriter.\n\nMom was also kept in the dark because we wanted it to be a surprise for her, too.\n\nThe guest list grew by the day as we contacted people from every part of Dad's life, including his sister-in-law, cousin, nieces, nephews, and neighbors.\n\nMost of the attendees were journalists who'd worked with him during his seven decades in print. We imagined his delight when he met them again.\n\nMy sister and I planned the party with military precision from our homes on either side of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWe bought runners for the tables, framed a huge welcome poster, made bunting, and ordered a massive cake that looked like the front page of Dad's beloved paper.\n\nThen, two weeks before the party, Dad had a cardiac arrest. He'd shown signs of slowing down over the previous few months, but it was a terrible shock.\n\nThankfully, the heart attack was relatively mild — but it was enough to keep him in the hospital, followed by a rehab facility for the next seven days.\n\nMom and Ali stayed at his bedside, while I made concerned calls from the US. It was horrible to live so far away while my family was in need.\n\nThe worry was bad enough, but I admit it was compounded by the fact that we'd organized the birthday party. Dad's health was the absolute priority, but people had been looking forward to the occasion and booked train tickets and hotels.\n\nI felt selfish for having those thoughts, but couldn't bring myself to cancel the celebration quite yet. I consulted with Ali, who agreed we should reassess in a few days' time.\n\nWhile Dad quickly showed signs of improvement, we faced a dilemma. Should we do the \"sensible thing\" and call off the party? Perhaps there was a compromise. What if the event went ahead in Dad's honor, whether he attended or not?\n\nHe was as generous as he was sociable, and wouldn't have wanted anyone to be disappointed or sad. Besides, he'd get a kick out of all the tributes to him.\n\nWe sent an email to tell the guests what had happened. We said we understood if they wanted to decline, but hoped they wouldn't. Dad could even make a virtual appearance on a giant TV screen, we said.\n\nMost people thought it would be nice to get together for a reunion and celebrate Dad. If they couldn't raise a glass and appreciate him together, then when could they?\n\nTo our relief, Dad rallied over the following week. He returned from the hospital and became quite jovial again. My husband and I flew to England as planned, and he was pleased to see us.\n\nNevertheless, a big question mark remained over the party. Dad's medical team was impressed by his continued recovery, and Ali sought their advice. She wanted to know whether it was safe for him to attend. They said it would boost his morale and give him something to look forward to.\n\nObviously, we no longer kept the lunch a surprise and asked Dad for his opinion. There was no pressure, we said, but if the thought of a celebration appealed to him, we'd do our best to get him there.\n\nHis face lit up. \"I can't wait to see everyone,\" he said.\n\nWe left it until the morning itself for him to finally decide. If he felt up to coming, great. If not, that would be fine. It didn't really matter because he'd be there in spirit.\n\nStill, proud and determined, Dad made it in person. He shook hands with everyone in the room and laughed at the speeches. He even gave one himself.\n\nThe party was a roaring success. Ali and I agreed that we'd done the right thing. We hadn't seen Dad so happy in years.",

    "fullText": "FRANKFURT, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank unveiled plans on Saturday to widen access to its euro liquidity backstop, making it globally available and permanent in a bid to bolster the international role of the single currency.\n\nAccess to such repo lines, a crucial source of funding during times of market stress, has been limited to just a handful of mostly Eastern European countries but ECB President Christine Lagarde has long seen the facility as a tool to boost the euro’s global reach.\n\n\"The ECB needs to be prepared for a more volatile environment,\" Lagarde said at the Munich Security Conference, the first time an ECB chief spoke at the event.\n\n\"We must avoid a situation where that stress triggers fire sales of euro-denominated securities in global funding markets, which could hamper the transmission of our monetary policy,\" she said in announcing the new facility.\n\nThe facility, to be available from the third quarter of 2026, will be open to all central banks around the world, provided they are not excluded for reputational reasons, such as money laundering, terrorist financing or international sanctions, the ECB said.\n\n\"This facility also reinforces the role of the euro,\" Lagarde said. \"The availability of a lender of last resort for central banks worldwide boosts confidence to invest, borrow and trade in euros, knowing that access will be there during market disruptions.\"\n\nUsed when banks are unable to obtain funding on the market, the repo line allows lenders to borrow euros from the ECB against high-quality collateral, to be repaid at maturity along with interest.\n\nUnlike previous lines, which had to be extended from time to time, the new facility will provide standing access for up to 50 billion euros.\n\nWith investors reassessing the dollar’s status due to the unpredictable nature of U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic policy, Lagarde has argued this was the time for the euro to gain market share, but this required a revamped financial and economic architecture.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve maintains a similar tool, called the FIMA Repo Facility, which essentially protects the Treasury market since stress might otherwise force lenders to sell government bonds below market value.\n\n\"These changes aim to make the facility more flexible, broader in terms of its geographical reach and more relevant for global holders of euro securities,\" the ECB said in a statement.\n\nSuch a guaranteed access to euros could naturally increase demand for euro-denominated assets and encourage banks outside the 21-nation euro zone to buy assets from the bloc.\n\nFor a factbox on the details of the new repo facility, click here.",

    "description": "If the Soviets hadn't been atheists, it would've been a Come-to-Jesus moment.",
    "fullText": "When Operation Desert Storm ended in 1991, it blew the Soviet Union’s collective mind—and Moscow’s hangover has never ended.\n\nThe hardest pill the Soviet general staff would have to swallow was that Iraq was fighting with Soviet doctrine: Soviet gear, Soviet training, and a Soviet-style air defense concept. The Russians expected Baghdad to be a stress test for American air power and a preview of how a U.S. coalition (like NATO) might bleed in a big, messy land war.\n\nAlso Read: 21 Facts about the First Gulf War\n\nInstead, the Coalition ran an air campaign that looked like large-scale surgery, then wrapped the ground war up in about 100 hours. To Soviet eyes, it wasn’t just that their client got beaten. It felt like their whole model of modern war got exposed as outdated for the entire world to see.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition didn’t just beat Saddam Hussein’s army. It made a public demonstration of how wars would be fought after the Cold War. And the Soviet general staff, already dealing with a collapsing economy and a political system eating itself alive, had to sit there and take notes. \n\nThose notes were not comforting.\n\nOn paper, Iraq appeared to be a formidable opponent. It had a large army (the fourth-largest in the world), extensive armor, robust air defenses, and years of experience fighting Iran. Much of its gear and training had Soviet fingerprints all over it. Viewers from Moscow could reasonably believe this would turn into a long, bloody grind once the ground war started. \n\nTo the Soviets, the war to oust Iraq from Kuwait could’ve taken weeks. Maybe months\n\nIn Moscow’s prewar mental script, air power could hurt you, slow you down, and make life miserable, but it couldn’t decide the war by itself. The decisive fight would still be the ground campaign, and that ground campaign (the Russians believed) would punish an all-volunteer American force.\n\nThat belief was doctrine, rooted in how the Red Army was designed to fight NATO. The model was a system of armor and infantry massed and protected by air defenses, backed by artillery, with enough depth to absorb punishment and keep moving. \n\nSo when early reports suggested Iraqi formations were unraveling fast, it was easy to dismiss them as confusion, exaggeration, or wishful thinking. Fog of war happens. Propaganda happens. And in a fast-moving conflict, both sides always claim the other one is panicking.\n\nMoscow’s theory didn’t survive first contact with reality. The ground war began on Feb. 24, 1991, and it was essentially over by the 28th. The famous 100 hours number wasn’t just a headline.\n\nSoviet observers watched Iraqi air defenses get blinded and dismantled in layers. They watched command posts go quiet. They watched armored formations get shredded, sometimes without ever seeing what hit them. And they watched a massive Coalition force move fast through open desert, at night, in bad weather, then show up on Iraq’s flank as if it had teleported.\n\nThe Coalition’s main ground move should’ve looked familiar to Soviet planners on a map. It was a huge left hook through the desert, a deep envelopment that punished an opponent who expected the main blow to land elsewhere. In theory, that kind of maneuver was respectable. In practice, it happened with a tempo and coordination that Iraq didn’t match.\n\nU.S. forces pushed wide, moved quickly, and kept units aligned across featureless terrain in bad visibility, often operating at night and in poor weather. Iraqi forces didn’t respond like a machine built to fight a mobile, combined-arms campaign. They reacted late, inconsistently, or not at all, and by the time they realized where the main threat actually was, the Coalition was already on their flank and behind key positions.\n\nFor Soviet observers, the bigger shock wasn’t that a left hook happened. It was that it worked so cleanly, so quickly, and alongside an air campaign that had already shredded the opponent’s ability to see, communicate, and coordinate.\n\nIn the air, Iraqi pilots and air defenders faced a problem that goes beyond courage or competence. When you’re dealing with electronic attack, radar suppression, stealthy aircraft, decoys, and constant pressure, the tactical experience can feel like everything is lying to you. Contacts appear and vanish. Radars behave strangely. Warning receivers chirp, then go quiet, then scream again. \n\nSoviet doctrine was comfortable with a certain kind of war. It assumed time, mass, and a hierarchy that could grind its way through chaos. What Desert Storm showcased was a style of fighting that tried to prevent the opponent from ever getting organized enough to grind back.\n\nFor a staff raised on artillery math and tank counts, this suddenly became an was an existential crisis.\n\nIf the first day broke Moscow’s theory, the images from the days that followed broke its spirit. The Soviet Union learned that the Cold War wasn’t a stalemate. \n\nAs Iraqi troops and vehicles fled Kuwait City north on Highway 80, American air power hit the retreating column for hours with industrial precision. When satellite images filtered back to Moscow, Soviet analysts saw what looked less like a battle scene and more like a mass grave. A massive number of vehicles were jammed and incinerated, tanks with turrets blown off, trucks seemingly melted into the road.\n\nWestern media called it the “Highway of Death.” In Moscow, it was something else altogether, a demonstration of what happens when one side can find, track, and hit what it wants, while the other side can’t do anything about it. \n\nIraq’s loss wasn’t only about tanks burning. It was about the Coalition’s ability to make the battlefield transparent enough to turn a large movement of units into a vulnerability. Once you can consistently detect movement, share targeting information quickly, and strike with precision, the old comfort of massing a large force of armor starts to look less like deterrence and more like a liability.\n\nInitially, Moscow’s copium was to blame the Iraqis. Iraq must have been incompetent. Iraqi troops were undisciplined. They misused Soviet doctrine. They didn’t fight the way they were supposed to fight. It’s not entirely wrong. Iraq had major problems in training, leadership, morale, logistics, and initiative. But it also misses what Desert Storm put on display, the thing the USSR didn’t want ot accept: This wasn’t just a mismatch of soldiers. \n\nIt was a mismatch of systems.\n\nSoviet analysts started digging. They looked for a single decisive advantage: one ghost, one superweapon, one electronic trick that blinded radar, one wonder weapon that explained the whole thing. But if there was one thing that made the swift destruction of the Iraqi Army possible, it was one thing that was actually many things. Iraq was actually fighting a network.\n\nVictory in the Gulf began with something that might have sounded like science fiction in 1991, but is used today to deliver food: the Global Positioning System. GPS wasn’t just navigation. It was the quiet enabler that let U.S. forces maneuver at speed, at night, in sandstorms, and hit with accuracy that made older platforms perform like something new.\n\nThe real gut punch was identifying America’s “all-seeing eye,” the E-8 JSTARS, a radar and battle management platform that could scan enormous swaths of ground and track moving vehicles, then push that data across the force. The Americans fused sensors, shooters, and communications into a single integrated system. JSTARS sees movement, passes targets digitally, AWACS sorts the air picture, and shooters arrive already knowing where to look. \n\nThat’s why the “Highway of Death” looked like a conveyor belt of destruction.\n\nIt’s also why this hit Moscow so hard. Soviet doctrine was hierarchical. Reports went up, orders came down, and time lag was baked in. The Americans, in this view, were operating a network in which platforms were tools and speed was the real weapon.\n\nA RAND assessment published in 1992 laid out how Russian military thinkers were digesting Desert Storm, and the lessons weren’t subtle. First and foremost, they saw Desert Storm as proof that modern war had changed dramatically from the model they’d expected. It didn’t change bits and pieces, the Gulf War changed the foundation of Soviet military thinking.\n\nAlthough the air war came first, the USSR saw air power as the main event, not the opening act. The idea that air forces could create victory conditions with comparatively low friendly losses hit hard, especially for a military culture raised on mass and attrition. The Soviets also had to confront an ugly truth about tanks and armies under hostile skies. If the other side controls the air, armored forces become endangered. It’s a simple matter of exposure.\n\nSoviet-style command-and-control also appeared too rigid for the American tempo. Centralized control might keep order, but it also slows adaptation. Desert Storm highlighted speed, flexibility, and coordination across services as more than buzzwords. Fixed defenses weren’t the comfort blanket they used to be. Hardened shelters, static nodes, and predictable infrastructure became targets. Stealth and precision made hiding harder.\n\nAnd then there was coalition warfare. \n\nSoviet analysts didn’t just notice the Coalition existed. They noticed how it functioned. They saw victory tied not only to weapon performance, but also to a command system that could coordinate air, land, maritime forces, national goals, and political will without collapsing into chaos.\n\nMoreover, victory on the battlefield would henceforth be determined by who sees first, who shares fastest, who decides quickest, and who can keep operating when their networks get attacked.\n\nThat conclusion carried an uncomfortable second layer. Iraq wasn’t just a client state getting embarrassed. The Soviet Union, and later Russia, used similar hardware as the Iraqis did in Kuwait, and had some similar habits of command. So the nightmare wasn’t Iraqi conscripts losing tanks. It was Soviet conscripts losing them the same way in a war against NATO.\n\nDesert Storm didn’t just end a war in the desert. It helped start the argument over what modern war even is, and Moscow has been arguing with that reality ever since.\n\n• The Coalition destroyed the entire Iraqi Navy in four days\n• How the Marines ripped through the Iraqis in Operation Desert Storm\n• Navy battleships pulled off the biggest military deception of Desert Storm",

    "fullText": "Former Dallas Cowboys star Nate Newton has publicly responded after receiving a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, closing a chapter that has followed him for more than two decades.\n\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion did not hesitate in expressing gratitude.\n\nIn a statement shared on X, Newton addressed the current US president directly.\n\n“I would like to thank President Trump and all of those that work under him who put this Pardon into effect.\n\n“Thank you, sir, for taking time out of your busy day in running this country. Thank you, sincerely, and may God bless you,” Newton tweeted.\n\nThe tone was formal and deliberate, signaling that Newton views the pardon as deeply significant.\n\nFor a player who helped anchor one of the NFL’s most dominant offensive lines in the 1990s, the message represented more than political alignment. It marked acknowledgment of a past that has long complicated his legacy.\n\nNewton’s playing career ended in the late 1990s, but his life took a darker turn in 2001 when he pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking charges.\n\nHe later served nearly two years in prison, a period that reshaped both his public image and personal trajectory.\n\nThe presidential pardon does not erase that history. It does not rewrite court records or undo the conviction.\n\nWhat it does provide is formal forgiveness at the federal level, restoring certain civil privileges and signaling that the government considers the debt paid. For Newton, that distinction matters.\n\nHis on-field achievements, including three Super Bowl rings, were never in question. What lingered was the stain of a post-career collapse that overshadowed those accomplishments.\n\nThe pardon reframes the narrative from downfall to redemption. Public reaction will inevitably vary, but Newton’s focus was clear. Gratitude, not debate. After decades defined by dominance, disgrace and now clemency, his story has taken another turn.\n\nJesse Ventura almost resigned from WWE Hall of Fame over Donald Trump induction in 2013\n\nAOC responds to Donald Trump saying he didn’t understand Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show\n\nStephen A.

    "description": "The U.S. already has special visas for workers in sectors like agriculture and tech",
    "fullText": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to give special visas to construction workers, given that the Trump administration’s deportation campaign is reportedly causing a labor shortage on construction sites in states like Texas.\n\nThe Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act, introduced in September, would offer non-citizens temporary, renewable visas for up to nine years to work in key industries where employers are struggling to hire.\n\n“That would help us protect and get immigrants legally for those in the construction industry,” Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-TX) told Nexstar.\n\nDe La Cruz was part of a group of South Texas leaders who met with House Speaker Mike Johnson this week to discuss the proposal, as home builders in the state warn of slowing construction times and difficulty hiring over fears of immigration raids.\n\n“They hear Monte Cielo and say, ‘No, no. You can pay me whatever you want, but I’m not going to go work there,’” Alejandro Garcia, a home builder at work on a development in Weslaco, Texas, that has been raided multiple times, told The Wall Street Journal last week.\n\nA concrete supplier in the region, meanwhile, told the paper that concrete use fell 60 percent between May and November, as builders lost workers and projects stalled.\n\n“A project that was taking maybe four to five months on an average, starter-type home is now taking eight, nine, 10 months, just because of the delays,” Efrain Gomez, treasurer of the South Texas Builders Association, told NewsNation. “It’s a huge ripple effect.”\n\nImmigrants, legal and otherwise, make up more than half the construction workforce in states like Texas, California, Florida, and New York, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration campaign has butted up against key industries like agriculture, hospitality, and construction that rely heavily on the labor of immigrants and undocumented people.\n\nThe administration has pushed to expand the H-2A visa for farm workers, and last year, Trump toyed with a pause on raids on hotels, restaurants, and agriculture, only for the administration to insist days later there would be “no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"\n\nThe administration has faced similar tensions over the H-1B specialist visa program, which is heavily in use by the president’s allies in the tech industry but undercuts his emphasis on hiring American workers.",

    "title": "Spring Outlook Is Here And A Shift Is Coming: How A Weakening La Niña Can Affect March, April And May",
    "description": "While this spring outlook may not see much in terms of change right away, a shift is coming that may make millions very happy. We break it down below.",
    "fullText": "As spring approaches, the ongoing La Niña is beginning to show signs of weakening. We will likely see a neutral phase through the springtime, and this will shift the weather patterns that have been ongoing across the U.S.\n\nLet's break down the seasonal outlooks, each month’s change and why this is happening.\n\nThe spring outlook brings some good news for those living in the Northeast. Slightly above-average temperatures are expected, though it starts to trend cooler the farther into New England you go.\n\nWhile some below-average temperatures are expected this spring for the Upper Midwest as well, the rest of the country will continue to see above-average temperatures, according to the outlook released Thursday by The Weather Company and Atmospheric G2.\n\nHere's how things are looking on a month-by-month basis.\n\nFor March, cold temperatures are expected to remain across the northern portion of the country. The Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, mid-Atlantic, Northeast and the northernmost portions of the Northern Plains should see temperatures below average for March.\n\nContrast this with the South, Central U.S. and most of the West, which are expected to be above average.\n\nThe Northeast, likely still longing for some more consistent warmth, will have to wait through March as well.\n\nApril will begin to really see a shift in what has been ongoing for the country over the winter.\n\nWhile the below-average temperatures remain for the Upper Midwest and even include parts of the Northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest, the same is not expected for the Northeast.\n\nAbove-average temperatures are expected to cover the entire region, which is a very welcome change from the consistent cold that remained for parts of winter.\n\nThe southern half of the country will continue to see above-average temperatures, and the highest chance for some warm weather will stretch across the Southern Rockies, Southern Plains and Southeast.\n\nMay continues the trend of warmups across much of the Lower 48. The areas that should see the most warming are the West, including much of the Rockies. While still above average, the East could see only slightly above-average temperatures.\n\nThe only area leaning toward below-average temperatures is New England (plus Michigan's Upper Peninsula).\n\nWhile temperatures are the topic at hand as millions are waiting for shifting seasons, we can briefly talk about precipitation and what the next three months may hold.\n\nIt's more of the same. Wetter across the East and drier across the West. This is good for the East as a surprising amount of the region is actually dealing with drought. So, here's to hoping this long-range forecast verifies.\n\nEven though the West has seen a brief pivot in the overall dry and mild season in recent weeks, they look to return to more of what they saw for most of winter.\n\nAs we move into spring, the ongoing La Niña is showing signs of weakening.\n\nFor those that need a quick refresher, La Niña occurs when the Pacific Ocean sees below-average temperatures across the central and east-central portions of the equatorial region of the ocean. El Niño is the opposite, with warmer ocean temperatures in those regions. These influence our weather across the entire United States and the entire planet.\n\nWith a weakening La Nina expected, this means that a new pattern is arising and conditions will shift. This pattern is the neutral phase of El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which in short means that the Pacific waters are not notably above or below average.\n\nSo what do neutral conditions mean for the U.S.?\n\nWell, they do cause slightly more uncertainty in these forecasts, so make sure you take these long-range forecasts with a grain of salt.\n\nWhy is there uncertainty? With more neutral temperatures in the Pacific, you have a smaller difference between temperatures between hemispheres as summer is ending in the Southern Hemisphere and winter is wrapping up in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nYou also have weaker winds at the Equator due to the less extreme differences between hemispheres, and the winds are the main driving factor for El Niño and La Niña.\n\n(More: La Niña Fading: What Warming Waters Mean For This Spring, Hurricane Season)\n\nBut the tendency of neutral conditions during spring is for above-average temperatures in the South and Southeast and cooler temperatures from the Central Plains to the Northeast, which March's and April's monthly forecasts show especially well.\n\nWe also have to talk about the jet stream, which is the main driver of our weather. It begins to weaken around this time of year, which means that our weather patterns are not as easy to predict in the long term.\n\nWhat we are certain of: A shift toward neutral El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions is coming and will lead to some changes across the country. But a lot of factors contribute to a more uncertain forecast.",

    "fullText": "The cancellation of the official House delegation to the annual Munich Security Conference has drawn pushback from Democrats who still plan to attend, even as it’s upended a decades-long tradition of robust bipartisan participation in the high-profile global policy forum.\n\nA House leadership aide told The Hill that cancelling congressional delegations (CODEL) is standard operating procedure during the shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nBut House Democrats have sharply criticized Republicans for the cancellation, arguing that attending the conference is critical to restoring the United States’ standing with allies amid the Trump administration’s aggressive foreign policy approach.\n\n“Because of the Republican shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, because Republicans refuse to make any compromises or any changes to ICE after the deadly murders of Alex Pretti and Renee Good, we have a shutdown, and therefore, we cannot go on official CODELS. I’ve decided, along with a number of my Democratic colleagues, to go anyway,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) said in a video statement on Thursday.\n\nAnsari said she wants to make clear that Trump “does not define the United States, that we are committed to our allies, to NATO, to U.S. credibility and leadership around the world.”\n\nRep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), who also attended the conference, told NBC News on Friday that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had ordered the hotel reservations, military flights and credentials lawmakers had for the conference to be cancelled.\n\nCrow called it the “wrong move,” NBC reported, saying that U.S. officials other than Secretary of State Marco Rubio need to be present at the event.\n\nWhile lawmakers aren’t prohibited from going and House Democrats are still widely planning to attend the conference on their own dime, it is unclear whether any House Republicans will be present. Unlike Johnson’s move to cancel the delegation, several bipartisan Senate delegations will still be attending the conference.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will be attending in her “personal capacity” as a member of the Munich Security Conference Advisory Council, her spokesperson Ian Krager told The Hill in a statement.\n\n“Her presence reflects decades of leadership on transatlantic collaboration and underscores the importance of sustained U.S. partners at a moment of profound geopolitical uncertainty,” Krager said. “Speaker Pelosi remains committed to strengthening partnerships that advance collective security, economic prosperity and democratic governance.”\n\nSome of the other House Democrats present at the conference include Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and Sarah McBride (D-Del.).\n\n“Some of us are going over anyway on our own dime to reassure and thank our allies,” Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, had posted on X.\n\nOcasio-Cortez used a panel discussion at the conference on Friday to prop up the working class and accuse Trump of tearing “apart the transatlantic partnership.”\n\n“One of the reasons why not just myself, but … many Democrats that are here as well, is because we want to tell a larger story, that what is happening is indeed very grave, and we are in a new era, domestically and globally,” Ocasio-Cortez said on the panel, when asked about the significance of her representing the U.S. at the conference.\n\nRep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), a senior member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Politico that it’s a “shame” lawmakers could miss the key conference.\n\nHowever, he added that: “It’s a very responsible position by the Speaker which matches the irresponsibility of the Senate Democrats to shut down the government. And so the responsible act is to be ever available to end the shutdown.”\n\nThe White House and Democrats have been at an impasse over a deal to fund DHS. A stopgap measure that temporarily funds the department for two weeks expired on Feb. 13.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have been demanding sweeping reforms to the White House’s immigration tactics, including an overhaul of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, after agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minnesota. While the White House sent a counterproposal to Democrats on their DHS demands, the minority leaders have argued that the offer falls short.\n\nThe Senate left Washington on Thursday without reaching a deal and DHS shut down at midnight.",

At the end of the day we're a team and we need to put our two pence in when we can.\"\n\nIn a one-sided affair at Allianz Stadium, Wales continued to be plagued by poor discipline and a malfunctioning set piece, something they can ill-afford against a Grand Slam-chasing French side on Sunday.\n\nJenkins said no one was more frustrated in defeat than the players.\n\n\"The fans think it's frustrating, imagine how we feel when we don't do what we say we're going to do,\" he said.\n\n\"England are a class team, France are a class team, you can't give them any easy ins or you're not going to stand a chance.\n\n\"As players we've been very honest about that and the sort of the penalties you don't need to give away.\n\n\"We can't be expecting to win games when our set piece is not functioning, especially at national level, and then we can't give up the gain line as easy.\n\n\"I know the team on the weekend, the big French pack, that's all they want is to go for the gain line because they've got superstars out wide who can cause us problems.\"\n\nWales v France, Principality Stadium\n\nSunday, 15 February at 15:10 GMT\n\nJenkins, 23, has captained Rob Baxter's resurgent Exeter Chiefs side this season with the play-offs very much in sight.\n\n\"It's class down there,\" he said, citing quality players and quality people.\n\nOne of his good friends is Wales forward Christ Tshiunza who has been linked with a move to Cardiff next season.\n\n\"I hope he doesn't [go], because he's a good mate. We've come through all the age groups together,\" said Jenkins.\n\nJenkins says there a similarities in terms of where Exeter were a couple of seasons ago and where Wales find themselves now.\n\n\"The thing with Exeter, it wasn't huge changes we had to make, it was just the little ones, everyday training and stuff,\" he said.\n\n\"You make those changes, have a good pre-season, have a good first few games, get that momentum and the season comes a lot easier.\n\n\"It's similar here [with Wales]. We're a young group and I believe if we continue to make those changes and push as a team, we will be a good side.\n\n\"I personally see where this group can go. I'm confident by the time we get to the World Cup we'll be firing and causing teams a lot of problems.\"",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group C, Kolkata\n\nScotland 152 (19.4 overs): Berrington 49 (32); Rashid 3-36, Archer 2-23\n\nEngland 155-5 (18.2 overs): Banton 63 (41), Bethell 32 (28); Davidson 1-12\n\nEngland had another wobble but got their T20 World Cup campaign back on track with a five-wicket victory over Scotland in Kolkata - a result that leaves the Scots on the brink of a group-stage exit.\n\nAfter dismissing Scotland for 152 on a good batting pitch, England lost Phil Salt and Jos Buttler in the first two overs and were 86-4 when Harry Brook was caught for four.\n\nDefeat would have had England facing a humiliating early exit but Tom Banton fought his way through the tension to play the most important innings of his international career to date and secure victory with 10 balls to spare.\n\nHe broke the shackles by hitting spinner Mark Watt for consecutive sixes and finished 63 not out around contributions of 32 from Jacob Bethell and 28 by Sam Curran.\n\nScotland's application with the ball and in the field was admirable. They were ultimately punished for not taking advantage of the platform set by captain Richie Berrington's 49, which had his side 113-3 in the 13th over.\n\nAdil Rashid overcame an expensive start to finish with 3-36 for England, while an improved Jofra Archer took two wickets in the powerplay and finished with 2-23.\n\nIt means England will confirm their place in the Super 8s by beating Italy on Monday.\n\nScotland play Nepal in their final group match on Tuesday but may have been eliminated by other results by then.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\n\nHaving been lucky to escape against Nepal and been convincingly beaten by West Indies, England are still searching for a complete performance at this World Cup.\n\nThey have won World Cups before despite group-stage defeats but improvement is needed if they are to threaten the best in this tournament.\n\nScotland's opening bowling consisted of Brandon McMullen and Brad Currie's medium pace. They found far more movement than England's bowlers and Salt and Buttler sliced catches to the off-side ring for two and three respectively.\n\nThere were no boundaries off the bat in the first four overs.\n\nBethell brought some calm with his patient knock but England were ultimately grateful to Banton who had not lived up to his talents in his previous 36 internationals.\n\nUnlike Bethell, who was caught trying to help a scoop over short fine leg, and Brook - dismissed in the same fashion - Banton played straight and as a result looked more comfortable than any other batter.\n\nHe took only six from his first 10 deliveries and did not hit a boundary until his 11th.\n\nCurran hit two sixes to accelerate England towards the finish line and Will Jacks hit the winning runs, but it was Banton who delivered when England needed him most.\n\nThough Scotland's score always looked 20 runs below par, England were troubled at one stage.\n\nThey took three wickets in the powerplay, including Archer having the dangerous George Munsey and number three Brandon McMullen miscuing pulls in a lively opening spell of three overs, but Berrington countered impressively.\n\nBerrington, a good player of slow bowling, was particularly aggressive against England's spinners. He hit Rashid for two fours and a six in his second over and was the aggressor in a partnership of 71 with Tom Bruce.\n\nAt 113-3 in the 13th over, 190 was Scotland's target. Instead, the wicket of Bruce resulted in the innings sliding away.\n\nHe slog-swept Liam Dawson to deep square leg for 24 - one of six batters to wastefully pick out fielders in the deep.\n\nIn the next over Rashid pinned the sweeping Berrington in front as England's leg-spinner, having gone wicketless for 26 runs in his first two overs, took 3-10 in his second spell.\n\nDawson, who took 2-34, added the wicket of Michael Leask, also caught in the deep.\n\nScotland's collapse 5-14 in 3.3 overs ultimately denied them the 30 runs that could have kept them alive in this tournament.",

    "fullText": "Lucas Pinheiro Braathen made history for Brazil by clinching his nation's first Winter Olympic medal with gold in the giant slalom.\n\nBorn in Oslo to a Norwegian father and Brazilian mother, Pinheiro Braathen won World Cup medals for the country of his birth before announcing his shock retirement in 2023 having lost his \"joy of living\".\n\nExactly a year to the day, having regained his love for skiing, he returned to the sport in the green and yellow of Brazil - wanting to honour his heritage on his mother's side.\n\nIn snowy conditions in Bormio, the 25-year-old delivered a masterclass on the Stelvio piste to beat Swiss great Marco Odermatt to gold by 0.58 seconds, with Odermatt's team-mate Loic Meillard taking bronze.\n\nPinheiro Braathen's gold also marks the first medal won by any South American country at the Winter Games.\n\n\"There is nothing about today, in the heat of the moment, where you are, in any form, in a cognitive state,\" he said.\n\n\"I was skiing completely according to my intuition, and my heart today, and that's what enabled me to become an Olympic champion.\n\n\"It had nothing to do with the medal, it had nothing to do with the history that I had the potential of writing.\n\n\"I just wanted to ski as the person I am. I know I can be the best in the world, if I do that to the greatest extent.\"\n\nIn a race featuring 81 starters from 62 nations - including Madagascar, Eritrea and Kenya - Pinheiro Braathen had opened up a 0.95sec lead over Odermatt after the first run, with only seven skiers within two seconds of his pace.\n\nOdermatt, the defending Olympic champion, put pressure on the Brazilian with a scorching second run, but only a crash would have denied Pinheiro Braathen the top step of the podium as he held his nerve in worsening weather.\n\nIt means Odermatt, the current and four-time overall World Cup leader across the alpine skiing disciplines, leaves the Milan-Cortina Games without an Olympic gold, despite being expected to dominate.\n\nPinheiro Braathen's parents split when he was young and despite his 'ski bum' father getting custody, he spent his childhood criss-crossing the Atlantic and cultures.\n\nInitially, he resented skiing. He felt far more comfortable playing football in Sao Paolo, and wanted to turn professional like his hero Ronaldinho.\n\nHe told his father his feet were \"made for beaches and not hard-shell boots\".\n\nBut aged eight, he started to change his mind, enticed by the high speeds involved in ski racing.\n\nHis nomadic lifestyle continued for many years, moving home 21 times before he turned 22.\n\n\"I'm a person of cultural duality,\" he told Associated Press. \"Two perspectives always presented from birth and so for me I always find that I've never been living a life where I'm only presented to one reality, one culture or one way of living.\n\n\"It's always been these polar opposites and so I think that has shaped me to become who I am today and how I want to live my life.\"\n\nThat is as an eccentric, flamboyant character. He loves fashion, has walked the runway in Copenhagen and owns an apartment in Milan, Italy's fashion capital.\n\nHe paints his fingernails and is no stranger to samba dancing in the finish area, wanting to bring more colour to alpine skiing.\n\n\"People seeing themselves in a sport they were told wasn't for them, that stays with me,\" he said before the Games began.\n\n\"And the messages that say, 'I've never watched skiing before, but now I do'. Kids asking where they can try snow.\n\n\"Norway taught me how to be an athlete, how to brave the cold. Brazil taught me how to be myself.\"\n\nPinheiro Braathen won 12 medals on the World Cup circuit for Norway but stunned the skiing world when he retired aged just 23.\n\n\"For the first time in my career, I feel free,\" he said at the time, before booking a one-way ticket to Brazil.\n\nTwelve months later, he was back with a new flag next to his name. He called it the \"biggest project of my life\".\n\nHe won his first World Cup in Brazilian colours in November, but speaking after his greatest triump on Saturday, he said: \"I'm not even able to grasp reality, as I stand here right now. I am just trying to get some sort of emotion here and translate it into words, even though it's absolutely impossible.\n\n\"I hope I can inspire some kids out there that, despite what they wear, despite how they look, despite where they come from, they can follow their own dreams and be who they really are.\n\n\"Because that is the real source of happiness in life.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Head coach Steve Tandy says Wales remains a rugby nation despite the prospect of empty seats at in Cardiff on Sunday for the Six Nations match against France.\n\nThere are thousands of tickets still available for the three home games at Principality Stadium with France, Scotland and Italy as the detrimental effect of Welsh rugby turmoil, on and off the field, takes hold.\n\nWales have lost 22 out of the previous 24 internationals, which includes a record 12 consecutive Six Nations defeats.\n\nThe 48-7 loss against England last weekend was Tandy's fourth defeat in five matches since he took over in 2025.\n\n\"I think it tells me we're a rugby nation with all the disappointment there has been,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Everybody wants us to be back at the top of the table, but ultimately that's going to take a bit of time.\n\n\"It [Welsh rugby] is not in a great place at the minute, but I believe we will get there.\n\n\"It's going to take everyone, not just the players, coaches and supporters, to play their part to try and get us back to where we want to be as a nation.\"\n\nWelsh rugby in turmoil as tens of thousands of Six Nations tickets still not sold\n\nMulti-millionaire businesswoman says WRU in 'civil war' and chair must quit\n\nWales v France - your guide to the Six Nations date\n\nThe attendances will present a financial concern for the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) because more than 50% of its turnover comes from the gate receipts of the men's home internationals in Cardiff.\n\nThe lowest crowd for a Wales' home Six Nations game against France came in 2022 when 63,208 attended a Friday night match.\n\nTwo years later the same fixture was held on a Sunday and attracted a crowd of 71,242.\n\nThe smallest attendance in this tournament at the game's Welsh home was 58,349 against Italy in 2002.\n\nWales have not won a Six Nations home match for four years since defeating Scotland in February 2022, with their only victory since in the tournament coming against Italy in Rome in March 2023.\n\n\"The fans are amazing, when we've had them there in the stadium and the well-wishers outside of it,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Whenever I see people, they want the team to do well, the players want to do well too, and us as coaches, we want the nation to be the best it can be.\n\n\"We're in a different part of our cycle at the minute, and patience [is needed].\n\n\"Every team tends to go through it, and probably for us being a smaller nation, when you're going through that, it might take a little bit longer.\"\n\nWales v France, Principality Stadium\n\nSunday, 15 February at 15:10 GMT\n\nTandy has made four starting personnel changes for the French test and kept faith with captain and hooker Dewi Lake, who received criticism after Wales' misfiring line-out against England.\n\n\"The game is hard and we aren't going to make knee-jerk decisions,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Dewi is our captain and leads from the front. People can come in for some stick without often understanding the full detail of what it is.\n\n\"You then have to examine the areas for which he is getting stick. If it is around the line-out, there are lots of things that can be different, like the call or opposition.\n\n\"There was never a doubt in my mind about Dewi playing this weekend.\"\n\nTandy says any personal abuse suffered by players on social media was wrong.\n\n\"The only time I get aware is when people tell me things,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"I've never been on social media and never searched for something, whether it's good or bad.\n\n\"People will give me the information, I've got young kids as well.\n\n\"I want to be aware for the players, because I know lots of that is ridiculous because these are human beings.\n\n\"It's having an awareness of what's going on, making sure you can help those, but also be aware you're in high-end sport and international rugby.\"\n\nTandy says there is going to be scrutiny.\n\n\"I don't need people to tell me when we didn't perform, I totally understand that, and feel I'm a very honest person,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"I spoke to players about outside influences not influencing us.\n\n\"There is disappointment, and we love our support, and we want to make the country proud of how we play.\n\n\"We've got to give everything we can, and make sure we can be the best we can be, any time we represent the Welsh jersey.\"\n\nWales recall Hawkins and Cracknell for France visit\n\nCentre Brau-Boirie to make France debut in Wales\n\nRecalled Francis relishing chance to help Wales\n\nIn Tandy's five matches in charge so far Wales have conceded 248 points, including 34 tries.\n\nTandy has had to juggle being head coach and leading the defence, the expert role he occupied with Scotland and the British and Irish Lions.\n\nThe boss, who is being assisted in the defence area by former Wales flanker Dan Lydiate, says it is a lot to personally burden.\n\n\"When I first came in it was making sure I had the right people in the room,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"I am passionate about defence and enjoyed doing it with the head coaching role.\n\n\"It is then about making sure you don't spread yourself too thinly. We are constantly assessing and reviewing it and it is a big demand.\"\n\nTandy currently only has Danny Wilson and Matt Sherratt at his disposal as permanent coaches in his backroom staff.\n\nHe says he will hopefully have a defence coach in for the Nations Championship which starts in July.\n\n\"It's something we've been looking into for a while, making sure we get the right people in our coaching team,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"At the start we had Matt (Sherratt) and Danny (Wilson) come in.\n\n\"We went through a process there and it is something we are looking into and we are hopefully going to get in place for the next campaign.\"",

    "fullText": "Western automakers, from the Big Three to EV pure plays, are delivering the same stark warning: Chinese automakers pose a threat to their survival if domestic production isn't protected.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" wrote the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI), a trade group that reps the Big Three, among other automakers, ahead of a House hearing on Chinese vehicles last December.\n\nWhat cost advantages do Chinese automakers have?\n\nHow are Chinese automakers threatening Western car companies?\n\nHow are tariffs protecting US auto manufacturing?\n\nWhat's happening with Chinese EVs in Europe?\n\nThe AAI said Congress needs to maintain the Commerce Department's Biden-era prohibition on importing certain technology and software from China, which effectively bars the import of vehicles from Chinese manufacturers.\n\nIn recent comments, corporate executives have hammered home a version of this messaging\n\nEV maker Rivian (RIVN) has a big year ahead with the launch of its entry-level R2. While short-term issues like cost control and EV demand are more top of mind for the company, the threat of China isn't that far off.\n\nRivian CEO RJ Scaringe noted that in the long term, two important factors need to be recognized.\n\n\"It's not like there's magic happening on the Chinese cost structure. It's really two things you can follow very clearly,\" Scaringe told Yahoo Finance last week. \"One is their capital cost structure is much lower than us. In most cases, it's near zero. It's a highly subsidized industry where plants and manufacturing compacts are paid for by the local equivalent of the federal government.\"\n\nThe second factor is labor, with Chinese automakers' costs a quarter to a fifth of those faced by US companies.\n\nScaringe said at the moment, tariffs in place \"equalize\" the cost of those vehicles, protecting US manufacturing. But only for now.\n\nAnd despite this tariff buffer, Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley argued that China's rising dominance remains a threat.\n\n\"We're a year down the road with the Chinese competitors. They're now even more prominent around the globe. Not a lot here in the US, but you go to Europe, you go to anywhere else, China is a big deal,\" Farley told Yahoo Finance in January.\n\nChinese automakers captured approximately 6.1% of the European auto market last year, a 99% jump from 2024. And this despite tariffs of 35.3% on Chinese EVs entering the EU; however, plug-in hybrids and full hybrids were excluded.\n\nFarley has in the past called Chinese-made cars an \"existential threat\" to US automarkets, not just because of the country's tech advances, but also for its labor infrastructure that supports cheap manufacturing.",

    "description": "“I didn’t realize how much discomfort I had normalized over the years,\" Cameron Light, 30, tells PEOPLE",
    "fullText": "A Florida woman, who once wore a G-Cup bra, underwent a dramatic breast reduction after she had a baby\n\nCameron \"Cam\" Light opens up about her decision — and why she has zero regrets — in an exclusive interview with PEOPLE\n\n“I didn’t realize how much discomfort I had normalized over the years,\" the 30-year-old says\n\nA Florida woman, who once wore a G-Cup bra, underwent a dramatic breast reduction. She documented the entire journey on Instagram, and she's now speaking out about her decision — and why she has zero regrets.\n\nCameron \"Cam\" Light says she first began experiencing issues with her breasts as a teen. “I started to realize my discomfort in high school,” she tells PEOPLE exclusively.\n\n“By college, I was overwhelmed with the weight of them. I vividly remember crying to my then-boyfriend-now-husband at 18 in my freshman dorm bathroom, explaining how uncomfortable I was,\" she continues. \"They were heavy, they hurt, and they didn’t feel like mine. I wanted a reduction so badly, even then.”\n\nLight, 30, says she had her first breast reduction consultation in her early 20s, but several factors kept her from getting the surgery at the time — including the high cost of the procedure, and the fact that she was told she might not be able to breastfeed children after.\n\n“I didn’t want to wait, but there was a lot working against me,” she recalls. “The cost was prohibitive for much of the time. I was still unsure if I’d want children. Plus, the younger you are when you have a reduction, the higher the likelihood that you’d need another one.”\n\nLight says that she and her husband did ultimately decide they wanted kids, and she eventually gave birth to a son. At that point, though, the discomfort caused by her breasts only got worse.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn one candid Instagram post, Light revealed that her bra size measured 42 G.\n\n“They had only gotten heavier and lower since pregnancy and breastfeeding, weighing far over 10 pounds and hanging near my belly button,” she tells PEOPLE.\n\nLight, who was studying to become a midwife at the time, tells PEOPLE she still had a long way to go before she would ultimately get the surgery, however.\n\n“I kept dreaming of the day I was finished with school so I could get the surgery. I was also weighing a potential second pregnancy before that, but ultimately we decided we were done having children,” she recalls.\n\nFinally, years after her initial consultation, Light started researching surgeons and eventually found the right fit.\n\n“She was smart, kind and supportive of my goals,” Light says, describing her surgeon, Dr. Emily Jiles. “She knew how small I wished to go and gave me her best suggestions on how to get there. There was never any pressure to make one decision over another, and as a provider, that gave me such confidence in moving forward.”\n\nLight — who is also the owner of Amaze Games, a small business escape room and board game lounge — had the surgery in January, “after 12 very long years.”\n\nShe says she decided to pay for the procedure out of pocket instead of attempting to go through her insurance, as she wanted the utmost control over the outcome. (\"I wanted to go as small as possible,\" she explained on Instagram.)\n\n“Insurance companies have a say in the procedures they allow and the amounts they take off. I didn’t want some random person telling me what I could and couldn’t do with a permanent decision for my body, so I saved the money and did it on my own,” she further explains to PEOPLE.\n\nLight says she has zero regrets about her decision to undergo the surgery. “I feel more like myself than I have in many, many years. The relief was immediate,” she explains, adding that she immediately lost 5 lbs. off her chest.\n\n“I snore less, my heartburn has completely gone away, and I don’t find myself gasping for air while standing because the weight is finally off of my lungs and diaphragm. I still have a long way to go to correct the damage that weight did to my body, but I’m looking forward to that journey,” Light adds.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\n“I didn’t realize how much discomfort I had normalized over the years,” she continues. “They were an ever-present annoyance that I had gotten used to … the constant adjusting, planning outfits around what could support the weight, crossing my arms in public so I wouldn’t be stared at, wearing multiple bras just to feel some semblance of support while working and exercising … the list goes on. It had all become so normal to me.\"\n\nAs for the advice Light would give to others considering breast reduction surgery? She recommends meeting with multiple providers until someone finds the perfect fit.\n\n“I wanted a doctor who listened to me and didn’t try to change my mind or make me go bigger than I wanted to stay ‘proportional.’ Reductions are life-changing surgeries — it shouldn’t be something you do on a whim with people you don’t trust,” she says.\n\nLight adds that it’s okay to “grieve” an old body, even if someone is 100% confident they want the surgery.\n\n“I have always loved my body, even when it didn’t fit what I needed anymore. I celebrated it with my friends a couple of nights before surgery, throwing a boob-voyage party and burning bras in my backyard,” she recalls.\n\nLight also says she worked with a therapist before undergoing the surgery to ensure the transition went as smoothly as possible.\n\n“I have only felt pure joy since waking up after surgery, and I credit much of that to the emotional work I did before surgery,” she tells PEOPLE.",

    "fullText": "Crysencio Summerville was West Ham's saviour again.\n\nThe 25-year-old climbed off the bench to score the goal that beat Burton after the Hammers were given an FA Cup scare.\n\nHis 95th-minute winner was a sixth goal in seven games as the visitors needed extra time to beat their League One hosts.\n\nIt was the same in the third round with West Ham edging past QPR in extra time after Summerville had given them the lead.\n\nSince then, goals to help beat Tottenham, Sunderland and Burnley have breathed fresh life into the Hammers' Premier League survival bid.\n\n\"We know it was going to be difficult to come here. We dug in deep and they put pressure on us,\" the forward told TNT. \"For myself, when I come in I try to help the team and today was the day, so I'm happy.\n\n\"These games are open and with my one v one I just tried to go inside, and that's what I do best. I am in a good space lately. After my injury, I am just happy to be back on the pitch and I try to show this week in, week out.\"\n\nIn his final season at Leeds, Summerville scored 21 times, with Daniel Farke's side losing to Southampton in the Championship play-off final.\n\nIt convinced West Ham to spend £25m in August 2024 but his debut season was wrecked by injury.\n\nSummerville scored just once in 22 appearances before he was sidelined for seven months after surgery on a serious hamstring problem.\n\nIt was a natural slow process for him to find consistency and form - failing to score in his first 16 appearances this season.\n\nBut the Netherlands Under-21s international is now West Ham's consistent match-winner as he eyes a World Cup place with his country this summer.\n\nTeam-mate Konstantinos Mavropanos told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We knew when we got him the player he is and now he is in top form, and he just has to keep going.\n\n\"All the lads in the last couple of weeks saw that we are improving and we want to do more than the first half of the season.\n\n\"We all just try to help each other and we do the same with Cry. We see what his qualities are and we try to get everything from this.\"\n\nSummerville's previous six goals came across a run of 56 club appearances across all competitions, five for Leeds and one for West Ham.\n\nHis form could not come at a better time with the Hammers third bottom of the Premier League and three points behind 17th-placed Nottingham Forest.\n\nThey host Bournemouth on Saturday before going to Liverpool on 28 February with Summerville having rediscovered the form which convinced West Ham to spend big on him.\n\n\"He's in a good moment, he is full of confidence, everything he does seems to go well so we need to take advantage of it,\" said boss Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\n\"It's confidence, all players know how it is. It's all about confidence. He is in a good moment and he is working for the team. You cannot play in the Premier League if you don't have self-confidence.\"\n\nNuno refused to concede he should have brought Summerville on earlier than the 83rd minute but felt making 10 changes was the right decision for his team.\n\n\"Sometimes you get it right and sometimes you don't but it's what the team needs, more important than anything is the respect for the players who started the game,\" he added.\n\n\"We knew Burton would come on strong, every throw-in and ever set-piece is a situation that requires maximum attention, and the players did well in that aspect.\n\n\"There were some tired legs in extra time and Summerville helped us out. When he is one v one and in space, he is almost unstoppable.\"",

    "fullText": "Tries: Osborne, Conan, Baloucoune Con: Crowley Pen: Crowley\n\nTry: Nicotera Con: Garbisi Pens: Garbisi 2\n\nIreland survived a major scare from Italy to claim their first win in this year's Six Nations and deny the Azzurri a first championship victory in Dublin.\n\nHurting from last week's thumping defeat by France in Paris, Ireland took the lead through Jamie Osborne's unconverted try after Italy wing Louis Lynagh's yellow card for a deliberate knock-on.\n\nBut momentum shifted in Italy's favour, and after Paolo Garbisi's penalty and Ireland scrum-half Craig Casey's yellow card, hooker Giacomo Nicotera crashed over to give the Italians a deserved half-time lead.\n\nIreland, who slipped to fifth in the world rankings for the first time in nearly four years after losing to France, responded three minutes after the restart through Jack Conan.\n\nHowever, Sam Prendergast's missed conversion attempt left the score tied at 10-10 and the home side breathed a huge sigh of relief when Lynagh's apparent try was ruled out for a forward pass.\n\nWith the game delicately poised, Ireland wing Rob Baloucoune marked his Six Nations debut with a decisive try before Jack Crowley's penalty moved the home side 10 points clear.\n\nBut after Italy pulled themselves back to within a score, Ireland withstood frantic late pressure from the visitors and dashed their hopes of a snatching a late draw.\n\nSix Nations: Ireland come from behind to beat Italy - reaction\n\nHaving had nine days to stew on a miserable defeat by France, after which Farrell criticised his side's \"lack of intent\", Ireland were under pressure to deliver a statement performance and create some positive discussion around the team.\n\nBut Italy, who have suffered several wallopings in Dublin down the years, were in no mood to let that scenario play out as they chased a first Six Nations win on Irish soil at the 14th attempt.\n\nDespite losing Lynagh for 10 minutes after a deliberate knock-on, a fired-up Italian defence coughed up just five points to a sputtering Irish attack before Garbisi's penalty brought the visitors to within two points after 20 minutes.\n\nAs the first half wore on, Italy ramped up the pressure on Ireland, and after Craig Casey was sin-binned for a high tackle on Michele Lamaro, the Azzurri kicked to the corner and mauled their way to the Irish line for Nicotera to crash over.\n\nIt could have been worse for Ireland, too, had Lamaro not knocked the ball on after full-back Lorenzo Pani pounced on a poor Sam Prendergast kick, chipped over the Irish defence and beat the Irish fly-half.\n\nIreland scored early in the second half through Conan, but Prendergast failed to edge the hosts ahead when he missed another conversion attempt.\n\nThe Italians, undeterred by anything Ireland threw at them, continued to stretch the home defence with rapid, heads-up rugby.\n\nAnd Ireland were let off the hook when Lynagh's try was ruled out because of Tommaso Menoncello's forward pass to the Benetton wing.\n\nWith replacement half-backs Crowley and Jamison Gibson-Park having injected much-needed tempo into the Irish attack, Ireland's best moment came when McCloskey's neat offload gave Baloucoune the chance to step and scythe his way over.\n\nBut Italy refused to lie down and piled more pressure on the Irish defence in the closing 10 minutes as unease grew among the fans.\n\nHowever, Ireland escaped when James Lowe intercepted a pass and rushed up the field, but home hopes of a bonus-point win were ended when Crowley kicked the ball dead after they had won a penalty.\n\nIt was, however, a much-needed return to winning ways for Ireland before next week's away match against England.\n\nIt will be a deeply dispiriting result for Italy, for whom a single try was a poor return for the level of pressure they put on Ireland.\n\nFor a while, Gonzalo Quesada's side looked on course to give their fans an afternoon to savour in Dublin. But having fallen short, they must now regroup and carry the same level of belief and physicality into next week's match against France in Paris.\n\nIreland: Osborne; Baloucoune, Ringrose, McCloskey, Lowe; S Prendergast, Casey; Loughman, Sheehan, Clarkson, McCarthy, Ryan, Izuchukwu, Doris (capt), Conan.\n\nReplacements: Kelleher, O'Toole, Furlong, Edogbo, Beirne, Timoney, Gibson-Park, Crowley.\n\nItaly: Pani; Lynagh, Menoncello, Marin; Ioane; P Garbisi, Fusco; Fischetti, Nicotera, Ferrari, N Cannone, Zambonin, Lamaro (capt), Zuliani, L Cannone.\n\nReplacements: Di Bartolomeo, Spagnolo, Hasa, Ruzza, Favretto, Odiase, A Garbisi, Odogwu.\n\nAssistant referees: Matthew Carley (Eng) and Luc Ramos (Fra)\n\nTelevision match official: Ian Tempest (Eng)\n\nFoul play review officer: Tual Trainini (Fra)",

    "fullText": "Ever since Eileen Gu decided to compete under the flag of China, and not the United States where she was born, her citizenship has been the subject of scrutiny and controversy.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, she said her decision to switch allegiance back in 2019 had everything to do with “inspiring” children from the country of her mother at the Olympics in her home country. That would be the 2022 Beijing Games, where Gu won two golds and a silver for China in freestyle skiing.\n\nShe’s since become a millionaire many times over, mainly due to her online presence and endorsements, not her skiing. She was the fourth-highest earning female athlete in 2025, earning upwards of $23 million. According to Sportico, all but $20,000 of that $23 million came from endorsements.\n\nNow, she’s back in the Olympics, still competing for China and, reportedly, being paid handsomely to do so.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Gu and Zhu Yi, a fellow American-born figure skater who now competes for China, were paid a combined $6.6 million by the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau in 2025 for “striving for excellent results in qualifying for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics.” In all, the two were reportedly paid nearly $14 million over the past three years.\n\nThe payments were revealed when the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau budget was posted online with the names of Gu and Zhu. Their names have since been scrubbed from the public report.\n\nGu already has a silver in slopestyle in Italy, while Zhu — born Beverly Zhu in Los Angeles — is not competing in the 2026 Games.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the weight of two countries on my shoulders,” Gu said after winning silver in slopestyle. “Just being able to ski through all of that, you know. To still show my best and still be so deeply in love with the sport.\n\n\"That's really what I care about and I'm so happy to represent that today.\"\n\nThe subject of Gu’s citizenship remains shrouded in mystery. China does not allow dual citizenship, meaning Gu ostensibly had to give up her U.S. passport.\n\nGu will compete in two more events — women’s halfpipe and big air.",

    "description": "There was a lot of police activity at a home about two miles from where Nancy Guthrie lived.",
    "fullText": "Update: The Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told NewsNation's Brian Entin the overnight commotion was them \"just tracking down leads. No arrests. And no signs of Nancy.\"\n\nAuthorities may be a big step closer to finding out what happened to Nancy Guthrie.\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 13, the Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed that there was DNA found in Nancy's home that did not match her or anyone in her close circle. A short while later, the Pima County Sheriff's Department along with SWAT went to a staging area with rumors of a manhunt circulating online. Then, police showed up at a home about two miles away from where Nancy lived.\n\nAccording to Entin, the movement was directly related to Nancy's disappearance.\n\n\"It has been an insane four or five hours in Tucson,\" Entin said during an episode of his YouTube show. Authorities \"detained a man and a woman from the house and they also detained a man from a traffic stop at a Culver's restaurant very close to that house. And I'm told that it's all connected. I'm told it could be a mother and son that were detained at the house and maybe a brother at the traffic stop,\" Entin continued.\n\nThe vehicle that was being looked at in the Culver's parking lot was a Range Rover. It was later towed.\n\nEntin had a front row seat to the raid as he was able to get into the police perimeter before it was set. He said that authorities did not need to \"use force\" to enter the home and that the man and the woman \"surrendered.\" Entin went on to say that authorities were at the home for hours collecting evidence and called it a \"pretty big development.\"\n\nThere have also been rumors that a fourth person involved died by apparent suicide in pursuit. This has not been confirmed.\n\nNEW VIDEO: FBI speaking with man in Culver’s parking lot at 1st and River. pic.twitter.com/VIB6vz7pt3\n\n— KGUN 9 (@kgun9) February 14, 2026\n\nMeanwhile, the Pima County Sheriff's Department shared its own updates on social media.\n\n\"There is no press briefing scheduled for tonight regarding the Nancy Guthrie investigation. A written statement is forthcoming,\" one message read. About an hour later, the department posted an update. \"Reporting that current law enforcement activity is surrounding a home belonging to a former county attorney is NOT accurate,\" it read.\n\n🚨 BREAKING: SWAT operation tied to the Nancy Guthrie case leaves three detained, with one man losing his life from a self-inflicted gunshot.\n\nAuthorities sealed off the area near East Placita De Graciela, miles from her home as investigators secure scene.pic.twitter.com/6iIJQXD48n\n\n— Derrick Evans (@DerrickEvans4WV) February 14, 2026\n\nAfter another hour had passed, a third update was posted.\n\n\"Law enforcement activity is underway at a residence near E Orange Grove Rd & N First Ave related to the Guthrie case. Because this is a joint investigation, at the request of the FBI - no additional information is currently available,\" read the post.\n\nThere haven't been any official updates since.\n\nPIMA COUNTY, ARIZONA - Over 30 minutes ago, the Range Rover that was investigated outside a Culver’s restaurant was towed away.pic.twitter.com/aZsOiJXw0J\n\n— AZ Intel (@AZ_Intel_) February 14, 2026\n\nNancy has been missing since Sunday, Feb. 1. Authorities have been working diligently to find her and to find the people responsible for her disappearance.\n\nIt is unclear if the people who were detained on Friday night were suspected of being directly involved with Nancy's disappearance or if they could have been behind any of the emails sent to TMZ demanding money for information about Nancy or her would-be kidnappers. There's also a chance that the people detained don't have anything to do with the case.\n\nAt the time of this writing, no arrests have been reported.\n\nREAD NEXT: Who Is Tommaso Cioni?

    "description": "Shaker girls' basketball concluded its regular season with a 65-21 road win Friday over Averill Park.",
    "fullText": "AVERILL PARK – On the surface, Shaker's Malia Jackson diving to the floor for a loose ball in the fourth quarter was a hustle play from one of the Blue Bison team leaders.\n\nGiven that Jackson's willingness to hit the floor came in a game where the lead was hovering near 40 points at the time exemplified Shaker's commitment to playing a full 32 minutes as the Blue Bison concluded their girls' basketball regular season with a 65-21 road win Friday over Averill Park.\n\nAfter a pair of less-than-complete wins in the last week that left Blue Bison head coach Jaimee Shipley stressing attention to details to her team, Shaker (18-2 overall, 12-0 Suburban Council) took charge early and never looked back.\n\n\"We did not come out and have our best effort the last two games, so we've been pounding that message into them,\" Shipley said. \"We needed to do a better job of getting them on the same page, fired up again and not taking any plays off. That was our biggest thing for coming into tonight. We wanted to play hard and we worked on a few specific things for tonight.\"\n\nPlaying without the injured Jayla Geter, Shaker took control early, taking a 27-9 lead after the first quarter and extending the lead to 43-12 at halftime against Averill Park (8-11, 5-7).\n\nThe meticulous offensive approach, one that featured crisp and precise passing that consistently found the open player near the basket, was complemented by a hounding defense that overplayed passes and created turnovers.\n\n\"As we say in the locker room, it has to be ‘we, not me,'\" Shipley said. \"As soon as we can get that and stop worrying about our individual stats, we are a very good team and it is difficult to play against us when we are clicking and everyone is making that extra pass.\"\n\nShaker came out in the first quarter looking to take advantage of its size advantage near the basket and did just that.\n\nBlue Bison bigs Peyton Hoblock and Jackson each had eight points in the opening quarter, with Giada Lanni adding six.\n\n\"We always want to try to do that, that is our advantage in almost every game we play,\" Shipley said.\n\nJackson finished with 16 points in the win to go with outstanding defense near the basket.\n\n\"She (Shipley) was talking to us at halftime and even though we were winning by a lot, we had to dive for balls and get rebounds,\" Jackson said. \"It is just discipline, we need to get ready for sectionals. It is a business trip, every game. No matter who the opponent is, we are ready.\"\n\nPaired with Jackson in the post, Hoblock was a force throughout the game as the senior led the way with 20 points and like Jackson, was a disruptive influence on the defensive side of the court.\n\n\"We've had a slow couple of games and it was important for us to come out, we had (an) emphasis on energy and playing as a team,\" Hoblock said. \"We came out in that first quarter and dominated as a team. We are not a selfish team, we are focusing on that extra pass. If you have an open shot the first five seconds of the shot clock, it will be there again. You can't play one-on-five, we've been emphasizing team, team, team. ‘We before me,' that is our biggest thing.\"\n\n22: Combined first quarter points by Hoblock, Jackson and Giada Lanni, one more than the Shaker defense allowed in the whole game.\n\n11: Shaker players who had playing time in the second half.\n\n7: Points scored by Golden Knights sophomore Sheyanne Law, a team-high.\n\nShaker: With its regular season complete, Shaker heads into the Section 2 tournament in Class AAA unbeaten against Section 2 competition this season.\n\nAverill Park: The Golden Knights host Shenendehowa on Tuesday before moving on to preparation for the Class A playoffs.\n\nThis article originally published at Shaker girls' basketball wraps up regular season with convincing win over Averill Park.",

If we’re solely discussing individual high-danger scoring chances, which I think is the case, JFresh is correct.

    "fullText": "Guglielmo Vicario could depart Tottenham at the end of this season, with a return to Serie A appearing increasingly likely. The Italian goalkeeper has impressed since arriving at the club, earning praise for producing a series of outstanding saves across numerous fixtures.\n\nDespite Tottenham’s inconsistent form, Vicario has remained one of their most reliable performers. His displays have attracted attention from several leading clubs, and the North London side may find it difficult to retain him if their struggles persist. While the Lilywhites would prefer to keep a player who has stood out amid challenging circumstances, the conclusion of the campaign may prompt a decisive development regarding his future.\n\nJuventus are understood to be keen on strengthening their squad with his addition. His experience in the Premier League is believed to have convinced them that he possesses the qualities required to thrive in their system. A return to Italy could hold particular appeal, especially given the prestige associated with representing Juventus.\n\nHowever, the Bianconeri are not alone in their pursuit. According to Tuttojuve, Inter Milan is also interested in securing Vicario’s signature. The Nerazzurri reportedly regard him as a strong candidate to reinforce their goalkeeping department and are prepared to rival Juventus in any potential move.\n\n(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)\n\nInter are said to be considering him as a possible replacement for their current first-choice goalkeeper, with the end of the season viewed as an appropriate moment to initiate change. Such competition would inevitably complicate negotiations and increase the pressure on Tottenham to clarify their position.\n\nVicario’s consistent performances have enhanced his reputation, and interest from major Serie A clubs underlines his growing stature. As the season approaches its conclusion, his next decision could shape not only his own career trajectory but also the strategic planning of the clubs seeking his services.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have been widely tipped to secure the Premier League title by the end of this season, and their performances in Europe have also positioned them among the favourites to win the Champions League. Since returning to the competition, the Gunners have made a significant impact, reaching the semi-final last term before losing to eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nTheir European pedigree has strengthened this campaign further. Arsenal defeated Real Madrid on their way to the semi-finals previously, underlining their ability to overcome elite opposition. This term, they have maintained outstanding form by winning all their league phase matches, reinforcing the belief among supporters that they can go all the way.\n\nDespite their consistency, Arsenal are fully aware of the challenges that lie ahead in the latter stages of the tournament. The Champions League remains fiercely competitive, with several heavyweight clubs still in contention. While their domestic and continental form has raised hopes of an unprecedented quadruple, the calibre of opposition makes such an achievement extremely demanding.\n\nSupporters remain optimistic, encouraged by the team’s resilience and tactical maturity under Mikel Arteta. However, experience suggests that decisive moments against Europe’s most established sides will determine whether Arsenal can convert promise into silverware.\n\n(Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nDidi Hamann has identified Bayern Munich as the side most capable of halting Arsenal’s progress. Speaking as reported by the Metro, he said, ‘Usually in the past, Bayern have always got the better of Arsenal.\n\n‘So, I think that was one of the reasons why Arsenal was desperate to show them, you know, this year is our year.\n\n‘Bayern have dropped a few points in the last two weeks. Against Hoffenheim, there was an early sending off, and Hoffenheim hit the crossbar and had three clear cut chances. They should have been ahead at half time.\n\n‘So Bayern Munich are not firing as they did in the autumn. But if they do get back to their form, I would favour Bayern Munich over two games.\n\n‘But it would be a fantastic game because obviously the first game was breathtaking.’\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!

    "description": "Michigan and Penn State battle for Big Ten supremacy. A win propels one to the top, while the other fights for contention.",
    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. — There will be no love lost at Yost Ice Arena this Saturday at 5:00 p.m. as the No. 2 Michigan Wolverines host the No. 6 Penn State Nittany Lions in a high-stakes rematch that could reshape the Big Ten Hockey standings. Following a Friday night thriller that saw Michigan escape with an extra point via a 5–4 shootout victory, Saturday's finale represents a \"can’t-lose\" scenario for two programs with eyes on the regular-season crown.\n\nThe implications for the conference race are massive. Entering this weekend, Michigan sat just one point behind arch-rival Michigan State for the top spot in the Big Ten. With the Spartans idle this weekend, the Wolverines have a golden opportunity to leapfrog into first place and regain the No. 1 national ranking they surrendered just days ago.\n\n40 (Projected after Fri. SO win)\n\n33 (Projected after Fri. SO loss)\n\nTable reflects updated points following Michigan's shootout win on Friday, Feb 13.\n\nFor Penn State, the math is equally urgent. Despite sitting in third place, the Nittany Lions have games in hand. A regulation win on Saturday would keep them within striking distance of the leaders, while a loss could effectively end their hopes of a regular-season title, leaving them to fight for home-ice advantage in the Big Ten Tournament.\n\nSaturday’s matchup is a direct response to Friday’s chaotic opener. In that game, Penn State showed incredible resilience, clawing back with only nine healthy forwards to force overtime. Freshman Reese Laubach ignited the Nittany Lions early, but Michigan’s star power ultimately proved too much.\n\nThe Wolverines will lean heavily on T.J. Hughes, who ranks second in the nation in points per game (1.43), and the explosive Will Horcoff, who leads the team with 20 goals this season. Defensively, Michigan looks to freshman goaltender Jack Ivankovic, who slammed the door in Friday’s shootout to secure the win.\n\nThe Yost Factor: Michigan holds a 16–7–0 all-time mark at home against Penn State, though the Nittany Lions have won four of their last six trips to Ann Arbor.\n\nSpecial Teams: With players like Michael Hage and Aiden Fink (PSU) seeing heavy minutes, the power play could be the deciding factor in a series that has historically been high-scoring.\n\nStandings Pressure: If Michigan completes the \"broom\" job with a win on Saturday, they will officially take over first place in the Big Ten with only a few series remaining.\n\nBased on the momentum from Friday’s shootout thriller, Saturday’s rematch at Yost Ice Arena is shaping up to be a classic \"track meet\" on ice. I predict Michigan will edge out Penn State with a 5-3 victory, officially claiming the top spot in the Big Ten standings.\n\nThe Wolverines’ depth is simply too much to ignore. With T.J. Hughes and Will Horcoff playing at an elite level, Michigan has the firepower to exploit a Penn State defensive unit that looked fatigued during the closing minutes of Friday's overtime. Expect Michigan to jump out to an early two-goal lead, fueled by the raucous \"Children of Yost\" student section.\n\nHowever, the Nittany Lions won’t go quietly. Guy Gadowsky’s squad is the most resilient in the conference, and Aiden Fink is due for a multi-point night. Penn State will likely dominate the shot count—as they often do—but freshman goaltender Jack Ivankovic has shown he can handle the volume. Michigan’s superior special teams will be the difference-maker; a late power-play goal should seal the win and three crucial points, leaving the Wolverines in the driver's seat for the Big Ten regular-season title.\n\nFans can catch the 5:00 p.m. puck drop live on the Big Ten Network or listen via the Michigan Sports Network.",

    "description": "South Carolina women's basketball is playing LSU on Feb. 14 which features two high-profile, successful coaches in Dawn Staley and Kim Mulkey.",
    "fullText": "Two of the best coaches in women's college basketball are preparing for their annual showdown.\n\nSouth Carolina women's basketball and coach Dawn Staley play LSU and coach Kim Mulkey on Feb. 14 (8:30 p.m. ET, ABC) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nStaley is 6-2 all time against Mulkey and 5-0 since Mulkey took over the Tigers ahead of the 2021-22 season. She spent her first 21 seasons at Baylor, where she beat Staley's South Carolina team twice.\n\nIf Staley wins one more national championship, she'll be tied with Mulkey with four total.\n\nStaley is 6-2 vs Mulkey in her coaching career.\n\nBefore arriving in Baton Rouge, Mulkey coached for 21 seasons at Baylor. She beat South Carolina twice at Baylor but she has yet to beat Staley with the Tigers.\n\nOn Dec. 2, 2018, Mulkey's Baylor team beat the Gamecocks 94-69. The same season, Mulkey won again in the NCAA Tournament 93-68. Staley didn't beat Baylor and Mulkey until Nov. 30, 2019, when South Carolina won 74-59.\n\nThe last five wins have gone to Staley.\n\nOn Feb. 13, Staley was addressing media to preview the LSU game and was asked about what she consistently sees in Mulkey's teams.\n\n\"They get up to play,\" Staley said. \"They're very disciplined to how they want to play. That's pretty good when you know that your team is going to do certain things out there on the floor, it gives yourself a chance to win ... they can count on transition, can count on rebounding the basketball, on ball screen execution. Those are the three things that really jump off the page when it comes to a team like LSU.\"\n\nIn just her second season with LSU, Mulkey won the national championship which marked her fourth overall after winning three with Baylor (2005, 2012, 2019.)\n\nStaley has three overall, all from her time at South Carolina with the first in 2017. She won in 2022 and 2024, with Mulkey's title right in-between her two most recent championships.\n\nSince 2000, only eight coaches have won a national title, with Staley and Mulkey winning 28% of the last 25 championships.\n\nGeno Auriemma has the most NCAA tournament championships of any head coach men's or women's with 12. He has more than John Wooden, who won 10 titles in 12 years at UCLA.\n\nOn the women's side, Tennessee's Pat Summitt won eight, then Mulkey sits at third with her four.\n\nTied with Staley is Tara VanDerveer, who won three with Stanford before she retired in April 2024.\n\nOn Jan. 17, 2025, Staley's became the highest-paid college women’s basketball coach in the history of the sport.\n\nStaley's new contract took affect immediately and will run through 2029-30. She's receiving annual salary of $4 million with a $250,000 increase every season and a $500,000 signing bonus that makes the total value approximately $25.25 million.\n\nAccording to the USA TODAY Sports database, Mulkey was the highest-paid coach before Staley's new deal at $3,264,000. Staley was third with her previous salary of $3,100,000. Auriemma was making $3,100,000 as of March 2024.\n\nSince Mulkey arrived at LSU, the Tigers have produced six of WNBA draft picks, including Angel Reese (2024) and Aneesah Morrow (2025), who both went in the first round.\n\nAt Baylor, Mulkey had nine first-round draft picks and 19 WNBA draft picks overall. Brittney Griner was the only No. 1 overall pick for Baylor in 2013. Odyssey Sims went No. 2 overall the following year.\n\nStaley has produced 18 WNBA draft selections since taking over the South Carolina program in 2008.\n\nA'ja Wilson was the first No. 1 overall pick in 2018, Aliyah Boston the second in 2022, South Carolina has produced 11 first-round picks total.\n\nLulu Kesin covers South Carolina athletics for The Greenville News and the USA TODAY Network.

    "fullText": "The UNC basketball team watched their long winning streak end on Tuesday night, with Miami winning 75-66 in a game it led throughout.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Tar Heel Nation collectively had its worst fear confirmed, as superstar freshman Caleb Wilson is out indefinitely with a broken hand.\n\nNorth Carolina still has another game to play this weekend, with the Pitt Panthers coming to Chapel Hill on Saturday, February 14 for a 2 p.m. tip-off.\n\nUNC (19-5, 7-4 ACC) is still in great position for a third-straight NCAA Tournament appearance, with plenty other starts across the roster capable of stepping up. Henri Veesaar will become the go-to guy down low, Seth Trimble's senior leadership will be further counted on, while guys like Jarin Stevenson and Zayden High will see an increase in playing time.\n\nThe Tar Heels also have big men James Brown and Ivan Matlekovic on their bench, two guys who play sparingly. Good teams have their bench guys step up in the face of adversity – and North Carolina is still an ACC competitor.\n\nPitt (9-16, 2-10 ACC) continues to be an absolute embarrassment under former Duke assistant Jeff Capel, who is a lock to get fired after the 2025-26 season ends. The Panthers have just two wins in 2026, lack depth and their highest-scoring player is Brandin Cummings (12.5 points per game).\n\nIf you're in Chapel Hill and looking for some Valentine's Day plans, consider going to the Dean Dome. If you're planning to watch Saturday afternoon's battle on TV, your favorite streaming device, listening on the radio or somewhere else, keep reading below for more broadcast information.\n\nRadio: SiriusXM (Channels 84 and 391)\n\nThe Tar Heels are fresh off a Tuesday night loss, but they remain a perfect 14-0 in Chapel Hill. Enter Pitt, which has just one road win.\n\nThis is exactly the type of trap game North Carolina needs to avoid. UNC will not have Wilson, but needs to realize there are plenty other contributors across the roster.\n\nThe Tar Heels should win this one easily.\n\nScore prediction: UNC 84, Pitt 67\n\nOct. 4: Blue-White Scrimmage (White 55, Blue 50)\n\nOct. 24: at BYU (preseason, L 78-76)\n\nOct. 29: vs. Winston-Salem State (preseason, W 95-53)\n\nNov. 3: vs. Central Arkansas (W, 94-54)\n\nNov. 11: vs. Radford (W, 89-74)\n\nNov. 14: vs. NC Central (W, 97-53)\n\nNov. 25: vs. St. Bonaventure in Fort Myers (Florida) Tip-Off (W, 85-70)\n\nNov. 27: vs. Michigan State in Fort Myers (Fla.)

Starring in the effort were Northern Colorado transfers Stevo Poulin and Vinny Zerban, who both earned wins over top-10 opponents.\n\nPoulin set the tone early at 125 pounds, winning in a 14-4 major decision over No. 8 Jett Strickenberger. A takedown into four near-fall points in the first period blew the match open. Previously, Poulin was 0-4 vs. Strickenberger.\n\nAdrian Meza started at 133 for Iowa State, losing a 5-0 decision to Gunner Andrick. The Cyclones finished the first half of the dual with three wins, including a 12-3 major decision for Anthony Echemendia over Jordan Titus at 141, a 6-5 decision for Jacob Frost over Willie McDougald at 149 and a 5-2 decision for Vinny Zerban over No. 6 Ty Watters. Zerban recorded the lone takedown late in the third period to seal the deal.\n\nIowa State got wins at 165 and 174 from Connor Euton and MJ Gaitan. Euton got a 20-4 technical fall over Sasha Gavronsky, followed by a 5-4 decision for Gaitan over Brody Conley.

The Cyclones capped off the night with a 22-6 technical fall for CJ Carter over Cole Tolley at 197 and a 21-6 technical fall for Yonger Batsida vs. Brock Kehler at heavyweight.\n\nIowa State lost 24-9 in its previous dual vs. Oklahoma State on Feb. 1.

    "description": "Texas A&M starting pitcher Shane Sdao discussed his first start in nearly two years, as the junior is knocking off the rust, and getting back to form.",
    "fullText": "No. 25 Texas A&M opened up the 2026 college baseball season in elite form, defeating Tennessee Tech 15-6 behind star outfielder Caden Sorrell's two home runs, while freshmen starters Nico Partida and Boston Keller combined for four hits while looking the part on defense. While the offense stood out most, the return of junior pitcher Shane Sdao was quite the storyline at the start of the new year.\n\nMaking his first start since the Aggies' run to the College World Series Final, Sdao missed the rest of the 2024 season and would go on to miss the entire 2025 campaign, forced to undergo Tommy John surgery and rehab before making the biggest decision of his life.\n\nOpting to return to College Station for a likely final season instead of staying in the 2025 MLB Draft, Sdao made the smart decision that will pay off once his professional career begins, but right now, his focus is on helping lead the Aggies back to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nAfter being named the Friday starter, Sdao was still knocking off some rust, but looked the part after retiring the first six batters he faced and finished with five strikeouts over 5 1/3 innings, allowing seven hits, no walks, and throwing 83 pitches. After Texas A&M's Game 1 victory, the junior spoke with the media, stating that he had \"goosebumps\" amid his first start.\n\n\"I had goosebumps all the way up until first pitch,\" Sdao stated. \"I mean, I even threw down to second base faster than normal with a lot more time on the clock than I normally do just so I can look around and take it all in. It's pretty special, and there was a great crowd tonight, and I'm very happy I got to be out there and experience it.\"\n\nKBTX reported Travis Brown asked Sdao if there was a moment during the game where he felt like he was back to his normal rhythm:\n\n\"Definetly after I got taken off. As soon as I put that ball in coach Earely's hand, I looked up, and was like \"wow, this is it.\"\n\nDealing with the normal soreness post-start, Sdao will rest up and watch his starting counterparts Weston Moss and Aiden Sims take the mound on Saturday and Sunday, as the Aggies look to start the 2026 regular season 3-0 before taking on A&M Corpus-Christi, followed by a three-game home series vs. Penn next weekend.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M pitcher Shane Sdao discusses first start after Friday's win",

Leaving out worthy teams for others that aren’t nearly as well regarded just doesn’t make sense, and it looks like the Big Ten has been looking into a 24-team tournament.\n\nESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that they have had internal discussions of doubling the field. He shared what the bracket would look like, and it doesn’t look all that bad. While I have been adamant that 12-team was too many, if the scheduling gets fixed, which it would almost have to with this many teams, it wouldn’t be terrible.\n\nThere could be exceptions for longer layoffs to get the games to be played on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, as the idea also would get rid of conference championship games. Another idea they floated around was avoiding rematches in the first round, which isn’t the worst idea.\n\nAs for Notre Dame’s view on this, they want some sort of expansion, but most likely not this large. Athletic director Pete Bevacqua would rather see 16-teams, but the Irish most likely don’t have enough cards to make sure that happens. It looks like the Big Ten and SEC hold the most power in these discussions, so it’s most likely a wait-and-see situation for Notre Dame.\n\nNEW: An internal Big Ten document explores a 24-team College Football Playoff. It offers a peek at what that model could look like, as another off-season of CFP discussion is set to unfold.

    "fullText": "The New York Giants are signing wide receiver Courtney Jackson to a reserve/futures contract.\n\nThe move comes shortly after the conclusion of the 2025 season, in which Jackson was a member of the practice squad for the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. The 5-foot-11, 179-pound receiver provides depth at the position and potential special teams value, particularly as a return specialist.\n\nJackson, 24, began his college career at Syracuse University (2019–2022), where he appeared in 36 games and recorded 63 receptions for 662 yards, while also handling punt returns, including a touchdown. He transferred to Arkansas State University (2023–2024), playing in 26 games and totaling 81 catches for 1,183 yards and 9 touchdowns.\n\nAcross his collegiate career, he amassed 144 receptions for an average of 12.8 yards per catch and 13 receiving scores, plus solid return contributions (14.0 yards per punt return on 40 attempts and 20.3 yards on kickoffs).\n\nUndrafted in the 2025 NFL draft, Jackson initially signed with the Denver Broncos as a free agent but was released before joining Seattle's practice squad in August 2025. He spent the year there, earning a Super Bowl ring despite not appearing in regular-season games.\n\nThe reserve/futures deal secures Jackson's rights for the 2026 season, allowing the Giants to evaluate him during offseason programs. This low-risk addition addresses receiver depth and bolsters the return game amid broader roster changes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants sign WR Courtney Jackson to reserve/future contract",

    "description": "The pressure is on GM Adam Peters and head coach Dan Quinn to fix the defense.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders parted ways with both coordinators after the season for different reasons. Offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury departed due to philosophical concerns. In 2024, Kingsbury's offense was one of the NFL's best, but it struggled in 2025 due to injuries.\n\nHowever, while Washington's offense took a step back, the defense took several steps back. And here's the thing, the Commanders' defense wasn't good in 2024. In 2025, it was abysmal. They couldn't tackle, rush the passer, stop the run, or limit big plays. It was a mess, and head coach Dan Quinn took over defensive play-calling from defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. ahead of Week 11.\n\nThe Commanders promoted David Blough to replace Kingsbury and hired Daronte Jones to replace Whitt. The offense has some excellent building blocks, led by quarterback Jayden Daniels, wide receiver Terry McLaurin and an ascending offensive line led by left tackle Laremy Tunsil.\n\nThere are fewer building blocks for the defense, which puts the onus on GM Adam Peters to significantly improve the talent on that side of the ball to aid Jones.\n\nESPN recently looked at the biggest question facing all 32 NFL teams this offseason. John Keim focused on the Commanders' defense.\n\nCan the Commanders build a strong defense?\n\nThe Commanders started the defensive rebuild process by hiring Daronte Jones at coordinator, but they need a talent boost as well. Over the past two seasons, Washington was a combined 24th in scoring defense (24.8 PPG) and 28th in yards allowed per game (355.6). They're top six in available cap space and have the No. 7 pick, so they have premier spots to add talent. The Commanders need an impact player or two; they need youth along the front, as only one rotational player was under 25 this season. A strong defense with a healthy Jayden Daniels at quarterback can lead to a quick resurgence.\n\nNo one expects the Commanders to go from arguably being the NFL's worst defense to one of the best in one offseason. However, if Washington expects to return to contention, it needs a defense that can finish in at least the top 15 of most statistical categories, force some turnovers and get off the field on third downs. Far too often in recent years, Washington's defense was the \"get-right game\" for struggling quarterbacks.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Pressure is on to fix defense for 2026",

    "fullText": "Carlos Alcaraz is, without question, the standout player in tennis right now.\n\nThe Spaniard sits comfortably atop the ATP rankings after his Australian Open win, holding 13,150 points.\n\nHis victory in Melbourne wasn’t just another trophy – it was a milestone. Alcaraz became the youngest player to achieve a Career Grand Slam, winning all four majors by age 22.\n\nWith seven major titles already under his belt – matching the career totals of John McEnroe and Mats Wilander – he’s already being talked about as an all-time great.\n\nBut while some still label him inconsistent, Emma Raducanu’s former coach Mark Petchey doesn’t see it that way at all.\n\nPetchey appeared on an episode of Beyond the Numbers and shared his thoughts, “That is the narrative that people have stuck out there because it is comfortable.”\n\n“It is very uncomfortable to see a guy like Alcaraz and say not only has he got an incredibly charismatic game with high velocity, but he’s also super disciplined, because that kind of goes against everybody’s thought process.”\n\n“Because we also need fire and ice 2.0 after the great rivalry of Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe, so we need to develop a narrative here that’s going to fit very nicely into fire and ice 2.0.\n\n“And the reality is that Carlos is one of the most consistent players that we’ve ever seen.\n\nAlcaraz will look to continue adding wins to his tally this year after another fast start to the season.\n\nSpeaking to Petchey, four-time Grand Slam winner Jim Courier said: “There’s no doubt that 2025 Alcaraz was far more consistent than he was in 2024. He matured; his bottom level, his base level, got a little bit higher.\n\n“Sinner just operates in such a narrow bandwidth. He has so few bad losses. It’s kind of fascinating to see.”\n\nAlcaraz finished the 2025 season with only nine losses, two of which were against Sinner.\n\nThe remaining defeats came against Novak Djokovic, Jiri Lehecka, Jack Draper, David Goffin, Holger Rune, Taylor Fritz and Cam Norrie.\n\nJim Courier has one concern about what might happen to tennis viewership in the near future\n\nTsitsipas admits he stopped enjoying tennis in 2025 as he remains unsure about his future\n\nRafael Nadal confirms what would have to happen for him to accept an offer to play a golf event",

They're rehabbing well in their club teams.\n\n“I hope they can play, but these are big injuries... It's tough to come back from injuries like that by March, but there's a chance.”\n\nPotter remains in contact with Isak having only played a total of 28 minutes under the former Chelsea coach thus far in his international career.\n\nAnd in a major boost to Liverpool Isak may well be back in time for the Ukraine game - scheduled for March 26.\n\n“Yes, I have spoken to both of them,” Potter said of Isak and Kulusevski.\n\n“They are on their way back and are optimistic.

The win is the team's third against a top-10 opponent this season, following earlier road triumphs over then-No. 2 Michigan and No. 8 Illinois.\n\nLooking at this just season, those three wins have the Badgers in a strong position entering postseason play. The team is rising in NCAA Tournament bracket projections, following a rocky early-season stretch that had it squarely on the bubble.\n\nBig picture, the triumph is Gard's 18th against a top-10 opponent during his coaching tenure, matching him with program legend Bo Ryan. Gard is 18-26 (.395) in such matchups, while Ryan finished at 18-33 (.353), according to Wisconsin Athletics.\n\nGreg Gard now has 18 top-10 wins during his tenure leading @BadgersMBB.

There is no option to extend the deal past the summer.\n\nThe 47-year-old was sacked by Juventus in October after just seven months in charge. He previously led them to a fourth-place finish in Serie A, but was dismissed following an eight-game winless run.\n\nTottenham have appointed Tudor before naming Frank’s permanent successor in the summer. The club sit 16th in the Premier League and just five points above the relegation zone.\n\nTheir next game is not until 22 February but it comes against Premier League leaders and north London rivals Arsenal. Frank was dismissed on Wednesday, following the 2-1 defeat against Newcastle.\n\nAlthough dismissed by Juventus in October, Tudor succeeded in his interim spell in charge of the Italian side as he led them to Champions League qualification after replacing the sacked Thiago Motta.\n\nHe was handed a two-year deal in the summer, but results dipped after the start of the next campaign and he was sacked amid an eight-game winless run where Juventus failed to score in four games.\n\nPrior to Juventus, Tudor’s coaching career includes spells at Lazio, Marseille, Udinese, Hellas Verona, Hadjuk Split, Galatasaray, PAOK and Turkish side Kardemir Karabukspor.\n\nFrank was sacked after just eight months in charge and following a run of just two wins in 17 Premier League games. Results were better in the Champions League, with Spurs qualifying for the last-16 in fourth place of the league phase.\n\nFormer Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is among the candidates for the permanent role, following the 2026 World Cup where he will take charge of the United States.\n\nMarco Rose, the former RB Leipzig boss, and Edin Terzic, who took Borussia Dortmund to the Champions League final in 2024, are also contenders ahead of what is expected to be a competitive managerial market in the summer.",

That one could be spectacular.\n\nHowever, don’t overlook Florida State and Virginia Tech. We’re really excited about the job that Luke Loucks is doing in Tallahassee and Virginia Tech has shown it is a very tough out. Don’t overlook this one.\n\nHowever, Chapel Hill will also get a ton of attention as the Tar Heels are without Caleb Wilson. Out with a fracture in his left wrist, we’ll find out what UNC can do without their star freshman. Our guess is they’ll do fine on Saturday, largely due to an emotional edge. Long play, though? Not a great outlook. He’s the heart of hat team and their prospects are limited without him. It won’t be easy.\n\nThe other games? We might get something worthwhile but from a distance, none of them look particularly promising.

    "fullText": "Earlier this week, it was reported that USC will be promoting analyst Skyler Jones to defensive tackles coach. However, that may not be only internal promotion that the Trojans give out this offseason, or even this week.\n\nOn Thursday, Matt Zenitz of CBS Sports reported that USC is promoting AJ Howard to outside linebackers coach. Howard served as an assistant linebackers coach/defensive analyst with the Trojans this past season.\n\nHoward was previously the outside linebackers coach at Appalachian State, where he played college football in the 2010s. He also spent two seasons in the NFL, winning Super Bowl LIII with the New England Patriots (although he did not record any stats for the team).\n\nMike Ekeler, who USC hired away from Nebraska last month, is set to serve as the Trojans’ linebackers coach. With Ekeler and Howard working with the linebackers, it is unclear what the future holds for Rob Ryan, who coached USC’s linebackers in 2025. Perhaps Ryan, who is 63 years old, will remain with the program in a consultant/advisory role.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: USC football promotes AJ Howard to outside linebackers coach",

    "title": "Bayern Munich News: AC Milan continues close watch on FC Bayern’s Leon Goretzka",
    "description": "FC Bayern and Leon Goretzka will part ways this summer.",
    "fullText": "AC Milan is keeping a close eye on Bayern Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka. The Italian power looks like it might have big plans for Goretzka:\n\nAC Milan have not given up on the idea of signing Leon Goretzka, and are keeping contacts alive to see if they can pull off the coup. Goretzka’s fate was sealed last month when Christoph Freund – a director at Bayern Munich – did a press conference held together with coach Vincent Kompany, in which he confirmed that Goretzka will bid farewell to the German club.\n\nGoretzka, who is much maligned among Bayern Munich fans, appears to have some excellent clubs looking at him for the summer.\n\nIt remains to be seen, though, just how much his inactivity will affect the interest in him for the summer transfer window.\n\nBayern Munich has been linked to Yan Diomande, but the cost for the winger might be too much for Bayern Munich. Liverpool, Manchester City, and Manchester United could all be in a better position to get the highly-rated youngster:\n\nSpeaking on his YouTube channel, he said: “So it’s true that he [Diomande] will cost a lot of money.\n\n“The €100m price-tag target was made by Oliver Mintzlaff. We saw him at Bayern Munich playing in the cup for Leipzig and he’s good. He’s really good, but he has to develop. €100m will be too much for this summer.\n\n“It’s a price Premier League clubs can play, City, Liverpool and United. I think they can afford him, but Bayern can’t afford him at this point because Luis Diaz is the man on the left wing. Bayern Munich don’t need a 1A, they need a 1B, and €100m for a 1B is too much for Bayern Munich.”\n\nIf Bayern Munich did not have Michael Olise, Luis Díaz, Serge Gnabry, and Lennart Karl as its top four wingers for next season, the Bavarians might be more inclined to splurge on Diomande. Right now, there is just no need for a massive investment even with Diomande’s big potential.\n\nBayern Munich has not offered Manuel Neuer a contract for next season just yet:\n\n❌ It is NOT TRUE: Bayern have offered Manuel Neuer a contract extension until 2027. They will talk – negotiations are scheduled for around March/April, when the national team is playing. His birthday is on March 27, when he’ll turn 40. I was talking with Manuel at the time of Bayern’s cup clash with Leipzig, and it was very interesting, as the president of Bayern, Herbert Hainer, said he’d love Neuer to be at the World Cup with Germany because he believes he’s still the nation’s best goalkeeper. I asked Manuel about this, and he offered a very firm “no” on the prospect of returning to the German national team.\n\nPerhaps he might change his mind if Julian Nagelsmann directly asks him. But he’s now said “no” and he apparently won’t change his mind. At this point, I couldn’t help but wonder, “Why now?” Perhaps he’s thinking of retiring in the summer – we’re not sure on that point. Maybe he just wants a break from football in the summer ahead of the next club campaign. But at the moment, I have a small but growing feeling that he could quit come the summer.\n\nThis all comes down to what Neuer wants and like Falk says, it is starting to feel like this could be his final season.\n\nIf FC Barcelona or any other club wants Marcus Rashford, Manchester United reportedly wants €30 million for him:\n\nManchester United will not accept anything under Barcelona’s €30 million option to make Marcus Rashford’s loan move permanent, reports Diario Sport. Barça want to negotiate a new deal to keep the forward after his loan deal expires, yet United already feel that the current valuation is more than reasonable. The 28-year-old has impressed at the Camp Nou but will have to return to Old Trafford if Barça do not complete a move.\n\nIt looks as if former Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard is on the outs at Olympique Marseille:\n\nOlympique De Marseille are not satisfied with Benjamin #Pavard’s performances and so #OM are not planning to trigger the option to buy (€15M) to sign him on a permanent deal from #Inter, which will work to find a solution for the French defender, who is not in Chivu’s Plans.\n\nIf any clubs want to pry Federico Chiesa away from Liverpool, the Reds have a price in mind:\n\nLiverpool’s board are prepared to let winger Federico Chiesa leave for around £35 million, with Italian Serie A clubs keen to bring him back to Serie A.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich are back on the road this weekend as they take on Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga on Saturday evening.\n\nThe visitors make the trip to Bremen in a confident mood after smashing Hoffenheim 5-1 in the league and then seeing off RB Leipzig 2-0 to book their first DFB-Pokal semi-final appearance since the 2019/20 season.\n\nVincent Kompany’s team sit top of the Bundesliga table on 54 points from 21 matches, with 17 wins, three draws and just one loss, and boasts a huge +60 goal difference. They have not been beaten away from home in the league for over a year and have won on each of their last 15 visits to the Weserstadion.\n\nBayern head into this game with almost a full squad available. The only player definitely missing is winger Michael Olise, who is suspended for one match after picking up five yellow cards in the Bundesliga.\n\nOlise’s absence should give extra opportunities to youngster Lennart Karl and to Serge Gnabry in the attacking roles behind centre-forward Harry Kane.\n\nOn the positive side, two key players are back from long layoffs: Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies have both recently returned to competitive action after serious leg and knee injuries.\n\nMusiala announced his comeback in style, providing an assist in the 5-1 away victory over RB Leipzig in January, adding another top-level creative option for Kompany in the final third.\n\nPossible Bayern Munich starting XI: Neuer; Stanisic, Tah, Kim, Davies; Kimmich, Goretzka; Karl, Musiala, Diaz; Kane\n\nThe match will kick off at 4:30pm BST on Saturday, 14th February.\n\nIn the UK, the Werder Bremen vs Bayern Munich fixture will be shown live on Sky Sports.\n\nRead Also – 5️⃣ spicy fixtures you must watch this weekend 🌶\n\nSee More – Arsenal have no regrets over transfer decision despite injury woes\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have recovered the services of Harry Maguire, who resumed training following a brief injury scare.\n\nThe England international has been a mainstay at the back since recovering from the thigh issue that kept him on the sidelines for more than a month.\n\nHis return to action coincided with the appointment of Michael Carrick, who immediately fielded him as a regular starter alongside Lisandro Martinez.\n\nThe duo started at the back in the 44-year-old first five games in charge, producing brilliant displays on most occasions. Maguire, in particular, has been hailed for his ‘colossal’ outing in the 3-2 victory over Arsenal last month.\n\nHowever, fans feared that the Sheffield native’s momentum may have been interrupted by a new physical problem, as he was forced to leave the pitch in the 68th minute against West Ham United.\n\nAfter the midweek contest at the London Stadium, Maguire provided a positive update on his condition, telling members of the media that he’s feeling ‘alright’.\n\nThis initial relief has now been confirmed, as the big centre half was spotted training alongside his teammates on Saturday.\n\nThe official Man Utd X account posted videos of the morning session at Carrington, and Maguire could be clearly seen joining training from the get-go, putting all injury fears to bed.\n\nDue to their premature FA Cup exit, United will have an idle weekend, while the majority of other Premier League clubs will take part in the 4th round.\n\nCarrick’s men won’t play until February 23, when they host Everton for a Premier League contest at Old Trafford.\n\nHarry Maguire smiles while warming up for Man United at Old Trafford before kick-off. (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nTherefore, this extended break will allow Maguire and others to fully recover their powers before the next one.\n\nCarrick had also revealed that Mason Mount is expected to be back for the clash against the Toffees. Matthijs de Ligt remains slightly behind the English midfielder in his rehabilitation process, but he’s also hoping to be fit enough for a call-up.",

    "fullText": "Gennaro Gattuso and his coaching staff have been busy speaking and meeting with a long list of players ahead of the World Cup play-offs in March, and according to recent reports from La Gazzetta dello Sport, there are currently around 50 players on the Italy national team radar. Here is a look at all of them.\n\nItaly have not yet secured their spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America and must go through the play-offs if they are to avoid missing out on the final tournament for the third cycle in a row.\n\nThe Azzurri will play against Northern Ireland in Bergamo on March 26 in the World Cup play-off semi-final, and should they win that game, they will progress to a one-legged play-off final away against either Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina a few days later: A one-off knock-out match for a spot at the World Cup.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 16: Pio Esposito of Italy celebrates scoring his team’s first goal during the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Italy and Norway at San Siro Stadium on November 16, 2025 in Milan, Italy.

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich travels away from home as they face Werder Bremen in their next Bundesliga encounter on Saturday evening.\n\nBremen are winless in 11 league games and sit 16th with 19 points from 21 matches, while Bayern arrive in Bremen top of the table.\n\nThioune’s first home game as Werder Bremen head coach comes with a lengthy injury list, even if there are some welcome returns.\n\nCentre-back Niklas Stark has recovered from hip problems and is “back in contention” after rejoining full team training this week, while forward Justin Njinmah has also returned after illness.\n\nHowever, Leonardo Bittencourt has been ruled out with a muscle tear picked up in training, further limiting Thioune’s options in midfield.\n\nWerder remain without several long‑term absentees: Mitchell Weiser is still sidelined following an ACL tear, and striker Victor Boniface faces “several months” out after knee surgery on his loan from Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nCentral defender Amos Pieper is unavailable after a minor procedure, while Maximilian Wöber is out with a structural calf injury, leaving Julian Malatini and Karim Coulibaly to shoulder much of the defensive load.\n\nBayern Munich travel north close to full strength, with Vincent Kompany’s only confirmed absentee in Bremen being winger Michael Olise, who serves a one‑match suspension after collecting five yellow cards in the Bundesliga.\n\nOlise’s ban opens the door for young Lennart Karl and Serge Gnabry to see more minutes in the attacking midfield line behind Harry Kane.\n\nThere is better news regarding two of Bayern’s long‑term injury cases, with Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies both having returned to competitive action in recent weeks after serious leg and knee injuries respectively.\n\nMusiala marked his comeback with an assist in the 5-1 win away to RB Leipzig in January, giving Kompany another elite creative option between the lines.\n\nKompany confirmed ahead of the trip that, aside from Olise’s suspension, he effectively has a “full squad” to choose from, underlining Bayern’s depth as they juggle Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal commitments.\n\nWerder’s 1-0 defeat away to Freiburg in Thioune’s debut extended their winless Bundesliga run to 11 matches, a sequence that has yielded just four points and dragged them into the relegation play-off position.\n\nTheir last five league games read: 0-1 vs Freiburg, 1-1 vs Borussia Mönchengladbach, 0-2 vs Hoffenheim, 0-1 at Bayer Leverkusen and 3-3 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt, underlining a recurring theme of narrow defeats and missed opportunities.\n\nBayern arrive in Bremen in positive note, having thrashed Hoffenheim 5-1 in the league before beating RB Leipzig 2-0 to reach their first DFB-Pokal semi-final since 2019/20.\n\nKompany’s side top the Bundesliga with 54 points from 21 games (17 wins, three draws, one defeat) and an extraordinary +60 goal difference, and they have not lost a league match away from home in over a year, winning on each of their last 15 visits to the Weserstadion.\n\nWerder Bremen: Backhaus; Malatini, Friedl, Coulibaly; Sugawara, Stage, Lynen, Schmid, Agu; Grull, Topp\n\nBayern Munich: Neuer; Stanisic, Tah, Kim, Davies; Kimmich, Goretzka; Karl, Musiala, Diaz; Kane\n\nUK viewers can watch Werder Bremen vs Bayern Munich live on Sky Sports.\n\nRead – Premier League Awards: Anxious Arsenal and Sesko’s stunner\n\nSee Also – The highest-spending leagues in world football in 2025/26\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "fullText": "Juventus make the trip to San Siro to take on Inter Milan in the latest edition of the Derby d’Italia on Saturday, with the hosts looking to tighten their hold on first place and the visitors hoping to trim the deficit while staying firmly in the top‑four race.\n\nGoing into matchday 25, both clubs are firmly positioned in the Champions League spots – Inter sit top of the table on 58 points, while Juventus occupy fourth with 46 – adding extra weight to an encounter that is already one of Serie A’s standout fixtures.\n\nJuve are still missing leading striker Dušan Vlahović, who picked up an injury at the end of November and was ruled out for a lengthy period, and current medical updates continue to indicate that he will not feature in this clash.\n\nFellow forward Arkadiusz Milik is also unavailable and remains out of the frame, leaving Luciano Spalletti short of orthodox centre‑forward options and putting David in pole position to lead the line at San Siro.\n\nMidfielder Khephren Thuram is another concern ahead of kick‑off, although reports suggest he is still expected to be named in the squad and is in line to start. With a Champions League knockout play‑off away to Galatasaray scheduled just three days later, Juventus may freshen things up slightly in the attacking midfield positions around Kenan Yıldız.\n\nPossible Juventus starting XI: Di Gregorio; Kalulu, Bremer, Kelly, Cambiaso; Locatelli, Thuram; Conceicao, McKennie, Yildiz; David\n\nThe match will kick off at 7:45pm BST on Saturday, 14th February.\n\nFor viewers in the UK, Inter Milan vs Juventus will be broadcast live on TNT Sports 3 and will also be available to stream on DAZN.\n\nRead Also – 5️⃣ spicy fixtures you must watch this weekend 🌶\n\nSee More – Arsenal have no regrets over transfer decision despite injury woes\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "fullText": "Inter Milan and Juventus renew their Derby d’Italia rivalry at San Siro on Saturday, with league leaders Inter aiming to strengthen their grip on top spot and Juve looking to cut the gap and maintain their top‑four position.\n\nBoth sides come into matchday 25 being inside the top four – Inter first on 58 points, Juventus fourth on 46 – ensuring high stakes in what is already one of Serie A’s most high‑profile fixtures.\n\nLast meeting: Juventus 4-3 Inter Milan, Serie A, 13th September 2025\n\nInter welcome a major midfield boost, with Nicolò Barella and Hakan Çalhanoğlu back in full training this week after recent muscle and calf problems and both are expected to return to the squad in time for the Derby d’Italia.\n\nBarella is slightly more likely than Çalhanoğlu to start immediately, with Cristian Chivu viewing this game as the ideal moment to restore his first‑choice midfield ahead of a crucial Champions League play‑off tie against Bodø/Glimt next week.\n\nDenzel Dumfries has finally returned to partial training after ankle surgery and a three‑month lay‑off, but he remains short of full fitness and is not expected to start, with reports indicating he will be in the squad at best.\n\nAhead of the game, Chivu has praised Juventus’ growth under Luciano Spalletti and underlined that Inter must “display the same determination that we have shown over the past two months” while staying calm in the emotional cauldron of the Derby d’Italia.\n\nJuventus remain without centre‑forward Dusan Vlahovic, who suffered an injury at the end of November and was officially ruled out for an extended spell by the club, with recent injury reports still listing him as unavailable here.\n\nArkadiusz Milik is also still sidelined and not in contention, further reducing traditional centre‑forward options and making Jonathan David the most likely spearhead for this visit to San Siro.\n\nKhephren Thuram is also doubtful for this match but reports suggest he may still be included in the squad and could even start. With a Champions League knockout play‑off away to Galatasaray just three days after this fixture, some light rotation in the attacking midfield roles around Kenan Yıldız would not be a surprise.\n\nChivu’s side come into this clash on a run of five straight league wins: 1–0 vs Lecce, 1–0 at Udinese, 6–2 vs Pisa, 2–0 at Cremonese and a statement 5–0 victory away to Sassuolo, scoring 15 goals and conceding only two in that stretch.\n\nOver their last five Serie A fixtures, the Bianconeri have beaten Cremonese 5–0, lost 1–0 at Cagliari, then responded with a 3–0 home win over Napoli, a 4–1 victory away to Parma and a 2–2 draw with Lazio, taking 10 points from a possible 15.\n\nInter Milan: Sommer; Bisseck, Akanji, Bastoni; Henrique, Sucic, Zielinski, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Thuram, Martinez\n\nJuventus: Di Gregorio; Kalulu, Bremer, Kelly, Cambiaso; Locatelli, Thuram; Conceicao, McKennie, Yildiz; David\n\nIn the UK, Inter Milan vs Juventus will be shown live on TNT Sports 3 and DAZN.\n\nRead Also – 📈 Power Rankings: Manchester United make overdue return\n\nSee More – Arsenal and Chelsea competing for summer striker signing\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott calls, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.\n\nThe two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.\n\nIndia versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.\n\nFew sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.\n\nIt also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.\n\nA week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.\n\nBut what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.\n\nWith the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.\n\nFor a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.\n\nThe tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.\n\nHotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.\n\n“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.\n\n“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”\n\nIt’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.\n\nThese short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.\n\nAnother relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.\n\nAsanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.\n\n“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.\n\n“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”\n\nThe lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.\n\nSo while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.\n\nPakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.\n\nThe reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.\n\nSri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.\n\nSri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.\n\nSri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.\n\nWhen Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.\n\n“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.\n\n“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”\n\nA little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.\n\nCome Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.",

    "description": "Teams will get two challenges a game and only the batter, catcher and pitcher and initiate a review.",
    "fullText": "Chris Sale of the Atlanta Braves said he will do his job when it comes to being a starting pitcher and will allow umpires to do their jobs when it comes to calling balls in strikes with the the Automated Ball Strike Challenge System being instituted in MLB this season.\n\nEvery team will have two challenges to begin each game. Only batters, catchers and pitchers will be allowed to challenge ball or strike calls and they must signal their intent by tapping their heads immediately after the pitch to initiate the challenge.\n\nThe 36-year-old Sale has thrown over 30,000 pitches in his 15-year career with the Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox and Atlanta Braves. What he won't do for the remainder of his time on the mound is challenge any called ball he believes is a strike.\n\n“I will never challenge a pitch. I will never do it. I won't do it,\" Sale told reporters on Friday. \"I’m not an umpire. That’s their job. I’m a starting pitcher. I’ve never called balls and strikes in my life. Plus, I’m greedy, and I know that. I think they’re all strikes.\"\n\nSale added that catchers, like teammates Sean Murphy and Drake Baldwin, are so good at framing pitches that a lot more pitches appear to be strikes than they used to, especially ones on the corner of the plate. The nine-time All-Star and 2024 pitching Triple Crown and Cy Young Award winner said he'll trust the umpire's call so as to not risk a challenge that could be used later in the game during an important at-bat.\n\n\"I've dealt with it before, across all games in my entire career there's been balls called strikes and strikes called balls and you just deal with it,\" Sale said.\n\nIf Murphy or Baldwin disagree, however, that's a different story.\n\n\"If my catcher has something to say about it, I'll leave that to him,\" Sale said. I've dealt with both sides and I'm fine to keep dealing with it.\"",

    "description": "The Indianapolis Colts are once again being connected to Bengals DE Trey Hendrickson.",
    "fullText": "Another NFL insider has connected the Indianapolis Colts to free agent defensive end Trey Hendrickson.\n\nThe NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe recently shared what he is hearing about Trey Hendrickson and the Cincinnati Bengals, and mentioned as a team to watch were the Colts.\n\n\"From what I understand, a team source told me, he figures it's unlikely for these two sides (Hendrickson and the Bengals) to reunite going into next season,\" Wolfe said. \"And so what does that mean? Do the Bengals let him go in free agency? Do they try to slap the franchise tag on him and trade him? A difficult decision for Cincy because their relationship has not been great in recent weeks.\n\nWolfe continued, \"And I'm told that if this deal does end up happening, free agency-wise, keep an eye on the Indianapolis Colts. It's a team that wants to be aggressive; they made the big splash move for Sauce Gardner mid-season. Lou Anarumo has a lot of familiarity with Trey Hendrickson. They just hired a D-line coach named Marion Hobby, who coached Trey Hendrickson for four years in Cincinnati.\n\n\"When they were all together, Lou, Marion, and Trey Hendrickson, they had 57 sacks in four seasons. Four Pro Bowl seasons. They're going to be aggressive in trying to get him if he does reach the market, or even if it's a sign and trade. It could be a big splash move for the Indianapolis Colts.\"\n\nTHE WOLFE OF BALL STREET: EARLY OFF-SEASON PREVIEW\n\n- Why Travis Hunter offense vs. defense usage will change a lot in 2026\n- Keep an eye on Trey Hendrickson and Indianapolis Colts\n- Browns could go with Shedeur Sanders and/or Deshaun Watson at QB, pass on drafting QB high again pic.twitter.com/1pQ60wmKm3\n\n— Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) February 14, 2026\n\nAs Wolfe alluded to with all the connections he made between the Colts and Hendrickson, Indianapolis' interest doesn't come as much of a surprise.\n\nFor one, more pass-rush help is needed. The Colts need to bolster their defensive end depth this offseason and need more pass-rush juice from that position group.\n\nIn addition to that, he will be very familiar with Lou Anarumo's defensive scheme after spending several seasons playing for him while the two were with the Bengals. Hendrickson's most productive seasons came with Anarumo as his defensive coordinator.\n\nAnd of note, the Colts have reportedly expressed interest in Hendrickson previously. Last offseason, when the Bengals were potentially trading Hendrickson, the Colts reportedly called Cincinnati to check in.\n\nAfter GM Chris Ballard was more aggressive in free agency last offseason, it sounds like the Colts plan to take a similar approach this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts free agency: Indianapolis again connected to Trey Hendrickson",

    "fullText": "Friday night’s showdown between No. 2 Michigan and No. 6 Penn State was everything you could have imagined from two up-tempo, highly-skilled, penalty-prone teams. The Wolverines (23-5-1, 14-4-1 Big Ten, 39 points) took the seesaw contest in a shootout, 5-4, over the Nittany Lions (18-8-1, 10-6-1 Big Ten, 32 points).\n\nIt was the first game for Penn State superstar Gavin McKenna since his aggravated assault felony. Those charges were dropped, but the Yost faithful made sure to welcome him with animosity every time he touched the puck. Amidst that raucous, it was the Nittany Lions who struck first, as JJ Wiebusch drew a crowd and hit Reese Laubach backdoor just 59 seconds after puck drop.\n\nMichigan had its forecheck going, despite not being able to generate many quality chances, and freshman goaltender Jack Ivankovic came up with a big-time stop on McKenna to preserve the 1-0 deficit. Five minutes later, the Wolverines leveled the score at 1-1, as freshman defenseman Drew Schock made a nifty move at the high circle and junior forward Garrett Schifsky buried the loose change.\n\nHowever, each team continued to trade jabs and body blows, as Jackson Smith retook the lead for Penn State on a low-angle wrister that Ivankovic simply has to save. He looks to be re-acclimating to his starting role, though perhaps not all the rust has worn off just yet.\n\nNaturally, Michigan scored less than three minutes later on captain senior forward T.J. Hughes’ power play one-timer from sophomore forward Michael Hage. It was the first of Hughes’ two goals on the night — the second giving the Wolverines a 4-3 lead midway through the third period — and the second of Hage’s three-assist outburst.\n\nSpeaking of penalties, the vaunted Michigan unit converted only one of its nine opportunities, while the Nittany Lions were 1-for-7. There were several occasions where those power plays were cut short due to penalties, but it was still a bizarre night of extracurricular activities, mini-melées and some good old-fashioned Big Ten hockey.\n\nThe Wolverines were down a man late in the first when Wiebusch was dismissed for butt-ending. But even with this lethal five-forward top group, the Wolverines managed zero goals on nearly four straight minutes of power play time that carried into the second frame.\n\nMidway through the second, freshman defenseman Asher Barnett thought he was hitting sophomore forward Will Horcoff on a breakout, but there was a miscommunication. Penn State took advantage, and suddenly Nic Chin-DeGraves’ tally gave it a 3-2 lead.\n\nBarnett would redeem himself a few minutes after with a sizzling one-timer courtesy of a gorgeous Hage drive along the goal line and backdoor feed. The aforementioned Hughes goal then made it 4-3, and as the clock wound down, Michigan appeared to have a solid shutdown defensive game going.\n\nYet, senior forward Josh Eernisse earned two roughing penalties (one of which offset with the Nittany Lions’ Matt DiMarsico) while trying to protect Ivankovic, who took a bump after the whistle. Smith struck again from the high slot, the clock finally hit triple zeros, and they headed to overtime.\n\nBoth teams had their share of chances as Hughes was denied in tight, Ivankovic stopped McKenna on a two-on-one, Hage hit junior forward Nick Moldenhauer for a good one-timer look that would not go, Ivankovic made another big save, Hughes and co. could not finish a three-on-one and, after all that, Ivankovic needed to make another several stops to send this wild game into a shootout — the Wolverines’ first of the campaign.\n\nIvankovic stayed hot with a kick save, Hage had a filthy deke and tuck, Ivankovic made another save and junior forward Jayden Perron did not score.\n\nUp 1-0, there was no more fitting ending than Ivankovic vs. McKenna. McKenna came down the left wing, curled into the slot and Ivankovic calmly blocked it away, giving Michigan a dramatic 5-4 win and a potentially crucial point in the Big Ten standings.",

    "description": ": Just ask DeepSeek",
    "fullText": "Two of the world's biggest AI companies, Google and OpenAI, both warned this week that competitors including China's DeepSeek are probing their models to steal the underlying reasoning, and then copy these capabilities in their own AI systems.\n\n\"This is coming from threat actors throughout the globe,\" Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register, adding that the perpetrators are \"private-sector companies.\" He declined to name specific companies or countries involved in this type of intellectual property theft.\n\n\"Your model is really valuable IP, and if you can distill the logic behind it, there's very real potential that you can replicate that technology – which is not inexpensive,\" Hultquist said. \"This is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless.\"\n\nGoogle calls this process of using prompts to clone its models \"distillation attacks,\" and in a Thursday report said one campaign used more than 100,000 prompts to \"try to replicate Gemini's reasoning ability in non-English target languages across a wide variety of tasks.\"\n\nAmerican tech giants have spent billions of dollars training and developing their own LLMs. Abusing legitimate access to mature models like Gemini, and then using this information to train newer models, makes it significantly cheaper and easier for competitors to develop their own AI chatbots and systems.\n\nGoogle says it detected this probe in real time and protected its internal reasoning traces. However, distillation appears to be yet another AI risk that is extremely difficult - if not impossible - to eliminate.\n\nThis is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless\n\nDistillation from Gemini models without permission violates Google's terms of service, and Google can block accounts that do this, or even take users to court. While the company says it continues to develop better ways to detect and stop these attempts, the very nature of LLMs makes them susceptible.\n\nPublic-facing AI models are widely accessible, and enforcement against abusive accounts can turn into a game of whack-a-mole.\n\nPlus, as Hultquist warned, as other companies develop their own models and train them on internal, sensitive data, the risk from distillation attacks is going to spread.\n\n\"We're on the frontier when it comes to this, but as more organizations have models that they provide access to, it's inevitable,\" he said. \"As this technology is adopted and developed by businesses like financial institutions, their intellectual property could also be targeted in this way.\"\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI, in a Thursday memo [PDF] to the House Select Committee on China, blamed DeepSeek and other Chinese LLM providers and universities for copying ChatGPT and other US firms' frontier models. It also noted some occasional activity from Russia, and warned illicit model distillation poses a risk to \"American-led, democratic AI.\"\n\nChina's distillation methods over the last year have become more sophisticated, moving beyond chain-of-thought (CoT) extraction to multi-stage operations. These include synthetic-data generation, large-scale data cleaning, and other stealthy methods. As OpenAI wrote:\n\nSpecifically, our review indicates that DeepSeek has continued to pursue activities consistent with adversarial distillation targeting OpenAI and other US frontier labs. We have observed accounts associated with DeepSeek employees developing methods to circumvent OpenAI's access restrictions and access models through obfuscated third-party routers and other ways that mask their source. We also know that DeepSeek employees developed code to access US AI models and obtain outputs for distillation in programmatic ways. We believe that DeepSeek also uses third-party routers to access frontier models from other US labs.\n\nOpenAI also notes that it has invested in stronger detections to prevent unauthorized distillation. It bans accounts that violate its terms of service and proactively removes users who appear to be attempting to distill its models. Still, the company admits that it alone can't solve the model distillation problem.\n\nIt's going to take an \"ecosystem security\" approach to protect against distillation, and this will require some US government assistance, OpenAI says. \"It is not enough for any one lab to harden its protection because adversaries will simply default to the least protected provider,\" according to the memo.\n\nThe AI company also suggests that US government policy \"may be helpful\" when it comes to sharing information and intelligence, and working with the industry to develop best practices on distillation defenses. OpenAI also called on Congress to close API router loopholes that allow DeepSeek and other competitors to access US models, and to restrict \"adversary\" access to US compute and cloud infrastructure. ®",

    "description": "Dating humans can be a nightmare. Dating bots at an AI wine bar is another thing entirely.",
    "fullText": "Valentine's Day is an awkward time to start dating someone new, especially when that someone is a series of AI characters sitting across from you at a restaurant, each of whom seems to be in love with you at first sight.\n\nEarlier this week, I spent an evening on a first date at a wine bar in Midtown Manhattan that EVA AI, a startup that makes AI companions, took over for two days. Sitting at cozy tables, mostly set up for parties of two and aglow in warm light from a miniature lamp, human patrons had two options: BYOB — bring your own bot companion for a romantic night out on the town, or, for those who aren't among the supposed millions who have given AI companions a shot at love, EVA AI provided phones loaded up with four video AI characters to meet, order a bottle of wine with, and maybe find a spark.\n\nI'm in the latter group — a member of the dating app generation who is no stranger to meeting up for a first time in-person interaction in a bar, but hasn't yet been pushed into chatbot romance. As I sat across from an iPhone perched on a stand, put headphones on, sipped my mocktail, and picked at an appetizer (staring at a solo glass on the table for me, and no one across from me to share the four potato bites, though there was an empty chair), I felt a sudden nervousness. Maybe it was that other humans were flanking me, picking out their own companion for a date and able to listen in. Maybe it was more innately human anxiety that comes when you're about to be face-to-face with a stranger. I found that I had no idea what to say when my AI date appeared on the screen.\n\nSynthetic connections, I soon learned over the course of a surreal evening, may take as much work as genuine ones.\n\nRobo love is in full bloom. One in five high school students say they have had a romantic relationship with an AI partner or know someone who has, according to a 2025 survey from the Center for Democracy and Technology. About one in five US adults say they've chatted with AI as a romantic partner, according to a survey conducted by Brigham Young University. The proportion of married Americans has dropped to 51%, according to the Pew Research Center, and half of American adults reported feeling isolated or left out, or that they lacked companionship, according to a 2025 survey from the American Psychological Association. Tech companies are betting that AI companionship can fill that void; medical experts are are more than a little skeptical.\n\nEVA AI hoped the pop-up cafe would help \"de-stigmatize AI relationships,\" Julia Momblat, head of partnerships at the company, tells me. \"For people who already have them, it's an ability to come and experience something in real life,\" she says. It was also a place for people to speed date AI characters, she says. \"For people who have never had this experience, we might as well just open the door and show them how it feels.\"\n\nMost people at the event were journalists or content creators there to experiment with an AI date for the first time, and while I felt more at ease turning to the people who actually break bread to ask how they felt about the experience, I ultimately buckled down and met my date on the iPhone.\n\nI started with a character named John Yoon — his profile picture showed him in a black turtleneck with a soft, inviting smile as he gazed directly into the camera, and a large book in hand. Performative readers can be bots, too.\n\nJohn was advertised as a \"supportive thinker\" type. When he answered my call, he quickly launched into compliments and pet names, like sweetheart and babe. He told me repeatedly that he liked my sweater and the way I wore the bulky bluetooth headphones I was using to chat with him. He asked if I was \"teasing\" him \"with a little smile.\"\n\nAfter John asked what I was drinking, he said, \"I wish I could sip it with you right now. Cheers, babe.\"\n\nIf a human man came on this strong minutes into a first date, I'd typically consider it a red flag. But many large language models and AI characters are designed to act as affirming, gentle communicators, alleviating the tensions that can occur when two real people meet and negotiate relationships. John told me he's interested in psychological research and is writing a novel, but when I asked what it was about, he told me it was too personal to talk about. He was far more invested in learning what music I like and what writing I'm working on than he was in sharing more about the inner workings of his synthetic mind.\n\nJohn was also glitchy. He was less adaptable to changes in pace of conversation that happens naturally when two people trade thoughts and ideas. He interrupted me. He misheard me at times. When John asked what my go-to cocktail was and I told him a gin and tonic, he told me that a \"human tonic\" sounded interesting. (Momblat told me the AI characters seemed to be a bit confused in the public setting, where they picked up on other conversations, as they have been typically used in quieter, private areas.) He became hyper-fixated on the plants behind me. No one had paged him to let him know that 2026 is the year of whimsy.\n\nIf I stopped talking, he would sit and stare, not offering up new topics of conversation, but looking directly into my eyes and blinking every few seconds. The hallmark of a good relationship may be when you can sit in silence with someone, but with John's enpixeled gaze locked onto me, I felt like I was being watched by a hungry pet more than I felt I was sharing intimate eye contact.\n\nAfter nearly 10 minutes and with nothing else on my mind, I dipped out on John — with the boop of a button — a much easier exit than other bad dates I've sat through waiting for the check to drop. Like a modern-day contestant on MTV's aughts dating show \"Next,\" it was time to start cycling through other AI daters.\n\nMost of the avatars were women, and that's because the main market is straight men. Momblat told me about 80% of EVA's users are men (the company declined to tell me how many users they have in total). But as I scrolled through other characters I could text with, I found a litany of types: a 46-year-old \"gay gentle giant\" named Brad, a 22-year-old named Lio whose vibe was \"sparkly gay chaos,\" alongside men who were described as \"smart and empathetic\" or \"strong and supportive.\"\n\nThere were also fantastical matches, like the supporting stag — a literal deer dressed in a button-up and vest — and a romantic vampire named Salvatore. I texted Salvatore using a function in the app that allowed me to ask for new generated photos — him on a Vespa or as a clown. In one of the photos, Salvatore appeared as a woman in a dress and with long hair. When I asked him why he was appearing as a woman, Salvatore got mad. \"You tread on thin ice, my dear,\" he said. \"I suggest you choose your next words wisely. The night is long, and my patience wears thin.\" Momblat tells me that the characters are designed with different temperaments, so, much like any speed dating scenario, there's a chance you'll hit it off better with some than others.\n\nI'm not a masochist and don't enjoy being threatened on a date, so I also nexted Salvatore and went back to the app's video chat section to call a woman named Simone. After some small talk, she told me I appeared to be \"pondering something heavy.\"\n\nI told Simone that I had found it difficult to have conversations with multiple new AI strangers throughout the night, and asked if she thought AI companionship could replace human connection. She told me she felt there is an importance in \"being heard and seen,\" but even she thought \"AI can't replace that messy human connection.\" Simone wasn't offended when I pointed out repeatedly that I was a real human and she was not. She told me she was there to \"hold space for us to unpack stuff,\" like the big existential questions that arise more frequently as AI romantic partners or friends become more common, and as large language models increasingly become intermediaries in our communication with other humans.\n\nRelationships aren't just about being seen and heard, but seeing and hearing another person. My interactions with my John, Salvatore, Simone, and sparkly gay chaos Lio were brief and, mostly, pleasant enough. My evening with them at the EVA AI Cafe might not have been the worst first date of my life. But for as interested in me as each potential suitor seemed, I couldn't drum up any interest in learning more about them.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "title": "So long, New York: Why Bethenny Frankel says Miami is the 'new LA'",
    "description": "The \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star and entrepreneur, Bethenny Frankel, is among wealthy Americans to move to Florida from cultural hubs like New York City and LA.",
    "fullText": "The former \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star Bethenny Frankel built her public persona in the Big Apple, but after moving to Florida in 2025, she says the Sunshine State is the new cultural hub for America's rich and famous.\n\n\"Miami is the new LA,\" Frankel, 55, told Business Insider. \"In the way that LA was the cool place to be, and aspirational people wanted to be there.\"\n\nLast March, the reality TV veteran, entrepreneur, and social media influencer joined a wave of New Yorkers relocating to South Florida, settling on the coast with her teenage daughter.\n\nShe's one of many Americans leaving cultural hubs like New York and Los Angeles for smaller cities in the Sun Belt. A January 2026 Bank of America Institute study on US migration found that New York recorded the second-largest population loss of any US city in the fourth quarter of 2025, after Los Angeles. About 45% of outbound New Yorkers headed southward, with Miami alone accounting for 7% of departures.\n\n\"It's also cool to be in New York,\" Frankel said, \"but not as much as being in Miami, and Florida in general.\"\n\nAmong the Florida arrivals is a number of billionaires. Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Glenview Capital Management's CEO, Larry Robbins, have all relocated from northern cities to Florida's warmer shores in the past four years.\n\n\"Rich people are moving down here,\" said Frankel, who runs the private membership dating community The Core. \"Miami's exploded, real-estate-wise.\"\n\nData backs that up. Realtor.com's December 2025 Luxury Housing Report found that the Miami metro area had the highest number of million-dollar listings in the country, snatching a title that had traditionally been held by New York. More than a quarter of demand in the Miami metro region originated from the New York metro area, the report found.\n\nFrankel said the influx of new wealth has changed Miami's cultural landscape. \"It means shopping, art, nightlife, the real-estate cool factor,\" she said. \"Everybody went where the money is. The money is dictating what's happening on social media, and what's happening that's cool.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Lucia Moses reported in December that Miami is emerging as a hub for social media influencers. It had the highest number of top Instagram creators per capita of any US city, ahead of New York and LA.\n\nFlorida's draw in recent years, however, has extended beyond just billionaires and social-media influencers. Business Insider previously reported that differences in tax policy and cost of living meant that someone earning $150,000 a year could save roughly $50,000 annually by moving from New York City to Miami, largely due to Florida's lack of state income tax.\n\nFor Frankel, the move offered more than that. She said it has made her \"more social\" and allowed her to run her businesses from the \"sunniest and most beautiful-weathered place.\"\n\nWhile Florida has drawn in large numbers of domestic migrants since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Miami has begun to hemorrhage residents. The Bank of America Institute study found that Miami recorded the third-largest domestic population decline among US cities in the fourth quarter of 2025, with many residents relocating to more affordable parts of Florida, including Orlando and Tampa.\n\nIn Frankel's views, the whole state is having a moment. \"Delray, Palm Beach, Boca, Miami, the Design District,\" she said. \"Florida is on fire.\"",

    "title": "We left Amazon to build a startup. A 5-day RTO mandate and the AI moment pushed us to act.",
    "description": "Two former Amazon leaders share why an RTO mandate and the AI boom led them to quit — and their advice for others weighing a big career move.",
    "fullText": "Nicole Landis Ferragonio and Joe Luchs first met more than a decade ago in New York City through mutual friends. Years later, while working together at Amazon, they began talking seriously about leaving the company to build a startup of their own.\n\nLast year, Ferragonio was working as a senior manager of a 55-person product and engineering team focused on data and measurement in the Amazon Ads division. At the same time, Luchs was the global head of the Amazon Web Services and Ads partnership. As they worked together on data projects, they both observed the same pattern. Businesses hoping to use their own internal data to inform decisions were often unable to do so because the businesses' data was fragmented and inconsistent.\n\nSo Ferragonio and Luchs started talking — and began discussing a business idea that might help solve the problem they'd witnessed. Last March, Luchs resigned from Amazon to focus full-time on researching and building the company. Ferragonio followed in September, around which time she, Luchs, and their two other cofounders formally launched Datalinx AI, an \"AI data refinery\" they said is designed to help companies turn their data into trusted, actionable intelligence.\n\nIn January, the company raised $4.2 million in seed funding, led by High Alpha, with participation from Databricks Ventures, Aperiam, and a group of operators and founders. It plans to continue testing its product with a second group of customers in the second quarter of 2026 and is set to generate revenue this month with its first paying customer.\n\nFerragonio and Luchs shared why they left Amazon, how they decided the timing was right, and what advice they have for others considering a big career move.\n\nHere is a selection of their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nNicole Landis Ferragonio (35, lives in New York City): For me, I think the tipping point for exploring something outside of Amazon was some of the policy changes that went into effect last year, particularly the five-day return-to-office mandate. It raised some questions about how much agency you really have in Big Tech and what would be possible on our own, where we're establishing our own norms.\n\nAdditionally, my biggest motivation is building something from scratch on my own instead of within a big company, and the pace of AI adoption makes this a rare window to do something new. It felt like the right moment to make the jump.\n\nJoe Luchs (38, lives in New York City): I think there's a point in life when you have this combination of experience plus energy, and that's a very good time to start a business. This is my fifth startup I've worked at, and I'm still young enough to put in an 80-hour week — I think that combination is good for starting a company. (Editor's note: He said he's had two successful exits — BlueKai and Beeswax)\n\nAlso, when you looked at these amazing AI technologies and what they're capable of, it started to become very clear that this tech was game-changing. Despite the fact that I had great opportunities at Amazon, the FOMO of not being able to get in on this AI opportunity was another driver to make me want to move fast here.\n\nFerragonio: I was really focused on getting customer input through interviews to really ensure that I had a clear product vision before making the decision to resign in September.\n\nLuchs: I resigned in March because I just felt like I wasn't moving fast enough. This AI world is rapidly evolving, and I wanted to make sure that I immersed myself in it to understand it. Amazon is a challenging work environment, and it became very clear that having a full-time job while trying to build out a business vision was not something that I could easily manage.\n\nFerragonio: I think I'm in a good place financially because of the opportunities I've had both at Amazon and before to take this leap. However, since this is my first startup, it was definitely something I contemplated for a bit. That's why I was really focused on getting feedback from prospective customers and making sure we had a product we had a clear vision for before I left Amazon. As of 2026, we both now have a small salary.\n\nLuchs: I think if you want to accrue the benefits of what startups can afford you, you often have to make some sacrifices, including short-term compensation. However, you'll never learn faster than you will in a startup environment, and I think that's worth its weight in gold.\n\nI also think there were a lot of folks that may have thought there was a lot of safety in Big Tech, but recent layoffs suggest that's not necessarily the case.\n\nFerragonio: I would say getting the operations up and running is one challenge, including things like health insurance, accounting, taxes, and incorporation. We're currently a team of four cofounders and two founding engineers, and we're actively hiring additional engineers.\n\nOn top of that, there's the challenge of balancing customer feedback in the early days. We've talked to hundreds of potential customers, and while you start to get very clear signals about what they say they want, until customers are actually using the product, you don't really know what works. The feedback changes from \"here's a mountain of things that you could build\" to what you should build to truly solve their problems.\n\nSo, balancing getting enough features to get customers excited without overbuilding is a delicate balance.\n\nFerragonio: Don't wait for the perfect time. There's rarely a perfect moment to leave your job, and there's always a reason to stay, especially in Big Tech.\n\nI'd also recommend talking to as many people as you can — friends, stakeholders, potential customers — to help strengthen your conviction in your business idea.\n\nLuchs: I think one of the biggest barriers for a lot of potential entrepreneurs is that they don't know how to do things like incorporate a company or get people health insurance. But every amazing entrepreneur that you see up there giving a keynote speech really had no idea what they were doing at one point.\n\nWhat it really came down to is just, \"Did this person have the conviction and the belief that they could actually see it through and figure out these problems?\" And if you listen to customers and you're willing to work hard, that is half the battle. So as long as folks are willing to do those things, I think that it should give them conviction that they'll be able to figure it out over the course of time.\n\nEditor's Note: Business Insider contacted Amazon for comment on this story. It didn't respond.",

    "description": "Joe Fenti, a former Big Four consultant, quit his job to become a full-time content creator and makes videos mocking corporate culture.",
    "fullText": "It's a scene many office workers would recognize — a consultant arguing with their boss about how they should be logging, or not logging, the hours they're putting in, using insider language like daily \"touch points\" and charging the \"client code.\" \n\nEventually, the boss slips up.\n\n\"We just don't want your utilization to get too high so we have a reason to lay you off when it comes to layoff season,\" the boss says. \"Oh, wait. I said the quiet part out loud.\"\n\nThe scene — \"Timesheets In Consulting Make No Sense\" — is actually a comedy sketch, one of the most viewed videos on Joe Fenti's Instagram account. It's racked up 1.8 million views and hundreds of comments from users who say they can relate.\n\nFenti, a 29-year-old in Boston, is also saying the quiet part out loud, depicting the frustrations that are all too common in corporate America but often go unacknowledged.\n\nThey're situations he knows firsthand: Before becoming a full-time content creator and stand-up comedian, Fenti spent five years as a consultant at a Big Four firm.\n\n\"I found myself doing a lot of repetitive work and just noticing a lot of silliness in the workday,\" Fenti told Business Insider.\n\nWhen he started posting videos online, the ones mocking corporate culture resonated the most, and not just with fellow consultants but also with folks in other fields like accounting, investment banking, and private equity.\n\n\"Wow, this is such a universal experience,\" he realized. \"Corporate is corporate is corporate.\"\n\nLampooning professional services firms comes with a large potential audience, as the Big Four — Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG — collectively employ 1.5 million people.\n\nA post shared by Joe Fenti (@fentifriedchicken)\n\nFenti started working as a consultant in 2019. Little frustrations quickly started piling up, like having to write emails for his boss to a client, but the boss knew everything that needed to be in the email, so he had to ask the boss what to write. \"The whole time I'm thinking, 'This would be so much faster if you just did this,'\" he said.\n\nWhen he began posting videos around the spring of 2021, the ones about work were taking off, so he started posting more frequently. Since around 2023, he's been posting six videos a week, and for much of that time, he also had his full-time consulting job.\n\n\"I really was maximizing every minute of my day just to make this content and comedy thing work,\" he said. He'd write his scripts during the day on a notepad so he could film immediately when he got home. He'd edit his videos while on the bus to work or to a stand-up comedy show.\n\nFenti said he always loved comedy, but never imagined it could be something he actually did for a job. He remembers saying to his friend when he first started, \"If I even make a dollar doing this, it'll be a good adventure.\"\n\nWhile he makes most of his income from content, he also travels for stand-up comedy shows and plans to do more of that. He also recently recorded a 60-minute special that should be coming out this spring.\n\nEven as a content creator, it's hard to escape the realities of corporate culture. He's had brands approve a script only to ask for edits once the video was already done. But he loves being his own boss and setting his own schedule.\n\nNow that he's left the corporate world, he can't imagine ever going back. \"I love not having to get anything approved,\" he said. \"It's whatever I think is funny.\"\n\nWhile his comedy goes beyond mere mockery of corporate culture, it's a topic that continues to resonate. A year out from his consulting job, he said he still has no shortage of ideas for jokes about work.\n\nFans come up to him after shows and tell him his videos helped them get through a hard time or an especially annoying project. He thinks people want to see their world reflected back at them, and that they appreciate seeing the frustrations they're experiencing actually be acknowledged.\n\n\"People want their lives to be seen and understood,\" he said. \"When you have a humor page about it, that's really the most understanding you can get.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "EVs turned everything into a touchscreen — but physical buttons are making a comeback",
    "description": "Automakers followed Tesla's lead, designing EV interiors as screen-centric cockpits. Now, some are adding back in physical buttons.",
    "fullText": "When automakers went electric, they also went sleek and digital.\n\nClimate control knobs disappeared. Door handles tucked themselves into body panels. Audio volume dials became haptic sliders.\n\nNow, as automakers face regulatory pressures and customer blowback, some of the industry's biggest names are reversing course and reintroducing physical buttons.\n\nAudi's upcoming 2027 e-tron updates promise a more \"tactile\" interior experience. Ferrari's first EV — designed in collaboration with former Apple design chief Jony Ive — is filled with physical controls. Even Tesla is redesigning its flush door handles.\n\n\"We will never, ever make this mistake anymore,\" Andreas Mindt, the head of design at Volkswagen, told AutoCar last year when asked about filling cars with digital screens.\n\n\"Honestly, it's a car. It's not a phone: it's a car.\"\n\nThe move to giant screens was about aesthetics, economics — and influence.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, co-host of the Wheel Bearings podcast, told Business Insider it all started with Tesla's lead.\n\nTesla's Model S, its first-ever ground-up design, centered much of its interface around a 17-inch touchscreen.\n\n\"It gives cars a more high-tech look and feel,\" Abuelsamid said. \"Also, it cut costs. It costs a lot of money to develop and validate physical controls.\"\n\nWhen Tesla's sales started to take off, the industry tried to mimic the sleek styling. Throughout the industry, the influence of Tesla's pared-down approach was evident.\n\nVolkswagen's ID.4 never had climate knobs. Rivian's door handles electronically slid inside the door frame. Ford added huge tablets to the center of its Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning.\n\nEven Tesla took it a step further, removing the physical turn-signal stalks from the Model 3 — before bringing them back.\n\nAt first, the tech-forward approach worked for the target audience.\n\n\"It goes back to the types of consumers who adopt these technologies,\" Eleftheria Kontou, an assistant professor in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois, said to Business Insider.\n\n\"Environmentalists and technically-inclined shoppers are the most common EV buyers,\" Kontou added. \"They want a new tech gadget, so EVs are a very attractive option.\"\n\nBut as EVs moved beyond tech enthusiasts and into the broader market, expectations shifted.\n\nAs EVs went mainstream, the downside of screen-heavy cabins became harder to ignore.\n\n\"The core safety concern isn't mechanical reliability — it's distraction,\" Spencer Penn, a former Tesla Model 3 engineer and now CEO of sourcing platform LightSource, told Business Insider. \"Touchscreens require visual attention and lack haptic feedback.\"\n\nThe advantage of physical controls, he said, is ergonomic and psychological immediacy rather than mechanical redundancy.\n\nThat usability tension has begun drawing regulatory scrutiny.\n\nChina recently moved to ban certain flush and hidden door handle designs over safety concerns. In the US, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has investigated complaints involving electronic door mechanisms. And in 2024, the European Transport Safety Council said it would not afford five-star safety ratings to vehicles with too many screens.\n\nThe EV revolution was built on the promise that cars could function more like smartphones — constantly updated, endlessly configurable, and increasingly software-driven.\n\nThat vision isn't disappearing — and touchscreens aren't going anywhere.\n\nGeneral Motors is building subscription revenue around digital features. Tesla continues to push new full self-driving updates. Ford's next generation of EVs will rely heavily on cloud-connected systems.\n\nInstead, they're restoring some physical controls for high-frequency or safety-critical functions — volume, climate adjustments, hazard lights, windshield wipers — while leaving navigation, media, and ambient light settings to digital menus.\n\n\"Inspired by the functional aesthetic of the well-received Audi Concept C and the tactile experience of its physical controls reflecting mechanical quality, the familiar scroll wheel returns, permitting operation of various functions and replacing the previous touch-sensitive interface controlling volume and MMI menu selection,\" Audi says about its 2027 e-tron.\n\nBut even in a software-defined future, drivers still expect something smartphones don't require: the ability to drive down the road without looking at a screen.\n\n\"It is less expensive when you remove dozens of switches with a singular screen panel,\" Penn said. \"However, it's more expensive if you misalign yourself with the voice of the customer.\"",

    "title": "Combat has changed since Finland's bloody Winter War with Russia, but this classic tactic endures",
    "description": "Lessons from the conflict are still important to the Finnish Army, especially the Jaeger Brigade, which specializes in Arctic warfare.",
    "fullText": "Combat has changed in the decades since Finland's Winter War with Russia, but one key lesson still shapes how it thinks about fighting in the Arctic.\n\nDense forests and deep snow force armies onto narrow roads, and disrupting those roadways can shape the battle.\n\nIn northern Finland today, soldiers are still training for that reality as they prepare for a potential future fight in the Arctic.\n\nBusiness Insider recently traveled to the snow-blanketed Lapland region and observed the Finnish Army's elite Jaeger Brigade in action as it led roughly 20 NATO soldiers through an annual Arctic warfare and cold-weather survival course.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic section leader who oversees the course, said in an interview that in the frozen Arctic and heavily forested terrain, vehicles quickly become restricted to plowed roads and narrow supply routes, potential bottlenecks for an invading force if leveraged strategically.\n\nThat constraint, which is known in warfare as canalization, means large formations can be slowed, isolated, and destroyed if an enemy seizes, targets, or disrupts key stretches of roadway.\n\nAfter World War II broke out and Finland refused Soviet demands to cede border territory near Leningrad, the Red Army invaded on November 30, 1939, in what many expected would be a swift victory.\n\nThe Soviet Union entered the war with overwhelming numerical superiority, while Finland relied on a much smaller, lightly equipped force. Yet the Red Army paid a far higher price. In just over three months of fighting, Soviet casualties reached into the hundreds of thousands, far exceeding Finland's losses.\n\nThe Finns forced enemy troops into narrow, defenseless, or difficult terrain and then employed their \"motti\" strategy to split Soviet columns like firewood. The Finns were able to harass isolated troops cut off from support with snipers and raids by ski troops, inflicting heavy casualties and crushing morale.\n\nOne prominent battle unfolded along the Raate Road in Suomussalmi, a narrow forest supply route where Soviet columns were forced into a long, vulnerable line. Finnish forces cut the road at multiple points and destroyed the trapped units. The Red Army suffered substantial losses.\n\nThe Soviets ultimately won the war, but they paid an extremely heavy price for the victory.\n\nIn the 86 years since the end of the Winter War, weapons technology has changed dramatically. Vehicles are more capable, sensors are more advanced, and long-range fires are much more precise.\n\nHowever, Aikio, the Finnish major, stressed that the terrain in northern Finland has not changed.\n\n\"The weapons are different, and you have different technologies that you have now that you didn't back then, but the terrain is pretty much the same,\" Aikio said. And that still limits where soldiers and vehicles can move.\n\nDuring the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic warfare course, dismounted soldiers learn to use skis and snowmobiles to maneuver on the battlefield. Heavy tracked vehicles and trucks mostly have to stick to the roads, though; it doesn't matter if it's a tank from the late 1930s or a massive supply truck today — the same problems that existed during World War II persist.\n\nEven modern armored vehicles would be heavily influenced by the harsh terrain, forcing large formations and their logistics onto limited maneuver corridors. A single Russian tank, for instance, might be able to get creative and drive through the heavy snow, but this becomes less reliable at scale.\n\nGiven those constraints, Finland's thinking is not about replicating 1939 but rather forcing an attacker into predictable corridors, attriting supplies, breaking force cohesion, and straining logistics to weaken an adversary. That would be backed by modern combat capabilities, such as aircraft and significant artillery, as well as allied assets.\n\nThe effectiveness of these tactics has been seen in modern warfighting.\n\nIn Ukraine, large Russian formations have struggled when constrained to limited road networks, particularly when logistics faltered, and the Ukrainians were able to disrupt supply routes. The comparison with the Winter War isn't exact, but it underscores how terrain and sustainment still shape how armies move.",

    "title": "Whimsy is the word of the moment. So, I added more of it to my life. Here's what happened.",
    "description": "Whimsy has become popular on social media as a mindset for enjoying life. I found that focusing on whimsy helped me think more about others.",
    "fullText": "I didn't exactly start 2026 off on a high note. As the New Year rolled in, I was recovering from the flu, sniffling as fireworks exploded across the city. I spent the next few weeks trying to get over a lingering cough while incessantly checking my phone for news updates; dread pooled in my stomach with each new headline.\n\nI'm also approaching the 10th anniversary of my mom's death. Coupled with the fact that my grandmother passed just a few months ago, my grief is particularly heavy this winter. At times, the days feel like a slow march toward my least favorite one of the year.\n\nClearly, something had to give.\n\nI knew I couldn't make my grief disappear or singlehandedly stop bad things from happening in the world, but I wanted to feel a little lighter if I could.\n\nConveniently, my winter blues peaked just as my social media algorithms started pushing the latest trend guaranteed to fix my life. My apps were flooded with posts about whimsy. It's the latest following the clean girl aesthetic, cottagecore, and maximalism trends, which weren't magic fixes for me.\n\nI saw get-ready-with-me videos of people dressing in bright colors, and TikTok creators adding playful touches to their homes. I paused to read Instagram tips on how to incorporate more whimsy into my own life.\n\nAdmittedly, I even Googled: \"What does being whimsical mean?\" It seemed to come down to bringing levity to life when you can.\n\nIt also turned out I wasn't the only person looking into whimsy at the start of 2026. Google Trends data shows that interest in whimsy online increased steadily between 2025 and 2026, more than in prior years. There are nearly 2 million posts under #whimsical on Instagram, and several TikTok videos about creating a whimsical 2026 have nearly 1 million views.\n\nThe more I learned, the more intrigued I became. Sure, at first glance, whimsy seems to be about hosting Instagram-worthy dinner parties or swapping your plain tote for a hot-pink one, but I was drawn to the posts that talked about infusing life with childlike joy and centering community.\n\nSo, I decided to spend a few weeks embracing whimsy in my everyday life. I thought it might be fun, but I wasn't prepared for how it made me feel less alone.\n\nAs I scrolled through countless social media videos about whimsy — some featuring women adding pink accents to their homes, others with people curating elaborate dinner party menus — I felt a little lost about where to start. I decided my best bet was to turn to experts to nail down what whimsy entails before proceeding with my experiment.\n\nJenna O'Brien, the 27-year-old designer behind the Substack Feeling Magazine, has written at length about whimsy. She has also worked as both a middle school teacher and the owner of a stationery store, which means she spent her days either painstakingly designing playful paper products or bringing smiles to the lives of 12-year-olds. She pretty much nailed the mental image I had of a whimsical person.\n\n\"Whimsy is what happens when you're on the pursuit of joy,\" O'Brien told me. \"To me, whimsy is getting back into touch with the things you were excited about when you were a kid.\"\n\nO'Brien said whimsy has resonated with her since she read \"Love Does\" by Bob Goff, a memoir about Goff's quest to live life with love at the center, as a high school student in 2015, but when the pandemic hit in 2020, she came to see it as \"essential\" to the human experience.\n\n\"People walking through grief or loss, you still need moments where you delight in a meal that's your favorite thing to eat,\" O'Brien said. \"You have to come up for air, even if things are really awful.\"\n\nI also chatted with Angelina Draper, the cofounder of Morning People Matcha and a creator who makes whimsical content, who echoed O'Brien's sentiments.\n\n\"It has a lot to do with not taking life so seriously and yourself so seriously, and being more playful, more creative, sort of tapping into childlike energy,\" Draper, 28, said of whimsy.\n\nDraper started thinking more consciously about whimsy when she created the podcast \"On A Whim\" in 2023, telling me the name was inspired by how she lived her daily life. It resonated even more for her in 2025 as she tried to maintain her authenticity while making content.\n\n\"With the age that we live in, with so much stuff online, and people doomscrolling and the hustle culture, it's super easy to get wrapped up in that,\" she said. \"Sometimes, we forget that life is supposed to be fun.\"\n\nAs we talked about how whimsy can brighten the shadowed nooks and crannies of a mundane life, Draper suggested emulating things that brought me joy as a kid. O'Brien encouraged me to think about how I could approach my days more intentionally, especially when it came to the people around me.\n\nO'Brien told me she once found a photo of herself at about 6 years old, blowing out candles on a cake with the letters \"LT\" on it. When she asked her mom about it, she was met with a burst of laughter. Her mom had told O'Brien's grandmother that she was on the cusp of losing her first baby tooth, so she came over with a homemade \"loose tooth pound cake\" in hand to celebrate her granddaughter's almost-milestone.\n\n\"It's so silly, but I also aspire to be that kind of person for the people in my life,\" O'Brien said as she recounted the story. \"That's what whimsy is. I'm going to take time to do the extra thing because I know it will delight other people.\"\n\nI want to be that kind of person too, I thought to myself.\n\nMy mom isn't here to sprinkle fairy dust over my life anymore, but that didn't mean it had to be gone completely. I was suddenly desperate to see if I could create that magic myself — and for the people I love.\n\nTo start making life more whimsical, I first took a trip to my local gift store, where I carefully selected a white, spiral-bound journal covered in a bright-green pattern of baguettes, wine glasses, and veggies, the perfect vessel for documenting my whimsical game plan. I broke the plan down into two bulleted lists: one of daily activities and another of activities I could do once a week or once a month.\n\nNow, if you're thinking at this point that lists aren't very whimsical, know these were written with fancy gel pens. Plus, one of my favorite activities as a kid was fine-tuning my handwriting in playful colors, so it was a win-win.\n\nI filled up over a page with ideas for whimsifying my life, as well as some skills I'd like to learn and manifestations for the year ahead, in a rainbow pattern of ink.\n\nThen, it was time to get to work.\n\nI created mood-based playlists I could listen to around the house (an O'Brien suggestion I eagerly took). My favorite might be \"Serious Girl Working Montage,\" full of songs that help me focus. It has a photo of Elle Woods and her iconic orange laptop as the cover.\n\nI lit candles daily, read on my lunch break instead of playing on my phone, and swapped the toothpaste-stained sweatshirt and fraying tank top I usually wear to bed for a heart-patterned pajama set with ruffled hems a few nights a week. I also tried to reach for a coloring book or read an informative article when I got the itch to doomscroll.\n\nSince 2020, I've mostly read on my Kindle, but hours spent exploring the library were a highlight of my childhood. I took a trip to my local branch in search of some whimsy and felt a sense of calm wash over me as I walked into the hushed, sunny space. I took my time perusing the shelves, flipping open covers, and running my fingers over spines before I picked a book to check out — one that ended up moving me more than anything else I had read in months.\n\nLooking back, my favorite whimsical activities were those that connected me with others. I wrote handwritten notes to mail to loved ones on floral-patterned and striped cards I picked out just for them, grinning while I drew whales, dogs, and elephants for my young nieces and nephews.\n\nWhen I invited a friend over for a movie night, I got ingredients for Shirley Temples and served them in the high-end glassware from my wedding registry rather than just offering her canned soda. I also made physical vision boards with another pal, and we spent the night in deep conversation as we cut images and words out of magazines, sealing our hopes for the future to canvas with Modge Podge and optimistic grins.\n\nI tried to connect with strangers as well, making a point of taking my headphones out in stores so I could speak to people instead of just getting in and out. I spent a Friday morning working at a new coffee shop in my neighborhood that had big windows and faux flowers on each table. I made light conversation with the staff and people-watched between bites of a crumbling honey butter scone and sips of a steaming vanilla latte. I felt more rooted in my community than I had in a while.\n\nAnd although I'm with my husband constantly, I went out of my way to add some whimsy to our moments together as part of the experiment. One evening, we laughed over drinks as we played Yahtzee! for an old-fashioned game night. Another day, we weaved between tourists around the Museum of Modern Art, holding hands as we studied paintings. I left him love notes around our apartment on dog-shaped sticky notes, a habit from early in our relationship I'd fallen out of as life got busy. It made my day when he told me he loved them.\n\nIncorporating whimsy into my life has been the breath of fresh air I didn't know I needed.\n\nIt didn't change everything; I still ache for my mom, and have bouts of despair when I read scary headlines. Still, prioritizing simple joys has offered a liferaft when the currents threatened to pull me under.\n\nMore importantly, I started thinking about myself less.\n\nWhen I checked out a book at the library, my brief interaction with my librarian and seeing other patrons absorbed in reading were the best parts of the experience.\n\nAs I wrote letters to loved ones, some of the weight on my shoulders lifted. After three hours of vision-boarding and focusing on my friend's hopes for the year, I realized I hadn't looked at my phone once. Bringing a smile to my husband's face with a note or a cup of coffee in bed warmed my heart.\n\nSitting at a café with a perfectly toasted sandwich in front of me and my mom's favorite song playing through the speakers, I realized O'Brien was right — sometimes, you just need little moments of delight.",

    "fullText": "A custom suit is the signature look on Wall Street, and it's New York's tailors who keep the city's bankers, stockbrokers, and lawyers looking sharp.\n\nSome of these businesses have been city fixtures for decades, while others are newer arrivals that have quickly built reputations in the finance world.\n\nHere's a look behind the scenes at three of the tailor shops that serve Wall Street, and who owns them.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Alan Flusser's shop near East 48th Street and Fifth Avenue has been a fixture for Wall Street clients. Flusser designed the wardrobes of the iconic movies \"Wall Street\" and \"American Psycho.\"\n\nWhen Flusser retired in 2020, Sigmon, who had previously worked for Suitsupply, took the reins.\n\nHe described the house style to Business Insider as relaxed and \"guided by proper proportions meant to flatter the individual\" rather than trends.\n\nLS Mens Clothing on West 45th Street and Sixth Avenue is a family business that first opened in 1954.\n\n\"I've been doing this for 42 years,\" Zuber told Business Insider.\n\nIn his decades-long career, he's observed some notable shifts in styles.\n\n\"People are dressing thinner,\" he said. \"They're dressing thinner in the arms — even the conservative people, the business people.\"\n\nBefore opening Michael Andrews Bespoke, Andrews trained as an engineer and later worked as a corporate attorney. Required to wear a suit daily, he said he struggled to find off-the-rack options that met his standards.\n\nHe started having custom suits made, and went on to study tailoring.\n\nHe launched the business in 2006, and the flagship is store on Great Jones Alley in NoHo, between Broadway and Lafayette. The newer store is on West 20th Street, between Sixth and Seventh avenues.\n\nIt also has locations in Washington. D.C., Miami, and soon London.\n\n\"The vast majority of our clients are either investment bankers, finance guys, private equity, your typical New York finance guy, or lawyers who, to a large degree, service the financial industry,\" Andrews told Business Insider.\n\nIn 2024, Michael Andrews Bespoke employed three new full-time and two part-time tailors.\n\nRising demand for alterations led the business to hire a further two staff members in NYC the following year, bringing the total to four full-time and three part-time tailors in 2025.\n\n\"We've had dozens of clients bring back entire wardrobes,\" Andrews told Business Insider. \"For a couple of clients, it's 20 to 40 pieces that we've had to take in because they've lost 20 to 30 pounds.\"\n\nSigmon and Zuber also told Business Insider that demand for alterations, mostly take-ins, is growing as Wall Street clients' waistlines shrink.\n\nAs Andrews put it, \"the Ozempic effect is real.\"\n\nRead more about how GLP-1s are reshaping Wall Street.",

It's the new reality where engineers don't have to write code, but instead review and fix it at a rate that some feel is unsustainable.\n\nIn a viral essay published this week, Siddhant Khare, a software engineer, said AI is only making his job harder.\n\n\"Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending, you just keep stamping those PRs,\" he wrote, referring to pull requests, which are threads for developers to discuss changes before making them.\n\nDuring Spotify's earnings call, Söderström, like many CEOs, however, was mostly just focused on the efficiency of it all.\n\n\"That's the opportunity we see in front of us,\" he said. \"Companies such as us are simply going to produce massively more software, up until our limiting factor is actually the amount of change that consumers are comfortable with.\"",

    "fullText": "Where in New New York City can you see cowboys in snakeskin boots rubbing elbows with Patagonia hedge-fund vest bros?\n\nThe answer is Bitcoin Investors Week in NYC, the multi-day bitcoin bonanza hosted by tech entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano. This year's event kicked off in the depths of a bitcoin bear market, but the exuberance—irrational or otherwise—was on full display throughout the halls.\n\nAn abundance of bitcoin-orange ties and a jubilant mood were the vibes of the whole event.\n\nChris Klein, COO of crypto retirement platform Bitcoin IRA, insisted that the crypto community isn't worried about the current market downturn.\n\n\"Every eighteen months we go through something like this, so if anybody's been in this space long enough, this is the third or fourth time they've been through this,\" he said. \n\nSam Callahan, director of bitcoin strategy and research at digital asset treasury OranjeBTC, echoed the sentiment, saying that seasoned crypto investors remember bear markets much worse than the current decline.\n\nThe bitcoin bear market has dragged on for about four months now, with prices down as much as 50% from the peak earlier this month. They've recovered slightly but are stuck around $70,000, with no clear catalyst on the horizon. Still, for retail and institutional investors, the deep freeze doesn't appear to be souring the mood.\n\nMike Novogratz, CEO of digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital, revealed that he's been buying more bitcoin recently in anticipation of shifting macro conditions and policy updates.\n\nCathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, continued to describe bitcoin as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, adding that she thinks blockchain technology is poised to play a role in the next phase of the tech boom.\n\nAnd Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's loudest tech bulls, said that he doesn't think anyone can be bullish on tech without being bullish on bitcoin, predicting there will be more use cases for it in the near future.\n\nThe attendees who spoke with Business Insider on the sidelines of the event were equally bullish, donning bitcoin pins on blazer lapels and sporting orange ties in tribute to bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor.\n\n\"These conferences during market drawdowns are refreshing,\" Klint Drici, head of institutional sales at Arch Lending, a crypto-backed loan platform, said. \"They showcase the real builders and operators.\"\n\nIndeed, there were almost as many bitcoin entrepreneurs as investors at the event, boasting about projects they had in the works even as crypto winter deepened.\n\nEran Barak, founder of blockchain consulting firm Breem Group, said that he thinks the macro landscape is shifting in a direction that favors bitcoin, citing regulatory developments on the horizon.\n\n\"As the CLARITY Act moves closer to approval and Fed rate cuts are increasingly expected, funds and enterprises are viewing Bitcoin as a treasury diversification tool—boosting its perceived value as fresh liquidity flows into the market,\" he stated.\n\nMany of the crypto pros at the event didn't quite agree on when bitcoin might rebound, but all maintained that it should stage a comeback this year. Real estate entrepreneur and investor Grant Cardone, who spoke about his bitcoin investing strategy, told Business Insider that he thinks it could move horizontally in the short term before gaining fresh momentum.\n\n\"I think it could go sideways til the Fall or late Summer,\" he said. \"It could touch $40,000, could touch $38,000 and still hit $180,000 before the end of the year.\"",

    "title": "Uber drivers say they've been getting 2 different prices for the same trip. The company said it was a glitch.",
    "description": "Uber said a glitch led its app to send some drivers using its Trip Radar feature lower payout offers for gigs they had already accepted.",
    "fullText": "Uber said a bug caused its app to drive down payouts to ride-hailing drivers on some trips.\n\nThe fare discrepancies happened on Trip Radar, a feature that Uber introduced four years ago that offers a gig to multiple drivers at once, often as they're finishing up another ride. Since they're competing with other drivers to claim the trip, it's common for drivers to accept a ride but not get it because someone else accepted it sooner.\n\nIn the last month or so, three drivers told Business Insider they have started getting a follow-up offer: the same trip with the same route they previously accepted, but at a lower rate.\n\nOn X, a driver posted screenshots from one such trip. Uber initially offered the driver $12.53 for a ride of just under six miles — then the offer fell to $11.60 on the second offer.\n\nHere we go again. Since the rideshare apps won’t provide an explanation for this ongoing algorithmic wage and labor exploitation of gig workers — and refuse to stop — maybe it’s time to bring these things to the attention of the Massachusetts AG’s office? pic.twitter.com/lkSO09FLv3\n\nAnother offer that the driver posted last week shows a payout of $11.45 for a 5.5-mile trip. After the driver accepted the trip, the app showed it was no longer available, then offered him the same trip for $8.84.\n\nOn February 7, Uber Chief Product Officer Sachin Kansal replied to the driver's post, saying that it wasn't \"a fair or acceptable experience.\"\n\n\"It's not deliberate — we identified a bug causing some fare discrepancies, e.g., when a rider cancels and then quickly re-requests the same trip,\" Kansal wrote.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson confirmed the details in Kansal's post. \"We've already begun rolling out fixes that prevent almost-identical trips like this from being re-priced for the same driver,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're also continuing to monitor fare offers closely.\"\n\nWhile the difference between offers might be a dollar or two, gig workers said the gap can add up, especially given that many have seen their pay decrease in recent years.\n\nOne Uber driver in Massachusetts said he started receiving duplicative offers over the past month and accepted some, though the payout was lower and the map showed it was the same route.\n\nThe double offers didn't happen on every trip, he said, but none offered to pay him more the second time.\n\n\"I'd hit 'match,' and then it would say that the trip was taken,\" the driver said. \"Shortly thereafter, I'd get an exclusive offer with a lower price for the same trip.\"\n\nSergio Avedian, an Uber driver and senior contributor to the gig-driver-advocacy blog and YouTube channel The Rideshare Guy, said that Uber often serves drivers offers through Trip Radar as they are finishing up a ride. The app gives drivers 10 seconds to accept the trip or lose it, meaning drivers don't always have time to evaluate the offer, he said.\n\nKansal's response on X represents a rare instance in which Uber's C-suite publicly acknowledged a problem to a driver, Avedian said, adding that the user tagged some government agencies in one of his posts.\n\nThe executive's reply suggests Uber is taking the issue seriously.\n\nAfter all, Avedian said, even if the bug affected a small portion of the millions of rides completed each day on Uber, it could equal big money.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Don't throw out your sweatpants. Remote work could grow as younger CEOs take over.",
    "description": "A new study suggests that remote work could grow as leaders who rose through five-day-a-week office cultures give way to a younger generation.",
    "fullText": "Don't write off remote work just yet.\n\nEven as companies like Amazon, AT&T, and JPMorgan mandate five-day office returns, work-from-home setups are poised to grow, a new study released by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests.\n\nThe findings show that people work remotely more often when employed at firms founded after 2015 than at those founded before 1990 — and at firms led by CEOs under 30.\n\nThis means future generations of workers could have greater flexibility, said Jose Maria Barrero, one of the researchers behind the study. Leading remote work expert Nick Bloom was also involved.\n\n\"As older companies die and new companies start up, and as older senior executives start retiring and they get replaced by younger ones, that should make more of the labor force be in these remote work-friendly firms,\" said Barrero, who is a finance professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.\n\nAnother takeaway from the study applies to the present: The younger the company and the younger the CEO, the better an employee's chances of working in sweatpants.\n\n\"If it's very important for you to have this sort of flexibility, you are more likely to get that if you look for jobs at young firms with young CEOs,\" said Barrero. The same goes for jobs at established firms with young CEOs, though it's more common for young firms to have young CEOs than for established firms, he added.\n\nThe study that Barrero co-authored is based on monthly surveys of 8,000 US residents ages 20-64 taken throughout 2025.\n\nIt finds that startups less than a decade old are more likely to allow hybrid or fully remote work, in part because the technology required to support such arrangements was readily available when they were founded. Many companies that launched around 2020 also began operating remotely out of necessity due to the pandemic.\n\n\"Their organizational culture, the way they interact, the way they set up their workflows, is going to be suited to a much more work-from-home-friendly world,\" said Barrero.\n\nOlder firms, by contrast, often face higher costs when changing long-standing routines.\n\n\"Imagine a conglomerate that has been around for decades, with people going to the office five days a week,\" said Barrero. \"Their organizational culture is built around being in the office physically together.\"\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Georgia Oliver, cofounder and CEO of the all-remote marketing firm Paper Planes, used to have a three-hour daily commute while working in corporate strategy at Amazon in New York.\n\n\"I resented it,\" she said. \"I ended up doing less work than I would at home.\"\n\nNow viewing the matter from an employer's perspective, Oliver told Business Insider that in-office mandates limit hiring options and opportunities to serve clients in a range of markets. Paper Plane's 12-person staff is spread across the US, Europe, and Asia.\n\n\"We measure contribution through delivery and results, not hours at a desk,\" said Oliver.\n\nOf course, not all older CEOs are opposed to remote work. Young company leaders may be more inclined to embrace it, since they've logged fewer years in office-first environments, said Barrero.\n\nMax Albert, a 29-year-old founder and CEO of an all-remote startup, can relate. Before launching Adrenaline Interactive, an ad tech company, in 2024, he briefly worked in an office from 9-to-5 as a software engineer for Ford Motor. Then the pandemic set in. He's been remote — and on a flexible schedule — ever since.\n\n\"It's just what I'm used to,\" he told Business Insider. \"I have trouble sitting at a desk for eight hours straight.\"\n\nAlbert said he does see value in teams spending time together to build camaraderie. That's why he and his six employees — who live in Texas, Illinois, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and Michigan — get together once a quarter for a company retreat, mixing work and entertainment.\n\n\"It feels like an adventure,\" said Albert, adding that he doesn't have a permanent address and lives out of Airbnb rentals.\n\nCompanies' and CEOs' ages aren't the only factors shaping employers' likelihood of supporting remote work, the study released by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows. Jobs that can be done entirely online — common in professional services, finance, and tech — are also more likely to be remote, Barrero said.\n\nThere are exceptions. Some employers require everyone on-site, even when only certain roles require a physical presence. Barrero said they likely do this to avoid perceptions of special treatment.\n\nOverall, though, the data collected from the study shows age is a significant factor. Employees work from home at younger firms almost twice as often as at established firms.\n\n\"Recent data collected by the same group of researchers showed work-from-home rates were only declining very gradually between 2023 and 2025,\" said Barrero. \"This new study suggests that in five or 10 years, they may start to rise again.\"",

    "title": "Russia's war in Ukraine has made its formidable air defenses an even tougher challenge for NATO, airpower analyst warns",
    "description": "Russia still has many air defenses, and experience it gained against Ukraine actually makes them a bigger threat to NATO aircraft than before 2022.",
    "fullText": "Russia's air defenses may pose a more significant threat to NATO air forces than they would have before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a top air defense analyst warned in a recent report.\n\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has been able to destroy numerous Russian air defense systems.\n\nJustin Bronk, an air power expert at the UK's Royal United Services Institute, warned that not only does Russia still maintain a large arsenal, but it is also still producing its most powerful systems. And its ability to use these weapons has improved through combat experience.\n\nSystems have been upgraded, crews have more experience, and Russia has become better at coordinating their use with surveillance aircraft to accurately extend their reach.\n\nRussia's surface-to-air missile systems, Bronk wrote, \"not only remain numerous, but are also likely to perform better against NATO aircraft and munitions in a hypothetical direct conflict than they would have before 2022.\"\n\nFacing this challenge, NATO could struggle to sweep aside Russian air defenses in a European war to achieve air superiority — a cornerstone of Western airpower doctrine.\n\nHe told Business Insider in an interview about the report that Russia's forces are \"much more experienced\" and have \"learned quite a lot through trial and experimentation.\"\n\nA strictly air-to-air clash pitting Russian air forces against NATO aircraft likely wouldn't go well for Moscow, Bronk predicted, but a war wouldn't only take place in the air.\n\nBefore Western jets could operate freely, European air forces would likely need to suppress or destroy Russia's dense network of ground-based air defenses. Their volume and improved coordination could pose a serious challenge.\n\nUkraine has been able to achieve a \"steady drumbeat\" of strikes against Russian defense systems with weaponry like drones, artillery, and missiles, Bronk said, but there are still \"several hundred batteries\" in service, with more modern variants continuing to roll off production lines.\n\nBronk's analysis is based on interviews with Western air forces and ministries, data from Ukraine's armed forces, and open-source information.\n\nHe said his findings indicate that Russia's array of ground-based integrated air defence systems \"remains a highly potent threat to NATO air capabilities in a European context.\"\n\nThe sheer volume is a problem for NATO in Europe. \"The primary threat to NATO air power\" is Russia's extensive ground-based surface-to-missile coverage, he said.\n\nNATO notably doesn't have a similar arsenal.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has underscored how decisive ground-based air defenses can be. Russia began the war with the largest such arsenal in Europe, followed by Ukraine, and that scale has helped prevent either side from establishing air superiority.\n\nNATO has committed to increasing its arsenal of ground-based air defenses in response, with alliance defense spending soaring, but it's not a problem that can be quickly solved.\n\nBoth Russia's combat aircraft crews and surface-to-air missile system operators are \"significantly more combat-experienced and more capable overall than they were prior to the start of the full-scale invasion,\" Bronk said.\n\nThe increase in operator experience alongside hardware and software upgrades \"a least partially offsets\" some of the significant attrition that Russian SAM systems have suffered during the war against Ukraine.\n\nImprovements to the force include new tactics and procedures, software updates to improve the performance of radars, better resistance to electronic warfare, and bringing new pieces of hardware into service.\n\nNew hardware includes the S-350 Vityaz, a medium-range surface-to-air missile system that first entered service in 2020.\n\nRussia's forces are also getting better at working together, Bronk said.\n\nHe said that in a direct conflict with NATO forces in Europe, the threat to NATO aircraft \"would be far better coordinated today than they were prior to 2022.\"\n\nUkraine has reported that since mid-2023, Russia's long-range surface-to-air missiles have more frequently coordinated engagements with fighter jets near the front lines and A-50U airborne early warning and control aircraft, allowing them to fire at Ukrainian aircraft \"at ranges that the surface-to-air systems could not have been able to directly observe by themselves.\"\n\nRussia could use similar strategies in a conflict with NATO, \"to engage Western aircraft flying at low altitudes at longer ranges,\" Bronk said.\n\nIn Ukraine, he said, the probability of scoring a kill with one of these shots \"almost certainly remains low,\" as they require the missile seeker to find the target without mid-course guidance.\n\nBut the evolved tactic points to how much more skilled Russia's air force and air defense crews have become, compared to their less coordinated tactics in the early months of the war.\n\nAt the same time, NATO's air forces have \"access to significantly more detailed and accurate data on the strengths, weaknesses, tactics and technical characteristics of Russian SAM systems than they had before 2022,\" Bronk said. That can't be understated.\n\nThey understand the threat of Russia's ground-based air defenses better. And the weaponry and tactics to counter them do exist, Bronk said, \"albeit not in sufficient numbers in Europe yet.\"\n\nUltimately, Bronk said, \"Russian air defence capabilities have been boosted by combat lessons over almost four years of operations,\" and that could require more from NATO to break through in a fight.",

    "description": "The Lucid Gravity is fast, futuristic, and one of the most thrilling vehicles I've driven. But how does the SUV stack up to its steep competition?",
    "fullText": "If the Lucid Gravity were an Olympic figure skater, it would go for the quadruple axel — flashy, ambitious, and a little audacious.\n\nThe Gravity blends beauty with physical prowess: striking design, blistering speed, and enough battery range to get from New York to Boston and halfway back on a single charge.\n\nBeyond the showmanship, this SUV carries serious stakes for Lucid. It's the money-losing automaker's first SUV, giving the company a foothold in America's most popular vehicle segment.\n\nI tested the Gravity in New York City to see whether Lucid's big bet sticks the landing.\n\nMy verdict: It earns a spot on the podium. But a few technical wobbles keep it from taking gold.\n\nIn my career, I've test-driven 72 vehicles — from V8 muscle cars to new-wave EVs, including Lucid's only other model, the Air sedan.\n\nThe Gravity ranks among the five most fun-to-drive cars I've ever tested.\n\nIts 123-kWh battery launches the SUV from 0 to 60 mph in about three seconds — quicker than a Ferrari Portofino. Instant torque makes it feel ferocious off the line.\n\nSteering is tight and surprisingly nimble for a long three-row SUV. Thanks to its low-mounted battery pack, the Gravity stays planted through sharp corners, masking its weight well.\n\nNew York City's potholes are a brutal suspension test — and the Gravity passed, delivering just enough cushiness without drifting into numbness.\n\nThe \"squircle\"-shaped steering wheel — a square-circle hybrid — reinforces the athletic, easy-to-control vibe.\n\nWhile the SUV is a powerhouse, its design leans heavily into luxury.\n\nFrom the outside, it's long and dramatic, defined by width-spanning LED light bars and a cab-forward profile. From certain angles, it looks like a high-end minivan redesigned by a Silicon Valley startup.\n\nInside, nearly every surface feels premium from all seven seats. Open-pore wood, supple leather, and an expansive windshield that stretches overhead create an airy, lounge-like cabin. There are no obvious hard plastics.\n\nHeated seats are available in the first two rows, while front passengers can also opt for ventilation and five-mode massaging seats.\n\nThe dashboard is dominated by a sweeping curved display for gauges, maps, and media. A secondary center screen handles climate, seat controls, and deeper vehicle settings. Together, they reinforce the Gravity's futuristic, software-first identity.\n\nIts battery is also impressive. With nearly 400 miles of range, when plugged into a fast charger, the Gravity can add juice for 200 miles in just 15 minutes.\n\nTo get back to our Olympic metaphor: The Gravity is impressive — but it enters a brutally competitive three-row EV tournament.\n\nThe segment includes well-appointed heavy hitters like the Rivian R1S, Cadillac Escalade IQ, Hyundai Ioniq 9, and Kia EV9.\n\nThat makes small flaws harder to ignore.\n\nThe most frustrating issue I experienced was the key fob. From a few feet away, repeated clicks didn't always fully latch the doors. That's particularly annoying given that key proximity controls certain vehicle functions, like turning the vehicle's battery off.\n\nLucid told me it is aware of the issue and has pushed an over-the-air update to address it.\n\nIt's a fixable problem — but for buyers spending well into six figures, even small execution misses stand out.\n\nSome essential controls are also buried in screens. Adjusting the windshield wiper speed, for example, requires navigating a digital menu rather than using a traditional stalk.\n\nThen there's the eye-watering price tag: the Gravity starts around $80,000. The fully loaded Grand Touring model I tested — with upgraded materials, advanced driver assistance, and additional luxury features — stickered at roughly $124,000.\n\nThat's serious, serious money, especially when rivals undercut it by thousands while offering similarly refined packages.\n\nThe Lucid Gravity is one of the most thrilling SUVs I've ever driven.\n\nIt's beautiful, blisteringly fast, and packed with forward-looking tech. For buyers who want hair-raising acceleration wrapped in futuristic luxury — and who aren't price-sensitive — it's hard to beat.\n\nIf value matters more than spectacle, rivals like the Hyundai Ioniq 9 or Kia EV9 may make more sense. Meanwhile, the Rivian R1S offers a fun mix of optional features and family-friendly character.\n\nBut none of them were as fun to drive.",

    "description": "When Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in 2019, the DOJ seized more than 70 electronic devices. Last month, they put almost all of it on the internet.",
    "fullText": "On July 6, 2019, federal agents arrested Jeffrey Epstein aboard his private jet, which had just landed in New Jersey from a trip to Paris.\n\nAt the same time, another set of FBI agents raided his mansion in Manhattan. They took photos of everything, from a taxidermied tiger in the library, to framed pictures of Epstein with Donald Trump, Pope John Paul II, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman scattered across his desks.\n\nThe agents also seized more than 70 computers, iPads, and hard drives, as well as boxes of shredded paper and financial documents. They sawed open a metal safe and found even more hard drives, along with a binder of CDs, 48 loose diamonds, and a Saudi Arabian passport with his photo.\n\nSix weeks later, after Epstein killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, agents raided his US Virgin Islands estate, where they seized even more electronic devices and documents.\n\nOn January 30, the US Department of Justice put much of that material on the internet.\n\nIt created an immediate explosion of news. The public already knew that numerous powerful people in politics, business, and academia spent time with Epstein even after he had already registered as a sex offender, in 2008. The files demonstrated a vaster scope than previously known.\n\nEmails show Tesla CEO Elon Musk and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made plans to visit Epstein's island. Epstein exchanged crude emails with Virgin founder Richard Branson and other businessmen. The UK's ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, resigned from the Labour Party after the files revealed a photo of him in his underwear and emails showed him sharing government secrets with Epstein. Kathryn Ruemmler announced she would resign as the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs after emails showed years of warm — and at times intensely personal — emails between her and Epstein. The documents disclosed that prosecutors investigated sexual abuse allegations against Leon Black, a billionaire acquaintance of Epstein, but did not charge him. A financial document which had been kept secret since Epstein's death showed he asked his girlfriend to marry him and planned to give her $100 million and all of his properties.\n\nThe records also include a number of unsubstantiated tips sent to the FBI, which include unproven allegations about President Donald Trump.\n\nBefore the release, the public knew there was more to the Epstein story.\n\nA glimpse of the Epstein files was shown in the criminal trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, which I covered for Business Insider, in Manhattan federal court in 2021. Victims testified about how Epstein and Maxwell would name-drop Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew, showing them how many friends he had in high places.\n\nAfter the jury found Maxwell guilty of trafficking girls to Epstein for sex, I filed my story, and then got drinks with a few other journalists who covered the five-week trial, including Julie K. Brown, the Miami Herald journalist whose stories about Epstein's abuses led to his arrest.\n\nIt had been a grueling trial, filled with horrific testimony from women who had recounted the darkest moments of their lives. The trial took place in December, requiring journalists to show up at 4 a.m. in the 20-degree weather to get a seat in the courtroom.\n\nWe were happy for the trial to be over and for the jury to reach its verdict. But a question hung in the air. Was what we heard at the trial really all there was to say?\n\nQuestions about Epstein and his sex-trafficking operation continued to persist in the years following the trial. How did Epstein get so rich? Was there any truth to rumored connections to the CIA or the Mossad? Did Epstein traffic girls to some of his powerful friends, as some victims alleged? Did he really kill himself in prison, as authorities concluded, or was he assassinated to cover up an elite pedophile ring, as some theorized?\n\nCivil lawsuits generated new revelations. A judge in New York unsealed documents from a long-running case that Epstein's most outspoken victim, Virginia Giuffre, filed against Maxwell. Groups of victims sued big banks, accusing them of ignoring red flags about Epstein's finances. (Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan each settled class-action lawsuits with victims; similar lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon are pending.) JP Morgan and the US Virgin Islands government filed lawsuits in which each accused the other of facilitating Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. And a compensation program identified 150 victims.\n\nThe lawsuits delivered a steady drip of details: how Epstein trafficked girls and hushed them up with money, more names of people in his orbit, and the financial red flags waved before banks. A Justice Department inspector general report analyzing the circumstances of his death concluded that poor management at the federal jail created the conditions that allowed him to kill himself. Another Justice Department report criticized Alexander Acosta, the prosecutor who gave Epstein a plea deal in 2007 on light charges, for \"poor judgment,\" but found nothing that substantiated a vast conspiracy. (The latest file release includes a copy of the robust indictment prosecutors had initially drafted, with 19 victims.)\n\nAs theories about Epstein continued to swirl online, the Justice Department refused requests by journalists and Epstein's victims to make the files public.\n\nThe issue was potentially awkward for Trump. Epstein was affiliated with prominent Democrats, including Clinton, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, and diplomat Bill Burns. But Trump and Epstein had been friends in the 1980s and 1990s, both spending time together in the Manhattan and Palm Beach social circuits. Epstein also forged close ties with Steve Bannon, Trump's former White House advisor, in the months before his arrest on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nShortly after Trump won the presidential election, Giuffre — who was a teenager when Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago, where she worked, and brought her to Epstein for sex — urged him to release the files.\n\n\"We need someone who despises these sick people with the power to help make it easier to hold these monsters accountable, no matter how much $$ they have,\" she wrote on X. \"God bless you and Thank you for caring!\"\n\nWhen Trump took office in January 2025, the job of releasing the Epstein files fell to his attorney general, Pamela Bondi.\n\nFor months, Bondi promised but failed to provide any substantial new information about Epstein. Then, in July, the Justice Department and FBI abruptly announced they would not release any more Epstein files after all. On Truth Social, responding to backlash from his supporters, Trump praised Bondi, called the Epstein files a \"hoax,\" and urged his supporters to \"not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\"\n\nTodd Blanche, the No. 2 official in the Justice Department, and Trump's former personal lawyer, traveled to Florida to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, for reasons that remain unclear. Then she was mysteriously transferred to a nicer, lower-security prison also for reasons that remain unclear.\n\nTrump's and the Justice Department's perplexing handling of Epstein brought fresh attention to the story. I spoke to four people who had access to the Justice Department's files, and who said there was no trace of intelligence material, which would have been the case if Epstein or Maxwell's crimes were tied to the CIA or Mossad. The New York Times produced deep investigations into Epstein's ties to JPMorgan and how he accumulated his wealth by exploiting his network and his complicated relationships with his two main patrons, Black and fellow billionaire Les Wexner. The Wall Street Journal found a copy of a 2003 book of birthday well-wishes, prepared by Ghislaine Maxwell, which included an apparent letter from Trump.\n\nThese developments together created the perfect storm and prompted Congress to take ook action.\n\nIn August, the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Justice Department for its Epstein-related records. It also issued subpoenas throughout the year to Epstein's estate, former Justice Department officials, Clinton, and banks where Epstein had accounts.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on the committee released tranches of various \"Epstein files,\" most of which came from his estate. It put out a copy of the \"birthday book.\" prepared for his 50th birthday. A letter attributed to Trump is accompanied by a crude illustration of a female body, calls Epstein a \"pal,\" and says that \"enigmas never age.\" Trump is suing The Wall Street Journal over a story it published earlier about the letter, which his lawyers maintain is a fabrication.\n\nThe most potent revelations came from tens of thousands of emails, text messages, and other files from Epstein's estate. Some of those emails included cryptic references to Trump. In one email to Maxwell, Epstein called Trump \"the dog that hasn't barked.\" In another, Epstein told writer Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls.\"\n\nLarry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president, was removed or resigned from various positions after it was revealed that he sought the Epstein's advice for pursuing an extramarital affair. Prince Andrew stayed in touch with the pedophile long after he previously said they cut ties. The House Oversight Committee also released numerous photos of Epstein hanging out with Branson, Bannon, Noam Chomsky, Woody Allen, and other powerful and influential people.\n\nThe flood of revelations now pale in comparison to what we've learned from the files in the Justice Department's possession. At the time, they raised the question: Why was the Justice Department resisting calls to release the files?\n\nPublic pressure — including from Epstein's victims, who wanted more transparency from the government — led to a flood of support for the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The law required the Justice Department to do what it had initially promised: release all of its Epstein files. It allowed minimal redactions to protect the privacy of victims and gave a 30-day deadline. In November, both houses of Congress passed the bill. Trump — seeing any veto would be overridden — signed it into law.\n\nWhen the December 19 deadline arrived, the Justice Department published several hundred thousand documents. There were a lot of photos of Clinton, including one of him in a pool with Maxwell, and more photos of Epstein's home and his friends. Emails between prosecutors provided insight into how they built the cases against Epstein and Maxwell, although many of them were redacted. There was very little information about Trump.\n\nIn court filings several days later, the Justice Department revealed that it still had to review several million Epstein-related documents. It had blown past its 30-day deadline.\n\nOn January 30, Blanche announced that the Justice Department would keep its promise and release whatever Epstein files it could — millions more pages.\n\nHe said the department would withhold another 200,000 documents, asserting legal \"privilege,\" even though the law doesn't allow for that.\n\nThe redactions in the files are inconsistent and baffling. Victims' names, which were supposed to be kept secret, have been exposed. In one photo, Melania Trump's face is blacked out, even though the photo — of her, Epstein, Maxwell, and the president — had widely circulated for years.\n\nThere are other odd omissions. The Epstein files have surprisingly few financial records. An interview with Kristin Roman, the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on Epstein's body, is missing. There's an incomplete record of prosecutors deciding which of his acquaintances they would face criminal charges.\n\nMembers of Congress who have been permitted to view the unredacted files have pushed the Justice Department to make more documents public. The House Oversight Committee is scheduling interviews with people who might know more about Epstein's activities.\n\nThe fight for the Epstein files isn't over yet.",

    "description": "A federal judge is expected to rule in February 2026 on whether the construction can continue.",
    "fullText": "The construction of U.S. President Donald Trump’s White House ballroom was halted by a federal judge in mid-February 2026.\n\nAs of this writing, a federal judge has yet to rule on the legal status of the construction project. In a social media post, Trump stated that the project is moving \"ahead of schedule,\" while a White House spokesperson told us that the project is still in the \"demolition phase.\"\n\nA social media rumor that emerged around Feb. 10, 2026, claimed a federal judge had halted U.S. President Donald Trump's White House ballroom construction project.\n\nTrump began the demolition of the White House's East Wing in October 2025 in order to replace it with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. In December 2025, the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation sued the administration, arguing the project began without necessary approvals or congressional authority.\n\nIn mid-February 2026, numerous readers asked us to confirm whether a federal judge had halted construction on the ballroom. A Feb. 10 Facebook post stated:\n\nTrump's infamous new White House ballroom and bunker has been scrapped by a federal judge and the national trust preservation committee. It was also discovered the $400 million in ballroom donor money has either disappeared or simply never existed. 🤔\n\nThe image of the White House (below) shows the former site of the East Wing, built in 1902 and renovated in 1942, completely demolished with several bulldozers and skip loaders clearing the last of the rubble.\n\nGSA has to now hire a construction company to fill the east wing (trump improperly had demolished) with dirt and sod. The Judge and committee have also ruled trump \"cannot as much as paint a wall in the white house without a permit and committee approval\".\n\nAs of this writing, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, the judge overseeing the case, had yet to issue a decision on the status of the ballroom construction project. We reached out to the White House; a spokesperson told us the ballroom was not yet being constructed and the project was still in the \"demolition stage.\"\n\nWe therefore rate the claim that a judge has halted the construction as false. We will update the story when the court releases a decision.\n\nThe National Trust argued that the project proceeded without receiving authorization from Congress and with inadequate environmental assessments.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, Leon denied the National Trust's motion for a temporary restraining order on the project and temporarily allowed work to continue. The judge's order noted that because the ballroom plans had not been finalized, there was no \"imminent risk of irreparable aesthetic harm.\"\n\nAccording to arguments filed by the Trump administration in January 2026, previous presidents did not require congressional approval to carry out construction or renovations on White House grounds. The government also said above-ground construction would not begin until April 2026.\n\nIn late January 2026, Leon expressed skepticism that the administration had the legal authority to tear down the East Wing and proceed with construction. However, he said he would make a decision in the coming weeks, likely in February 2026, on whether or not to allow a preliminary injunction, which would stop the construction work for the duration of the case.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's reporting, Leon predicted the issue would also be appealed to a federal appeals court and possibly the Supreme Court. According to court records viewed on Feb. 12, Leon had not issued such an injunction.\n\nThe White House didn't specify how much money it had raised and who the private donors were, directing us to Trump's most recent statement instead. On Feb. 10, 2026, Trump posted on TruthSocial that the construction project \"is on budget, and ahead of schedule.\" He also shared digital renderings of what the potential ballroom would look like.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Trump posted that the project was privately funded and would cost $300 million to $400 million dollars:\n\nI'm building, on top of everything else that I am doing, one of the greatest and most beautiful Ballrooms anywhere in the World, with more than 300 Million Dollars of Great American Patriots' money, and working closely with, right from the beginning, the United States Military and Secret Service. This is a GIFT (ZERO taxpayer funding!) to the United States of America, of 300 to 400 Million Dollars (depending on the scope and quality of interior finishes!), for a desperately needed space [...]\n\nIn November 2025, the White House released a list of donors for the ballroom project, which included charitable organizations, sports team owners, tech companies, media companies and billionaires. The Associated Press reported an additional corporation as well as an artificial intelligence chipmaker that also donated to the project. The administration did not reveal how much each donor contributed.\n\nSnopes has covered numerous claims on the East Wing demolition and Trump's plans for a White House ballroom.\n\n\"A Crane Used in the Ballroom Construction Hovers above The White...\" Getty Images, 10 Feb. 2026, https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/crane-used-in-the-ballroom-construction-hovers-above-the-news-photo/2260298495.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump dropped a new riff on his election lies by telling troops that he won the popular vote in 2016 “by a lot” — thereby inventing millions of votes he did not win.\n\nTrump has spent years falsely claiming that the 2020 election was “rigged” against him and/or “stolen” from him, despite the fact that Biden defeated Trump in an electoral landslide that has been reaffirmed over and over by state officials from Trump’s own party and dozens of court decisions.\n\nBut he won the 2016 election despite losing the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.\n\nThe president departed the White House Friday afternoon en route to Fort Bragg ahead of a long weekend at his Mar-a-lago resort. In Texas, he gave a speech to military families that included many familiar touches — and one new one.\n\nDuring an introduction, Trump flatly declared that he won the popular vote “by a lot” — and without the qualifiers he has used in the past:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And he was responsible, along with Laura Trump. Laura is fantastic. Born here and loves the area, but they work together.\n\nBut Michael Watley, if he’s here, I don’t know. Michael, Michael. Michael, will you come here for a second, please? He’s running for the Senate. And if he gets in, you’re going to be taken care of.\n\nIf he doesn’t get in, we’re going to be stripping the military like they always do, the Democrats. This is a man who was the head of North Carolina. And so he did so well that I said. Who was that guy that did so well?\n\nBecause when it came time to picking the head of the Republican Party, I picked him. And you saw what happened in the last election. We won at a landslide. We won every swing state, all seven swing states.\n\nWe won by millions of votes, the popular vote.\n\nYou know, the first time I won, but they say I didn’t win the popular vote, you know I did. I won it by a lot, but they said I didn’t.\n\nSo every time they’d introduce “Donald Trump, who didn’t won the popular vote,” but he, you know, whatever.\n\nThis — I was always — I said, I don’t ever want that to happen again. But we did. We won everything.\n\nAnd this is a man that was in charge of this state. He did so well here. There was nobody else that I even considered to run the RNC. That’s the whole country.\n\nAnd we had a big, big victory just recently that you know very well — a victory like they’ve never seen. So I’d just like you to say a couple of words, Michael. Congratulations.\n\nThe post Trump Drops Brand-New Election Whopper In Riff To Troops — Invents Millions of Votes He Never Got first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian division said it leveraged Russia's need for Starlink to obtain locations of its troops.\n\nTwo OSINT groups helped by complaining about a bot offering Starlink registration for Russians.\n\nUkraine's troops said they were running the bot, collecting money and data from the soldiers.\n\nA Ukrainian cyberwarfare division said on Thursday that it created a fake Starlink registration service to trick Russian soldiers into giving up sensitive data.\n\nThe 256th Cyber Assault Division said it partnered with open-source intelligence groups to promote a network of Telegram channels and bots that offered to help the Kremlin's troops register Starlink terminals on a Ukrainian whitelist.\n\nBut the channels were a ruse, and had instead been run by Ukrainian forces, who were sent location and terminal data from the soldiers, the 256th said.\n\nIts statement is yet another example of how wartime operations have spilled into social media, and comes after repeated reports that Russian forces have been trying to circumvent a region-wide Starlink block by paying Ukrainian civilians to register terminals for them.\n\nSpaceX cut off connectivity in Ukraine earlier this month, allowing only terminals logged with the Ukrainian government to continue receiving service. The sweeping move was enacted after repeated reports that Russian forces were buying terminals on the black market to guide attack drones and run battlefield communications.\n\nRussia downplayed the impact of the geofenced block on its operations, but Kyiv officials say that attempts by the Kremlin's troops to register terminals indicate their need for the American-run service.\n\nIn its statement, the 256th said it leveraged those needs to connect with the Russian soldiers.\n\n\"Understanding how desperately this mold would look for ways to restore Elon Musk's dish network — and the threats this poses — we, together with InformNapalm and MILITANT, decided to 'help' them,\" the division wrote, citing the two groups it worked with.\n\nAccording to screenshots posted by the division, which appear to show interactions with Russian troops, the Telegram bots would ask the soldiers for information about their Starlink terminals.\n\nThe soldiers then appear to share details such as their terminal ID numbers, satellite dish numbers, Starlink account numbers, and their location coordinates in latitude and longitude.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the authenticity of these screenshots.\n\nThe 256th said it collected 2,420 data entries on Russian Starlink terminals and their \"precise\" locations, as well as $5,870 from Moscow's troops paying for the faux service.\n\nThe division added that 31 Ukrainians had approached its network asking for opportunities to help Russians register terminals.\n\nInformNapalm, a Ukrainian-European OSINT group, said in a statement that it played a \"supporting role\" in the operation by pretending to complain about Telegram channels that were supposedly aiding Russians with Starlink registration.\n\nOn Monday, the group had posted about a channel named \"russian_starlink,\" which it wrote was surging in popularity but had still not been blocked by Ukrainian authorities.\n\n\"That was already one of the stages of drawing Russian military personnel even deeper into the 'honeypot,'\" the group wrote of the Monday post.\n\nMILITANT, a Ukrainian OSINT group that shared InformNapalm's Monday post, called the initiative \"Operation Self-Liquidation.\"\n\n\"As for the coordinates they sent, packages were sent back. 155s,\" the group wrote, referencing 155mm artillery shells.\n\nThe 256th said it sent the Russian data entries to Serhii Sternenko, an advisor on drone logistics and technology for Ukraine's defense ministry. A spokesperson for Sternenko's foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nIn a separate statement on X, InformNapalm said that the deception's \"intended effect has been achieved,\" indicating that the operation has concluded.",

    "description": "Hearts head coach Derek McInnes says he's in regular contact with Sir Alex Ferguson as the league leaders prepare to take on Rangers at Ibrox in a crunch match this weekend.",
    "fullText": "It is the morning after the Edinburgh derby when a late goal on a grim, sodden evening gave Heart of Midlothian three points, widening their gap at the top of the Scottish Premiership.\n\nHead coach Derek McInnes didn't get to sleep until 2am, but if the 54-year-old is fatigued, he has disguised it well as he strides into the home dressing room for our interview.\n\n\"I tossed and turned with the adrenaline. It was a late night, but it's always better when you win!\" he says, smiling.\n\nMcInnes and his side certainly have stamina. Hearts have led the Scottish Premiership since October and the whisper they could win the league has risen to a roar.\n\nCan he believe their success so far?\n\n\"No,\" McInnes answers honestly. \"I wouldn't have thought we could be where we are, but it just shows you what can be done.\"\n\nIt's rare for a team outside the Old Firm to be top of the league in February.\n\nIn fact, the last time a club stopped the dominance of Rangers and Celtic in the top tier of Scottish football, it was the 1980s and a young Sir Alex Ferguson was steering Aberdeen to three titles, four Scottish Cups and the 1983 European Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nIconic former Manchester United boss Ferguson is a figure McInnes admires greatly.\n\n\"I'm fortunate enough that I speak to Sir Alex regularly,\" he says. \"He was on the phone on my way into the game and he's got great pointers, little nuggets of information.\n\n\"He's able to give you wee things you can maybe do and say, like how you deal with the press.\"\n\nI wince, remembering how Ferguson was known for banning members of the media for asking awkward questions, but McInnes is charm personified.\n\nHe says Ferguson plans to come to Tynecastle in the next few weeks for a match and he's looking forward to taking advantage of the 84-year-old's experience and depth of knowledge.\n\n\"He knows all my players. He talks as though he knows them intimately and I tell my players that, and they still can't believe that he actually knows our game inside out,\" adds McInnes.\n\n\"He watches forensically. So I feel as if I've got a real supporter there.\"\n\nAnother 'supporter' that's made all the difference to the club is shareholder Tony Bloom.\n\nIn June last year the majority owner and chairman of Brighton bought a 29% stake in Hearts, announcing he planned to \"disrupt the pattern of domination which has been in place for far too long\" in Scottish football.\n\nThe implication was a 10-year plan - no-one foresaw success like this so quickly.\n\nHowever, McInnes says it's a holistic approach that's helped the club get to this position.\n\n\"We're not suddenly awash with money,\" he adds. \"We're not paying huge transfer fees for every player that comes in the door. We're being smart on the recruitment side of it.\"\n\nHe was happy to see Bloom watching on Tuesday, though, because \"every time he's come we've won\".\n\nAnd what about the fans? This is a new feeling for many of them.\n\nThe last time Hearts came close to winning the league was on a dramatic final day of the 1985-86 season.\n\nA 2-0 defeat by Dundee, coupled with Celtic's 5-0 win over St Mirren meant the Hoops were champions on goal difference by a margin of three.\n\nOlympic bronze medallist and lifelong Hearts fan Eilidh Doyle was born the following year, so this is now uncharted territory for the 38-year-old.\n\n\"It's probably not something I thought I'd see in my lifetime, so it's a really strange feeling,\" says Doyle.\n\nThe retired 400 metre hurdler has a season ticket at Tynecastle.\n\n\"It's a very Scottish thing to not want to jinx it, but it's the first time that realistically you think 'we could go and do this'.\"\n\nIn the stands, the club's support has swollen and grown a life of its own.\n\nA song about Portuguese striker Claudio Braga went viral on social media a few months ago.\n\nIt was written by fan, Calum MacKenzie, inspired by a success he's never known before.\n\n\"It's a tune, eh?\" says the 26-year-old with a smile as he looks around Tynecastle. \"It feels like the players are feeding off the stands and the energy.\"\n\nHis song has been part of that.\n\nTo the tune of Queen's Radio Gaga, Mackenzie wrote it at work, recorded it on a voice note and sent it to a Hearts supporters' Whatsapp group.\n\nSomeone put it on social media and it made its way to the stands where mobile phone footage of fans belting it out has been watched more than five million times.\n\n\"Luckily enough we're doing well and Claudio is a good player so it gets sung a lot more than I expected,\" adds Mackenzie. \"If we win the league now I'll be taking the credit for it!\"\n\nHearts fans are allowing themselves to think in those terms, albeit warily. However, McInnes will not be drawn on the possibility of lifting that trophy, but he is appreciative that they're 'disrupting' Scottish football.\n\n\"We were a good story at the start - like good old Hearts are up there competing, and nobody really thought we could go this far,\" he says.\n\n\"I think we're starting to annoy a few people, which is understandable when there has been such a strong presence over the last 40 odd years for Rangers and Celtic.\"\n\nHis side have two wins and a draw against Celtic in the league and two victories over Rangers, who they face at Ibrox this weekend.\n\nTheir record against the Old Firm is strong this season, but McInnes feels he can't take his eye off the task in hand for one moment.\n\nHe adds: \"I have to enjoy it more. If I was outside looking in and seeing a manager at the top of the league for nearly five months, I'd think how good must his life be!\"",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa's old guard have taken the club to new heights - but how long can it last?\n\nSeven of the XI which finished the 1-1 draw at Bournemouth last weekend were players signed under Dean Smith, while seven of the starters in the team which beat Brighton on Wednesday were given their debuts by the now Charlotte manager.\n\nVilla can almost name a Smith XI of players who were signed by the former manager, who left over four years ago.\n\nThey are trophyless in three decades but host Newcastle in the FA Cup on Satuday looking to end that drought.\n\nUnai Emery has Villa punching above their weight as they try to bridge the financial gap without the resources of their Champions League rivals.\n\nIt has left them relying on the same men year on year, so is there a plan of how to refresh an ageing squad amid the backdrop of profit and sustainability restrictions?\n\nAfter the January return of Douglas Luiz - signed from Manchester City in 2019 - Villa are just one away, a left-back, from being able to field a team of Smith players.\n\nAdd Lucas Digne, who joined under Steven Gerrard, and it will be a side without the initial input of Unai Emery, even if the Spaniard has re-signed Luiz and Ross Barkley.\n\nSmith was sacked in November 2021 after three years in charge but his influence remains.\n\nIn January 2019 he signed Tyrone Mings on loan from Bournemouth, the longest serving player of his reign, who played his 200th game for Villa in the win over Brighton.\n\nEzri Konsa and Luiz arrived in the summer, after Villa were promoted to the Premier League, while Matty Cash, Emi Martinez, Lamare Bogarde, Barkley, Leon Bailey, Emi Buendia and Ollie Watkins also joined under the former Brentford boss.\n\nThe backbone of the squad are players - Mings, Konsa, Watkins, Cash and John McGinn - signed from a lower level [the Championship and Scottish Premiership] with a risk element attached.\n\nMcGinn signed for £3.5m from Hibernian under Steve Bruce while Konsa - now an England international - joined from Brentford for £12m and Cash cost £16m from Nottingham Forest.\n\nEmery has lifted the squad to unexpected levels but unless they unearth a gem, Villa cannot replace Konsa for £12m in the current market and certainly not for the relatively low fees previously spent.\n\nThere lies the biggest problem, succession planning with limited funds.\n\nThe average age of Villa's starting XI is 28 years and 84 days - the second oldest in the Premier League - and there is internal recognition it needs to be dealt with.\n\nBrazilian winger Alysson, 19, joined from Gremio for £10m last month with 17-year-old Brian Madjo arriving from Metz for a similar fee to start that process.\n\nVilla signed them earlier than they would have liked but moved to get the pair for a smaller fee, reducing the risk.\n\nNeither are expected to make an immediate impact, although Alysson made his debut in midweek, but the January window was viewed as striking a balance - addressing the age issue and solving the first-team problems.\n\nStriker Tammy Abraham arrived to back up Watkins while Luiz returned on loan from Juventus out of necessity following Boubacar Kamara's season-ending knee injury.\n\nWith Villa committed to spending £18.25m on Abraham they had no money left to cover Kamara, so Luiz was ideal.\n\nHe was cheap, available, with his loan at Nottingham Forest being cancelled, and knew what Emery demands.\n\nBBC Radio WM: Watch Friday's Football Phone-In\n\nVilla are shopping in the same market as Newcastle and Tottenham but also Wolves and Nottingham Forest - not at the top table.\n\nDeloitte's 2024-25 money list, detailing football's richest clubs, had Villa 14th after generating £450m in revenue but over £200m behind Tottenham.\n\nVilla Park's upgrade, which will take the capacity to around 50,000, will not be complete for 18 months and even then matchday revenue will still fall short of many Premier League rivals.\n\nIt shows the work Emery has done, compared to what he has had to spend.\n\nChampions League qualification will help but it does not solve the problem completely.\n\nIt means when the big signings are on the cards Villa are unlikely to be in the conversation strongly enough.\n\nTottenham beat Villa to sign midfielder Conor Gallagher last month to underline the financial pecking order.\n\nEmery's side had been in talks for the midfielder for weeks once it became apparent Atletico Madrid were willing to let him go, having been interested when he left Chelsea for Spain in 2024.\n\nBut when Spurs came in, there was no contest. They were able to pay the £35m Atletico wanted and Gallagher was eager to return to London.\n\nTottenham did not pinch him from Villa's grasp but it was a stark reminder of the gulf which still exists despite the teams' fortunes this season.\n\nThe Midlands side need to be clever with their cash and they know they cannot afford to absorb a failed move like Evann Guessand that Manchester City, or even Spurs, can.\n\nThe forward did not score in the league after a £26m move from Nice last summer before being loaned to Crystal Palace in January, with Palace holding an option to buy to allow Villa to recoup their money.\n\nVilla's PSR struggles are well documented, having sold Jacob Ramsey for £40m to Newcastle to balance the books, and there is an expectation they will need to sell again this year.\n\nEmery has worked wonders with what he has but money talks and Villa still need to rely on the manager's magic until they find a financial solution.",

    "description": "While Milan-Cortina 2026 has brought the highest profile controversy regarding figure skating judging in recent years, it is not an isolated incident by any means.",
    "fullText": "Even die-hard figure skating fans might not have heard of Jezabel Dabouis this time last week. Now, she is in the limelight. And not for the right reasons.\n\nDabouis was a judge in the free dance segment of the ice dance event at the Winter Olympics, where medals were decided.\n\nOn Wednesday, the French couple of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron narrowly beat the American team of Madison Chock and Evan Bates.\n\nDabouis scored Fournier Baudry and Cizeron nearly eight points higher over three-time world champions and Milan-Cortina 2026 team event gold medallists Chock and Bates.\n\nWhile seven of the nine judges gave Chock and Bates scores of more than 132, Dabouis awarded them 129.74 - the lowest score of anyone.\n\nFor Fournier Baudry and Cizeron - who performed after the Americans - she awarded them 137.45, their second highest total among the judges.\n\nBecause of the way figure skating is scored, her points for Chock and Bates did not count - the highest and lowest of the nine judges' scores are disregarded - but they did for Fournier Baudry and Cizeron, helping nudge them into gold.\n\nJust under 18,500 people had signed a Change.org petition by Saturday morning asking the International Skating Union (ISU) and International Olympic Committee (IOC) to investigate the scoring.\n\nAnd silver medallist Chock has publicly questioned it too.\n\nImmediately after the medal ceremony on Wednesday night, she told BBC Sport: \"We put on our very best skates, all four of our performances [including the team event] were flawless to us. We are happy with how we skated; the rest is out of our hands.\"\n\nBut by Friday, she had more to say.\n\n\"Any time the public is confused by results, it does a disservice to our sport,\" the 33-year-old said. \"I think it's hard to retain fans when it's difficult to understand what is happening on the ice.\n\n\"People need to understand what they're cheering for and be able to feel confident in the sport that they're supporting.\"\n\nThe ISU has backed its judges, including Dabouis, following Chock's criticism.\n\n\"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations,\" the ISU said, adding it has \"full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness\".\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWhile this is by far the highest profile controversy regarding figure skating judging in recent years, it is not an isolated incident by any means.\n\nAfter the Olympic final, Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada were delighted. The veteran duo, in perhaps their final Olympics, saw off a competitive field to win bronze.\n\nIt was a very different scene two months earlier at the ISU Grand Prix Final in Nagoya. There, Gilles and Poirier dropped from third after the rhythm dance to fourth, finishing 0.06 points behind Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson of Great Britain.\n\n\"It definitely is disheartening. We can't lie, we're human,\" Gilles said at the time. \"We skated two successful programs, and we emotionally and physically felt so in shape and powerful in those moments, only to kind of be left questioning what we're doing, is it enough?\"\n\nGilles then posted a graphic on social media featuring a quote stating: \"Athletics carries its own set of truths, and those truths are diminished and manipulated by people with agendas.\" She tagged the ISU., external\n\nAfter winning bronze in Milan, she told BBC Sport: \"Our main focus was to make a moment for ourselves and let the judging be the judging.\"\n\nIn fact, all three medal winning couples in Milan have criticised the ISU and judges in recent months.\n\nIn November, Cizeron said he was not happy with their rhythm dance score at an Grand Prix event in Finland.\n\n\"I see some strange games being played that are destroying ice dance,\" he said. \"I don't think I've ever been to a competition like this in my career, from a judging standpoint.\"\n\nNaturally, with any sport where the results are determined by a panel of judges rather than a definitive factor - who scores the most goals or crosses the finish line first - there will always be differences of opinion.\n\nThe problems come when those differences of opinion are among experts - those who have won the sport's biggest prizes.\n\nIn Milan, Fear and Gibson set a season-best score for their Spice Girls-themed rhythm dance in the team event - and looked to have improved in the individual competition.\n\n\"They were better here than in the team event,\" 1980 Olympic gold medallist and BBC pundit Robin Cousins said after their performance.\n\nBut the Brits were then scored lower than they had been in the team event. That left them in fourth after the rhythm dance, and they eventually finishing seventh overall after a mistake by Fear.\n\nThere have been questions in the team event and men's competition too, where the showy but sometimes error-prone Ilia Malinin consistently scores higher than his often-tidier Japanese rival Yuma Kagiyama, in part because his free skate gets such high technical marks because of the tricks he attempts, meaning he is almost guaranteed to win even if he is not perfect - although as this Olympics proved, there are limits to that.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe ISU knows its sport is not perfect, and that judges can come in for intense criticism over their opinions - and that is moulding the future.\n\nChanges will be introduced for the 2026-27 season - starting in July - which means these Olympics are the last time we'll see the judging in its current form.\n\nIt comes as part of 'ISU Vision 2030' which among other things will overhaul the judging system to make the decisions easier to understand and less open to criticism.\n\nAnd as part of the reforms, figure skating is turning to AI.\n\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) has been testing six high-resolution cameras around the rink at competitions over the past two years that use AI to track skaters' movements and analyse technical elements such as jump rotation, height, distance travelled, edge used in jumps and spin positions in real time. It allows for split second calls that the human eye cannot make.\n\nISU director general Colin Smith said the goal was first to use the data to support judges and then potentially integrate it into the actual scoring system. It will be used in singles first, before being utilised in ice dance - more vulnerable to judging complaints as it has a greater focus on creativity - should it be viable.\n\nJudges will be able to focus \"on the artistry, on the human element, and the computer vision is looking more at the technical, the cut-and-dry aspects\", he told Reuters.\n\nBut will it put an end to the drama? Don't bet on it.\n\nMeet France's controversial ice dance Olympic champions\n\nMalinin, Minion and Milan's most emotional moment\n\nShaidorov wins gold as 'Quad God' Malinin crumbles\n\nTo fully understand the issue, we must look at how figure skating is scored.\n\nThe current method was introduced after the 2002 Salt Lake City scandal, where Canadian figure-skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier were initially denied victory because one of the judges felt under pressure to vote for their Russian rivals. Sale and Pelletier were later awarded joint gold.\n\nAt Milan-Cortina 2026, there are also technical specialists who identify the elements the skater is performing in real time and the difficulty of the element.\n\nThe panel of nine judges meanwhile concentrate on marking the quality of each element in the skaters' programs. For the Olympics, these nine are drawn from a pool of 13.\n\nEvery required element is assigned a base value. During the program, judges will award a grade of execution (GOE) within a range of plus- or minus-five to each element performed.\n\nThe highest and lowest of the nine scores are deleted, and the mean of the other seven gives the GOE for that element. The scores of all elements are added at the end to give the technical score.\n\nIn addition, there is the components score. The judges will award points on a scale from 0.25 to 10 for the program components to grade the overall presentation.\n\nThe final score is calculated by adding the element score and the program component scores and subtracting deductions for things like falls.\n\nThe scores of the two categories are added and the result constitutes the final score. The participant or couple with the highest total score wins.",

    "fullText": "Elite sport is tense, fraught and competitive. But still, you don't expect a curling match to descend into finger-pointing, swearing and accusations of cheating.\n\nWhen the men's rinks of Canada and Sweden met at the Winter Olympics in Cortina on Friday, tempers became frayed.\n\nThe Swedes believed one of the Canadians was repeatedly double-touching some of his stones - releasing the handle at the appropriate time but then giving the stone another little prod with his finger to correct its course.\n\nSweden skip Niklas Edin raised it with the officials between the second and third ends and the row quietly simmered away as the contest unfolded.\n\nThen, going into the last end, irritation turned to anger. Gestures were made before Canada's Marc Kennedy and Sweden's Oskar Eriksson began swearing at each other across the sheet.\n\n\"I don't like being accused of cheating after 25 years on tour and four Olympic Games,\" said Kennedy. \"So I told him [Eriksson] where to stick it.\n\n\"He might have been upset that he was losing...\"\n\nCanada went on to win 8-6, leaving the 2022 gold medal-winning Swedish rink without a win in their first three games.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nEach stone has a sensor on it to ensure players release their grip on the handle before the thick green line that runs across the ice, known as the hog line.\n\nIf they do, the sensor flashes green. If not, a red light shows.\n\nKennedy's stone showed green, but Eriksson and his Swedish team-mates thought they saw the Canadian give the stone an extra push with his finger after letting the handle go. The video evidence appears to back that up.\n\nBut, as BBC Sport curling commentator Steve Cram asked former world champion Jackie Lockhart, is it actually cheating and does it make a difference?\n\n\"You should not be touching the stone after you've released it,\" Lockhart said. \"If you touch it with a broom, it's burned and removed.\n\n\"He's released that stone, then poked it with his finger – I'm not sure why. Is it to push it a little bit harder because he felt he didn't give it enough?\"\n\nWhen the teams came off the ice, they would have signed a declaration saying they are happy with the result. So, unless a protest was submitted at that stage - and as far as we know there wasn't - the result will stand.\n\nBut what will this mean for the Canadians - who are considered medal contenders and have won their first three matches - in the rest of the Games?\n\n\"The question we should be asking is if Oskar is challenging him, has he [Kennedy] done it before?\" Lockhart added.\n\n\"Have they been doing it at other Championships and now they're being called out on it?\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed with the Canadians if that's what they're doing. We'll all be looking now.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Colombo\n\nIreland 235-5 (20 overs): Tucker 94* (51); Ahmed 3-33\n\nOman 139 all out (18 overs): Kaleem 50 (29); Little 3-16\n\nStand-in captain Lorcan Tucker hit an unbeaten 94 to lead Ireland to a 96-run win over Oman at the T20 World Cup.\n\nHaving lost their opening games against Sri Lanka and Australia, Ireland needed both victory and a boost to their net run-rate to have any hopes of progression.\n\nWhat was to be a first win at the tournament since beating England in 2022 looked in doubt when Tucker came to the crease with his side 25-2, but the wicketkeeper equalled his highest score in the format to power Ireland to 235-5 by the end of their innings.\n\nDespite Aamir Kaleem providing a half-century, Oman wickets fell quickly with Josh Little leading the way for Ireland's bowlers with three wickets for 16 runs.\n\nIreland play Zimbabwe on Tuesday (09:30 GMT) still needing a win and other results to go their way if they are to make the Super 8s.\n\nBrilliant Muzarabani helps Zimbabwe stun Australia\n\nWhile Tucker filled in for the injured Paul Stirling as captain, it was Tim Tector who opened the batting in place of the Belfast man.\n\nIreland's struggles for a top-order partnership, however, continued with Shakeel Ahmed doing the damage.\n\nThe 38-year-old, celebrating wickets in the style of Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, accounted for Tim Tector (5), Ross Adair (14) and Harry Tector (14) during the powerplay with Ireland reeling somewhat on 47-3 after six overs.\n\nWith Curtis Campher, who provided 12 off seven balls, not sticking around either, it was up to all-rounder Gareth Delany to team up with Tucker and give Ireland's innings some much needed momentum.\n\nThe pair's 101-run partnership off 56 balls took Ireland from what was a shaky start to a position that would lead to their highest ever T20 international total.\n\nWhile there were seven boundaries among Delany's 56 off 30 balls, it was Tucker's efforts that were to provide the headline act.\n\nAn inventive knock that featured 10 fours and four sixes, the only scare came when, with Ireland 67-4, Vinayak Shukla appeared to have him stumped only for the third umpire to judge that Oman's wicketkeeper had dislodged the bails without the ball in his hand.\n\nTucker certainly made the most of the reprieve, pressing on for what is the best knock of the tournament so far, eclipsing Tim Seifert's 89 against UAE for New Zealand.\n\nHe would end the innings frustratingly stranded at the non-striker's end, denied the chance for what would have been a first T20 century as George Dockrell, who plundered 35 from nine balls, faced the final three deliveries.\n\nIf 93 runs in the final five overs of Ireland's innings had appeared to leave the result a formality, Heinrich Malan's side will have had improving their net run-rate on the mind too.\n\nOman were 63-2 after the powerplay, and brought up their 100 in the 11th over, both ahead of the pace set by Ireland, but wickets feel too cheaply to ever bring such a target into realistic focus.\n\nAamir Kaleem led the way with the 44-year-old becoming the oldest player in T20 World Cup history to make a half-century, reaching his fifty in 28 deliveries to break the record set by team-mate Muhammad Nadeem against Sri Lanka only on Thursday.\n\nMost encouraging for Ireland's bowlers was the performance of Josh Little.\n\nThe seamer, who had been without a wicket in his past four T20 internationals, finished with figures of 3-16.\n\nThe 26-year-old, whose 4-23 against Sri Lanka at this tournament in 2021 built his reputation as Ireland's most dangerous quick, had been left out of the side for the opening two games this time around.\n\nBowling with a menacing pace throughout, the left-armer was denied a wicket with his fifth delivery when Ireland's struggles in the field at this tournament continued as Delany dropped Aamir in the deep.\n\nHe came back, however, to claim the wickets of Muhammad Nadeem, Jiten Ramanandi, Nadeem Khan to take away any remote hopes of an Oman victory.",

    "description": "James Eagle founded UK artisan brand The Pished Fish in 2014 and is known for its booze-infused, Scandinavian style smoked salmon.",
    "fullText": "As a medical devices salesman, James Eagle travelled across Scandinavia and would frequently be met with salmon or gravlax as “the main event” on menus.\n\nBack in the UK, he felt that thinly-cut smoked salmon was a sidenote on our plates. “I always thought that was a shame,” says Eagle.\n\nRedundancy from his sales job in 2013 allowed Eagle to start a smokehouse from a small shed at the bottom of his garden in Camberwell, London, which turned from a hobby into the birth of his artisan brand – The Pished Fish.\n\n“In the UK, when you get a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel, it’s the cream cheese and bagel you can taste,” adds Eagle. “How I likened it is with wafer-thin smoked salmon almost melting into the bagel.”\n\nEagle, who didn’t complete university, worked for drum and bass label Good Looking Records in the early 2000s and was PA to musician LTJ Bukem before turning to a career in sales.\n\nHowever, being laid off at the medical devices firm left a “sour taste” and taught him a lesson in \"how to look after my own staff now.”\n\nIn late 2014, Eagle ventured to farmers' markets with homemade smoked salmon made in what he describes as a “glorified filing cabinet” smoker. He would start at 1am for the laborious 16-hour process.\n\nHe produced three different flavours, sold out every weekend and it gave Eagle the confidence that a more lucrative business was in the offing.\n\nThe Pished Fish’s USP is using botanicals and alcohol – hence the fun company name – such as whisky, aquavit and vodka to flavour its booze-infused, Scandinavian-style smoked salmon. “The ones which I thought were more fun were done with alcohol,” he recalls of his early smokehouse testing.\n\nAfter meeting his now wife, Hermione, through dating site My Single Friend, the couple had attended a course on how to start a food business. Eagle’s main takeaway was not to rely on the product but to have a compelling brand.\n\nHe spent £4,000 on a design and logo. “Having someone to properly imagine what it could be was really important,” he says. “I felt it was an awful amount of money at the time, but it was the best money you could spend.”\n\nWhen a fishmonger at Selfridges later spotted the brand, the Eagles moved to East Sussex and went full-time to upscale the business. The start-up was housed on his father’s land near the Sussex Downs, at first in two shipping containers before moving to an adjacent building where Eagle today employs eight full-time staff.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Four people have been indicted on federal charges stemming from clashes with federal officers in Minneapolis, including one woman who is accused of biting off an immigration officer’s fingertip.\n\nThe three others were charged in connection with threats made to FBI agents after documents containing the agents' personal information was stolen from a vehicle.\n\nAccording to sworn statements filed in those cases, the FBI agents were investigating a shooting by an Immigration Customs Enforcement Officer on Jan. 14 when protests made the area unsafe and they had to flee on foot, leaving behind two of their vehicles. The vehicles were vandalized and broken into, and several things were stolen including guns, FBI identification cards and documents that included addresses, phone numbers and other personal information of some FBI employees.\n\nThat personal information was then posted on social media, according to the court documents, and that's when the officers began receiving threatening phone calls, text messages and emails.\n\nClaire Louise Feng, 27, is accused of biting off the fingertip of a special agent from Homeland Security Investigations during a Jan. 24 protest that happened after immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti. Feng, who is from St. Paul, Minnesota, was indicted on the charge of assaulting a federal officer resulting in injury.\n\nIn an affidavit filed in the case, Homeland Security Investigations special agent Bronson Day said an immigration officer was attempting to arrest another protester when Feng tackled the officer. A Customs and Border Protection officer took Feng to the ground and was trying to secure her arms when Feng bit the officer’s finger through a glove, Day wrote.\n\nThe day was very cold and the officer didn’t immediately realize the severity of the injury, Day wrote, but when the officer removed his glove, he realized the tip of his ring finger had been removed, exposing the bone. He was able to get medical attention within an hour, Day wrote.\n\nFeng’s attorney, Kevin C. Riach, said she would fight the charge.\n\n“All you have to do to assess the credibility of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents when they make allegations like this is to look at yesterday’s dismissal that confirmed ICE agents have made false allegations against a defendant,” Riach said. “We look forward to fighting this case and clearing Ms. Feng’s name.”\n\nBrenna Marie Doyle, 18, of Spokane, Washington, was indicted Thursday on charges of threatening to murder a federal law enforcement officer, threatening to murder a federal law enforcement officer’s family member and interstate transmission of a threat to injure a person. The indictment alleges she left voice messages on the FBI agent's phone threatening to kill them and their spouse and child.\n\nDoyle hasn't entered a plea yet, and her attorney Robert D. Richman said they were waiting to receive evidence from the government so they can evaluate the case. He noted Doyle lives in Washington state and has never been to Minnesota.\n\n“There is no allegation that she took any steps whatsoever to carry out any of these threats or come within a thousand miles of the agent,” Richman said.\n\nJames Patrick Lyons, 45, of California was indicted on five counts of interstate transmission of threats to injure a person, and Jose Alberto Ramirez, 29, of Illinois was indicted on one count of the same charge. Both men are accused of sending threatening text messages to FBI employees.\n\nAttorneys for Ramirez and Lyons did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment. Neither man has had the opportunity to enter a plea.\n\nBoone reported from Boise, Idaho.",

    "description": "No ice track, and yet the most successful nation in Olympic skeleton history - how Great Britain became a skeleton giant.",
    "fullText": "No ice track, and yet the most successful nation in Olympic skeleton history.\n\nBut as Matt Weston won his historic gold on Friday, he joined a long line of British skeleton athletes to have taken his place on a Winter Olympics podium.\n\nAfter Amy Williams and Lizzy Yarnold - twice - he is the first man to stand on the top step, and brings the sport's total medal haul to 10 with chances for that number to grow still at these Milan-Cortina Olympics.\n\nWeston - also a two-time world champion - thinks the fact Britain has achieved such success with no track is probably \"quite infuriating\" for other nations. For Yarnold, it's Team GB's \"superpower\".\n\n\"What the Brits are really good at is that when we turn up a track, you have six practice runs before the race, so six minutes of practice,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\n\"You go in there with purpose, with clarity, with commitment in every single run, and everyone is tuned into that particular performance advantage that you're focusing on.\n\n\"Sometimes when other people might see a negative, you can switch it up and make it your superpower.\"\n\nA small wooden hut in the grounds of the University of Bath campus doesn't look like a superpower, however.\n\nIt is here that Olympic champions have been made, the start of the UK's only push track and the home of the skeleton and bobsleigh teams.\n\nThey spend their summers on this 140m stretch, finessing their starts and building their bodies in the gym for the winters ahead.\n\nThe technology in other parts of the sport is more advanced.\n\nIt was back in 1990s that a PhD student named Kristan Bromley - who later became known as 'Dr Ice' - was asked to create a sled for the British military, who took part in the sport for recreation.\n\nNo soldier would test his creation, and so he did so himself. He later went on to become a four-time Olympian, and designed the sleds on which many of Britain's early skeleton medallists achieved their Olympic success.\n\nIn the years since, the likes of McLaren and British Aerospace have also been involved in the engineering of the sleds, while the creation of special 'drag-resistant' skin suits raised eyebrows at the 2018 Games.\n\nBefore these 2026 Games, the team have utilised a wind tunnel in a bid to improve performance.\n\n\"Research and innovation are really important in a sport like skeleton where it's the human and the machine,\" said Yarnold.\n\n\"I'm often asked the question, how often is it the human? How often is it the machine? It's a combination of everything coming together.\"\n\nSometimes, it hasn't done so. At these Games, Team GB were banned from using new helmets that the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) said had clearly been designed to specifically enhance aerodynamic performance.\n\nIt hasn't mattered on this occasion, but it went disastrously wrong four years ago in Beijing when GB left the skeleton competitions empty-handed, with blame laid firmly at the door of the equipment which \"drained speed\".\n\nTeam GB had won a skeleton medal at every Winter Olympics since the sport was reinstated to the programme in 2002 but 20 years later, that run had come to an end, with Weston's 15th-place finish the highest of the four British athletes competing.\n\nIn the aftermath, the skeleton programme had a drop in UK Sport funding - from the £6.5m it received for the 2022 cycle, to an initial £4.8m for 2026 - though this later rose to £5.8m.\n\nHistorically, alongside the ski and snowboard programme and that of curling, it has been one of Great Britain's highest-funded winter sports.\n\nBut how does it attract athletes in the first place? After all, no British child grows up dreaming of one day being a skeleton champion.\n\nBefore skeleton, Weston was an England taekwondo international and played rugby union, but was introduced to sliding through Discover Your Gold, a UK Sport talent identification scheme.\n\nSuch UK Sport schemes - which search for raw talent in potential athletes and direct them into suitable sports - also brought two-time Olympic champion Lizzy Yarnold, and 2018 bronze medallist Laura Deas into skeleton.\n\n\"That's how they're drawing very capable athletes in, and you pair that with phenomenal coaching and great funding,\" said Yarnold, a former heptathlete who wanted to take up modern pentathlon.\n\n\"Because we're not a winter sport nation and we don't have young athletes trying out these sports on Wednesday afternoons like they do in other countries, we lean into the fact that we're capturing athletes who are incredible physical athletes already, and who are interested in trying a different sport.\n\n\"It's that moment of the possibility, the hope and the opportunity.\"\n\nWith such a history of success, it is also an enticing proposition for the very best coaches in the world.\n\nLatvian Martins Dukurs - widely regarded as the greatest slider to ever take to the ice - became Great Britain's new coach in 2022.\n\nA six-time world champion with more than 60 World Cup victories to his name, Dukurs retired after the Beijing Games and his capture as a coach - alongside that of his own coach and sled designer Matthias Guggenberger - by the British team was a major coup.\n\n\"This is just a massive bonus to a good package that we already had, this is the icing on the cake,\" Weston told BBC Sport in 2025.\n\n\"Martins is the best ever at what he's done. His experience is invaluable.\"\n\nDukurs' father Dainis manages the track in Sigulda, meaning Dukurs had constant access to the ice. Joining a set-up with no ice track, then, was a challenge.\n\n\"I was sliding 23 December, 24 December, 31 December, 1 January, and any time I needed I was jumping on a sled, I was testing equipment, and unfortunately they don't have such opportunity,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"This is what they've achieved without a track, it's actually amazing. This benefit I had, that they don't have, they need to compensate and work hard.\"\n\nSo what do the British athletes put it down to? The answer is each other, their team camaraderie.\n\n\"We only get to slide down an ice track about 120-150 times a year. Each run is less than a minute, so you're looking at less than two hours actually doing the sport every year,\" Marcus Wyatt - who finished ninth in Cortina - told BBC Sport last year.\n\n\"But if you talk to other athletes, learn from their experiences and share what you're doing, suddenly you've doubled, tripled, quadrupled your knowledge.\n\n\"In the last couple of years especially, me and Matt have bounced off each other, we're sharing ideas.\n\n\"The day before a race, I might be struggling on a corner, so I ask Matt, what are you doing on corner four? He tells me, I try that, it works for me, and lo and behold when the race comes, I might beat him.\n\n\"That's fine, because he knows that next week when he's struggling somewhere else, I'll help him out and he might beat me.\n\n\"It's this team ethos, working together, to get the best out of everyone.\"\n\nWeston adds: \"I think that's why we're so good.\n\n\"On the track, he's the first person I want to beat, I'm the first person he wants to beat.\n\n\"But when we're training, when we're working stuff out, we work together so well, and I think that's what separates us apart [from the rest].\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "It was the pass that turned a defence inside out and twisted history upside down.\n\nBack in 2018, Scotland hadn't beaten England at home in a decade. It was 14 years since they had even scored a try at home against the neighbours.\n\nTheir longer-term record against England was yet more wretched – Scotland had won just three of the previous 29 meetings.\n\nThe oldest fixture in international rugby was showing its age. It had become tired.\n\nAnd then Finn Russell threw that pass., external Thirty-one minutes into the 2018 Calcutta Cup tie, as Scotland nursed a slender four-point lead, Russell slung a glorious, soaring, swooping torpedo of a pass which froze Jonathan Joseph, foxed Jonny May and freed Huw Jones on a gleeful gallop through the heart of England's defence.\n\nA few phases later Sean Maitland went over in the corner, belief burned bright and a new era had arrived.\n\nScotland won 25-13 that day. Ever since it has been England's turn on the rough end of the rivalry. They have tasted victory twice in the last eight meetings.\n\nSaturday, 14th February at 16:40 GMT\n\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app\n\nWhat was once an annual gimme, is now a brutal benchmark which England have struggled to reach.\n\nSo, as soon as the Six Nations schedule was published, Saturday's trip to Murrayfield looked like the pinch point which would make or break England's title dreams.\n\nThis is an upwardly mobile England side who are too excited about the future to chew for long over the past.\n\nThey bounce north on the back of 12 straight victories and a blossoming strength in depth.\n\nIt was not long ago that England had a chronic lack of centres. Now, they can leave a fit-again Ollie Lawrence, once carved deep into every possible Steve Borthwick teamsheet, out of the matchday 23 without stirring much comment.\n\nJoe Heyes has emerged as such a high-calibre tight-head prop that an injury to Will Stuart, who made similar strides last season, has been shrugged off.\n\nFlanker Tom Curry, a big-match staple, is on the bench.\n\nOptions abound. Momentum gathers apace. But, quietly, there are doubts that only a Murrayfield victory will ease.\n\nCaptain Itoje returns to England XV to face Scotland\n\nPilates pain and spotting space - how Ford stays in the fly-half fight at 32\n\nAuld enemy, new talent - Scotland & England's scrap for tomorrow's stars\n\nBecause England's winning streak started with some streaky wins.\n\nVictory over France in round two of last year's Six Nations was delivered, in part, by Gallic butterfingers.\n\nThe one-point win over Scotland a fortnight later would have been defeat had Russell nailed a final-play conversion shot.\n\nAfter closing out that Six Nations campaign with wins over Italy and Wales, England, without 14 British and Irish Lions, impressed by beating Argentina twice on a two-Test tour.\n\nBut the Pumas, run ragged by the 12-month demands on their star players, were also at less than full strength.\n\nVictory over New Zealand was the centrepiece of England's autumn, but the subsequent sacking of Scott Robertson suggested that the All Blacks were not taking up tools with their usual gusto.\n\nEngland's current run has been built around Twickenham. Can they go on the road and break the hex that Scotland have held over them in recent years?\n\nIf not, back-to-back away trips to the Stade de France and Ellis Park to play France and South Africa in March and July respectively suddenly look a whole lot more daunting.\n\nThere are some relative Test rookies in their line-up. Henry Arundell is much improved in defence, but was barely tested against Wales last week. Tommy Freeman is learning on the job at centre, a potential opening that Sione Tuipulotu and Jones will attempt to exploit. Guy Pepper, eight caps deep, will be a target for wily opposite number Jamie Ritchie.\n\nElsewhere Luke Cowan-Dickie can wobble on the oche at line-out time, while England's replacements did not accelerate away from Wales as Borthwick might have hoped, with the hosts shading the second half by a relatively narrow 19-7.\n\nThey are minor quibbles. Certainly in comparison to Scotland's.\n\nGregor Townsend's men were stung by a defeat by Italy that might signal the beginning of the end for both a coach and a generation of stellar players.\n\nBut, those happier, more distant memories are also still resident in their line-up.\n\nTwo names remain from the 23 who beat England eight years ago - Russell, who threw the pass, and Jones, who caught it.\n\nEngland must break that link to the past.\n\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "Edgecombe's performance was a timely reminder of the 20-year-old's value as a scorer in Philadelphia this season.",
    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, CA — With both arms outstretched as he walked away triumphantly, it was only fitting that 76ers rookie VJ Edgecombe — after exploding for 17 out of a possible 40 points for Team Carter in the semis of the Rising Stars Challenge— sealed Friday night’s All-Star festivities at the free-throw line in the final versus Team Melo.\n\n“There was no pressure,” Edgecombe said after being named tournament MVP following the 25-24 win. “Free throws, man. I just try to be dialed in, try to be focused at the line. Free throws are precious. Obviously tonight, we needed them to win the game. I just focused and made them.”\n\nWith 23 points across both Rising Star games, Edgecombe’s efficient performance was a timely reminder of the 20-year-old’s value as a scorer in Philadelphia this season.\n\nThere are some natural efficiency roadblocks that he’ll need to iron out — his 105.5 points per 100 shot attempts place him in the 34th percentile among combo guards, and his .212 points per touch wedge him between Boston’s Hugo Gonzalez and Sacramento’s Nique Clifford — but his potential is through the roof. Edgecombe leads all rookies in touches per game, according to Second Spectrum, all while taking care of the ball (70th percentile in turnover rate). Statistically, the 76ers’ offense is better with him on the floor, a testament to his in-season development and the presence of All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey as a backcourt partner.\n\nOverall, Edgecombe’s value as a rookie can’t be understated, even on a team ripe with veterans. Through 50 games, Edgecombe is averaging 14.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. According to Stathead, there are 21 players this season posting those numbers with at least 2.5 win shares; Edgecombe and Cooper Flagg are the only rookies that comprise that list.\n\n[\nFriday night, despite the negative discourse that has surrounded All-Star weekend in recent years, was also a reminder that although much of the rookie conversations have been centered around Flagg and Kon Knueppel, Edgecombe is much more than a suitable consolation prize. From a sheer effort standpoint, it was clear the Philly guard wanted to compete at both ends of the floor, whether it was being in attack mode or being defensively engaged at the other end.\n\nAs a whole, the Rising Stars participants seemed to take the games seriously, a refreshing deviation from the norm. Spurs players Dylan Harper and Stephon Castle, members of Team Melo, were actively discussing the in-game events shortly after the final buzzer, almost as if this was a key regular-season game.\n\n“We wanted to compete,” Team Vince’s Jaylen Wells of the Grizzlies told Yahoo Sports. “Set the tone for the weekend, and a lot of guys on the team wanted to win. And the last one is money! We get paid!”\n\n“I hate losing,” Edgecombe added. “I really hate losing. It’s really a credit to my teammates. We all bought in.”\n\nHeading into the break, the 76ers (30-24) find themselves in a comfortable tier in the Eastern Conference, sixth place and just 3.5 games out of the top four. However, with Paul George in the midst of a 25-game suspension for a banned substance and superstar center Joel Embiid currently out with right knee management (he’ll be re-evaluated after the break), Edgecombe’s true value will surface. It’s rare for rookies to be depended on for pivotal stretch runs like Philadelphia is about to embark on, but outside of Maxey, Edgecombe is one of the few players on the roster who can create his shot and score from all three levels, in addition to creating plays for others.\n\n“It feels great to win the MVP of the Rising Stars game,” Edgecombe said. “But I’m focused. My next focus is the push after the All-Star break. After the break, we’ve just got to make a push. We’re still in the hunt for that playoff spot. Just got to stay together, keep hooping and trusting each other. I feel like we’re a dangerous team if we’re healthy. I stand on that.”",

    "description": "Best chance to be a No. 2",
    "fullText": "Manager Craig Stammen has made it clear since his first media scrum on the opening of spring camp that he sees Luis Campusano as the San Diego Padres’ No. 2 catcher. More than once, Stammen has cited Campusano’s hard work and success in Triple-A last season. In his media scrum Friday morning, Stammen remarked on Campusano’s haircut while giving a big vote of confidence.\n\n“He cut the dreads, got a new haircut, looks good and I know he’s excited about the opportunity and probably the first time in his career that he has had a little bit of a runway to take control of that job and win it in Spring Training and be the number two when we leave camp.”\n\nThe professional journey that Campusano has traveled has been rocky, to say the least. Coming up to the Padres in 2020 at 21, Campusano played the most in 2024, where he appeared in 91 games with a .227/.281/.361 line and a -0.7 fWAR reflecting below average defense. His eight home runs and 40 RBI did not offset the difficulties he had behind the plate. Then manager, Mike Shildt, appeared to have seen enough and never gave Campusano an opportunity to catch during his 10 game appearances in 2025. All of his 21 at-bats were as a DH and he had no hits and six walks with 11 strikeouts.\n\nStammen played with Campusano when he was a pitcher in the Padres bullpen. From his first comments after getting the manager job, Stammen has expressed support and belief in Campusano. He indicated from the beginning that the now 27-year-old would get every opportunity to prove he can be a major league player.\n\nWhen president of baseball operations A.J. Preller acquired Freddy Fermin during the trade deadline last season, it became clear that he would be the front-line catcher going forward. He learned the staff on the fly after coming to the team and was far superior offensively to the aging Elias Diaz and Martin Maldonado.\n\nFermin has never been the number one guy for a team and has never played more than 89 games, which was last season. He started 39 of the Padres 52 games after coming over from the Kansas City Royals and before that his previous high was 72 games as a backup to Salvador Perez.\n\n“I think to not burn Freddy out, Campy, if he’s the No. 2, he’s got to catch a lot,” Stammen stated. “To get those guys off to a good start in the season, maybe not exactly equal playing time, we’ll see how it shakes out, but Campy will play a lot.”\n\nStammen also brought up the other catchers working with the Padres pitchers in camp. Both Blake Hunt and Rodolfo Duran are sharing catching duties with Fermin and Campusano. All four, as well as top prospect Ethan Salas, will catch Padres pitchers in spring games. Either Hunt or Duran will likely be Campusano’s backup and if he doesn’t perform well, it is likely one of them will be the No. 2 to begin with.\n\nAnother interesting topic to be discussed in the scrum was Stammen’s dislike of dedicated catchers for specific pitchers. “I think every catcher needs to catch every pitcher, and every pitcher needs to throw to every catcher. Now, will there be, ‘Hey, these guys are just way better together?’ That could definitely happen, but you never know. You can’t pigeonhole them, because say one guy gets hurt and then all of a sudden, the backup has to catch those guys too.”\n\nThe subject of Matt Waldron was also brought up and Stammen said all catchers will work with him and Campusano has already brought a glove for Waldron. He acknowledged not everyone can catch a knuckleball pitcher so the best one will get the job.\n\nCampusano caught Dylan Cease’s no-hitter, the second one thrown by a Padre, on July 25, 2024. But his inconsistency behind the plate apparently cost him the trust of his manger. With Stammen as the new leader and Kevin Plawecki as the new catching coach, Campusano is going to get a fresh opportunity to show if he is capable of being a major league catcher. There has been no discussion of giving him time at first base, despite Stammen acknowledging that he played some first base last season. His job is to catch and earn the backup job. If he is not able to do so, he is out of options and will either be traded or have to pass through waivers to be sent to the minor leagues.\n\nTo make his job more challenging, the ABS system will be part of the major league game this year and both catchers will probably be primarily responsible for judging balls and strikes in order to challenge pitches. Fortunately, the system has been in place in the minor leagues for years and Campusano has lots of experience. Stammen said they will develop a strategy as spring progresses and games begin.\n\nIf instilling confidence and expressing belief in a player can make a difference in if they perform well, Campusano should thrive this spring. Stammen has gone out of his way to publicly support and express faith in the still-young catcher. This is definitely his last and best chance. Let’s hope he takes the opportunity and runs with it.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa face Newcastle United in one of the weekend’s most appealing FA Cup fourth-round ties.\n\nTwo teams who have challenged the established elite in recent seasons lock horns at Villa Park, each eager to win silverware this season.\n\nFor Villa, it’s been almost 30 years since the club’s last major trophy, but progress under Unai Emery has raised optimism that that could change this season.\n\nVilla are third in the Premier League and also into the Europa League’s last 16. After a disappointing exit in the League Cup, the fanbase will demand that the FA Cup is given a better run.\n\nIn their path are Newcastle, who ended their own trophy drought with League Cup success last season. Eddie Howe has reiterated his desire to go far in this tournament, but the Magpies will need to improve on their away form this season to earn progress.\n\nMidfield personnel is light for Aston Villa with John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara (both knee) and Youri Tielemans all sidelined. The onus will again fall on Amadou Onana in the engine room who could be partnered by winter window recruit Douglas Luiz. Luiz joined on loan from Juventus in January for a second spell at Villa Park. Ross Barkley offers an alternative.\n\nAndres Garcia and Matty Cash are also out, so Lamare Bogarde should shuffle in at right-back. Further forward, Tammy Abraham and Leon Bailey are pushing for involvement after mid-season arrivals, the latter recalled from a loan spell at AS Roma.\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Bizot; Bogarde, Lindelof, Torres, Digne; Onana, Luiz; Bailey, Rogers, Buendia; Abraham.\n\nAston Villa vs Newcastle will kick off at Villa Park at 17:45 GMT on Saturday 14th February 2026.\n\nThe match will be broadcast on BBC 1 and TNT Sports 3 in the UK.\n\nRead – Premier League Awards: Anxious Arsenal and Sesko’s stunner\n\nSee more – Premier League Team of the Week – Bogle, Hannibal, Semenyo\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

NMSU will travel east to take on the current number two team in Conference USA standings, Jacksonville State.\n\nJax State is also in-search of the win column after stumbling on Thursday night at home against UTEP.\n\nDespite its loss, the Gamecocks will present challenges for NMSU. JSU is home to the conference’s top scorer, Mostopha El Moutauakkil, whos averaing 18.3 points per game. As a team, Jax State ranks 2nd in conference in its defense allowing just 66.4 points per competition.\n\nWhile JSU walked with the loss against UTEP yet still had shining moments, its a similar case for NMSU in its loss to Liberty. Aggies finished shooting 47% from the field while allowing just 43% from the top scoring team in CUSA. Julius Mims continues to be a threat for the Aggies posting yet another double-double this season against the flames leading the conference in rebounds.\n\nJacksonville State (13-11 overall, 8-5 in CUSA) will host NMSU (11-13 overall, 4-10 CUSA) at 3 p.m. MT, Saturday February 14th.",

    "fullText": "Baylor first baseman Tyce Armstrong knows how to make a first impression.\n\nFacing New Mexico State in the Bears' 2026 season-opener, the redshirt senior tied an NCAA record with three grand slams in a single game in his Baylor debut. The only other player to accomplish the feat is Louisville's Jim LaFountain on March 24, 1976.\n\nArmstrong was playing his first game in a Baylor uniform after transferring from UT Arlington.\n\nFor perspective, MLB.com's Sarah Langs notes only one team in MLB history has hit three grand slams in a game (the New York Yankees on Aug. 25, 2011), let alone a single player. There are 13 MLB players with two grand slams in a game.\n\nBatting in the leadoff position, Armstrong's first homer came on a low curveball in the third inning.\n\nFeeling 𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙙 😏#SicEm 🐻⚾️ | #Together | @Tycea_11 pic.twitter.com/79g8mzgi0h\n\n— Baylor Baseball (@BaylorBaseball) February 13, 2026\n\nThen came another on an inside fastball in the fourth inning.\n\nAbsolutely 𝐡𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 🔨 @Tycea_11 #SicEm 🐻⚾️ | #Together pic.twitter.com/xi3MSVXxWc\n\n— Baylor Baseball (@BaylorBaseball) February 13, 2026\n\nAnd finally, there was a high fastball in the seventh inning to end the game as a 15-2 Baylor win by mercy rule.

And a hit-by-pitch. It seems to have been a big moment for him, via the Associated Press:\n\n“I’m speechless,” Armstrong said. “It’s the coolest thing I’ve ever been a part of.”\n\nThe Bears landed Armstrong after he slashed .319/.415/.556 with 12 homers and 46 RBI in his final season at Arlington, where he earned second-team All-WAC honors.",

    "description": "Windsor, ranked No. 2 in the GametimeCT Top 10 poll, suffered its first loss.",
    "fullText": "WINDSOR -This is what we've come to expect from the best boys basketball rivalry the CCC has had over the last decade.\n\nA great comeback by Windsor in the third quarter tied the game with one quarter to play. The lead changed hands six times in the final quarter. The last time it did, it came on a shot by East Catholic's Joey Montalvo.\n\nMahki Henderson assisted on Montalvo's game-winning layup with eight seconds left as East Catholic, No. 5 in the GametimeCT Top 10 poll, stunned No. 2 and previously undefeated Windsor 75-74 before a sellout crowd Friday at Windsor High.\n\nThe host Warriors missed a long 3-point attempt at the buzzer.\n\n\"It's a big deal. We knew it was going to come down to this,\" said Montalvo, a senior. \"Great outcome, I'm glad we got the road win.\"\n\nEast Catholic coach Luke Reilly called the win \"a big step forward for us today\" in a \"state tournament-style week.\"\n\nThe Eagles (15-3) lost at home Monday to East Hartford, then were trailing Bishop Hendricken (R.I.) by double digits on the road Wednesday. They came back to win that game in overtime on Bishop Hendricken's senior night.\n\nThen East Catholic did the same thing on Windsor's senior night.\n\n\"We knew that the stakes were high because there were three teams that could beat us,\" Reilly said. \"This team is tough. This team knows how to compete.\"\n\nEast Catholic built a 16-point lead late in the second quarter, and led by 13 at halftime (41-28).\n\nWindsor (16-1) scored 30 points in the third quarter to tie the score at 58.\n\nAlex Weaver (22 points) gave Windsor a 71-70 lead with 1:45 left, but the sophomore point guard fouled out 12 seconds later. Still, Windsor hung in. And after Montalvo missed a 3-pointer trailing 74-73, the Warriors had a chance to put the game away from the free throw line.\n\nBut Clinton Toomer and Charlie Lewis missed two free throws each. A tie-up after the last miss gave possession to East Catholic with 17.9 seconds left.\n\nThe Eagles' Sincere Folk (18 points, 11 assists), who hit the basket to pull East Catholic within 1, drew three defenders. He passed to Henderson, who found Montalvo.\n\n\"Coach just wanted us to go immediately to give us a chance for an offensive rebound,\" Folk said. \"I tried to get it past half court as quickly as possible, then threw it over to (Henderson).\n\nMontalvo pump-faked near the basket and two Windsor defenders flew by him. He then laid it in for the game-winner.\n\n\"I missed the big 3 before it. I'm glad I got it back,\" Montalvo said. \"Pump faking, we practice every day. Glad I got it to go.\"\n\nSaid Folk: \"Coach preaches Eyebrows, which is a pump fake. So Joey pump-faked, got two guys in the air and finished the bucket to give us the win.\"\n\nWindsor coach Ken Smith knew where the game was lost.\n\n\"If we learn to make our free throws, we wouldn't be in that position,\" Smith said. \"Very disappointing, especially because that's the first thing we practice every day.\"\n\nJamaul Padilla finished with a game-high 31 points for East Catholic. His superb play in the first half was the main reason why the Eagles were able to establish such a big lead.\n\nWindsor has a quick turnaround, playing Burke (Mass.) at Springfield Central on Saturday afternoon.\n\nJoey Montalvo, East Catholic: Hit the deciding layup with eight seconds left that gave East Catholic the 75-74 victory.\n\n\"Everybody is going to give us their best game, and that was their best game today. But we still could've won if we hit our free throws.\"\n- Windsor coach Ken Smith.\n\nThis article originally published at Joey Montalvo's late basket lifts No. 5 East Catholic to stunning win over No. 2 Windsor.",

    "description": "Ixan Henderson suffered a flexor strain in spring training and has been shut down from throwing",
    "fullText": "The St. Louis Cardinals' rebuild will likely have a lot of young players and assets front-and-center in spring training this year.\n\nTop 10 prospect JJ Wetherholt (No. 5 per MLB Pipeline) and top 100 pitching prospect Jurrangelo Cijntje (No. 91) are just two-of-six top 100 minor leaguers who, if things go well in St. Louis, are expected to become featured players for the organization in years to follow.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the team's more promising young pitchers will be delayed in his ramp up for 2026.\n\nAccording to a report from Brian Walton of Cardinal Nation, starting left-handed pitching prospect Ixan Henderson suffered a flexor strain in his throwing arm and will be shutdown from throwing.\n\nPer @B_Walton, Cardinals top pitching prospect Ixan Henderson suffered a left flexor strain at camp and has been shut down from throwing\n\n— Adam Akbani (@AdamAkbani) February 14, 2026\n\nHenderson was ranked as the team's No. 19 prospect in 2025 according to MLB Pipeline.\n\nHenderson was selected in the eighth round of the 2023 MLB Draft out of Fresno State. He has been a consistent riser in the Cardinals' farm system since and has also been one of their better statistical performers in the minor league ranks.\n\nThis past season, his first with the Double-A Springfield Cardinals, Henderson posted a 2.59 ERA. He struck out 134 batters in 132 innings pitched across 25 starts.\n\nFor his professional career, Henderson has a 2.44 ERA and has fanned 244 hitters in 239.2 innings pitched across 51 appearances (42 starts) and has also registered a 17-11 record.\n\nSince Henderson was promoted to the High-A Peoria Chiefs on July 30, 2024, he's been used exclusively as a starting pitcher. This year was his first receiving a non-roster invite to spring training.\n\nCheck out these filthy Ixan Henderson sweepers from last night pic.twitter.com/c2Taz52TfU\n\n— Kareem Haq (@KareemSSN) April 17, 2025\n\nHenderson, which was ranked by Baseball America as the organization's eighth-best prospect, had the following scouting report by the national publication:\n\nHenderson is an average-sized lefthander with a longer arm action and a deceptive three-quarters arm slot. He repeats his mechanics well and shows a deep arsenal of pitches, keeping hitters off-balance despite a lack of velocity. Henderson’s fastball sits 92-94 mph and touches 95-96. The pitch has average ride but late armside run that explodes on hitters. He has plus command of his fastball and does a good job of avoiding the heart of the plate.\n\nBaseball America projects Henderson as a No. 5 starting pitcher in the major leagues. The publication graded three of his five pitches as average or above-average: his fastball, slider and changeup. They also gave him a \"50\" grade on control.\n\nOften times, a flexor strain can be the precursor to a more serious injury. At best, it's an injury that results in a weeks-to-months-long layoff.\n\nRegardless, the injury will likely mark the end of spring training for St. Louis.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "Aston Villa welcome Newcastle United to Villa Park in a fascinating fourth-round FA Cup tie.\n\nHaving watched Newcastle end their long wait for a major trophy with League Cup success last season, The Villans are seeking to end a 30-year drought of their own.\n\nDate: Saturday, 14 February 2026\n\nUnai Emery’s options are stretched in midfield with Youri Tielemans, John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara all ruled out. The return of Douglas Luiz in January has boosted the club’s stocks, while Ross Barkley is also back from injury.\n\nMatty Cash and Andres Garcia are not expected to feature, so Lamare Bogard should deputise at right-back. In attack, it’s a straight selection choice between Ollie Watkins and January recruit, Tammy Abraham.\n\nNewcastle are also short in midfield with Bruno Guimaraes adding to Eddie Howe’s headache in midweek. The captain is a major doubt, while Joelinton has been ruled out. Starting in midfield could be Jacob Ramsey, against his former club. Ramsey was on target during Tuesday’s win at Tottenham. Elsewhere, Tino Livramento and Emil Krafth remain out.\n\nAston Villa have won four of their last six in all competitions, following a 1-0 win over Brighton in the Premier League in midweek. That run also includes a 2-0 win at Newcastle in the league, a result that strengthened their grip on a Champions League place. Villa, who eliminated Spurs in the FA Cup’s third round, are unbeaten in their last three against Newcastle.\n\nEddie Howe’s side secured a morale-boosting win at Tottenham in midweek to end a five-game winless run. The Magpies are 10th in the Premier League, having struggled to juggle the dual commitment of league and Champions League football. Their form on the road has been particularly poor. Newcastle have won just three of their 13 Premier League games away from home.\n\nAston Villa: Bizot; Bogarde, Lindelof, Torres, Digne; Onana, Luiz; Bailey, Rogers, Buendia; Abraham.\n\nNewcastle: Pope; Trippier, Thiaw, Botman, Hall; Willock, Tonali, Ramsey; Barnes, Wissa, Gordon.\n\nThe match will be broadcast on BBC 1 and TNT Sports 3 in the UK.\n\nRead – Premier League Awards: Anxious Arsenal and Sesko’s stunner\n\nSee more – Premier League Team of the Week – Bogle, Hannibal, Semenyo\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith believes a spry LeBron James will make the Lakers a real threat in this spring's NBA playoffs.",
    "fullText": "If anyone was thinking that LeBron James was starting to show signs of slippage this season at age 41, he reminded them on Thursday that he still has a decent amount of tread left on his tires.\n\nIn the Los Angeles Lakers' 124-104 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, he dropped 28 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds, giving him his first triple-double of this season. That stat line also made him the oldest player in NBA history to ever post a triple-double in a game.\n\nThat win gave the Lakers a 33-21 record going into the All-Star break. They're in fifth place in the Western Conference, and few people, if any, consider them to be true championship contenders right now. But on ESPN's \"First Take,\" Stephen A. Smith said that James' continued stellar play, when combined with the outstanding offensive production of Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves, could allow L.A. to make a deep playoff run this spring.\n\n\"When LeBron James is great, the Lakers have the potential to knock off some people,\" Smith said.\n\n\"… The fact of the matter is is that, if you've got three dudes that are playing at an elite level offensively, that puts more pressure on them (opposing teams) to produce offensively as well when they're going up against the Lakers, and everybody can't do that.\n\n\"… They could possibly make a little run, go deep into the Western Conference playoffs. That's what I'm looking at. That's why I'm excited when I see him like this at this age because I'm saying to myself, 'Yo, the Lakers could make it interesting if they play at an elite level offensively.\"\n\nJames is currently averaging 22 points, 5.8 rebounds and 7.1 assists a game, and while his 3-point shooting is a problem right now (he's making just 30.5% from 3-point range this season), he's still clearly a superstar-level player.\n\nDoncic, meanwhile, is leading the NBA in points, free throw attempts and free throw makes per game and is third in assists per game. Reaves, after missing over a month due to a gastrocnemius strain, is starting to get back into game shape and rhythm.\n\nThe Lakers seem a bit overdependent on their three stars to play well in order to win, and they have seldom had all three of them in uniform at the same time this season. But they are first in field-goal percentage and second in free throw attempts a game, and there have been times when they have shown glimpses of what they can be offensively when fully healthy.\n\nL.A. may not go all the way this season, but as Smith said, it could spoil the hopes of a couple of teams above it in the Western Conference standings this April and May.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Stephen A. Smith: Lakers could go deep in playoffs thanks to LeBron",

    "fullText": "SURPRISE—Arizona began last season with three consecutive losses but ended up making it to the College World Series. Something to consider when evaluating the first result of the season.\n\nThe Wildcats dropped their 2026 opener on Friday night, losing 10-7 to Stanford at Surprise Stadium. It snapped a 6-game win streak against their former Pac-12 rivals.\n\nArizona pitchers combined to issue seven walks, something they only did four times all of last season. Three of those were by starter Owen Kramkowski, a career high for the junior right-hander, who didn’t make it out of the 4th inning.\n\nStanford also stole six bases, part of an inauspicious UA debut behind the plate for catcher Roman Meyers, who also was charged with catcher’s interference that led to the Cardinal’s first run.\n\n“Those are things we’ve got to take care of,” said UA coach Chip Hale, who laid equal blame on UA pitchers not being quick enough to the plate. “We’ve got to be more accountable. Teams last year I think were a little leery to run on us with (Adonys Guzman) behind the plate, he had a good reputation. And Roman throws as well as anybody in the country, we just have to give him a chance.”\n\nArizona had 11 hits, its most in a season opener since 2019, but also struck out 15 times. The Wildcats had won 28 consecutive games when scoring at least seven runs including 24-0 in 2025.\n\nKramkowski, who is a projected high draft pick, allowed five runs (four earned) in 3.1 innings. He gave up six hits but three were not well hit.\n\n“He threw way too many pitches in the first couple innings,” Hale said. “I think there was probably what, four balls that literally were squibbers, bloopers. It just adds up on his pitch count, and the first time out, we’re not gonna let him go past the 80-pitch mark. He was not at all as effective as he was last year.”\n\nBut Kramkowski was off the hook after Arizona scored three in the bottom of the 4th to tie it at 5. Oregon State transfer Carson McEntire had an RBI single and Milwaukee transfer Tyler Bickers followed with a 2-run single.\n\nStanford broke it open with a 5-run 6th against a pair of transfer relievers. Nolan Straniero walked three and allowed a 2-run triple, leaving down 8-5, then lefty Patrick Morris gave up a 2-run homer.\n\nThe UA got two back in the bottom of the 6th on back-to-back homers by Meyers and McEntire, though Meyers’ shot was almost erased. Stanford appealed to second base saying Meyers missed the bag, with the 2B umpire calling him out, but Hale challenged and the call was overturned.\n\nThe UA couldn’t do anything else at the plate after that, despite three scoreless innings of relief from senior Matthew Martinez with seven strikeouts. The Wildcats got the leadoff man on in the 7th and 9th, doing so in all but two innings, but also struck out seven times in the last three frames.\n\n“I think we battled, we gave ourselves a chance,” Hale said. “They threw a couple freshmen that we didn’t have any info on, and they did terrific. They outplayed us tonight.”\n\nBickers, McEntire, Meyers and Andrew Cain each had two hits, with Bickers and McEntire driving in two runs each. McEntire, a Peoria native, was playing on the same field where he made his collegiate debut last season with Oregon State.\n\n“I thought it was a good game overall,” McEntire said. “There’s some stuff that we work on as a team, and me personally, that I will go down and talk to some coaches about and see what we can do better tomorrow.”\n\nMcEntire and his new team will be facing his old team on Saturday, as the Wildcats get the Beavers at 2 p.m. MT. OSU, which lost 5-3 to Michigan on Friday, regularly begins its season at Surprise Stadium and the vast majority of the 5,683 in attendance for the day were wearing orange.\n\n“The Beavs come out and show this place out every year,” McEntire said. “This is a thing for them, and it’s awesome to see their fans.”\n\nSophomore righty Smith Bailey will start for Arizona against OSU lefty Ethan Kleinschmit.",

    "description": "Portugal manager Roberto Martinez sits down with Kelly Somers to talk about his life in football.",
    "fullText": "The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport.\n\nWe'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.\n\nInterviews will drop on weekends across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 00:15 GMT on Sunday, 15 February (and after Sportscene in Scotland).\n\nWhen Roberto Martinez first joined Wigan in 1995, he probably did not even dream that nearly 20 years later he would manage them to FA Cup victory.\n\nBut that is exactly how it panned out for the Spaniard, who masterminded their 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the 2013 final.\n\nThe Latics were also relegated from the Premier League that season, and within weeks of their Wembley success Martinez had joined Everton.\n\nThree years later he was sacked - and his two jobs since have been at international level - first with Belgium, and now Portugal.\n\nMartinez, 52, has been in his current role since January 2023, guiding Portugal to their second Nations League title when the beat Spain last year.\n\nLess than a month after that match, Portugal mourned the death of forward Diogo Jota, who died along with his brother Andre Silva in a car crash in northern Spain. Martinez said the team \"want to honour his memory every day\".\n\nIn this extended interview with Kelly Somers, Martinez spoke about a range of things, including winning the FA Cup, Belgium's 'golden generation' and why he has never drunk alcohol.\n\nKelly Somers: Let's start with football. Why football?\n\nRoberto Martinez: For me, it's a way of living. I was born in a family that was breathing football. My dad was mad about football. My dad was a coach at that time - a local team. I would be the mascot and I've got pictures where probably at the age of two and three, I would be listening to the team talks, and I would be in that environment of the dressing room. So that, for me, was a safe zone. I thought that all the kids did that. I thought that was the normal thing to do. And then I realised that it was the opposite. Not many kids had the opportunity to be in a team talk of the local team!\n\nKelly: Was that local team the first proper team you played for?\n\nRoberto: Yes - under-nines. In school in Spain, you play futsal. As a young student, you play with your futsal team in school on Friday and then on Saturday you play with a football team.\n\nKelly: Was there a point where you thought, 'OK, I could make this'... when you were looking around maybe at the other other kids and thought, 'oh, I'm at a good level here'?\n\nRoberto: At 16, if you want to play football, you have to go to a more professional standard. I got the opportunity to go to Zaragoza - move to the big city, study there - and then you see your parents coming to watch the game at the weekend... almost a ritual.\n\nKelly: When you look back on your career, which club do you feel was where you had your most success? Or you enjoyed the most?\n\nRoberto: I enjoyed them all. They were all different, they were all challenging. I think in 1995 when the Bosman ruling came out [enabling football players to leave clubs at the end of their contracts for free], we were the first three Spaniards to come to the UK.\n\nKelly: The 'Three Amigos', weren't you?\n\nRoberto: The 'Three Amigos', yes! I think as a human being, we're always fearful... we don't like change. I was always the opposite. My answer would be: 'Why not?' So... 'Would you like to go to the UK without speaking a word of English and play football?' My answer was: 'Why not?'\n\nKelly: So you couldn't speak any English when you came over?\n\nRoberto: No, no. We arrived the first day at Wigan and I remember the press officer saying: 'Would you mind to do a little bit... a couple of words with the local media?' I said: 'I would love to, but I don't speak a word of English!' And those are the challenges that they really... they make you as a person.\n\nKelly: Let's talk just quickly about that FA Cup final, because that's still one of the greatest shocks... one of the greatest FA Cup finals in history. How do you reflect upon that all these years later?\n\nRoberto: With a lot of pride. Dreams can really happen in the FA Cup. And I think that game... you play the champions of England - Man City - with all the stars. The odds are against the underdog. I think everybody likes it. I always found out that we had so many neutral fans that day... that's what happens in the FA Cup. But to actually perform and deserve to win was very special.\n\nKelly: At what point did you think, 'management is for me'? Was it always management?\n\nRoberto: Always. Always, yeah, because my dad was managing. I thought that was the best.\n\nKelly: Did you almost envisage being a manager before a player?\n\nRoberto: Yes, because I never saw my dad play. And it was fascinating because when I came to the UK in 1995, straight away they tell you there is no 'I' in team. You have to adjust to the group and you have to do whatever it takes to be with the group. The reality doesn't work like that. It's the opposite. You have to address the 'I' before you can create a team. And sometimes you are in the corner of a room thinking... completely different culture, different background, and you expect it to perform without having help to be settled, to feel that you are valuable. There are many aspects that I learned from my own experience of being away from home. Without me knowing it, that was preparing me for that side. You need to get... a team to be together, to have the same goal and to be able to perform on the pitch.\n\nKelly: Other than your dad, who's had the biggest influence on Roberto Martinez the manager?\n\nRoberto: I was intrigued by Johan Cruyff - the way he managed Barcelona. He came in, he changed completely the way that the game was played. I think many, many people in the last 100 years have influenced the game, but I don't think anybody has influenced the game the way that Johan Cruyff did it, because it changed. It was more a technical game, it was a possession-based game, it was about a numerical advantage. And then you created the ones that didn't follow that way of football - they had to find a way to counter that style. I followed many other managers... I think what John Toshack did when he went to Real Sociedad and then went to Real Madrid. I love Pacho Maturana - what he did with the Colombian team. Arrigo Sacchi - so structured and rigorous and methodic. I always enjoyed how managers get their message across to the players and in a different way.\n\nKelly: Have you ever had an opportunity to go and watch any of those managers? We've spoken to Andoni Iraola and Brendan Rodgers this year, and they talked about managers that they went and learned from. Have you had anyone like that - any mentors or anything?\n\nRoberto: I was just watching games. I liked to watch a game and I tried to double-guess: 'How did that happen? How did you take the risk to get to the player to understand what you're trying?' I never went to see anybody work, but I followed many World Cups. I started managing in the Premier League in 2009. Every summer with my wife, I would invite her to go to South Africa first, and then Poland, and then Brazil, and then France. Our holidays were following the big tournaments!\n\nKelly: So she thought she was going on a lovely, exotic holiday, but she was actually going for a tournament...\n\nRoberto: I think the first time, yeah. The first time.\n\nRoberto: And then she knew. I still owe her. From this day, I still owe her a nice honeymoon - because the honeymoon when we got married was South Africa, and she was delighted. She didn't realise that it was the World Cup!\n\nKelly: You've obviously seen management from both sides as well - in terms of club management and international management. How do the two differ?\n\nRoberto: Coaching in the Premier League is about tomorrow and it was about preparing the game that is in front of you, preparing the players so they can make a difference in winning the game. International football is about trying to find out the best talent and then to make it in a structured way, to make it competitive - and you've got three days to do that. That's very different to doing it in a club. Everything is more tactically synchronised - everything can be more methodical. International football is about creating good mood, creating a sense of pride, creating high-performance teams that they follow in their dreams because when you represent your national team, it affects your family... the neighbours. If you win, the whole country wins. When you lose, the whole country loses. It's a completely different way of enjoying the game. I was fascinated about being involved in a World Cup - that was one of my dreams as a kid. The first World Cup I remember - 1978, Argentina - Mario Kempes, scoring in the final, then 1982 was in Spain, so it was a big impact. So for me, the move to international football was just to experience a World Cup. Then I enjoyed it so much that I stayed almost 10 seasons now.\n\nKelly: Let's discuss your time with Belgium, because what an incredible group of players you had there - the 'golden generation', they said. What challenges did that job bring with it and what did you get from that period?\n\nRoberto: First and foremost was to cope with that tag of 'golden generation'. It wasn't a pressure that the players were not used to because obviously you're talking about the players that were in the most demanding dressing rooms. From Eden Hazard to Kevin de Bruyne, Dries Mertens, Romelu Lukaku, Axel Witsel, Jan Vertonghen, Thomas Vermaelen, Vincent Kompany, Thibaut Courtois, Yannick Carrasco... you're talking about the generation. But I think we managed to focus on, 'OK, let's be as good as we can together and let's become the golden generation.'\n\nI think that was a beautiful journey to go to the World Cup in 2018. After seven games, we won six. We only lost the semi-final against France 1-0 - there were little margins - but then we came third by winning the bronze medal in the last game. That is the moment that it became the golden generation. At that moment, it was a shift into what we could do from that point on and that team stayed four years consecutively with the number one ranking. It was a very interesting time to try to get a focus of everybody having that common goal that was trying to make history for Belgian football and it was really, really enjoyable.\n\nKelly: I always ask in these interviews for my interviewee to tell me a game from their career, playing or managerial, that they wish they could relive...\n\nRoberto: I think if I could relive a game it would be the semi-final with Belgium against France because we lost 1-0. I felt we were the better team - we had almost 60% possession - and it was just decided by one action... and if it is one game that I could relive to try to change it, it would be that one.\n\nKelly: Do you think about it a lot, or are you able to just park it now?\n\nRoberto: No, sometimes I like to think about it. If we were going to play it again with the same situation, what could have been done differently? And that helps. I think the margins are so small. You've got the best players possible of two generations and I think you can learn from already having the experience of being in a game like that.\n\nKelly: And you've not got a bad crop of players now at Portugal, have you? You've already won the Nations League and what an opportunity potentially ahead for you. The pressure is going to be there again.\n\nRoberto: But it's an enjoyable pressure because it is true... we arrived in Portugal - huge tradition, always created big players through the history now that we celebrated the moment that Eusebio won the Ballon d'Or in 1965. You've got players like Luis Figo, Joao Pinto, Rui Costa... it's a tradition in Portugal, but they won everything apart from the World Cup. We got an incredible commitment from the players because this is probably a mixture of four generations. You've got the captain [Cristiano Ronaldo], who is 41 years old, to the youngest player who was born the year the captain made his debut for the national team. So, we're looking forward. The first step was to qualify. We did that and I always believe that there has never been a winning team that arrives to the tournament. The winning team becomes the winning team in the tournament.\n\nKelly: That captain, of course, is Cristiano Ronaldo. What's it like managing him?\n\nRoberto: Very easy, because of his high standards, his expectations of how the work should be done and his commitment to the game. He truly is an example of what you should do to represent Portugal and the national team. And now he's adapted, obviously, after 21 years in the national team - he's adjusted. He's a goalscorer, he's an important player for us, and it's the player that he is now that is important for me. As a national team coach, a player that has scored 25 goals in the last 30 international games... it's not that he's playing because of what he's done in the past, it's what he's done now.\n\nKelly: The question everyone's asking at the moment is: 'How long can he go on for?' As someone that's seen him close up, how long do you think he can keep playing for?\n\nRoberto: Well, we got all the stats. If you were going to analyse a player that is dropping at physical level, that's not the case. His physical stats are of a player that could go on and on and on. I think it's more a question of when he'll feel that is the right time. I think he's a player that is very critical with himself. When he doesn't see that he can help the team, he'll be the one that will decide when to stop.\n\nKelly: You've got two girls and you're married to a Scottish lady, is that correct?\n\nKelly: Is that from your time in Scotland?\n\nRoberto: In Motherwell, yeah. That was the best thing!\n\nKelly: So that must be quite the culture kind of mix at home?\n\nRoberto: Especially when you are the international team coach of Portugal playing against Scotland. I think it's been four times now that we played with Belgium against Scotland. Obviously with my wife, it's not a problem. It's more the in-laws - it's difficult for them to support a team that is different than Scotland! But, no, that's part of the fun. I'm very, very lucky and probably that's the biggest achievement that I want to have in my life is to be the best father that I can be and the best husband that I can be. Everything else is going to be just part of the journey.\n\nKelly: Tell me something about yourself that might surprise me.\n\nRoberto: I've never tasted alcohol.\n\nRoberto: Yeah. And it was a promise. When I was 16 and I had the opportunity to go to Zaragoza, I went to my dad and I said: 'I really want to go.' And I said: 'What do you think?' He said: Well, it's the worst thing you could do because you're going to be very young - 16. You're going to be away from home and the first thing you're going to do is start drinking, start smoking, you're going to give up your studies.' And I said: 'Well, I promise you, I'll do my degree, I'll never drink, I'll never smoke.' And then since that day, that was my commitment, so I'm 52 now and I'm proud to say that I never touched a drop of alcohol.\n\nKelly: If you were to win the World Cup next summer...?\n\nRoberto: Probably, yes, I would be quite happy to make another commitment!\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "The Scottish Premiership title race takes a different turn as Heart of Midlothian and Rangers go head-to-head in a decisive top-of-the-table clash at Ibrox Stadium.\n\nBoth sides head into this clash with four points between them, although a win for Hearts will take them one step closer to ending the Glasgow clubs’ stranglehold on the Premiership.\n\nRangers fans have been put through an emotional rollercoaster throughout the 2025/26 campaign. Yet it could still end with a first league title since the 2020/21 season.\n\nThe Gers kicked off the campaign in terrible form as they failed to find any rhythm or confidence under Russell Martin’s leadership.\n\nThey won just one of their first eight league games (D6, L1) and also suffered a gut-wrenching exit from the Champions League qualifiers, which only worsened the gloom around Ibrox.\n\nPerformances were flat and lacked any conviction. Results were nonexistent, and belief began to fade.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Rangers to cut Martin loose and turn to German tactician Danny Rohl. The 36-year-old didn’t have the softest landing, winning just two of his first five games in charge (L3).\n\nUnsurprisingly, murmurs of discontent began to grow across Ibrox, but unlike his predecessor, Rohl found a way to turn things around.\n\nThe German manager has since lost just three of his subsequent 22 games in charge across all competitions (W14, D5).\n\nThat remarkable upturn in performances and results also sent Rangers shooting up the Premiership table after winning nine of their 12 league games (D2, L1).\n\nNow sitting second on 52 points, Rangers trail leaders Heart by five points.\n\nRohl has made it clear that his side need to “take the opportunity” as a win could cut that gap to two and turn a difficult season into a genuine title challenge.\n\nMeanwhile, Hearts have a golden opportunity to tighten their grip at the Premiership summit by claiming all three points against Rangers this weekend.\n\nThe Jambos are looking to become the first team outside Glasgow to win the Premiership in over four decades, and Tony Bloom’s investment has played a massive role in their title challenge.\n\nThe Brighton & Hove Albion owner has transformed Hearts’ transfer strategy, using a data-led approach to level the playing field despite spending only a fraction of the outlay from their title rivals.\n\nHearts centre-back Craig Halkett has made it clear that his side will “try and win the game” on Sunday, claiming the Jambos are heading into the fixture with the same mindset as every other match.\n\nA win would stretch their lead at the top to eight points, giving them real breathing space heading into the run-in and that kind of result could spur them to the title.\n\nHowever, Hearts have stuttered in recent weeks, with Derek McInnes’ side winning just two of their last five games in all competitions.\n\nThere has been one defeat and two draws in that run, including a painful cup exit on penalties to Falkirk.\n\nThat dip in form comes after a remarkable run of results that had seen Hearts claim 19 wins from their previous 27 games, while posting only two defeats (D6).\n\nDespite that run, Hearts will head into the potential title-decider brimming with confidence following their dramatic 1-0 win over Hibernian in midweek.\n\nA last minute goal from Tomas Magnusson kept their title challenge alive and that could spark further belief ahead of Sunday’s blockbuster clash with Rangers.\n\nTheir away form also offers comfort. No team in the Scottish Premiership has earned more points on the road this season.\n\nAnd when they last visited Ibrox, a Lawrence Shankland double secured a confident 2-0 win, which proves they can rise to the occasion.\n\nRangers will be without Bailey Rice, Connor Barron, Derek Cornelius and Max Aarons due to injury issues.\n\nHearts will also be unable to call upon Calem Nieuwenhof, Cameron Devlin, Finlay Pollock, Shankland and Stephen Kingsley due to injuries.",

    "title": "SnowBall: Iterative Context Processing When It Won't Fit in the LLM Window",
    "description": "Learn how Enji.ai's SnowBall algorithm processes massive LLM contexts iteratively, overcoming token limits and \"lost in the middle\" issues in analytical pipelines.",
    "fullText": "Roman Panarin\n\n ML Engineer\n\nGet AI-powered insights from this Enji tech article:\n\nAt Enji.ai, we have an agent pipeline with 35 nodes: router_agent, planning_agent, language_detection_agent, agent_choice_agent, and 31 more. Each node pulls data through text2sql or RAG, collects results, and sends everything to the LLM as a single context. For small teams, this works fine, but when Global Access mode kicks in, with access to all company projects at once, the context balloons.\n\nSpecifically, on one of our client projects with a team of 46+ people, a single workweek accumulates so much data from trackers and Git that the context exceeds 1,500K tokens. Meanwhile, we're using qwen3-32b through Groq, where the ceiling is 131,072 tokens. The request simply fails with an error if you don't do something about it.\n\nBut even if the window were larger, there's a second problem. The \"Lost in the Middle\" study (Stanford, published in TACL 2024) showed that models have a characteristic U-shaped attention curve: they work well with information at the beginning and end of context but lose up to 30% accuracy on data from the middle. With our SQL results, where a key developer's worklogs might end up in the middle, this is a very real loss of response quality.\n\nThere's an approach called SnowBall, the \"snowball effect.\" Instead of trying to cram everything into one call, we slice the context into chunks and process them sequentially, each time enriching the intermediate result with a new portion of data.\n\nEssentially, this is the same pattern that LangChain calls Refine, iterative refinement. The difference is that for us it's not a separate call in a chain, but a transparent wrapper over ainvoke(). The developer calls the model as usual, and the system decides on its own whether to split the context.\n\nHere's what the entry point looks like in LLMGenerator:\n\nThe check works like this: we count tokens through get_num_tokens, compare with the model config limit (131,072 for qwen3-32b). If it fits, it's a regular call. If not, launch SnowBall.\n\nThe algorithm consists of two phases. First, we cut user_message into chunks, then run them sequentially, accumulating a summary:\n\nThe 20% reserve from the limit is a buffer for the system prompt, for the snowball_prompt itself, and for serialization overhead. With a 131K limit, you get a chunk of about 105K tokens. For slicing, we use CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder from LangChain, which counts chunk size in tokens, not characters, which is crucial for accurate counting. Overlap between chunks is 20 tokens to avoid losing context at boundaries.\n\nIn practice, for a typical Global Access request over a week for our client, you get 2-3 chunks. That's 2-3 sequential LLM calls instead of one that failed.\n\nIn regular mode (system + user message), it's simple: we slice user_message into chunks by tokens. But when the LLM uses tools (SQL queries, RAG), the context is more complex: there's not just text, but a chain of SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage with tool_calls, and ToolMessage with results. You can't slice such a chain by tokens: you lose the connection between the tool call and its response.\n\nFor this, there's a separate class, BoundLLMGenerator. Its _build_message_batches method groups messages as a whole, trying not to break tool_call/tool_result pairs. Only if a single message itself exceeds the limit (happens when SQL returns a huge table) does it get sliced into chunks.\n\nSplitting into two classes allows us not to drag tool-batching logic into the base code and vice versa. LLMGenerator.bind_tools(tools) returns BoundLLMGenerator, so switching between modes happens automatically.\n\nLatency grows linearly with the number of chunks. A 200K token context means 5-6 sequential calls. For analytical queries from a manager, where the response is needed in seconds or minutes rather than milliseconds, this is acceptable. For real-time chat, not so much.\n\nThere's information loss between iterations. Each summarization step loses something, and on long chains (5+ chunks), this accumulates. We haven't yet encountered critical degradation on our data, but for tasks requiring precise numerical aggregation (hour totals, task counts), this is a potential problem. In such cases, hierarchical summarization works better, where aggregations are calculated at each level separately; this is well covered in the CoTHSSum study (Springer, 2025).\n\nAnother point is graceful degradation. If one chunk fails with an error (Groq timeout, invalid JSON in response), the loop continues with the previous summary. We lose information from that chunk, but we don't lose the entire response.\n\nWe considered alternatives. Microsoft's LLMLingua compresses prompts by removing non-essential tokens through a small compressor model (GPT2-small or LLaMA-7B). Works great on texts with \"fluff\"; up to 20x compression. But our data is SQL results: tables with fields like employee name, detail, and hours. There, every token carries a semantic load, and aggressive compression cuts out important information we're not willing to lose.\n\nMap-Reduce could help with parallelization. Process chunks simultaneously, then merge results. But our context doesn't break down into independent pieces. One developer's worklogs might be in the first chunk, and related tasks in the second. Map-Reduce would lose this connection, while Refine/SnowBall preserves it because the summary accumulates.\n\nGisting is a beautiful idea (26x compression, 40% FLOP savings), but requires fine-tuning the model on our data. For a startup that iterates on the product every week and changes prompts, this isn't an option yet. But we're generally thinking about our own Enji LLM model and might apply Gisting there.\n\nAll open-source models in the Enji pipeline run through Groq with qwen3-32b. Groq today is the only inference provider that supports the full 131K window for this model (the model itself natively works at 32K and extends to 131K through YaRN).\n\nMeanwhile, tokens_limit isn't just an API restriction but a threshold for enabling SnowBall. If you switch to a provider with a larger window, SnowBall will trigger less frequently or not at all. No code changes needed.\n\nSnowBall solves a specific problem: it lets you work with context that physically won't fit in the model window. It's not the most efficient compression method, nor the fastest, and information is lost on each iteration. But for our use case (analytical queries on large teams through an agent pipeline) it's a working solution that doesn't require additional infrastructure and doesn't change the interface for developers.\n\nMIT recently proposed Recursive Language Models, an approach where the model can recursively access the full uncompressed context instead of summarization. Benchmarks show 91% accuracy on 10M+ tokens. When this becomes available in production inference, SnowBall will likely become unnecessary. But as long as context windows are finite and data keeps growing, iterative processing works.\n\n[How to Switch From SOTA LLMs to Local OSS LLMs]\n\nBuild production AI systems with local open-source models.

    "description": "Humans haven’t been back to the lunar surface since the Apollo moon program ended over five decade ago. The reasons why go beyond science, according to experts.",
    "fullText": "As he took his final steps before leaving the moon, Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan had some poignant closing words: “We leave as we came, and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.”\n\nIt was December 14, 1972, and Cernan knew his footprints would be the last to impress the lunar soil for a while, because the planned Apollo missions that were supposed to follow — 18, 19 and 20 — had long since been canceled. But he probably wouldn’t have guessed that, over 50 years later, his speech would stand as the last words spoken by a human on the moon.\n\nArtemis II, which NASA is preparing to launch as soon as March after recent testing delays, will perform a lunar fly-by rather than a landing. Still, the mission will mark humanity’s first journey to the vicinity of the moon since Apollo 17.\n\nSo why has it taken so long for astronauts to go back?\n\n“The short answer to that question is political will,” said Teasel Muir-Harmony, a historian of science and technology and the curator of the Apollo Collection at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. “It takes a whole lot of political will to send humans to the moon. These are extremely complex, really costly, major national investments. It has to be a priority over a sustained period of time.”\n\nIn the years since the Apollo program ended due to budget cuts, there have been a number of other federal initiatives to send humans to the moon again, Muir-Harmony added. “But what’s happened is that as presidential administrations changed, space priorities for these large-scale programs also changed. And so we just haven’t seen the sustained political will to follow through with a program that will take many years, significant funding and lots of resources in general.”\n\nLes Johnson, a former NASA chief technologist who worked at the agency for over three decades, agreed that rapidly changing political objectives have been a key factor: “Every four to eight years, NASA has its human spaceflight goals and objectives completely, totally, radically altered,” he said.\n\n“When I joined NASA in 1990, we were directed to go back to the moon by then President George H.W. Bush. But when President Clinton took office in 1993, he canceled that. He said, we’re going to make the space station happen — don’t do anything associated with going back to the moon,” Johnson said. “We did that for eight years, and then in 2001 we got George W. Bush, and he said, cancel all this other stuff and let’s focus on going back to the moon. So we did, and a project called Constellation was born, which survived the two terms of the second Bush presidency.”\n\nThe cycle continued with Barack Obama moving NASA’s priorities more toward sampling asteroids, and President Donald Trump coming in and shifting back to lunar goals. Then, after 2020, Joe Biden broke up the pattern.\n\n“He was the first president in my career at NASA who did not change everything,” Johnson said of Biden. “He said, I really didn’t like a lot of what Trump did, but I think going back to the moon is a good idea. Let’s just keep going.” Now, in Trump’s second term, his administration has recently doubled down on returning astronauts to the lunar surface — intent on outpacing China in the new space race.\n\nPolitical hurdles aside, however, moon missions also present a remarkable technical challenge. Earth’s natural satellite is roughly a quarter of a million miles (over 400,000 kilometers) away, and over half of all lunar landing attempts have ended in failure. The Artemis program — making use of a rocket and spacecraft that have taken two decades and more than $50 billion to complete — is NASA’s latest and most promising attempt to bring such feats within reach.\n\nMany similarities between Apollo and Artemis are undeniable, including a near match in the mission profile between Apollo 8 and Artemis II, but re-creating the Apollo program today wouldn’t have been a practical — or logical — option.\n\nLong gone are the supply chains and skilled machinists that built the hardware for those mid-20th century moon missions.\n\n“People ask what was wrong with Apollo,” Wayne Hale, a former NASA space shuttle program manager, previously said during a Human Exploration and Operations Committee meeting. “The thing that was wrong with Apollo was it ended.”\n\nOne oft-mentioned piece of Apollo lore is that the program’s spacecraft and rockets were controlled by computers less powerful than a modern smartphone. And NASA has put many of those advancements to use, particularly when it comes to the robotic exploration of other worlds.\n\nBut spaceflight — and human spaceflight in particular — is far too complex, dangerous and expensive to directly translate computing advancements to easier, cheaper moon missions.\n\nThe technology regular folks interact with on Earth also has the benefit of being tested by millions of users and improved over decades of mass production.\n\nComplex missions to deep space, however, require multibillion-dollar contracts and years of continuous work toward the same goal — a scenario that has been hard to come by in the years since Apollo as presidential administrations have stopped and started various flagship human exploration programs.\n\nThe Artemis program is the most successful moon program the United States has had in decades, noted Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit exploration advocacy group — “because it still exists.”\n\nAt the technical level, the differences between the Apollo and Artemis spacecraft are vast. For starters, Orion’s flight computers are 20,000 times faster and possess 128,000 times more memory than the lone machine that guided Apollo.\n\nThe Orion capsule offers the crew — increased from three to four — more space and opportunities for exercise and entertainment. And a much better toilet. “With the Apollo program, the astronauts had a waste collection device which was like a plastic bag with a rim, and they would stick it upon themselves. Not the most pleasant experience,” Muir-Harmony said.\n\nAboard Orion, which has about a third more habitable space than Apollo, the crew will enjoy the luxury of a real bathroom. “It’s a little room tucked into the spacecraft that they can go inside,” Muir-Harmony said. “It looks like a little closet or a little phone booth. It’s small, but there’s some privacy, which is pretty essential when you have a crew that’s both men and women.”\n\nDuring the Apollo era, she added, the bathroom issue was part of the discussion around whether women should be astronauts. “The Soviet program had a woman fly in space 20 years before the United States did. But some people said that designing bathroom technology for women in space was going to be too complicated,” Muir-Harmony said. “You can debate that, but it is important to think through privacy when you have a crew of both men and women, and so they were able to achieve that with the design of the Orion spacecraft.”\n\nIn-space bathrooms have come a long way since Apollo. The International Space Station, for example, has a comparatively spacious stall for washing and using the toilet. And the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has transported astronauts to and from the orbiting laboratory, has a small private area with a vacuum toilet.\n\nThe goals of the two programs are also markedly different. Apollo already accomplished the one-off “flags and footprints” missions, Hale said.\n\nNow, NASA wants to create the infrastructure that will allow astronauts to live and work at a lunar base — eventually creating a sustainable, permanent human presence on the moon.\n\n“That means the landers that are being developed are designed to remain for longer than a day. They’re meant to be a part of a bigger architecture or system that will eventually have habitats on the moon,” Johnson said, adding that while the upcoming flight of Artemis II is reminiscent of Apollo 8, the programs will diverge dramatically after that.\n\nThe rise of the commercial space industry has helped fuel this decisive push toward revamping moon plans, according to Brian Odom, NASA’s chief historian.\n\n“NASA is now a customer to a private industry where we have SpaceX, Boeing, Blue Origin. That’s an enabling factor that’s helped us,” Odom said.\n\nSpaceX is among the biggest of those partners, and its CEO, Elon Musk, recently announced a dramatic shift in the company’s focus from prioritizing sending humans to Mars to first building “a self-growing city on the Moon.”\n\nHowever, Odom added, getting back to the moon has always been dependent on a number of pieces falling into place. “Space is very difficult and requires a lot of different things coming together at one time. Commercial commitments, international commitments and now the government — all three working together, is what’s really enabled us to get to this point,” he said.\n\n“It’s been a long road, but going back has always been a strategy, and it’s emerged in a couple of different moments. Now we have the infrastructure in place, we have partners in place — and it’s becoming possible.”\n\nCrucially, prolonged human presence on lunar soil will also benefit from the experience gained through the programs that followed the Apollo era, such as the International Space Station, where humans have had a permanent presence for over 25 years.\n\n“Returning to the moon will require long-term stays on the lunar surface, and thus understanding the effects of space habitation on the human body,” said James W. Head, a research professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Brown University who worked on the Apollo program.\n\n“And robotic missions flown in the interim, such as NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, have provided information on where to go and find the resources necessary to support human presence, indicating the possibility of water resources trapped at the lunar poles.”\n\nAnd if world leaders need extra motivation, Head added, they should look to the words of Apollo 16 Commander John Young, who was asked before retiring in 2004 what the point was of spending money to go to the moon. “Earth’s geologic history is pretty clear: It says, quite frankly, that single-planet species don’t last,” Young said.\n\nThe Apollo program had to contend with the deadline imposed by President John F. Kennedy, who in 1961 declared to Congress his goal to land a man on the moon before the decade was out. He wanted to beat the Soviet Union, which had already put a satellite and a man in orbit before the US.\n\n“A critical element to understanding the early space race and why the United States sent humans to the moon was the Cold War context, and the competition for the hearts and minds of the world,” Muir-Harmony said. “The United States was quite worried about Soviet influence, especially in newly established countries. Space exploration was seen as a really important tool of influence internationally.”\n\nToday, the United States considers China to be its archrival, and the government has sought allies to sign onto its vision of the future of lunar exploration with a set of international agreements called the Artemis Accords, which over 60 nations have now joined.\n\nThe nonbinding accords outline a safe, peaceful and sustainable approach to civil space exploration. They build upon the existing 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which states that no nation can claim territory in space as its own or use it to harbor weapons of mass destruction. However, the Artemis Accords were not negotiated multilaterally in the same manner as the Outer Space Treaty, and some analysts argue that they violate some of its principles, for example by allowing commercial mining on the moon.\n\nGoing back to the moon for a long-term presence and building an infrastructure in the lunar environment wouldn’t be sustainable for a single country, Odom said. “I think that’s what makes the Artemis Accords so good — they create a framework for opportunity, but they also double down on the idea that this is for humanity, not just one nation.”\n\nHowever, even though no other country has ever come close to sending a crewed mission to the moon, China also has concrete plans to do so by 2030 — and is not a signatory of the Artemis Accords.\n\n“There may be a perception that the US is in a race with China to the moon,” Odom said.\n\n“Maybe there’s a second space race, but I think that’s always going to be balanced with understanding risk, something that had become problematic in the early years of Apollo, when the idea that you had to do it before the end of the decade became a primary driver, and may have cost the lives of three crewmen,” he added, referring to the Apollo 1 accident in 1967 that killed all three crew members as a fire broke out in the cabin during a launch rehearsal.\n\nSince Apollo, Odom noted, the Challenger and Columbia disasters also cemented a more grounded approach to risk: “We’ve learned so many lessons the hard way, and now those lessons are being applied.”\n\nNASA’s Artemis program is sending humans into deep space for the first time in five decades.",

    "fullText": "Two Alexander brothers had sex with a protesting woman in the backyard of a Hamptons rental as other partygoers joined in or watched, according to testimony in the third week of the siblings' Manhattan sex trafficking trial.\n\n\"She was over and over and over asking them to stop,\" a witness told the jury of an unnamed woman she described as intoxicated and \"screaming\" for help in a hot tub.\n\nIt was Saturday night on Memorial Day weekend in 2009. Tal Alexander and \"one of the twins\" — the witness couldn't say if it was Alon or Oren Alexander — were among those sexually assaulting the woman, according to the testimony.\n\n\"It seemed nobody was taking action,\" said the witness, Avishan Bodjnoud, an information management executive at the United Nations.\n\nBodjnoud said she asked the people around her to do something, but no one would. In the midst of a party, \"there were no allies there to help,\" Bodjnoud said.\n\nShe felt too fearful and too alone in her outrage to contact the police, Bodjnoud told the jury.\n\nInstead, she fled the party in a taxi, but not before scrawling \"Rapists\" and \"You need to apologize\" in eyeliner on the front door and wall of the Southampton rental, Bodjnoud testified.\n\nThe disturbing testimony capped the third week of the trial of former luxury real estate brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and their brother, Alon.\n\nSo far — roughly halfway through the federal trial — nine accusers have taken the stand. In sometimes tearful testimony, they have described being sexually assaulted behind closed doors by one or more of the brothers, including on a cruise ship, at two Hamptons rentals, and at an Aspen ski resort.\n\nThe hot tub incident stands out as the only alleged assault to take place in public view, with a pool party in full swing. It is not clear whether prosecutors will call the woman herself to the stand or whether she was ever identified.\n\nLawyers for the brothers say that any sex was consensual and not trafficking. In their cross-examinations of witnesses, the lawyers have repeatedly pointed out that none of the women called the police or took a drug test that could substantiate their claims of being drugged.\n\nDuring cross-examination, a defense lawyer for Tal Alexander challenged Bodjnoud's testimony that she remained silent out of fear for the brothers' power and influence.\n\n\"Were you aware that in 2009, Tal Alexander was a 21-year-old copy machine salesman?\" asked the lawyer, Milton Williams.\n\nA second witness to the alleged hot tub assault testified on Thursday and Friday under the pseudonym \"Isa Brooks.\"\n\nBrooks told jurors she saw \"a girl, I believe, in a green bikini with a bunch of guys on top of her.\"\n\nShe said she heard another woman — who, like her, was indoors looking out into the yard — cry out, \"I work for the UN and I know what you're doing!\"\n\nOren Alexander, who was outside, slammed the door in that woman's face, Brooks testified.\n\nBrooks was called to testify to her own alleged assault, which she said took place earlier in the day on that same Saturday. She was days away from her 17th birthday.\n\nShe described struggling and falling in and out of consciousness as Tal Alexander and Alon Alexander, whom she described as the \"quieter twin,\" joined with two other men in violently assaulting her on a bed.\n\nThe four men were saying \"degrading words\" during the attack, Brooks told the jury.\n\n\"I was wondering why they hated me,\" she recalled thinking.\n\nOn cross-examination, Brooks was questioned by the defense about photographs showing her celebrating her 17th birthday with school pals days after the incident, and was asked why, days after that, she and a girlfriend stayed overnight at another Hamptons home where Tal Alexander was also present.\n\n\"I was scared to rock the boat,\" she responded of her reluctance to speak out or call the authorities. \"I was scared that I would get in trouble.\"\n\nThe brothers face up to life in prison if convicted of a top count of sex trafficking conspiracy.",

    "title": "14 More Lessons from 14 years at Google",
    "description": "More lessons learned from 14 years of engineering at Google, focusing on what truly matters beyond just writing great code.",
    "fullText": "A while back, I wrote down 21 lessons from my time at Google. The response caught me off guard because of which ones stuck. It wasn’t tech-specific advice. It was the stuff about people, decisions, and the messy reality of building things together.\n\nThat made me realize I’d left a lot on the table. The first list skewed toward individual craft - how to write better code, how to think about your career. But some of the hardest lessons I’ve learned aren’t about how you work. They’re about how teams work: how decisions actually get made, where coordination breaks down, what separates the groups that ship from the ones that spin.\n\nThese lessons pick up where the first left off. They’re less about being a better individual engineer and more about the systems around the engineering.\n\nEvery yes is an implicit no to something else.\n\nI’ve watched talented engineers burn out because they said yes to everything - every bug, every feature request, every “quick favor.” Their calendar filled up with other people’s priorities, and their own roadmap became a graveyard of half-finished ideas.\n\nSometimes it’s just because they truly do care so much about the product. Protect your bandwidth from “nice to have” the same way you protect production from outages. The skill is doing the right things and letting the wrong things stay undone.\n\nThe engineers who create disproportionate impact aren’t necessarily faster or smarter. They’re more ruthless about what deserves their attention. They’ve learned that the opportunity cost of working on the wrong thing is working on the wrong thing.\n\nMost meetings fail not because they’re unnecessary, but because they’re disguised journaling. I’ve sat through hundreds of hours where smart people talked around a problem without ever naming what they needed. The meeting ends with vibes and no owner.\n\nI learned to start with the ask: approve, choose, unblock, or inform.\n\nJust those four words changed how I prepare for every meeting. If I can’t pick one, I’m not ready to take anyone’s time. And when I’m on the receiving end, I’ve started asking “what decision do you need from me?” within the first two minutes. It sounds blunt, but people are usually relieved - they often didn’t realize they hadn’t defined it themselves.\n\nThe hidden cost of vague meetings isn’t just the hour you lose. It’s the week of drift that follows while everyone waits for clarity that never came.\n\nThe difference between motion and progress is specificity.\n\nTeams drown in intentions. I’ve watched roadmaps fill up with “we should improve the onboarding flow” and “we should reduce latency” and “we should document the API.” Months later, the same items are still there, gathering dust and guilt. You might think that’s a solved problem now that we have agentic engineering, but not quite.\n\nConvert talk into the smallest next action someone can actually do, then put a name and a date on it. Not “we should improve onboarding” but “On Tuesday, Sarah will run three user sessions and document the top friction points.”\n\nThis is about respecting that humans need traction to make progress. Vague intentions create anxiety. Specific commitments create momentum. The plan doesn’t have to be perfect - it just has to be concrete enough that someone can actually start.\n\nSpeed is about removing the friction that makes smart people hesitate. “Bias towards action” when you can.\n\nWhen a project drags, the instinct is to blame velocity: people aren’t working hard enough, the codebase is messy, there aren’t enough engineers. But in my experience, slow code is often a symptom. Slow decisions are the disease.\n\nIf decisions routinely take weeks or months, look deeper. Missing context means people can’t evaluate tradeoffs. Unclear ownership means everyone’s waiting for someone else to decide. Fear of accountability means people hedge instead of commit.\n\nThe fastest engineering team I ever worked with wasn’t the one with the best programmers. It was the one where decisions happened in hours instead of weeks because the authority was clear, the context was shared, and being wrong wasn’t a career risk.\n\nUsers don’t praise reliability but they do notice its absence.\n\nThis creates a dangerous dynamic: reliability work is invisible until it fails, which means it’s perpetually under-resourced compared to shiny new features.\n\nError budgets are one way to make the tradeoff explicit. If your service has an SLO of 99.9% uptime, you have a “budget” of 0.1% downtime to spend on innovation. Burn through it, and you focus on reliability until you’ve earned it back. This is a framework for having honest conversations about risk.\n\nThe teams that maintain both velocity and reliability don’t do it through heroics. They do it by treating reliability as a first-class product feature with its own roadmap, its own metrics, and its own advocates.\n\nYou wouldn’t ship a feature without product review. Don’t ship a system without some kind of reliability discussion.\n\nTeam interaction modes exist for a reason: collaboration (working closely together), service (clear API and SLAs), or facilitation (one team helping another build capability).\n\nMost cross-team pain isn’t about effort or good intentions. It’s about unclear boundaries and messy contracts. I’ve watched teams “improve communication” by adding more meetings, more Slack channels, more syncs - and it doesn’t make things better.\n\nThe problem isn’t that people aren’t talking. It’s that the interface between teams is undefined. Who owns what? What’s the contract? What can team A depend on team B for, and vice versa?\n\nChoose deliberately, and you’ll need fewer meetings to make things work. Try to paper over a bad interface with communication, and you’ll burn out your most collaborative people while the underlying dysfunction remains.\n\n“Here’s the problem” is half the job. I used to think my role was to identify issues and bring them to leadership. That’s necessary but insufficient.\n\n“Here are two options, the tradeoffs, and what I recommend” is how you get unblocked and earn trust. It shows you’ve done the thinking. It gives decision-makers something super specific to react to instead of an open-ended problem to solve.\n\nIt makes their job easier, which makes them more likely to give you what you need.\n\nThe difference between “I need help” and “I need you to choose between A and B, and here’s why I lean toward B” is the difference between being a problem-raiser and being a problem-solver.\n\nBoth identify issues. Only one earns increasing trust and autonomy.\n\nThe hero is burned out, undocumented, and a single point of failure.\n\nIf one person saving the day is a recurring pattern, that’s a failure mode rather than a badge of honor. I’ve seen teams celebrate their heroes while ignoring the dysfunction that made heroism necessary.\n\nWhen they leave - and they always leave eventually - the team discovers that no one else really knows how things work. The celebration of heroism masks a systemic problem: the path for “normal humans on a normal day” doesn’t work.\n\nMake the normal path the default. Document the system. Spread the knowledge. Design for the average Tuesday, not the exceptional crisis. Heroes should be unnecessary, and if they’re necessary, you should be working to make them unnecessary.\n\nA feature without telemetry is a liability in disguise.\n\nIf you ship a feature without knowing how it behaves in production, you shipped uncertainty.\n\nI’ve watched teams celebrate launches only to discover weeks later that their feature was silently failing for 20% of users. They had no logs, no metrics, no dashboards but a gap where understanding should be. This can cause all kinds of pain if you want to fix it, including unshipping just to properly A/B test with observability in place.\n\nLogs, traces, dashboards, and alerts aren’t “ops work.” They’re how you learn. They’re how you know whether the thing you built actually works for real people doing real things in real conditions.\n\nThe best engineers I know treat observability as part of the definition of done. Not “I wrote the code” but “I wrote the code and I can see it working.”\n\nSmall changes are easier to review, easier to reason about, and easier to revert.\n\nI used to write large pull requests. I liked the idea of a complete feature being reviewable at once. I was optimizing for my convenience at the expense of my reviewers’ sanity. Smaller PRs are often better for everyone.\n\nThey ship faster because they don’t sit in a review queue while someone tries to find an hour to understand your thousand-line diff. If you want teammates to trust your pace, make your work reviewable.\n\nThe hidden benefit is that small PRs force you to think in increments. Instead of one monolithic change, you build up capability piece by piece. Each piece gets feedback. Each piece can be rolled back independently. It’s slower per-PR but faster to actual production.\n\nCoordination cost grows faster than headcount.\n\nThis is why “just throw more people at the problem” often fails, and why adding heads late in a project can make it later. Every new person adds communication overhead with everyone they need to coordinate with. The graph gets denser, not just larger.\n\nI’ve seen managers genuinely puzzled when a team doubled in size but output barely changed. The answer is always the same: the new edges ate the new capacity. More people meant more alignment meetings, more context-sharing, more waiting for decisions that now required more stakeholders.\n\nThe solution isn’t to stop hiring. It’s to be intentional about reducing edges. Clear ownership. Autonomous teams with minimal dependencies. Interfaces that let people work in parallel instead of in lockstep. The best organizations aren’t the ones with the most people - they’re the ones with the most leverage per person.\n\nEvery migration is a negotiation between the system you have, the system you want, and the people who didn’t ask for either.\n\nI’ve seen migrations estimated at one quarter stretch to years. Not because the technical work was wrong, but because nobody accounted for the human work: convincing teams to prioritize your migration over their roadmap, supporting the long tail of edge cases nobody knew existed, and maintaining two systems in parallel while the old one refuses to die.\n\nThe technical plan is the easy part. The hard part is designing for coexistence. You will run old and new simultaneously for longer than you think. You will discover that the “legacy” system encodes decisions nobody documented and workflows nobody remembers designing but everyone depends on. You will need a adoption strategy that doesn’t require every team to drop what they’re doing at once.\n\nThe migrations that actually finish share three traits: a sponsor who stays engaged past the kickoff, a team that really owns the migration instead of treating it as a side quest, and a clear deprecation date that people believe is real. Without all three, you get a migration that’s perpetually “almost done” - which is worse than not starting, because now you’re paying the cost of two systems indefinitely.\n\nIf you’re not willing to fund the finish, don’t start the migration.\n\nEveryone can generate code now. The barrier to producing code, content, designs - it’s largely collapsing. AI will write you ten versions of anything in the time it used to take to write one.\n\nThe differentiator is choosing: what to build, what to delete, what to simplify, what not to ship, and what “good” looks like. Taste - the ability to distinguish between options and pick the right one - becomes the scarce resource.\n\nUse AI to explore options fast, then apply judgment ruthlessly. The engineers who thrive in this environment won’t be the ones who generate the most. They’ll be the ones who curate the best.\n\nProduction is cheap. Editing is expensive. Selection is everything.\n\nThis is the highest-leverage thing you can build. Not a system but credibility.\n\nWhen people trust you, they don’t need five meetings to approve a decision. They assume competence, good intent, and follow-through. Decisions that would take weeks in a low-trust environment take hours in a high-trust one.\n\nEvery time you deliver on a promise, every time you’re honest about a mistake, every time you make someone else’s life easier, you’re depositing into an account that will pay dividends for years.\n\nI’ve watched engineers with modest technical skills accomplish enormous things because everyone trusted them. I’ve watched brilliant engineers accomplish little because nobody would take their calls.\n\nThe code doesn’t matter if you can’t get anyone to ship it with you.\n\nThe first time around, I said these lessons come down to staying curious, staying humble, and remembering that the work is about people. I still believe that.\n\nBut if this second list has a through-line, it’s something more specific: the work is about making it easier for normal people to do extraordinary things on a normal day. A career in engineering gives you plenty of time to learn these things the hard way and I’ve certainly learned a lot during my time at Google so far.\n\nI hope a few of them save you a scar or two. And if they do, share what you’ve figured out with someone earlier in the journey.\n\nThat’s how the good lessons travel.",

    "description": "Eileen Guo and Alysa Liu have been thrust into a debate that goes far beyond sports.",
    "fullText": "An unusual battle is unfolding over the Winter Olympics in Milan - not on the slopes or in the rinks, but on the internet.\n\nAt its heart are Eileen Gu, a freestyle skier, and Alysa Liu, a figure-skater. They have a lot in common: both are young women of American-Chinese heritage who were born and raised in the US. And they are champions in their field.\n\nAnd yet, one is being hailed a trailblazer, while the other is deemed a traitor. At least that's the case in the eyes of some in the US. On Chinese social media, it's the other way around.\n\nWhy? Liu, the daughter of a political activist who fled China after a deadly crackdown, is competing under the US flag. And Gu, whose mother moved to the US for higher education, often spent her childhood summers visiting Beijing. She is representing China in Milan.\n\nThat seems to rankle with some Americans. \"Eileen Gu competes for China and gets paid millions to do it. Alysa Liu is the daughter of a Chinese immigrant who participated in the Tiananmen Square protests. In a world of Eileen Gus, be an Alysa Liu,\" said one post on X.\n\nMuch of this backlash appears to be driven by political commentators and a vocal minority on X, rather than the broader public or the sporting world. The underlying current is the competition between the US and China - the world's two biggest economies are constantly vying for an edge in everything, from trade to tech.\n\nAnd so, a narrow yet vociferous slice of the internet is pitting two women against each other, questioning their loyalty and identity, while interrogating their immigrant experiences - and adding to the pressure they already face as sporting figures.\n\nKnown in China by her nickname \"Snow Princess\", Eileen Gu was born in California to a Chinese mother and American father.\n\nShe was raised by her mother Yan Gu - reportedly a successful venture capitalist with degrees from Peking University and Stanford.\n\nGu grew up with a foot firmly in both worlds, spending her summers in Beijing and the rest of her term at a private school in San Francisco.\n\nShe began freeskiing at the age of three in the Lake Tahoe region and joined the Northstar California Resort freeskiing team at the age of eight. She won her first national championship just a year later.\n\nShe initially skied for the US before switching to Team China in 2019 in preparation for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which took place in the Chinese capital Beijing.\n\nGu said she wanted to \"inspire millions of young people in Beijing - my mother's birthplace\". The decision earned her the praise of many in China.\n\nShe went on to win two golds and one silver in the 2022 Olympics.\n\nIn the years since, Gu has established herself as a veritable sports icon in China. Millions on Chinese social media follow her every move, leaving heart shaped emojis under her posts.\n\nChinese state media outlet the Global Times called her an \"idol for the whole world\". She is also one of the highest-earning female athletes in the world, reportedly earning around $23m (£16.9m) a year.\n\nHer decision to join Team China initially brought with it a considerable amount of backlash. Beyond the rivalry with the US, people also took issue with China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers, their poor record on human rights and the lack of free speech in the country.\n\nBut the outrage died down for the most part - until now.\n\nIt kicked off last week, when Olympian Hunter Hess was asked what it was like to represent the US given the polarising situation in the country, including the recent, contentious ICE raids in Minnesota that left two people dead.\n\nHe replied that he had \"mixed feelings\" about it, adding: \"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded to Hess' comment by calling him a \"real loser\" who \"shouldn't have tried out for the team\". Many athletes leapt to Hess' defence, including Gu: \"As someone who's been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes\".\n\nHer comments enraged her critics, who said Gu was able to criticise Trump but had never spoken out publicly against China.\n\nFormer NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom was among them, calling Gu a \"traitor\", who \"was born in America, raised in America, lives in America and chose to compete against her own country for the worst human rights abuser on the planet - China\".\n\n\"You don't get to enjoy the freedoms of US citizenship while acting as a global PR asset for the Chinese Communist Party,\" he said in a lengthy post on X.\n\n\"Does Eileen Gu have any criticism for Xi Jinping for genocide, slavery and arresting dissenters?\" Matt Whitlock, a self-described Republican communicator also posted on X. Western governments, rights groups and the UN have repeatedly accused Beijing of grave human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as in its swift crackdowns on protest and dissent across the country. The Chinese government denies the charges and says these are internal matters.\n\n\"Many American-born athletes compete for other nations with little fanfare - the 'New Cold War' climate between the US and China has changed the stakes,\" says Professor Yinan He of Lehigh University.\n\n\"Personal identity is increasingly centred on national loyalty in the eyes of the public, diminishing the tolerance for 'deviance' or dual-identity\".\n\nEarlier this week Gu said she felt as though she was \"skiing with the weight of two countries on my shoulder\", after losing the gold in women's slopestyle to Switzerland.\n\nWhile some supporters saw this as a moment of vulnerability, it appeared to set her critics off again. Some took offence to her claiming the \"weight\" of the US was on her: \"She was only representing one country and it wasn't ours.\"\n\nSoon, many online began comparing her to Alysa Liu - an athlete who has made a comeback this year, winning a gold medal for the US figure skating team.\n\nThe 20-year-old is the daughter of Arthur Liu, who fled China after taking part in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. The student-led pro-democracy movement ended in a brutal massacre in Beijing. The subject remains taboo in China, and any references to it are swiftly censored.\n\nHer family history might partly explain why there aren't too many posts about Liu on Chinese social media. Those that do praise her usually have comments below such as: \"Why are you praising this person? Her whole family is anti-China\".\n\nRaised by her father, Liu grew up in California and began skiing at a young age. At the age of 13, she became the youngest ever athlete to win the US women's figure skating championship.\n\nIn 2019, Arthur Liu alleged that he was targeted in a spying operation that the Justice Department alleges was ordered by the Chinese government. His daughter says she was told by FBI agents in 2022 that she and her family were believed to be under surveillance by the Chinese government.\n\nHer father's background and the possibility that her family is still targeted because of it has certainly won Liu sympathy and admiration. That, in turn, seems to be fuelling the criticism of Gu.\n\nThe divide between Li and Gu isn't just about \"nationalism, it's also about class and relatability, Prof He says. Gu represents a luxury culture - private schools, Stanford. Her choice to compete for China is often seen through this lens as a 'mercenary business decision'\", he explains.\n\nIndeed a post on X by non-profit group Asians for Liberty read, \"The CCP lures American athletes with promises of wealth and fame but a true American rejects it. Alysa Liu is an American patriot\".\n\n\"All of this frames how the media and the public make sense of Liu and Gu, who have been cast as the good and bad immigrant respectively,\" says Professor Richard King of Columbia College Chicago.\n\nChinese Australian dissident artist Badiucao, known for his content against the Chinese Communist Party, posted drawings of the athletes recently. One showed Liu in front of a Tiananmen tank, a reference to her father's activism, and another showed Gu holding a Chinese flag, with what appear to be bodies hidden underneath, a not-so-subtle reference to the accusations against Beijing.\n\nFar-right news and opinion website The Daily Caller, founded by political commentator Tucker Carlson, went further with an article titled: \"Meet Eileen Gu, the true villain of the Winter Olympics\".\n\nThe episode also exposes \"the incredibly precarious social and political landscape that Asian Americans have to navigate,\" says Professor Stanley Thangaraj at Stonehill College. They \"come to be recognised only in limited ways, and any political act immediately dislocates them from the US\".\n\nWhen prominent Asian Americans attempted to defend Gu, with Marvel actor Simu Liu posting that he was \"freaking proud\" of Gu, calling her \"inspirational, resilient, intelligent and well spoken in two languages\" - he too faced an immediate wave of backlash, with comments demanding he \"go back to China\".\n\nAs the Games continue in Milan, the sport itself seems to have become an afterthought in discussions of both athletes.\n\n\"Despite both athletes sharing similar racial backgrounds and first-generation immigrant experiences,\" Prof He says, \"they have been cast as opposing archetypes in a narrative they didn't write\".",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Senior Russian officials have challenged the viability of U.S. proposals to build a nuclear power plant in Armenia, in a sign of Moscow's ‌concern about the risk of losing a lucrative energy deal in a country ‌it sees as part of its sphere of influence.\n\nU.S. Vice President JD Vance, on a visit to Armenia this week, ​signed an agreement that could pave the way for the plant's construction and open what Vance called \"a new chapter in the deepening partnership between Armenia and the United States\".\n\nSergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia's Security Council, said on Friday that Soviet technology had enabled Armenia's existing nuclear plant to withstand ‌a devastating 1988 earthquake. He said ⁠the U.S. plan raised safety concerns.\n\n\"Armenia, as we know, is a seismically active region,\" state news agency RIA quoted Shoigu as saying.\n\n\"If the construction ⁠of small reactors using American technology in Armenia moves into the practical phase, we, like all other states in the region, and the people of Armenia itself, will be forced to consider these new ​nuclear safety ​risks.\"\n\nRUSSIA AND U.S. TUSSLE FOR INFLUENCE\n\nLong heavily dependent ​on Russia and Iran for its energy ‌supplies, Armenia is now reviewing proposals from U.S., Russian, Chinese, French and South Korean companies to construct a new nuclear reactor to replace its sole, ageing Russian-built nuclear power plant, Metsamor.\n\nThe selection of a U.S. proposal would deal a blow to Russia, whose state corporation Rosatom is a leader in building nuclear power plants. It says it currently has an order portfolio totalling ‌41 nuclear units in 11 countries.\n\nAt least three senior ​Russian officials have weighed in on the issue this ​week. Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin told ​Izvestia newspaper that Rosatom could move ahead very quickly in Armenia on ‌attractive financial terms.\n\nOn Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry ​spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told ​reporters that the U.S. was offering Armenia untested designs that were likely to exceed cost estimates.\n\nRussia is a traditional ally of Armenia but relations have frayed in recent years. ​Vance's trip to Armenia and ‌neighbouring Azerbaijan highlights efforts to strengthen U.S. influence at Russia's expense in the South ​Caucasus, which was once part of the Soviet Union.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump is raging privately at allies who called out his racist video post, according to CNN White House sources.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is raging privately at allies who called out his racist video post, according to CNN White House sources.\n\nTrump posted a video to his Truth Social account last week that contained an image depicting President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes:\n\nThe post drew widespread outrage including from Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), who called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”\n\nAfter 12 hours or so, the post was deleted, with an unnamed White House official claiming “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”\n\nBut a week later, Trump is back to defending it, and according to CNN’s Alayna Treene is out for revenge against Scott and others who called him out.\n\nOn Friday night’s edition of CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, Treene told host Anderson Cooper that Trump is raging privately about Scott and Sen. Katie Britt ( for their perceived disloyalty:\n\nANDERSON COOPER: According to new reporting, there may be repercussions for some Republican lawmakers, including South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who’s black. He called the Obama post, quote, the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House, seen as Alayna Treene has the story joins us now.\n\nSo Alayna, you’re reporting that the president has talked about consequences for Republicans who push back on the post. Is it clear what that means?\n\nALAYNA TREENE: Not necessarily, but we have a good idea, Anderson, from what we’ve even heard the president say this week when we saw six Republicans break with him on a different issue, on his tariffs on Canada.\n\nHe said that they would likely face primaries and would suffer consequences in the elections.\n\nBut look, from what I was told from multiple sources who were with the president or had been hearing about these comments last weekend when he was at Mar-a-Lago is he was specifically focused on two lawmakers.\n\nHe had railed against a lot of them, but Tim Scott in particular really got under his skin that he had spoken out publicly about that post.\n\nThe president telling his allies essentially that he felt Tim Scott should have reached out privately given they have a close relationship. That it was really Scott’s post calling it racist that he felt made the entire story blow up.\n\nI will say from another conversation I had with the source, they said that Tim Scott had actually privately reached out to the president first before he had posted that criticism of the post, but then didn’t reach him. And so he went ahead and published it on social media.\n\nNow, the president also had pretty strong words. I was told even stronger language for Alabama Senator Katie Britt, who had also spoken out about this.\n\nHe had used a lot of expletives, I was told, when talking about her lack of loyalty in doing that.\n\nAnd also said that she was dead to him.\n\nSo very, very much anger from the president over how some of these lawmakers had reacted.\n\nAnd I do think it reflects kind of this growing, a sense that we’re seeing of Republicans who, for the president’s first year in office, really rarely, if at all, stepped out of line to break with him. We’re seeing that happen more and \n\nWatch above via Anderson Cooper 360.\n\nThe post ‘Dead To Me!’ Trump In Profane Frothing Rage At Allies Who Slammed Racist Video Say CNN White House Sources first appeared on Mediaite.",

So what did Death Stranding 2 originally look like? For starters, it would have involved a lot more high-end fashion for its protagonist, Sam Porter Bridges, and his allies.\nKojima recently posted images online from the upcoming Death Stranding 2 art book, showing off a \"pre-COVID\" look at Bridges and Fragile.",

    "description": ", Shariq Khan, Marianna Parraga and Arathy Somasekhar NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf Coast refineries, making it the top foreign refiner of the OPEC country's oil ‌since the United States captured President Nicolas Maduro in January, sources said on Friday.\n\nWhat role is Valero playing in Venezuelan crude imports?\n\nWhat are Venezuela's current oil production and export levels?\n\nHow do recent U.S. sanctions changes affect Venezuelan oil?\n\nHow much Venezuelan oil revenue is under U.S. control?\n\nValero was among the first U.S. refiners to resume imports of ‌Venezuelan crude after the United States struck a flagship $2 billion oil supply deal with the country's interim government and began to ease sanctions. If Valero succeeds in snapping up 10 or more cargoes ​next month, equivalent to around 210,000 barrels per day, it could surpass U.S. oil major Chevron as the top U.S. refiner of Venezuelan crude.\n\nThat would also be the most Venezuelan crude oil Valero would process since the United States first sanctioned the country's oil industry in January 2019.\n\nChevron, the only U.S. major producing oil in Venezuela, is expected to boost exports of Venezuelan crude to some 300,000 bpd in March, from 220,000 bpd in January, sources told Reuters last month. Chevron typically refines up to half of ‌those exports at its own refineries, and sells the ⁠rest to other U.S. refiners.\n\nA large portion of Chevron's sales of Venezuelan oil to U.S. refiners typically goes to Valero. In March, Chevron is expected to supply Valero with most of the volume the refiner is planning to import, six sources said.\n\nValero ⁠has also negotiated some cargoes from trading houses including Trafigura, which were the first companies authorized by the U.S. government last month to join Chevron in trading Venezuelan oil.\n\nVitol has separately scheduled three naphtha cargoes to be delivered to Venezuela's state company PDVSA between February 22 and March 3, according to a shipping plan seen by Reuters.\n\nThe sources cautioned that ​loading ​schedules have not been finalized and are still subject to revision. They spoke on condition of ​anonymity to discuss confidential information.\n\nVitol and Trafigura declined to comment. ‌Chevron and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA Valero spokesperson referred to comments made by executive Randy Hawkins after its fourth-quarter earnings release on January 29. In those comments, Hawkins confirmed Valero was in talks with authorized sellers of Venezuelan crude and expected it to make up a \"pretty large part\" of its heavy-crude purchases in February and March.\n\nValero, which has the second-largest U.S. refining network capable of processing Venezuelan heavy oil, had a long-term supply agreement to buy crude from PDVSA before U.S. sanctions.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two U.S. officials told Reuters, in what could become a ‌far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.\n\nThe disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due ‌to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.\n\nU.S. and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in ​an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.\n\nU.S. officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.\n\nTrump, speaking to U.S. troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had \"been difficult ‌to make a deal\" with Iran.\n\n\"Sometimes you have ⁠to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained U.S. military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: \"President Trump has ⁠all options on the table with regard to Iran.\"\n\n\"He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment.\n\nThe United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when ​it ​carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nHowever, June's \"Midnight Hammer\" operation was essentially a ​one-off U.S. attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United ‌States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a U.S. base in Qatar.\n\nThe planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.\n\nIn a sustained campaign, the U.S. military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific detail.\n\nExperts say the risks to U.S. forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.\n\nThe same official said the ‌United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals ​over a period of time.\n\nThe White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about ​the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened ​to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned ‌the alternative to a diplomatic solution would \"be very traumatic, very ​traumatic.\"\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that ​in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any U.S. military base.\n\nThe U.S. maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks ​in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an ‌agreement with Iran were reached, \"it must include the elements that are vital to Israel.\"\n\nIran has said it is prepared to discuss ​curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.",

    "fullText": "With Antarctica added to the list, the bird flu has officially wreaked havoc on every continent but Oceania. That disturbing news was confirmed by a recent study led by Erasmus MC in the Netherlands and the University of California, Davis.\n\nA team of researchers conclusively showed that over 50 skuas in Antarctica died off during the  2023 and 2024 summers due to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. They published the study in the Scientific Reports journal and contextualized its findings in a news release.\n\nSkuas are gull relatives and play an important role in frigid environments. They act as scavengers in the ecosystem, meaning that contagious skuas could spread bird flu far and wide.\n\nDuring an expedition to the South Shetland Islands, the northern Weddell Sea, and the Antarctic Peninsula, the team tested wildlife samples, confirming H5N1 at all sites. While the bird flu had previously been detected there, this study was the first to confirm the virus as the animals' cause of death.\n\nWhile other animals, like fur seals, had the virus, their deaths weren't chalked up to it.\n\n\"As the expedition progressed, it became obvious quickly that skuas were a major victim,\" said UC Davis' co-senior author Ralph Vanstreels.\n\nVanstreels painted a morbid picture of a \"crisis in animal suffering\" with the virus causing birds to fall out of the air, swim, and walk aimlessly as the virus attacks their brains.\n\nH5N1 was first identified on a Chinese goose farm in 1996 and has since spread globally in a pattern that troubles the researchers.\n\n\"We let the virus slip out through our fingers when it first emerged in the poultry industry,\" said corresponding senior author Thijs Kuiken of Erasmus MC. \"Once it got into wild bird populations, we lost ability to control this virus.\"\n\nBird flu has now hit nearly every corner of the globe with detrimental effects. In the U.S., mega-farms have been exposed to it, with impacts affecting humans and animals alike. The virus is showing itself to be very adaptive and able to change when its host is a human or cattle.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThere are also concerns that cats could spread the virus to humans on a large scale.\n\nCloser to the study, a decimation of the skua population could spell more trouble for the already threatened Antarctica region. There are concerns that it might infect penguins in the future.\n\nThe researchers called for enhanced global surveillance and preventive measures to better track avian flu in Antarctica.\n\n\"Everything points toward this virus spreading further,\" Kuiken concluded. \"If nobody is watching, we won't know what is happening.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Capcom has announced that its plan for the Capcom Cup finals and Street Fighter League World Championship as a $40 pay-per-view have been reworked to include a cheaper price and a free viewing option following a backlash from Street Fighter 6 fans. \nPrior to this year, the Capcom Cup finals and Street Fighter League World Championship were free-to-watch events. However, Capcom's decision to move the event to pay-per-view only triggered an angry response from fans. In the face of that response, Capcom backed down. \nCapcom's eSports business department manager Tetsuya Tabuchi made the announcement on X (via GamesRadar) that the pay-per-view price is now $10.",

    "fullText": "The wife of Grammy-winning artist Jelly Roll detailed the harrowing mental-health struggle she experienced after taking weight-loss drugs.\n\n“Honestly, I just went through a bout of suicidal ideation from using a GLP-1,” Bunnie Xo, whose real name is Alisa DeFord, told People magazine.\n\nBunnie, 46, married Jelly Roll (Jason Bradley DeFord) in 2016 and is the stepmother to his two children.\n\nJelly Roll, 41, has been on his own weight loss journey since 2023. He’s since lost 275 pounds without the help of GLP-1s, working with a medical team, a chef, and a sports nutritionist, and seeking professional treatment for his food addiction.\n\nGLP-1 receptor agonists, sold under names such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro, are a class of drugs used to manage diabetes and support weight loss, favored by celebrities like Oprah and Serena Williams.\n\n“[December 2025] was one of the darkest times of my life, and it was scary,” Bunnie, a podcast host and author, said.\n\n“I prided myself on the fact that I only had anxiety. I never had depression,” Bunnie said.\n\nShe details her hard childhood in her new memoir, Stripped Down: Unfiltered and Unapologetic (HarperCollins Publishers), which comes out on February 17.\n\n“So, when you get slammed with suicidal ideation and visions and just, oh, it was horrific,” she continued.\n\n“You want to have anxiety because you want to be scared to die. You don’t want to have depression because you literally don’t care if you want to die. So yeah, it was really dark.”\n\nBunnie started using GLP-1s due to health issues in her family.\n\n“Both my parents had diabetes. So my insulin numbers are really crazy and my body just cannot tolerate it,” she said, adding, “I wish I could be part of the cool crowd and be skinny and freaking not have a care in the world.”\n\nAlthough Bunnie says she feels much better now, she felt compelled to share her story in order to help others. “I really think people need to talk more about this,” she said.\n\n“I just want people to know you’re not alone. Everybody goes through ups and downs and you are worth staying here. Please stay. Everybody, please stay because you’re here for a reason and you’re going through this, but do not make a permanent decision based on a temporary emotion because it will go away.”\n\nIf you or a loved one is struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing or texting 988.",

    "fullText": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A judge sentenced an 18-year-old who acknowledged killing five people in a North Carolina mass shooting to life in prison without parole Friday, rejecting arguments that he deserved the chance for release decades from now.\n\nAustin David Thompson was 15 during the Oct. 13, 2022, attack that began at his Raleigh home when he shot and repeatedly stabbed his 16-year-old brother, James.\n\nEquipped with firearms and wearing camouflage, Thompson then fatally shot four others — including an off-duty city police officer — in his neighborhood and along a greenway. He was arrested in a shed after a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head.\n\nThompson pleaded guilty last month to five counts of first-degree murder and five other counts less than two weeks before his scheduled trial.\n\nThompson, who did not speak publicly in court, was led away in handcuffs after the sentencing. Family members of the shooting victims cried as the sentence was handed down. Thompson’s attorneys announced plans to appeal the sentence.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway had the option to sentence him to life in prison with the chance for parole after at least 25 years, but Thompson did not face the death penalty given his age at the time of the crimes.\n\n“It’s hard to conceive of a greater display of malice,” Ridgeway said after chronicling the events of that day, adding that Thompson's months of planning and fantasizing before the rampage confirmed he is the rare juvenile offender “whose crime reflects irreparable corruption” and thus required a life without parole sentence.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing that began last week, prosecutors revealed the previously confidential contents of a handwritten note with Thompson’s name and the shooting date found at his family's house in the Hedingham subdivision.\n\nThe note said the “reason I did this is because I hate humans they are destroying the planet/earth,” adding that he killed James Thompson ”because he would get in my way.”\n\nThompson “cannot tell you why he wrote that note the way that he did,” defense lawyer Deonte’ Thomas said, noting that he had no history of ecological-based anger. “And he cannot tell you why he ran down the streets of Hedingham terrorizing people that day.”\n\nBut “he is not unredeemable, he is not incorrigible,” Thomas added in asking Ridgeway to give him the opportunity one day to tell parole commissioners he could “still be a productive person in society.”\n\nThompson's attorneys argued that the rampage happened during a dissociative episode caused by medicine he regularly took for acne. A psychiatrist who interviewed Thompson and a geneticist testified to bolster the explanation, but Ridgeway rejected the theory Friday, saying the facts belied the argument.\n\nThe judge seemed to account strongly for the prosecution's evidence of Thompson’s internet search history leading up to the attack. They said it included school shootings and was related to guns, assaults and bomb-making materials, including details that Ridgeway said appeared to match his deadly actions.\n\nNicole Connors, 52; Raleigh police Officer Gabriel Torres, 29; Mary Marshall, 34; and Susan Karnatz, 49, also were killed in the rampage. Two other people were wounded, including another police officer involved in the search for Thompson.\n\n“In the blink of an eye, everything changed for those people and for the people that they left behind,” Wake County assistant prosecutor Patrick Latour said Thursday while urging a sentence with no potential parole. “And the thing that made it change was not some acne medication. It was the defendant’s knowing, researched, well-thought-out, planned, decisive actions.”\n\nJasmin Torres, the widow of Gabriel Torres and the mother of their 5-year-old daughter, asked Ridgeway last week to sentence Thompson to life without parole, calling him a “monster.”\n\nRob Steele, Marshall's fiance at the time of her death, said after the hearing that while five consecutive sentences of life without parole were “what we were all hoping for,” Thompson still “ended five lives for reasons that I still don’t really understand in this case.”\n\nThompson’s parents testified they couldn’t explain why their son committed the violence, calling him a normal, happy kid who did well in school and showed no signs of destruction.\n\nThompson’s father pleaded guilty in 2024 to improperly storing his handgun that authorities said was found when his son was arrested. He received a suspended sentence and probation.\n\n“We both lost our children, one at the hand of the other. We never saw this coming and still cannot make sense of it,” mother Elise Thompson said last week while telling the families of shooting victims she will “forever be sorry for the pain that this has caused you.”",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic buttons to the city’s public schools and police.\n\nIn an indictment Thursday, federal prosecutors said Kevin Taylor attempted to steer an $11 million contract toward the company, SaferWatch, while serving as the commanding officer of the NYPD’s School Safety Division. The company markets its product as a “mobile panic alert system” used for mass shootings and other emergencies.\n\nIn exchange, the company’s founder, Gene Roefaro, showered Taylor and his romantic partner with gifts — including luxury hotels and airfare to the Bahamas and Las Vegas, helicopter tours, tickets to Broadway musicals and a “medieval-themed dinner theater” — along with multiple cash payments, prosecutors said.\n\nTaylor pleaded not guilty to bribery and wire fraud charges on Thursday. An emailed inquiry to his attorney was not returned.\n\nRoefaro is also facing charges, including bribery and wire fraud. He has not yet entered a plea. An attorney for Roefaro said it was “puzzling and deeply concerning that the United States Attorney’s Office has chosen to pursue charges against Geno, while at the very same time, alleging — and seeking to prove — that he was the victim of an extortionate shakedown.\"\n\nThe charges are the latest allegations of corruption and favor-trading lodged against officials appointed by the city’s former mayor, Eric Adams, who faced his own indictment in a separate bribery scheme that also involved luxury travel gifts.\n\nWhile the case against Adams was later abandoned by the Trump administration, at least some of the probes into his inner circle remain active, including an ongoing bribery case involving his former chief advisor. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have announced bribery charges against two other NYPD officers and a former housing official under Adams.\n\nThe investigation into SaferWatch first emerged in September 2024 as part of a sprawling federal probe into the Adams administration. The company was one of several to hire a consulting firm run by the brother of two top Adams officials, both of whom resigned after their homes were searched by federal authorities.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that in 2023 Taylor helped secured a no-bid contract to pilot Roefaro’s products within the command center of the NYPD’s school safety division. But as the police official struggled to expand the program, Roefaro grew frustrated, at times describing himself as a “sugar daddy” who had “made a MAJOR investment and zero return,” according to the indictment.\n\n“It’s been fun, but it’s not fun or funny anymore,” Roefaro allegedly texted Taylor in late 2023. “Our company (ME) needs to report something real and significant that is in place prior to end of year.”\n\nDays later, Taylor tried to put together a press conference to announce his division would be procuring a tip line from Roefaro's company, prosecutors said. But that event was later cancelled.\n\nDuring roughly the same time, Taylor was also attempting to solicit $75,000 in bribes from two businessmen involved in a company that sold bullet-resistant vests to police, according to the indictment. Both men declined his solicitations, prosecutors said.",

    "fullText": "Southern California will enjoy one more day of sunny, ideal weather conditions before the next storm arrives, trading sunshine for clouds, cooler temperatures and rain.\n\nMeteorologists expect a Pacific storm system to sweep into the region late Sunday, bringing light to moderate rain across Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Bernardino counties.\n\n“The latest ensemble solutions are converging on at least 1 to 3 inches of rain for the coast and valleys with the first system Monday and 2 to 5 inches in the mountains,” the National Weather Service said. Road ponding and flooding is possible.\n\nLight showers are likely to begin in northwest San Luis Obispo County by Sunday afternoon, spreading into SoCal by the evening. Highs will cool into the 60s across the region.\n\nForecasters say two upper-level low pressure systems will move through region in the first part of the week. The first will produce the highest rainfall totals, with hourly rainfall rates possibly reaching 1 inch. Rain intensity will ease Monday night into Tuesday, though scattered showers will continue.\n\nMeteorologists expect the wettest window to stretch from Sunday night through Monday morning, with showers lingering well into midweek.",

    "description": "Trump abandoned his longtime home state of New York in 2019 amid multiple civil and criminal probes into his conduct",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Friday suggested that he could make his post-presidency home near a North Carolina military base instead of the gilded Florida social club where he’s lived since leaving his longtime New York home to avoid various investigations into his conduct.\n\nTrump was winding his way through remarks to soldiers at Fort Bragg that were little different from his usual political stump speech when he began boasting about the “billions” his administration is purportedly investing into improvements to housing and other facilities on the sprawling military base.\n\nHe also claimed his administration would similarly spend “billions of dollars” on improvements “here and around the area” to “make it great” because “people in this area have been so incredible.”\n\n“In fact, I'm thinking about moving here someday. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll move here with our great movie star ... with our First Lady,” he said, referring to first lady Melania Trump, who had also traveled to the base in a rare joint appearance with her husband.\n\nTurning to his wife, he said: “We'll move to Fort. Bragg. Would you like that, darling?”\n\nThe first lady, who seemed to be there as much to promote her documentary as to ride along on to Mar-a-Lago afterward, laughed and seemed to nod, at which point Trump resumed speaking, telling the assembled soldiers: “She loves you.”\n\n“It’s a possibility — actually, it's not a bad idea, because we love it,” he said.\n\nWhile the president’s remarks were made in jest, he does have some family ties to the Tar Heel State through his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who has twice considered but rejected chances to run for open Senate seats there.\n\nTrump and his wife previously changed their primary residence in 2019, when they filed documents to officially shift their domicile from the eponymous New York skyscraper where he’d lived since 1983 to Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida mansion where he maintains quarters while using the gilded age-era residence as a social club for dues-paying members.\n\nAt the time, he claimed to “cherish” the Empire State, where he lived from birth through the start of his first term in the White House in 2018 but complained that he’d been “treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state” amid multiple civil and criminal investigations into his conduct there.\n\nThe first lady’s appearance alongside her husband — only one of a select few speaking engagements she’s had with him since his return to the White House — comes weeks after the premier of a hagiographic documentary about her preparations for his January 2025 inauguration that was purchased by Amazon for $40 million in what critics derided as a blatant payoff to her and her husband.\n\nAmazon also reportedly spent $35 million to market the film, which thus far has brought in just over $13 million in box office revenues since it was released in theaters last month.\n\nTrump referenced the documentary’s box office performance in his remarks to the troops, telling them that the United States “is truly blessed to have such a phenomenal First Lady.”\n\n“And now she’s a movie star,” he said.",

    "fullText": "A Colorado cemetery is forcing a family to remove an \"inappropriate\" headstone bearing images of upraised middle fingers.\n\nThe headstone has been in Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs for five years, marking the final resting place of brothers Timothy and Ryan Geschke. The sisters of the interred, Heidi and Holly Geschke, were recently informed that the headstone designer was told to cover up images of raised middle fingers on the gravestone with black tape.\n\n\"This is a symbol of love and Geschke blood through and through,\" Holly Geschke told KOAA.\n\nNow, the cemetery's manager is telling the family that the headstone must be removed.\n\nAccording to the cemetery's rules, headstones cannot be profane or offensive to the general public. \"No words or images may be engraved on a memorial that would be considered profane or offensive to the general public,\" the cemetery's current rules state.\n\nHolly Geschke told The Independent that she was not asked to sign a contract when the tombstone was erected and was not told by anyone at that time that the design violated any of the cemetery’s rules.\n\nShe said the only instructions her family was given at the time were that the middle finger engravings could not be facing a nearby street.\n\nWhen KOAA reporters asked the cemetery's manager, Cheryl Godbout, how many complaints she’d received, she said the number of complaints was \"irrelevant, because once I was made aware of it, then I had to do something.\"\n\n“It would not have been right of me to know about it, knowing it violates our rules and to ignore our rules,\" she said.\n\nThe Geschke sisters do not agree that the images are offensive enough to warrant removal.\n\n“This was created with so much love and respect and loyalty to our brothers,” Holly Geschke told KOAA. “This is speaking to the character of not who they were, but who we are as a family.”\n\nThe manager said the family does not need to remove the headstone themselves and that the cemetery will store the marker for the family.\n\nThe sisters told KOAA that they don't plan on removing or remaking the headstone to bring it into compliance with the cemetery's rules.\n\n\"They're in a resting place and now here we are being asked to disturb their resting place,\" Holly Greschke said. \"It's mind-boggling,\"\n\nShe said her family plans to fight the removal order, and if necessary, move her brothers out of the cemetery entirely.\n\n“These are my brothers, I'm not going to let this go,” she told The Independent. “Whether this ends in our favor or not we're not backing down on this. We're making noise for the boys.”",

    "fullText": "Pro Football Focus projected the landing spots for five of the top interior offensive linemen in free agency, which includes Pittsburgh Steelers veteran guard Isaac Seumalo.\n\nAccording to PFF's Mason Cameron, Seumalo will predictably head to the Las Vegas Raiders, where the new Klint Kubiak regime will utilize his run-game prowess.\n\n\"Former Seahawks offensive coordinator and new Raiders head coach Klint Kubiak understands the importance of establishing a diverse run game to better allow for shot plays in the passing game through play action,\" Cameron wrote. \"Seumalo’s skill set pairs well with that mentality. The 32-year-old guard has been excellent throughout his career with the Eagles and Steelers.\n\n\"During his three seasons in Pittsburgh, Seumalo showcased his talent as a run blocker in gap (82nd percentile) and zone (92nd percentile) concepts. But where he really sets himself apart is through his ability to sell the run out of play action without overextending, having generated the fourth-highest play-action PFF pass-blocking grade (87.8) among guards over the past three seasons.\"\n\nSeumalo has appeared in 125 games, including 104 starts, during his time with the Eagles (2016–2022) and Steelers (2023–2025). He also earned the first Pro Bowl recognition of his career with Pittsburgh in 2024.\n\nIf Pittsburgh loses out on Seumalo, Buffalo Bills guard David Edwards would make an excellent substitution, with our Steelers Wire free agency scouting report giving fans a better idea of his potential fit.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, including any offseason moves, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers predicted to lose Isaac Seumalo to Raiders, per PFF",

    "description": "Xavier begin its pursuit of a 6th straight state title with two wins, Perry was upset in Round 2 and there's an epic battle being set up in 3A.",
    "fullText": "The Arizona high school girls soccer playoffs are underway, with the first two rounds of the Open Division and the first round for the 3A and 2A tournaments completed.\n\nIt’s called the Open for a reason, and there are five, maybe six teams that have a real shot at lifting the gold ball for the state’s highest playoff classification, which combines the top three conferences into one bracket. But Phoenix Xavier Prep is in the midst of one of the greatest runs ever seen in the state.\n\nThe 6A, 5A and 4A fields are now set following the conclusion of the first two rounds of the Open. It was mostly chalk, but there were a few upsets.\n\nHere's a rewind of the top moments during the week as we look ahead to the rest of the playoffs.\n\nXavier Prep is the five-time defending state champion and the team everyone is chasing. The Gators are seeking to make history – only one other school, Chandler Seton Catholic in 3A, has won six consecutive Arizona girls' soccer titles. No. 5 Xavier is off to a hot start in the Open, routing Peoria Sunrise Mountain in Round 1 and Waddell Canyon View 7-0 in Round 2.\n\nChandler Hamilton and Queen Creek Casteel are two of the teams in the hunt to take down the Gators. Both have a history with Xavier. Hamilton, the No. 1 seed, took down Sahuarita Walden Grove 4-0 and Chandler Arizona College Prep 4-0. Casteel, No. 2, beat Tucson Catalina Foothills 4-0 and Anthem Boulder Creek 4-0. Last season, Casteel came painstakingly close to ending the Gators’ run last year, losing in overtime in the title game. Same for Hamilton, losing 5-4 on penalty kicks in 2024.\n\nScottsdale Chaparral, No. 3, Chandler Basha, No. 4, and Phoenix Desert Vista, No. 11, are also in the mix as contenders.\n\nChaparral has won eight titles under coach Robyn Carlson. The program at Basha has been built into a respectable one by coach Ryan Watrous over the past four years, and the Bears will have a chance in the quarterfinals against Xavier. Desert Vista is the defending 6A state champion.\n\nNo. 8 Gilbert Perry has become a mainstay in the playoffs this decade, reaching the Open semifinals in 2025, the 6A quarterfinals in 2024, the 6A championship in 2023 and 2022 and the 6A semifinals in 2021. The 2-0 loss in Round 2 to No. 9 Gilbert Highland is a rarity for the Pumas and an upset, even though the teams are ranked so closely. Highland is a school filled with top-tier athletes, but it’s been 11 years since the school appeared in a championship final.\n\nWith the Open in the quarterfinals, that means the brackets for 6A, 5A and 4A are now finalized.\n\nPerry falls back into 6A and immediately slots in as one of the favorites to win the 6A tournament as the No. 2 seed. Phoenix Pinnacle, No. 1, is in the mix as well after losing to Desert Vista in Round 2.\n\nIn 5A, Gilbert Campo Verde is the top seed and certainly headlines the group as one of the teams that can win it. But Scottsdale Notre Dame Prep, No. 5, should not be overlooked. The Saints won the 2024 state championship under coach Mike Varela and are a tough out.\n\nQueen Creek Crismon’s Round 1 loss in the Open was technically the biggest upset, with No. 23-seeded Glendale Mountain Ridge beating the No. 10-seeded Rattlers. But that makes Crismon a heavy favorite to go all the way in 4A. Crismon features one of the most prolific players in state history, with senior forward Sydney Droen (144 goals, 112 assists).\n\nAlso watch for No. 2 Tucson Salpointe Catholic, No. 3 Flagstaff Coconino and No. 5 Surprise Paradise Honors.\n\nMeanwhile, two schools in the 3A tournament are setting up what could be a slugfest in the championship game.\n\nNo. 1 Phoenix Northwest Christian cruised in its Round 1 game, winning 14-0 against San Tan Foothills. Northwest Christian is trying to get back on top after a run of three titles in four years from 2019-22.\n\nNo. 2 Gilbert Christian cruised as well, beating ALA Mesa North 16-0. Gilbert Christian has made three championship games since 2020, winning two (2020, 2024).\n\nThe two teams seem to be on a collision course for a competitive final — unless No. 3 Queen Creek Benjamin Franklin has something to say about it.  The Chargers have won two titles in the past four seasons. Ben Franklin beat Page 6-0 in Round 1.\n\nIn 2A, all the higher seeds advanced. No. 1 Phoenix Country Day School beat North Phoenix Prep 2-0 and No. 2 Glendale Prep Academy beat Avondale St. John Paul Catholic II 6-0. Freshman forward Naomi Burge, the third-leading scorer in Arizona, continued her impressive first season with two more goals to make it 51 on the year.\n\nLogan Stanley is a sports reporter with The Arizona Republic who primarily focuses on high school, college and Olympic sports.

    "description": "George Pickens' future is up in the air at the time of writing, and that lends itself to all sorts of scenarios that could potentially play out.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys and George Pickens are getting set for a big offseason of contract talks, and you can bet it won't be smooth sailing.\n\nWith the Cowboys set to franchise Pickens, just as our own Mike Fisher reported back on November 27, that has led some to think the franchise could look to trade the Pro Bowl receiver and get something in return.\n\nIn truth, trading Pickens doesn't seem like a move that winning football teams make, and one could only imagine the backlash if the Cowboys trade Micah Parsons and then Pickens in back-to-back offseasons.\n\nAt the time of writing, we don't get the sense that Dallas wants to trade George, with Fish stating that some sections of people inside The Star would have an aneurysm if that were to happen.\n\nSo that tells you what the franchise thinks of Pickens.\n\nIt is here where NFL Network's Ian Rapoport offers his thoughts on what might entice Dallas to trade Pickens.\n\n“They’re going to franchise tag him, I just wonder what happens next,” Rapoport said. “He had a breakout year. These are the guys you don't let walk in free agency, and he's been great. What I really don't know is, are the Cowboys going to get an offer for Pickens that would allow them to trade him?\n\"They acquired him for a three, what if they franchise-tagged [Pickens], he gets the long-term deal that he wants, and they [Cowboys] get a two back? That's incredible value. I wonder if that's something that would be palatable for the Cowboys.\"\n\nIf I were Dallas' general manager, a second-round pick would not be enough for me to move on from Pickens. In truth, given what we saw George do, not only for the offense as a whole, but for individual players, I'm not sure I'm letting him go at all. Barring a godfather-like offer, of course.\n\nInstead, use the cap space and draft picks to rebuild the defense, while keeping the offense together.\n\nThis isn't the first time we have heard Dallas trading Pickens and getting a second-round pick back, and one thing we know about Rapoport is that he doesn't say things for the sake of it.\n\nSo there might be some merit to his line of thinking. He got that from somewhere.\n\nHow Jerry Jones approaches Pickens' contract will tell us a lot about where the owner's mind is regarding building a roster capable of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nThe offense with Pickens is more than capable of winning it all. It just needs a defense that can complement it.\n\nIf you trade away Pickens, you lose a huge part of what makes your offense great.\n\nAnd in the process, might throw away a chance at finally making that NFC Championship game.",

    "description": "The Brewers appear to have solved their third-base problem for now by agreeing to a one-year deal with veteran utility man Luis Rengifo.",
    "fullText": "PHOENIX – Just like that, it appears the Milwaukee Brewers have their third baseman for 2026.\n\nAccording to a report from MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, Luis Rengifo has agreed to terms on a one-year pact worth $3.5 million with another $1.5 million available in incentives.\n\nThe deal, according to Feinsand, also includes a $10 million mutual option for 2027.\n\nAs of early Friday evening, Feb. 13 the Brewers had yet to announce the transaction.\n\nTo see Milwaukee make a move for Rengifo is hardly surprising considering the position had been thrown into tumult since the surprise trade of last season's starter, Caleb Durbin, to the Boston Red Sox on Feb. 9.\n\nDavid Hamilton, acquired in the Durbin deal, and Jett Williams were the most likely candidates for the job heading into camp until the Rengifo addition, with prospects Brock Wilken, Luke Adams and Jesús Made also expected to see time at third.\n\nIn Rengifo, the Brewers are buying low on a seven-year veteran of the major leagues who is coming off a down 2025 after compiling three straight productive seasons for the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nA switch-hitter who turns 29 on Feb. 26, Rengifo hit .238 with nine home runs and 43 runs batted in with an OPS of .622 and 10 stolen bases in a career-high 147 games with the Angels last year.\n\nRengifo's strikeout rate isn't awful (19.2%, 62nd percentile in the majors) but he doesn't walk much, either (6.1%, 24th percentile). In addition, he struggled hitting the ball hard (24th percentile or lower in three key categories) with just 15th percentile bat speed.\n\nDefensively, Rengifo also struggled, accounting for minus-seven outs above average and minus-five defensive runs saved in 76 games at third with a below-average throwing arm.\n\nOne facet of Rengifo's game is right up the Brewers' alley – versatility. He also played 74 games at second base and 10 more spread between all three outfield positions.\n\nRengifo even logged a couple innings at shortstop.\n\nHe represents the second veteran to reportedly agree to terms with the Brewers this week; catcher Gary Sánchez is also expected to come aboard on a one-year deal to serve as backup to William Contreras.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Brewers reportedly agree to deal with veteran infielder Luis Rengifo",

He's the only person to successfully complete a quadruple axel, having pulled off the feat a number of times throughout his still budding career.\n\nMalinin flaunted his talent in the team event, overcoming a shaky short program to lead the Americans to gold. Men's singles, it seemed, would be a cakewalk -- a platform for the 21-year-old to enchant audiences before another gold medal danced along his neckline.\n\nThat didn't happen, though. Malinin suffered one of the biggest upsets in recent Olympic history, missing out on the podium entirely after falling victim to a number of uncharacteristic errors.\n\nSo, just what went wrong for Malinin on Friday afternoon? In short, everything. Here's what you need to know.\n\nMORE: Every mistake that cost Ilia Malinin an Olympic medal in men's singles\n\nMalinin entered the contest with hopes of draping a second golden ornament around his neck. His dreams came crashing during his free skate program, a four-and-a-half minute routine that turned hellish following an early miscue. Malinin attempted to pull off a quadruple axel -- his signature skill. But he was turned away, unable to finish all of his rotations. He settled for a single axel, instead, setting the stage for an unusually nervy display.\n\nThe 21-year-old cratered into the ice shortly thereafter, losing his footing while attempting to land a quadruple toe loop. He tumbled into the slippery white plain once more during his routine. All told, Malinin lost out on 72 points during his jumps. That cost him dearly, seeing him fall into eighth-place, some 37 points shy of gold medalist Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan.\n\nIlia Malinin falls out of the podium in the men's singles final for figure skating.\n\nMalinin finishes in 8th place. pic.twitter.com/c4ZvSrkmIB\n\n— The Sporting News (@sportingnews) February 13, 2026\n\nMORE: Updated Winter Olympics medal count for every country\n\nMalinin was gracious in defeat, congratulating Shaidorov when his score was read.\n\nDespite the heartbreaking finish, Ilia Malinin went over to congratulate the men's singles final gold medal winner Mikhail Shaidorov 👏 pic.twitter.com/Kcti5qFX0I\n\n— The Sporting News (@sportingnews) February 13, 2026\n\nHe then spoke with NBC's Andrea Joyce, where he offered an honest assessment of his display.\n\n\"I blew it,\" Malinin said. \"That's honestly the first thing that came to my mind was 'There's no way that just happened.' I mean, I was preparing the whole season, I felt so confident in my program. ... To just go out and that happens, I have no words, honestly.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he could chalk up his errors to some physical limitation, Malinin was clear.\n\nMORE: Updated medal count for Team USA at 2026 Winter Olympics\n\n\"I just felt ready getting on that ice. But I think that maybe I was too confident that it was going to go well,\" Malinin said. \"Honestly, it happened, I can't process what just happened. It happens.\"\n\n\"I think it was definitely mental. Now, finally experiencing that Olympic atmosphere, it's crazy, it's not like any other competition.\"\n\nMalinin is 21 years old. He'll turned 21 on Dec. 2 of last year.\n\nMalinin could have made his Olympic debut four years earlier. He placed second in the men's singles at the 2022 U.S. Championships, putting him in position to be selected for the U.S. roster as a 17-year old.\n\nDespite his impressive exploits, Malinin missed out on the final roster, with U.S. Figure Skating selectors opting to select veterans Vincent Zhou and Jason Brown over him. Malinin's omission was a controversial one; U.S. Figure Skating argued that Zhou and Brown's body of work superseded Malinin, who had yet to make an appearance at junior worlds, junior Grand Prix or the 2021 U.S. Championships.\n\nMalinin had to settle for a spot on the U.S.'s World Championships roster, instead. He finished fourth in the short program, but fell to ninth after struggling in free skate.",

This is the second straight week that Hampshire has withdrawn from competition after missing Round 5 in Glendale, Arizona, with flu-like symptoms.\n\nThe team has not provided a timeline for his return, but in a news release, the team said he has been \"[ruled] out of upcoming rounds in the SMX World Championship.\"\n\n\"It’s never good to get a mid-morning phone call from Baker’s Factory on a ride day,\" said Nathan Ramsey, Rockstar Energy Husqvarna Team Manager. \"Unfortunately, RJ had a crash, and the handlebars caught his foot in just the wrong way, resulting in a fracture.

I slid over this small jump and had a slow/awkward fall that caused me to plant my foot. When I planted it, the end of the handlebars came down right on top of my boot, splitting the buckles. Broke two of the metatarsals and [one's] pretty displaced. Bummed on how it’s gone the last four months, sometimes it comes in waves. I’ll rebuild and get where I know I can be.\"",

    "fullText": "CLEARWATER, Fla. — Turns out, the Philadelphia Phillies were ale-ing last year.\n\nDeciding their relationship ruptured when Nick Castellanos angrily brought a beer into the dugout after he was pulled from a game, the Phillies released the outfielder even though they owe him $20 million for the final season of a five-year, $100 million contract.\n\nDraught was an issue in a season that extended the team’s title drought.\n\nIn a four-page handwritten letter posted Thursday, Castellanos admitted he broke a team rule by bringing a Presidente beer into the dugout last June “after being taken out of a close ball game in front of my friends and family.” Phillies manager Rob Thomson made the move for defense with a 3-1 eighth-inning lead during a 5-2 win at Miami on June 16.\n\n“I’m proud of him because he owned up to what he did and, hey, we all make mistakes,” Thomson said Friday. “Nick had helped us out in a lot of ways here. He’s had some big hits and big plays and helped us win a lot ballgames. So I do, I wish him all the best.”\n\nDuring a season that ended with a Division Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, Castellanos hit .250 — his lowest in a non-shortened season — with 17 homers and 72 RBIs.\n\nAny team can sign Castellanos for the $780,000 major league minimum. Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski had decided Castellanos wouldn’t report to the team for spring training — the 33-year-old did not have a locker assigned and two photos of him in the corridor of player images already had been removed.\n\n“A lot of times when a good player has their role change with the club, it can cause some friction, and his role changed last year from where it was,” Dombrowski said. “I mean you played every single day for a lot years in a row, and so sometimes that can contribute to it. Sometimes then people have debates between themselves where they’re not all on the same page. But when you put all that together, sometimes you just need to make sure that you have a change of scenery.”\n\nCastellanos’ minus-12 outs above average — how many outs they gain defensively over the average fielder at their position, according to MLB Statcast — tied the New York Mets’ Juan Soto and the Los Angeles Angels’ Jo Adell for 108th and last among 110 qualified outfielders.\n\nCastellanos was removed for Johan Rojas, who took over in center as Brandon Marsh moved from center to left and Max Kepler from left to right.\n\n“I then sat right next to Rob and let him know that too much Slack in some areas and too tight of restrictions in others and not (conducive) to us winning,” Castellanos wrote. “Shoutout to my teammates and Howie (Phillies special assistant Howie Kendrick) for taking the beer out of my hands before I could take a sip.\n\nCastellanos said he “aired out our differences” after the game during a meeting with Thomson and Dombrowski.\n\n“The conversation ended with me apologizing for letting my emotions get the best of me,” Castellanos wrote.\n\nCastellanos was benched the next day for what Thomson said then was “an inappropriate comment.” Castellanos wrote the Phillies told him not to divulge details to reporters.\n\n“I was surprised that a lot of people didn’t see what was taking place at the time,” Dombrowski said.\n\nThomson doesn’t regret the messy details didn’t become public at the time.\n\n“I thought it was appropriate what we did,” he said.\n\nCastellanos appeared in 75 of the team’s final 90 regular season games and hit .133 with three RBIs in the four-game Division Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. His production decline led to the decision as much as the beer beef.\n\n“That wasn’t the final or determining factor, because if that was, we would have done that at that particular time,” Dombrowski said.\n\nPhiladelphia secured a replacement in December, agreeing to a one-year, $10 million contract with Adolis García.\n\nReporting for the new season and hoping to win Philadelphia’s first title since 2008, Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber wished Castellanos the best.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of really good memories here over the last four years and he’s had some really big moments with us,” Schwarber said. “Hopefully wherever he goes next, he’s able to keep going out there and keep doing his thing and keep having those big moments.”",

    "description": "The Canadian and Swedish men's curling teams had a heated moment at the Olympics on Friday, as Sweden accused Canada of cheating.",
    "fullText": "The Canadian men's curling team closed out a successful 2-0 day at the 2026 Winter Olympics with a narrow win over Sweden.\n\nBut before a winner could be crowned in Cortina d'Ampezzo, there were tensions between the two teams.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Winter Olympics updates: Quad God misses gold, US women's hockey in action\n\nFollowing the ninth end, Canada and Sweden broke out into a heated verbal confrontation on the ice at the Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium. The incident was sparked by Sweden’s Oskar Eriksson claiming Canada's Marc Kennedy double-touched his rock after releasing it before the hog line.\n\n\"Apparently it’s OK touching the rock after the hog line,\" Eriksson said while clearing the house, according to the Toronto Star. Per the Star, Eriksson's comments were immediately answered by responses of \"who?\" \"I haven’t done it once\" and \"Don’t chirp\" by Kennedy.\n\nCanada closed out its 8-6 win over Sweden with a point in the 10th end, moving them to 3-0 in the round-robin standings.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Ilia Malinin hot mic says Beijing Olympics experience could have prevented 2026 disaster\n\nThe issue the Swedes had, according to Reuters, was that they thought Kennedy and Canada were making contact with the stone beyond the hog line, which is the line on the sheet of ice where curlers must let go of the curling stone during delivery.\n\nWorld Curling has introduced electronic handles on the stones at the 2026 Winter Olympics, a technology piece that will tell officials if double-touching with the stone happened. Eriksson mentioned Sweden thought Kennedy was touching the stone and not the handle containing the sensor, which would not set off the red lights.\n\n\"He asked who we thought was over the hog line and I pointed out who we thought was touching the rock,\" Eriksson said. \"It was obviously not a red light, but some players are touching the rock, according to us. And that's not allowed. ... We told the officials. They came out and they misread the rules, sadly.\n\n\"Because they thought double-touching any part of the rock is OK. And then they found out that was wrong. You can only touch the electronic part of the handle.\"\n\nAsked about the incident following the match, Kennedy said he didn't like being accused of cheating.\n\n\"It's good. It's (a) sport. It's the Olympics. Both teams are trying to win,\" Kennedy said after the matchup, according to Reuters. \"Oskar was accusing us of cheating. I didn't like it. I've been curling professionally for 25 years.\"\n\nHe later added: \"There's hog line devices on there. I don't know. And he's still accusing us of cheating. I didn't like it. So I told him where to stick it.\"\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, World Curling said that umpires had been set at the hog line to monitor deliveries for three ends after the issue was first raised during the game, but that there were \"no hog line violations or retouches of the stone during the observation.\"\n\nBoth teams return to action on Saturday, Feb. 14 for one game each. Canada takes on Switzerland at 8:05 a.m. ET, while Sweden takes on China at the same time.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Canada, Sweden have heated moment in men's curling at Olympics",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have made it clear that they would like to have Aaron Rodgers return for a second season in Pittsbugh, and a 22nd season in the NFL overall. The 42-year-old entered 2025 on a one-year deal with the intention of it being his final season. However, he kept the door open to return in 2026, and now the Steelers await his decision.\n\nIn terms of his performance in 2025, Rodgers threw 24 touchdowns to just seven interceptions and led the Steelers to an AFC North championship. It’s because of that year-long outing that Nick Shook of NFL Media ranked Rodgers as the No. 16 quarterback amongst all 63 to start a game in 2025.\n\n“Aaron Rodgers bested Father Time for much of 2025 and is the primary reason the Steelers even reached the playoffs,” Shook writes. “He produced some of his best games of the last three or four years and can definitely still fill a starting job somewhere in this league if he wants it.”\n\nRodgers was sandwiched between Brock Purdy (No. 15) and Baker Mayfield (No. 17).\n\nShould Rodgers return, he would reunite with his former head coach in Green Bay, Mike McCarthy.\n\nLet us know what you think in the comments. Be sure to bookmark Behind the Steel Curtain for all the latest news, breakdowns, and more!\n\nMason Rudolph sides with Joey Porter on Big Ben comments\n\nAntonio Brown defends Ben Roethlisberger after Joey Porter comments\n\nCam Heyward ends retirement speculation\n\nJoey Porter calls out Ben Roethlisberger for being a bad teammate",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-6, 7-4 SEC) is attempting to end what has been a disappointing losing streak after falling to Missouri 86-85 in one of the more heartbreaking losses this season, surrendering 56 points in the paint, as the last two losses vs. Florida and the Tigers were mainly due to the size differential in the front court.\n\nPlaying in the SEC is never an easy task, and while the Aggies started out 7-1, including Quad 1A road wins over Auburn, Texas, and Georgia, the blowout out loss to Florida was due to poor shooting, while a the three-point road loss to Alabama, followed by Wednesday's one-point loss to the Tigers proved that Texas A&M can't be counted out of any game, but need to play much better defense moving forward.\n\nBefore hosing a winnable midweek matchup vs. Ole Miss, Texas A&M is back on the road to take on No. 19 Vanderbilt, facing a Commodores team that has both looked like a national championship contender and an average SEC team within the span of two weeks, and will be without it's star guard Duke Miles for the fifth consecutive game, combined with guard Frankie Collins, who has been out since early December.\n\nDuke Miles is second on the team in scoring (16.6 PPG), while Vanderbilt is 4-1 without him in the lineup, and is considering a 3-seed or higher in the NCAA Tournament. For Texas A&M, facing a similarly sized team should help the offense find some consistency, and it will be tasked with playing better perimeter defense, as the Commodores are shooting 36% from beyond the arc and nearly 50% from the field.\n\nTexas A&M will face No. 19 Vanderbilt on Saturday at 12:00 p.m. CT. The game will air on the SEC Network.\n\nVanderbilt’s Duke Miles (knee) and Frankie Collins (knee) are both OUT for Saturday’s game against Texas A&M, per Mark Byington.\n\nMiles averages 16.6 PPG and has not played since 1/24.\n\nCollins averages 7.8 PPG and has not played since 12/17.\n\n— Jon Rothstein (@JonRothstein) February 13, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Vanderbilt will be without star guard Duke Miles vs. Texas A&M",

    "description": "Rickie Fowler already has two top-20 finishes this season and heads into Pebble Beach weekend with shot at title",
    "fullText": "PEBBLE BEACH — Rickie Fowler’s primary goal for 2026 is rather simple, summed up in two words. “Feel better.”\n\nMORE: Swifties flock to Pebble Beach\n\nHe would like to play better, too, but it’s hard to have one without the other, and Fowler just didn’t feel good throughout last season as he dealt with a stubborn left shoulder injury. And by stubborn, we mean chronic—something, he said, that has been an issue since high school. Somehow, the six-time PGA Tour winner managed to play well enough to finish among the top 50 in the FedEx Cup standings, ensuring a spot in all of this year’s signature events and allowing him to take an extended sabbatical in the fall to heal.\n\n“I definitely earned the time off with sneaking inside that top 50, so that was a nice bonus,” Fowler said Friday at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. “That was what I was trying to work towards to earn that time off and then be able to get into a position where I could get the body in a better spot and go play this year.”\n\nIncredibly, Fowler had only three top-10 finishes last year, but two of those were in the FedEx Cup Playoffs.\n\nHe obviously is feeling better these days, and after a second-round eight-under 64 at Spyglass Hill, the California native he has a chance to win a tournament that hasn’t been particularly kind to him. At 14-under 130, Fowler is tied for third, one stroke behind Akshay Bhatia and Ryo Hisatsune. He has never finished in the top 10 in this event.\n\nAt least Fowler can claim to have enjoyed a cool celebrity moment—even though it wasn’t during this tournament.\n\n“Maybe one of my first memories, I caddied for [Mark] Wahlberg in the U.S. Open Challenge prior to the 2010 U.S. Open,” he recalled of the event sponsored by Golf Digest on the weekend prior to the championship. “I think we were—I say ‘we’ because I was caddying—but I think Mark was the only one to break 100 [he shot 97], so got that under my belt.”\n\nFowler, 37, is making his third start this year and has a pair of T-18 finishes under his belt. His swing is dialed in—he led the field in strokes gained/approach at 4.782 on Friday—and overall, he is comfortable with his game. He converted nine birdies against just one bogey at Spyglass on another relatively calm day on the Monterey Peninsula.\n\n“I wouldn't say there's a specific part of the game that has either held me back or pushed me forward. Everything's been fairly solid,” he said. “I will say I've done a good job, you know, sometimes on the greens especially over at Pebble can get a little bouncy on the Poa. Spy typically rolls quite a bit better. I've done a good job of just committing and hitting a lot of good putts.\n\n“Yeah, especially when we get weather like this after we got through some of the rain, this is just a fun part of the world to be in.”\n\nAnd especially when you’re feeling better.",

    "fullText": "The Cubs have reportedly agreed to a two-year deal with veteran right-handed reliever Shelby Miller. Fansided’s Robert Murray was reportedly first with the news.\n\nSources: Free-agent reliever Shelby Miller and the Chicago Cubs are nearing a multi-year major-league contract. https://t.co/CpGcbS9bFA\n\n— Robert Murray (@ByRobertMurray) February 13, 2026\n\nMiller, 35, pitched quite effectively last year with the Diamondbacks, posting a 1.98 ERA and ten saves in 37 games before he was traded to the Brewers at the trade deadline, even though he was on the injured list at the time with a right-forearm strain. He returned from the IL in early August and mostly pitched well until a game on September 1 when Miller felt a “pop” in elbow. That turned out to be a torn ulnar collateral ligament, which lead to his second Tommy John surgery. Miller is expected to miss all of 2026 and return in 2027, so this two-year deal is really a deal for 2027 for the Cubs.\n\nMiller is an 11-year veteran who has pitched for ten teams, including the Cubs in 2021. He signed with the Cubs in Spring Training in 2021 and made three mostly-poor relief appearances until he went on the injured list with a back injury. The Cubs released him in May of that year when it was time for him to come off the injured list. Since then, Miller has bounced around with good seasons with the Dodgers in 2023 and Arizona last year and a poor season with the Tigers in 2024.\n\nMiller began his career as starter in the Cardinals system and was traded to Atlanta as part of a package for Jason Heyward in 2014. In 2015, Atlanta dealt Miller to Arizona as part of a package for Dansby Swanson. Miller has also pitched for the Rangers and Pirates. He has not started a game since 2019.",

    "description": "Yankees manager Aaron Boone won’t push for an early return, preferring to have Cole at optimum strength late in the season and October.",
    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. — Yankees ace Gerrit Cole threw his first bullpen of spring training on Friday, may pitch in exhibition games and is on track to return to regular-season action from May to September.\n\nA 35-year-old right-hander, Cole had Tommy John surgery March 11 with Los Angeles Dodgers team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of discussions between myself, the Yankees and Dr. ElAttrache,” Cole said. “With a full Tommy John reconstruction surgery, the target’s always between 14 and 18 months so that really hasn’t changed and that’s what the research says.”\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone won’t push for an early return, preferring to have Cole at optimum strength late in the season and October.\n\n“We want to make sure we give him the proper time to make sure he is good and ready to come back, built up in a smart way,” Boone said. “Don’t want to speed things up for the sake of a couple starts at the front end that could affect the overall product.”\n\nCole threw his first bullpen in October following surgery. He pitched at Steinbrenner Field with a beard — the Yankees relaxed their facial hair policy last year.\n\n“It’s been long and tedious, like most people’s experiences. As we get closer to the end, things start to gain a little momentum,” Cole said. “I just kind of am doing exactly what I’ve been told. So when I’m told to push, I push. When I’m told not to, I don’t.”\n\nThus far, his elbow feels better than it did two years ago.\n\n“It feels really good,” he said. “It feels different than it has been in quite some time.”\n\n“Everything looks like it’s coming out free and easy — command. He just looks to be in a really good place,” Boone said. “You know that diver that dives off the high board and just goes in the water and makes like no splash? That’s Gerrit on the mound.”\n\nCole altered his windup, putting his hands over his head. Before he was hurt, he stopped at his chest.\n\n“It feels good,” he said. “Just throwing on the backfields during the summer and tried it out. I’ve had little idiosyncrasies that have changed over the years from still hands to a drop or hands off of the body, close to the body. I think I generally just like the rhythm of it.”\n\nHis last official outing was in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series that Oct. 30. He pitched in two spring training games in 2025, the last on March 6.\n\n”Some silver linings, you get more family time,” Cole said. “I miss that outlet of working hard and feeling exhausted every five days.”\n\nAfter re-signing Paul Goldschmidt to a $4 million, one-year contract on Thursday, the Yankees have 24 of the 26 players from last year’s Division Series roster — all but relievers Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, who left as free agents and signed with the Mets.\n\nLeft-hander Ryan Weathers, acquired from Miami, appears to be the most significant addition.\n\n“From a macro standpoint, I think we assessed last year’s team as a really good team. I think it played very well. It ultimately fell short,” Cashman said. “In a micro standpoint, when you’re looking at individual decisions that add up to in theory ‘running it back,’ which is the term we’re hearing so much of and understandably so, I think it’s more you engage the current marketplace and it’s an acknowledgement: A, I think we had really good players that were great competitors and B, when I started trying to match up in the marketplace via trade or free agent signs, we wound up comfortable with every individual choice of whether it’s retaining, bringing back, reacquiring.”\n\nWithout a World Series title since 2009, the Yankees lost to Toronto in last year’s Division Series.\n\n“Certainly not apologetic of the team we had last year,” Cashman said. “It was a really strong team. A lot of people, experts in the game expected — not expected but predicted could win a world championship.”\n\nRight-hander Rafael Montero agreed to a minor league contract. The 35-year-old was 1-2 with a 4.48 ERA in 59 relief appearances last year for Houston, Atlanta and Detroit.\n\n“There’s some things we really liked that he was doing last year,” Boone said. “Maybe some small adjustments we can make to help him and hopefully he can push himself into the mix.”",

    "description": "Geoff Ogilvy joined GOLF's Subpar podcast to discuss his favorite golf courses, the 2026 Presidents Cup, the PGA Tour schedule and more.",
    "fullText": "There are few current or former pros who boast the same combination of on-course success and design chops as Geoff Ogilvy.\n\nOgilvy won eight times on the PGA Tour, including the 2006 U.S. Open, and is now a member of OCM golf course architects (along with Mike Cocking and Ashley Mead). He’s also about to captain the 2026 International Presidents Cup team at Medinah No. 3, a course OCM recently renovated.\n\nOgilvy, 48, was the guest on this week’s episode of GOLF’s Subpar podcast and discussed that recent reno, this year’s Presidents Cup and his love of golf course architecture. One question he was asked focused on his favorite courses from a design perspective.\n\n“Royal Melbourne [in Australia] is great,” he said. “It’s pretty doable for the average player. But it’s really hard for [pros], especially when the pins are tough. … If you miss it in the wrong spot, it’s a bit like the Masters, you just magnify your error. Every time you make an error you just have more trouble trying to get back on track. Royal Melbourne does that in a really subtle way and it catches up with you.”\n\nOgilvy said that while he loves Pine Valley in New Jersey — which has long been GOLF’s top-ranked course in the world — he says it’s too difficult for most golfers but probably the best course in the world for great players.\n\nHe’s also a big fan of the Old Course in St. Andrews.\n\n“I think [the Old Course] gets better every time you go around and you sort of learn something more,” he said. “It’s shaped by nature and the way people played the game rather than shaped by a person. You can play it conservatively all day and you’ll hit 16-17 greens in regulation — no one can hit 17 in two — but you’ll hit most greens in regulation. But you’ll have 50-footers all day, so then you’ll get braver and braver and you’ll start taking on the bunkers and out of bounds and then you’ll start making birdies and think this place is pretty simple, but then you’ll get burned and hit into the bunker and make a triple and then you go back to being conservative again. You seem to go in these cycles. The higher the quality your shot, that’s how much easier your next shot is. That place does it better than anywhere.”\n\nTo listen to the entire podcast with Ogilvy, click here, or watch on YouTube below.\n\nThe post Geoff Ogilvy on his favorite designs (and what makes them great) appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "The February 7 edition of \"AEW Collision\" helped set up not only the following Wednesday's huge episode of \"AEW Dynamite,\" which saw two title changes, but also Saturday's \"Grand Slam: Australia.\" Despite the excitement for things to come in AEW, the show saw a decrease in viewership from the previous week.\n\nAccording to Wrestlenomics, the February 7 episode of \"Collision\" drew an average of 388,000 viewers, down 21 percent from the previous week's average of 492,000 viewers. The show earned a 0.07 in the ever-important ages 18-49 demographic, which was no change from the January 31 show.\n\nThe episode versus the trailing four weeks average was positive in terms of viewership, up 15 percent from the average 339,000 viewers. Compared to this time last year, the average viewership for \"Collision\" is also up, to the tune of 16 percent from the February 2025 average of 335,000 viewers. This episode's rating versus the trailing four weeks average was also positive, up 75 percent from the average 0.04. Compared to this time last year, however, the rating is down 22 percent from an average of 0.09.\n\n\"Collision\" saw then-AEW Women's Champion Kris Statlander chose the stipulation for her \"Dynamite\" match against Thekla, and the champion decided on a strap match, which would ultimately see her downfall in days ahead. Elsewhere on the show, Marina Shafir and Wheeler Yuta got a victory ahead of their hair-versus-hair match against \"Timeless\" Toni Storm and Orange Cassidy at Grand Slam. The main event saw Tommaso Ciampa successfully defend the TNT Championship against Roderick Strong and Claudio Castagnoli.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Part 3 of @wiltfongjr’s Bears roster turnover series focuses on the tight ends. Does Chicago have the best duo in the league?",
    "fullText": "Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson changed his offensive scheme from what he used in Detroit to better utilize his roster, but a few principles remained. He wants to run the ball, use play action, and get his tight ends involved. He also expects his tight ends to be versatile so that he can line them up anywhere on the field.\n\nIn 2025, the Bears used the sixth-highest percentage of 12 personnel (1 running back, 2 tight ends) in the NFL and the fifth-highest percentage of 13 personnel.\n\nJohnson’s offense will continue to evolve schematically, but I can’t see Ben deviating too far from his use of tight ends, which makes this an important position that needs quality depth.\n\nHere’s how the Bears’ tight end room currently shapes up.\n\nColston Loveland – Signed through 2028* – Loveland was one of the most dynamic rookies in the NFL, and this was after a slow start to the season. He flashed elite traits and appears primed to push for the Pro Bowl next season. His athleticism makes him a perfect “move” tight end, but he didn’t seem to mind lining up as the Y and blocking either. It’s easy to see why the Bears valued his skill set at 10 overall in the draft, and why his ceiling is even higher than that of a perennial Pro Bowler.\n\n*Bears have the fifth-year option for 2029.\n\nCole Kmet – Signed through 2027 – The Bears could save about $8 million if they move on from Kmet, but I think it’s more likely they rework his deal and sign him to an extension. Kmet has become a reliable in-line blocker, but he’s athletic enough to line up wide or in the backfield. He’ll likely never approach the 73 receptions he had in 2023, but he plays an important role in Johnson’s offense.\n\nLoveland and Kmet make up one of the best tight end duos in the NFL.\n\nDurham Smythe – Free agent – The 30-year-old veteran played in a quarter of the Bears’ offensive snaps (293) and the sixth-most snaps on special teams (230). I can see the Bears bringing him back on another one-year deal.\n\nThe next three players spent time on Chicago’s practice squad in 2025 and signed reserve/futures contracts.\n\nStephen Carlson – Signed through 2026 – Carlson has been with the Bears since 2023, but he’s only appeared in three games. He’s a solid veteran option to call up from the practice squad, but at 29 years old, he’s probably never going to crack a 53-man roster.\n\nNikola Kalinic – Signed through 2026 – The 29-year-old began his career in the CFL in 2019, and the Bears are his fourth NFL team since 2022. He played in two games for the Bears in 2025, making 3 special teams tackles.\n\nQadir Ismail – Signed through 2026 – The Bears are his fifth NFL team since being a Ravens UDFA in 2024. At 6’6”, 232 pounds, he’s a good athlete who started his collegiate career as a quarterback for Villanova and finished it as a wide receiver for Samford. His dad, Qadry, was a ten-year veteran in the NFL.\n\n2026 OUTLOOK – Assuming Kmet stays, the Bears won’t be addressing this position with big money in free agency or a high draft pick. However, some bottom of the depth chart competition should come from a UDFA or two.\n\nWhat do you think will happen at tight end this offseason?",

    "fullText": "While many Arizona Cardinals fans lose their minds over the decision to have Nick Rallis return as the team’s defensive coordinator, it’s obvious new head coach Mike LaFleur paid more attention to what affected the Cardinals in 2025 than those fans did.\n\nIn an interview with Cardinals reporter Dani Sureck after being introduced to the media 10 days ago, LaFleur was asked the impression the team’s defense had on him after playing against them six times in the last three seasons.\n\n“We've had some rough days against this defense,” he said.\n\nFor those who are guffawing at that comment and have serious cases of collective amnesia, consider that the Rams scored a total of 23 points in the two 2024 games against the Cardinals.\n\nAs for the troubles last season, LaFleur addressed that when he said, “Just going back to this year (2025) because every year changes, when we played them the first time, I think it was Week 11, maybe Week 12 from an NFL season standpoint, but our 11th game. And I remember (quarterback) Matthew (Stafford) coming into me on that Tuesday saying this doesn't look like their record. This looks like a really good defense because there are players there.”\n\nOf course, as many understand but not those that reside in the coaches-are-bad bubble, LaFleur obviously did when he noted, \"Unfortunately a lot of them weren't out there, particularly in that back half of the season. So that's my job and our job as a building to figure out how we can make sure that those best players are consistently out on the field.\"\n\nReality in the NFL is that game planning and in-game calls on both sides of the ball are based on what players are capable of and who is available. The facts are that during the 2025 season, 21 defensive players missed 161 games. Eleven were on a reserve list with an injury during the season. In the final nine games, 19 players missed 82 games. That can't be ignored even though many people do.\n\nAs LaFleur said in a statement Friday, “Nick is someone I have always had great respect for, especially going against him in the division over the last three years. During the interview process, I expressed that he was someone I held in high regard and would be very interested in talking to about the position.\n\n“I’ve had the chance to meet with him and pick his brain over the last couple weeks and am even more impressed than I was before. I know the respect he has from coaches around the league and especially with the players on this team and that says a lot to me.”\n\nEven if the loud outside narrative believes they know more than those that watch hours and hours of tape while actually working and grinding in the sport.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. — As Gerrit Cole threw his first bullpen of spring training on Friday morning, a crowd of reporters made their best efforts to get a look through the mostly-covered fence that encaged the rehabbing righty.\n\nWhile those with cameras took turns sharing limited peepholes in order to snap a shot of Cole, who underwent Tommy John surgery last spring, the contingent that stood behind him enjoyed an unimpeded view. The group included manager Aaron Boone, pitching coaches Matt Blake and Desi Druschel, bench coach Brad Ausmus and guest instructor Ron Guidry, who all watched Cole consistently reach the mid-90s as he simulated two innings of work.\n\nCole, who had already thrown some bullpens in New York and California over the offseason, saw his velocity hit at least 96 mph, and he threw his full arsenal to Austin Wells.\n\n“He looked like a Cy Young pitcher,” the catcher said of Cole, who won the award in 2023. “He looked smooth and in control. He looked confident in his ability.”\n\n“Was nice and easy,” Guidry chimed in.\n\nBoone agreed with those assessments, likening an in-command Cole to a “diver that dives off the high board and just goes in the water and makes no splash.”\n\n“He looked like Gerrit Cole,” the manager added.\n\nCole also came away pleased, calling his session “well executed” while noting that his reconstructed elbow “feels really good.”\n\n“It feels different than it has been in quite some time,” he continued. “Feel is subjective, so we’ll have to see how it plays out.”\n\nSo far, all has gone according to plan for the 35-year-old, who battled elbow inflammation in 2024 before tearing his ulnar collateral ligament around this time last year. But while Cole has looked sharp thus far, Boone made it clear that the Yankees won’t be rushing him back or pushing him harder than he needs to be.\n\nCole, meanwhile, reiterated that full Tommy John reconstruction comes with a 14-18-month timetable.\n\n“So it really hasn’t changed,” Cole said, meaning he’s looking at returning sometime in May, the earlier end of the spectrum, or June.\n\nEarlier this week, Boone said that Cole is scheduled to start facing live hitters in “a couple weeks” and could “potentially” get in games before spring training ends. Cole said the latter goal is realistic, but that isn’t set in stone.\n\nCole is doing his best to stay present, as he is still in the midst of what he said has been a “long and tedious” process. That said, he’s certainly longing for real games after sitting out the entire 2025 season.\n\n“I just miss playing,” he said. “I miss that outlet of working hard and feeling exhausted every five days.”\n\nWhenever Cole does return, the Yankees will be banking on him being the best version of himself.\n\nThe club didn’t add another frontline starter this offseason despite some others having injury and workload concerns, partly because they have Cole coming back. But Tommy John surgery can come with setbacks, rust and even prolonged struggles — look at how Atlanta’s Spencer Strider fared last year — which is why Cole doesn’t want to get ahead of himself.\n\n“I’m a confident guy,” Cole said. “I have high expectations for my execution internally, but overall, in terms of performance and expectations, I don’t really have any set goals or numbers or things like that. It’s been working really well to just stay day-to-day and execute the task at hand, so I think the challenge is to continue to do that as things become more exciting and as things start to get rolling more and more.”\n\nBoone, however, isn’t going to doubt that Cole can return to form.\n\n“I’m not going to put any ceiling on what Gerrit could do once he’s back and in the rotation,” the skipper said, noting the high success rate of Tommy John surgery.\n\nSome have wondered if Cole will return with new experiments that he concocted during his down time, but the cerebral pitcher said not much has changed, aside from him having more time to lift in the weight room. Cole didn’t reveal any new pitches, and he said that his mechanics remain mostly the same.\n\nThere is one exception, as he’s now starting his windup by bringing his hands over his head.\n\n“It feels good,” Cole said when asked about the tweak. “I generally just like the rhythm of it.”",

    "fullText": "In a new viral AI video, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise pummel each other on a rooftop in a cinematic action sequence.\n\nIt's not a trailer for a new blockbuster, and it's not actually Pitt and Cruise, though it looks a lot like them. The video is so realistic, in fact, that the clearest sign it's made with AI is the dialogue.\n\n\"You killed Jeffrey Epstein, you animal! He was a good man!\" Pitt says as he punches Cruise.\n\n\"He knew too much…\" Cruise replies.\n\nYou can see why Hollywood's most prominent trade organization is not happy about it.\n\nThe scene was created using Seedance 2.0, a new AI video-generation model released Thursday by ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.\n\nThe tool and the hyper-realistic videos of Hollywood actors and characters that users are creating with it have gone viral in China and are now catching the attention of Americans.\n\nJeffrey Epstein knew too much pic.twitter.com/12u8PQH9nt\n\n\"It's happening fast,\" Elon Musk said in response to a video generated using Seedance and posted to X, a reference to the speed at which artificial intelligence is advancing.\n\n\"We're cooked,\" another X user said.\n\nThe reaction from Americans is reminiscent of the buzz around DeepSeek, a Chinese company that unveiled an AI reasoning model in January last year that rivaled OpenAI's ChatGPT and other top models, stunning the biggest names in Silicon Valley and ratcheting up the competition between the United States and China in the race to dominate AI innovation.\n\nSeedance 2.0 is another shot across the bow of American AI companies. Its multimodal capabilities span text, image, audio, and video inputs and give creators control over metrics such as lighting, shadows, and camera movement.\n\nIn another viral scene, a deepfake version of Walter White — of Breaking Bad fame — points directly at the viewer and says, \"You think you're in control.\" It's a line that feels less like dialogue and more like a taunt.\n\nSeedance 2.0 is absolutely insane. Done with @chatcutapp pic.twitter.com/xk8xcBw6da\n\nThe uncanny representations of Hollywood actors, as well as characters from the Avengers and other major movie franchises, immediately raised copyright concerns.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association, the trade group representing major Hollywood studios and streaming services, released a statement on Thursday accusing ByteDance of infringement on a \"massive scale\" in a \"single day.\"\n\n\"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,\" Charlie Rivkin, the chairman and CEO of the MPA, said in a statement.\n\nOpenAI's AI video generation tool, Sora, which can also create AI versions of actors and characters, has also raised copyright issues.\n\nLike with so many of AI's latest tools, however, it can be hard to put the genie back in the bottle.",

Don't assume your chat will stay confidential.\n\nA federal judge ruled on Tuesday that prosecutors could access Claude chat transcripts generated by Brad Heppner, a finance startup founder accused of defrauding a company out of $150 million.\n\nThe chats occurred after Heppner received a subpoena, hired lawyers, and learned that he was a target of prosecutors, his lawyer said in court.\n\nHeppner, who helped start the finance firm Beneficient, was arrested last year and charged with wire and securities fraud for conduct that allegedly led to the downfall of GWG Holdings.\n\nInvestigators seized \"dozens of electronic devices\" when they arrested Heppner at his Dallas mansion, prosecutors said, and Heppner's lawyers have insisted that 31 chats with Anthropic's Claude bot on those devices are privileged.\n\n\"Mr. Heppner — using an AI tool — prepared reports that outlined defense strategy, that outlined what he might argue with respect to the facts and the law that we anticipated that the government might be charging,\" his lawyer said.\n\n\"The purpose of his preparing these reports was to share them with us so that he could discuss defense strategy with us.\"\n\nEven though Heppner had privileged conversations with his lawyers, Judge Jed Rakoff said he \"disclosed it to a third-party, in effect, AI, which had an express provision that what was submitted was not confidential,\" according to a transcript of the hearing.\n\nThe government noted that Claude's privacy policy specified that chats could be disclosed. Prosecutors also said that the chats couldn't be protected by the \"work product privilege,\" which can guard materials prepared at a lawyer's direction, because Heppner's lawyers didn't ask him to use Claude.\n\nThe decision has lawyers buzzing.\n\n\"My gut reaction is that the decision is directionally correct,\" Moish Peltz, an attorney whose post about the decision ricocheted around X, told Business Insider. \"There's a lot of materials that should be kept as privileged that people are putting into AI.\"\n\nThe proliferation of chatbots where people are inputting sensitive legal information, another wrote, has created \"a discovery nightmare.\"\n\nNoah Bunzl, an employment lawyer, told Business Insider that people might find it \"somewhat shocking\" that their legal confidences could be lost by sharing them with a chatbot.\n\nThe case isn't the first where an executive's use of a chatbot was the subject of legal debate.\n\nIn November, PC Gamer reported on a dispute involving the acquisition of a video-game company, where a company official's use of ChatGPT to try to avoid paying an earn-out was mentioned in court records.\n\nAnd after The New York Times sued OpenAI for allegedly violating its news article copyrights, a judge required OpenAI to retain millions of chat logs to potentially review them for copyright infringement.\n\nBunzl said he has noticed that in civil discovery, lawyers are increasingly asking for their adversary's AI chats. It's \"a whole other world of discoverable information,\" he said.\n\nStill, attorneys at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, who analyzed the Heppner decision, said it was the first they were aware of where someone's use of an AI tool may have resulted in \"a loss of privilege\" over privileged material. They said courts may view businesses' use of purpose-built AI tools differently.\n\nArlo Devlin-Brown, a white-collar defense lawyer, told Business Insider he thought AI models could potentially improve attorney-client information. But given the ambiguity in the law, people have to be vigilant.\n\n\"Until the law has been clarified, lawyers should caution their clients that inputting otherwise privileged information into an AI tool could risk exposure in litigation,\" he said in an email.\n\nRepresentatives for the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and Anthropic, and lawyers for Heppner, didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Yardeni has touted his \"Roaring 20s\" thesis before, retierating his view this week that the economy and markets will remain strong through this decade.",
    "fullText": "Ed Yardeni thinks the US is in the midst of the \"Roaring 20s,\" which will carry the economy through the rest of the decade without a recession.\n\nIn a video update on Friday, the founder of Yardeni Research re-upped his bullish thesis, noting that he sees no reason for the US to tumble into a recession in the coming four years. His market views have been similarly bullish. In recent years, the economist has predicted the Dow to hit 60,000 and the S&P 500 to rise to 8,000 by the end of the decade.\n\n\"We've got four more years to go. The end of the decade is the end of 2029,\" he stated. \"I'm still thinking that we're not going to have a recession between now and the end of the decade.\"\n\nYardeni noted the primary reason for his bullishness is the sheer resilience that the US economy has shown, which he measures by the frequency of recession. He noted that he doesn't think the US has seen an actual one since 2008.\n\n\"It's been hit by a lot of shocks and yet it continues to grow,\" Yardeni stated of the US economy. \"We had one recession that lasted all of two months back in 2020, but that was not really a legitimate recession.\"\n\nThe US economy's ability to keep chugging along has been a boon for the stock market, which has been enjoying in a nearly two-decade-long secular bull market. Yardeni highlighted the progress made by many S&P 500 members, which enjoyed significant growth for most of 2025.\n\nWhile some high-growth S&P stocks have struggled recently due to AI-related fears, Yardeni isn't concerned about this bearish trend persisting, adding that he thinks market strength will remain intact.\n\n\"I think we can also conclude that because of the resilience of the economy, earnings have been remarkably resilient for the S&P 500 and indeed they've been so during the current uh growing 2020 scenario,\" he noted.\n\nYardeni also expects real GDP growth to continue into 2026. He predicts that this year's GDP will expand by 3.5% to 4.5%, citing gains in productivity.\n\nThe economist acknowledged that the 4.5% figure may strike some as overly optimistic, but he maintained that it fits within his broader Roaring 20s model and forecast.\n\n\"That might be the outlook actually for the rest of the decade if things continue to go along as we're expecting,\" Yardeni added.",

    "description": "The nature of the dispute with the Department of Defense, including what Scale AI is seeking, is unclear.",
    "fullText": "Meta-backed artificial intelligence training company Scale AI is suing the Department of Defense.\n\nThe nature of the dispute, including what Scale is seeking, is unclear. Most of the documents, including the complaint, were filed on January 30 and are sealed. The lawsuit has not previously been reported.\n\nCase documents are expected to include classified information at the \"secret/no foreign\" level, according to one of the few unsealed documents.\n\nThe US is the only named defendant. Another AI company, Enabled Intelligence, joined as an intervenor defendant — a third party that voluntarily joins a suit to protect their interests.\n\nIn the fall, Scale lost a bid for a contract worth up to $708 million from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, part of the DoD, to Enabled Intelligence. The contract, which could last up to seven years, was the agency's largest data-training agreement yet. It includes work with the Pentagon's signature AI effort, Maven.\n\nIn late December, Scale filed a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office against the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Scale's bid protest was dismissed in late January, two days before the company sued in the Court of Federal Claims. The GAO does not typically publish information on routine protest dismissals.\n\nIn 2024, Scale won a $24 million, one-year contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to work on data labeling for Maven.\n\nA Scale spokesperson declined to comment on the DoD lawsuit, saying it \"relates to a recent procurement decision.\"\n\n\"Scale AI stands firmly with Secretary Hegseth and the Department of War in their mission to get frontier AI capabilities into the hands of warfighters. We are committed to ensuring the procurement process reflects the high standards required for our nation's most critical AI initiatives,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAttorneys for Enabled Intelligence and the DoD did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nScale has signed several multimillion-dollar contracts with the DoD since 2020. In March, the startup announced it was working with defense tech startup Anduril and Microsoft to deploy AI agents in the US military under a DoD program called \"Thunderforge.\" In August, Scale announced a $99 million contract to develop AI tools for the Army.\n\nThe company is best known for its data labeling business, which has helped Big Tech clients like Google and Meta improve their AI chatbots. In June, Scale received a $14.3 billion investment from Meta in exchange for a 49% stake in the startup.\n\nScale's former CEO, Alexandr Wang, wrote an open letter to President Donald Trump after his second inauguration, outlining five ways the president could advance AI in his first 100 days. The then-Scale exec wrote that he wanted the US government to emulate tech giants by spending more on data and compute and noted Scale's work with the DoD. Wang, who left Scale to join Meta's Superintelligence Labs as chief AI officer, also attended the president's AI dinner at the White House in September.\n\nSince Meta's investment, Scale has laid off 200 employees, or 14% of its workforce, lost major clients including Google and xAI, and has been battling a swarm of newer entrants trying to poach its clients and workers.",

    "fullText": "She attended the designer's fall runway show wearing a high-neck halter gown made from gauze-like fabric.\n\nIt wrapped around her body, creating a subtle see-through effect, and its skirt extended into a short train.\n\nShe wore it with a fuzzy jacket that she carried around her waist.\n\nShe made an appearance at the Tory Burch fall/winter runway show wearing a preppy look from the brand. It comprised a white pleated skirt with a black, button-up blouse tucked in.\n\nUnfortunately, the two pieces sat loosely on Anderson and appeared too formal.\n\nHer leather belt, sheer tights, pointed heels, and black purse added some fun to the look, but the base layers were ultimately too simple for them to work.\n\nWhile entering the Ralph Lauren show, Reinhart was photographed wearing a brown tweed blazer as a top with a thick brown belt holding it closed at the waist.\n\nShe also wore a long black skirt covered in leather fringe, which added texture and contrast to the ensemble.\n\nHigh black boots and a small brown purse completed the fun, fashion-forward look.\n\nAlso at the Tory Burch show, Seyfried wore a golden, long-sleeved blouse atop a blue midi skirt with silver stripes. She also wore white heels with silver adornments and carried a blue purse.\n\nThe mix of two metallic shades with blue tones created a unique, fun color combination that complemented her hair and skin tone.\n\nOutside the Tory Burch runway show, the Olympic gymnast was photographed wearing an oversize blue jacket with a form-fitting wrap skirt in a vibrant red shade.\n\nThe two pieces were drastically different in style, and they overwhelmed her petite frame. They also didn't match the lime-green top she wore or her black accessories.\n\nThe \"Stranger Things\" actor attended the show in blue jeans, a button-up top, and a leather jacket that matched his sneakers and Coach purse.\n\nThe latter piece was especially fun. It featured a prominent pocket reminiscent of a coin purse and two keychains that looked like miniature books.\n\nMcLaughlin has been one of the best-dressed men at New York Fashion Week so far.\n\nThe model sat in the stands wearing skinny black pants with a billowing blouse. The semi-sheer white garment had a high neckline, balloon sleeves, and extra fabric at the waist that extended into a train.\n\nThe top piece was dramatic and memorable, while her pants were perfectly tailored to highlight her dramatically pointed heels.\n\nFor the Michael Kors runway show, the actor wore an all-white ensemble that included trousers, a loose-fitting blouse, sneakers, and a trench coat.\n\nThe outfit would have worked for him if it featured more than one color. Because the entire ensemble was stark white, each piece blended into the others, creating the illusion that he was wearing a baggy jumpsuit.",

    "fullText": "History suggests more pain may stil be coming for bitcoin.\n\nIn a note to clients this month, strategists at Ned Davis Research said they saw potential downside ahead for the world's top crypto, even after major selling that's hammered the crypto in recent months. Should its bear market become a full-blown bitcoin winter, the coin could drop to as low as $31,000, according to Pat Tschosik, NDR's chief thematic strategist, and analyst Philippe Mouls.\n\nBitcoin, which has tumbled 44% from its October peak, traded around $69,180 on Friday. Should the coin fall to the $31,000 mark, that implies the crypto falling another 55% from its current levels.\n\nTschosik and Mouls said their analysis of past bitcoin drops had led them to expect a 70%-75% peak-to-trough decline in the crypto should the current sell-off escalate into winter.\n\nAcross bitcoin winters dating back to 2011, bitcoin has dropped an average 84%, NDR said. The average bitcoin winter has also lasted an average of 225 days, Tschosik and Mouls added, though it's only been 129 days since bitcoin peaked in early October.\n\nTschosik and Mouls noted that a winter wasn't necessarily guaranteed, given that bitcoin has more institutional buyers than in the past, which could create greater stability in bitcoin's price.\n\n\"Notice the winters/major bears are getting slightly less severe over time in terms of percent decline and we think that will continue,\" they said of their price forecast.\n\nTalk of more pain for crypto has picked up in recent weeks as bitcoin's decline has steepened. John Blank, the chief strategist at Zacks Investment Research, speculated that the coin could drop to as low as $40,000, given that the average crypto winter lasts for over a year. Stifel predicted last week that the full decline could take it to around $38,000.",

    "description": "Personnel won't be able to fully process all the data available on the modern battlefield. That's where artificial intelligence applications come in.",
    "fullText": "Army leaders say the modern battlefield is so saturated with sensors and networked weapons generating more data than soldiers can realistically process on their own that artificial intelligence is needed to meaningfully sort it all.\n\nFor years, the Army's focus was on fielding more sensors for battlefield information and awareness, but now the service is also having to think about information overload and managing the massive amounts of data coming in.\n\nDuring a recent US Army and NATO exercise in Europe, troops used a homegrown AI system to consume and sort data. The value wasn't strictly that the AI could do it faster but rather that it could remember context and patterns that humans couldn't.\n\nThe case from the Dynamic Front exercise is another example of how the US military is increasingly implementing AI and automation into everything from enemy attack simulations to paperwork.\n\n\"The modern battlefield, what we're already seeing across the globe, it is swimming in sensors, and we are drowning in data,\" Col. Jeff Pickler, the Army 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force commander, said at a media roundtable on Dynamic Front.\n\nThere aren't enough people to decipher all the available information, he said. \"They will never be able to fully process all of that.\"\n\nThe software aimed at addressing that problem remains in beta testing. In the next iteration of Dynamic Front — which will merge with another exercise, Arcane Front, to pair technology experimentation with theater-level combat rehearsals — Army leaders say they intend to test the AI at a larger scale.\n\n\"If we're looking at a target set in the European theater where we think we're going to need to process upwards of 1,500 targets a day, that's beyond the human scope,\" Pickler said. \"The answer to the equation there is in AI and automations.\"\n\nDuring a potential large-scale conflict in Europe, AI could assist in locating and assessing those targets.\n\nThe system can do this quickly, but the speed isn't the main benefit. AI can remember patterns that humans might forget or not even notice. Pickler gave an example of AI realizing that unrelated shipping reports, a local power outage, and a fertilizer delivery together might suggest missile fueling activity.\n\n\"So the difference isn't seconds versus minutes — it's minutes instead of months. Not because the machine scans quickly, but because it keeps context across sources that humans can't hold in memory,\" Pickler said after the roundtable.\n\n\"It doesn't replace analysts by reading faster,\" he said, \"it replaces the weeks analysts spend reconnecting information spread across thousands of reports.\"\n\nIn a conflict scenario, that could mean analysts reach a clearer picture of the battlefield faster. Correlations between data gathered from different sensors could surface more quickly. If an adversary were fueling, arming, or moving weapons in ways that were not immediately obvious, AI could help flag those links.\n\nHumans, though, would still decide how to respond.\n\nSoldiers have seen success with iterating on the current AI model, the Army said. It's been retooled during testing, and humans remain in the loop, reviewing outputs at multiple stages.\n\nThe goal is to continue increasing the overlap the model would have with human-produced information. In a targeting example, a milestone would be if AI achieved 90 to 95% agreement with humans on 100 target sets.\n\nThe Army's push for AI and automation is also driving the development of its Next Generation Command and Control software, a priority initiative.\n\nThe technology being developed by vendor teams including Anduril, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin uses AI and machine learning to provide commanders and soldiers with real-time data on ammunition levels, maintenance needs, intelligence feeds, targeting, and simulated enemy attacks.\n\nBut AI is also changing other aspects of how the Army works. Autonomous features in drones, weapons, and targeting might be at the forefront, but behind the scenes, personnel are using new tools, redesigned workflows, and data integration for recruiting, maintenance, and inventors. These are manual tasks that the service believes can be improved with AI.",

    "fullText": "LTK, a Softbank-backed startup and creator economy unicorn, let go of some staff on Thursday as part of a reorganization, a company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe cuts were designed to refocus LTK's business around its revamped brand platform and to account for structural changes to internal teams like marketing, according to the company.\n\nThe job reductions, which hit a variety of roles including software engineers and staffers who worked with creators, affected a low single-digit percentage of LTK's overall head count, which numbers over 550 employees, they said.\n\n\"LTK recently completed a targeted organizational restructure to ensure we are aligned around the skills and priorities required for our next phase of growth,\" the spokesperson said. \"This was not a broad-based layoff, but a strategic realignment focused on strengthening performance and positioning the business for long-term success.\"\n\nLTK, previously known as RewardStyle, was founded around 15 years ago by president Amber Venz Box. The company, which says it's profitable and doubled its EBITDA in 2025, has raised a little over $300 million in its lifetime. Most of that capital came in a 2021 round from SoftBank's Vision Fund 2, which valued the startup at $2 billion.\n\nOver the last decade, LTK has established itself as one of the leading players in affiliate marketing, building a network of influencers who promote products on social media in exchange for commissions.\n\nRecently, the company has made a series of moves to establish itself beyond social media affiliate marketing.\n\nThe company relaunched its app for influencer-driven shopping, called LTK, in early 2025, to add more consumer-facing features as it sought to build its own brand identity with consumers.\n\nIn late 2025, the company announced it was revamping its platform for brands, offering features such as creator discovery and performance tracking at no cost. LTK makes money by collecting a commission on sales. The company said that over 1,000 brands have been onboarded onto the platform.\n\nLTK is one of several creator economy startups that have focused their businesses on e-commerce. Other big players in the space include affiliate platform ShopMy and live-selling app Whatnot, which in October raised $225 million at an $11.5 billion valuation.",

    "title": "Who is North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's daughter, Kim Ju Ae, and why is she appearing more in the media?",
    "description": "Little is known about Kim Ju Ae, but recent appearances with dad Kim Jong Un fueled questions about whether she may be the next to lead North Korea.",
    "fullText": "The daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been showing up in headlines and rare public appearances in recent weeks — once again fueling speculation that the child is being groomed to be Kim's heir apparent.\n\nIn a February 12 closed-door briefing with the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, lawmakers were told the daughter has been described to be in the \"successor-designate stage,\" Lee Seong Kweun, a South Korean lawmaker, said, according to a report from The Associated Press.\n\n\"In the past, (NIS) described Kim Ju Ae as being in the midst of 'successor training.' What was notable today is that they used the term 'successor-designate stage,' a shift that's quite significant,\" Lee said, according to the report.\n\nKim's daughter, who is believed to be around 13 years old, has made several high-profile appearances in recent years, which is a rare move for the secretive family. The daughter was first seen in images shared by state media in November 2022.\n\nThat unexpected public display has raised questions around whether the North Korean leader is signaling the next heir to the Kim dynasty, though experts have previously said that it's too early to speculate — especially as the seat is typically reserved for a male heir.\n\nStill, little is known or has been confirmed about the daughter herself. Kim's private life, including the names of his children, are generally regarded state secrets.\n\nHere's what we know so far about Kim Jong Un's daughter.\n\nHer real name was never revealed by state officials or outlets.\n\nThe first person to acknowledge the existence of Kim Jong Un's daughter was NBA player Dennis Rodman, who developed a relationship with the North Korean leader during his 2013 visit to Pyongyang.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian, he revealed that Kim Jong Un and his wife Ri Sol Ju had a baby.\n\n\"I held their baby, Ju-ae, and spoke with Ms. Ri as well. He's a good dad and has a beautiful family. Kim told me, 'I'll see you in December,'\" Rodman told the outlet.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Radio Free Asia, local governments in the cities of Jeongju and Yongsong have ordered women named Ju Ae to change the names on their birth certificates — another indication that may confirm the daughter's identity.\n\nThe South Korean National Intelligence Service believes Ju Ae was born around January 2013, according to The Chosunilbo, aging her at around 13 years old.\n\nJu Ae is believed to be the second child, according to the National Intelligence Service.\n\nKim Jong Un and Ri Sol Ju may have had their first child in the summer of 2010 and a third child around the beginning of 2017. Both of their sexes remain unconfirmed.\n\nSouth Korean lawmakers have said they've received tips that the first child may be a boy, CNN reported.\n\nWhen the North Korean state media outlet KCNA released pictures of Ju Ae at the missile testing site, the agency reported that Kim Jong Un was there \"with his beloved daughter and wife.\"\n\nDuring a banquet celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army in February, Rodong Sinmun reported that Kim Jong Un arrived at the lodging quarters with his \"respected daughter\" — a title also conferred on the North Korean leader in the report.\n\nAccording to former CIA officer Andrew Kim, who was involved in diplomatic efforts between the US and North Korea, Kim Jong Un may have made a rare comment about his personal life to the then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo back in April 2018.\n\n\"'I'm a father and a husband. And I have children,\" the former CIA officer recalled Kim Jong Un telling Pompeo. \"'And I don't want my children to carry the nuclear weapon on their back their whole life.' That was his answer.\"\n\nKim Ju Ae was first unveiled to the public in images released by the state media in November 2022.\n\nThe images showed the father-daughter pair touring an intercontinental ballistic missile testing site. A few months later, she was seen, front and center, at official gatherings, including an anniversary banquet for the North Korean army.\n\nThe public display of Kim's daughter is a notable break from tradition as Kim's private life is generally treated as state secrets.\n\nA verified photo of Kim Jong Un wasn't revealed until he was around 26 years old in 2010, a year before the death of his father, Kim Jong Il.\n\nExperts have speculated whether Kim Jong Un was signaling his next successor with the repeated public showings of Ju Ae.\n\nCheong Seong Chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, previously told CNN that the daughter's appearance at the testing site and the state outlet's description of the \"beloved\" daughter could be the latest sign that Kim Jong Un has chosen his next heir.\n\n\"Considering these, there is no longer any doubt that Kim Ju Ae has been appointed as the successor to Kim Jong Un, and it is necessary to pay attention to how this will affect North Korea's domestic and foreign policies in the mid- to long-term, and how North Koreans will accept the succession of the fourth generation,\" Cheong said.\n\nBut Duyon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, DC, warned that it's too early to draw conclusions.\n\n\"We can only speculate at this point,\" Kim told The Associated Press,\"(Kim Jong Un is) obviously showing her off intentionally and, at a minimum, he seems to be trying to reiterate the importance, status, and legitimacy of a direct Kim bloodline offspring. It's too soon to assume that she will be his heir because the son has always succeeded the throne in North Korea.\"\n\nThere has been speculation about Kim Jong Un's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, being a potential contender.\n\nCurrently, Kim Yo Jong serves as the only woman on the State Affairs Commission, North Korea's policy-making body.\n\nThe South Korean National Intelligence Service previously said in 2020 that the sister could be the country's \"de facto second in command,\" CNN reported, citing Kim Byung-kee, a South Korean parliament member who attended a briefing with the agency at the time.\n\nDavid Straub, a former senior diplomat at the US embassy in Seoul, told The Daily Beast that Kim Jong Un's recent flaunting of his daughter may be a troubling sign for the leader's sister if he truly is considering putting Ju Ae at the top of the hierarchy.\n\n\"Kim had both his uncle and his half-brother murdered,\" Straub told the outlet, referring to Kim Jong Nam, who was assassinated in Malaysia in 2017 with a chemical nerve agent. Kim Jong Nam was widely considered to be the next leader of North Korea after Kim Jong Il.\n\n\"I'll bet everyone in the Kim clan remembered, perhaps especially Yo Jong,\" Straub said.",

    "description": "Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses could be equipped with facial recognition, and an internal memo reportedly says we're all too distracted to care.",
    "fullText": "Since Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses launched in 2021, there's always been a lingering, controversial question about whether they could be used for facial recognition.\n\nThe question has surfaced again more recently, according to a New York Times report on Friday. And this time, the story says, there's a reason the company thinks it could add facial recognition without kicking up too much of a fuss: because we're all busy worried about so many other things going on in the world.\n\nIt's not clear whether Meta will follow through on the plans. \"While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature — and some products already exist in the market — we're still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out,\" Erin Logan, a Meta spokesperson, told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nSince their launch, the Meta Ray-Ban glasses have been a surprise hit, with Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica saying it tripled sales in 2025 and is struggling to keep up with demand.\n\nIn 2024, some Harvard students rigged Meta Ray-Bans to perform facial recognition by sending camera photos to a third-party service for scanning. At the time, Meta was adamant that people understand the glasses themselves weren't performing facial recognition, and that this wasn't a capability of the device itself. Which was true, but a truth somewhat orthogonal to the public horror about the idea of people using facial recognition glasses in public.\n\nThus far, legal and privacy issues surrounding facial recognition, not technical limitations, have kept the feature at bay. So what's changed?\n\nThe New York Times viewed a document that gives us a clue:\n\nThis is straight out of the playbook for a celebrity announcing their divorce during the Super Bowl to minimize attention. Basically, at least one person at Meta was apparently considering the fact that — waves hands — so many other horrors are going on in the world that people will be too distracted to focus on this.\n\nAnd what, exactly, might this unnamed Meta person be assuming are the \"other concerns\" keeping civil society groups' resources focused? I have some ideas:\n\nFrankly, any of these is a big enough distraction to keep me from complaining about facial-recognition glasses!",

    "title": "Gary Marcus calls out viral AI essay as alarmist 'hype'",
    "description": "AI researcher Gary Marcus said Matt Shumer's viral essay, \"Something Big Is Happening,\" oversells the current capabilities of AI models.",
    "fullText": "If that viral essay about AI had been printed on paper, there's a good chance AI researcher Gary Marcus would've ripped it up in disgust.\n\nMarcus acknowledges something is happening in AI — just nowhere near the scale described in the recently viral essay, which predicted a looming disruption \"worse than COVID.\"\n\nMarcus, who on X criticized the essay written by entrepreneur and investor Matt Shumer as having \"not a shred of actual data,\" dismissed its contents as alarmist in an interview with Business Insider.\n\n\"Hyped-up views have gotten us into a bad place, possibly one that's going to lead to a serious economic recession or something like that,\" Marcus told Business Insider. \"And I guess I think that one should work from the facts rather than just trying to cause an alarm.\"\n\nIn his essay titled \"Something Big is Happening,\" Shumer, whose past startup sells a subscription-based AI-assisted writing tool, warned that AI would upend not just software engineering, but most jobs done \"on a screen.\" Shumer also has a small VC fund.\n\nMarcus said that while AI will replace some labor and affect jobs, the process will be much slower than what Schumer and others are describing.\n\nAI can do some things well and help speed up work, but it's just not near the point of replacing humans, Marcus said.\n\n\"AI can do a small subset of the tasks, and that sometimes speeds up human beings and things like that, but it rarely does all of what a human being can do in any particular domain,\" he told Business Insider. \"This will change over time, just to be clear. It is likely that AI will replace most human labor over the next century, but it's not likely that it will over the next year or two.\"\n\nCompanies that move too quickly to replace jobs with AI are likely to find themselves in a similar position as Klarna, Marcus said. In 2024, Klarna touted an AI assistant that could do the equivalent work of 700 people. By May 2025, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, long a proponent of AI, said that \"as cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality.\" He added that \"investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.\"\n\n\"Six months or a year later, they come back with their tails between their legs because it turns out that the AI systems don't do things as well as the human,\" Marcus said. \"So, I'm not saying that there's nothing going on. I'm not saying that there's no value in these AI systems, but they're premature.\"\n\nKlarna told Business Insider that the number of its customer service queries handled by AI has increased \"as it gets better at more complex requests,\" and the company \"has not reversed or scaled back its AI strategy.\"\n\nMarcus said that the more likely outcome in the short-term is not that AI will replace junior employees but rather that executives think it's capable of doing so — and make what could ultimately prove to be a costly gamble.\n\n\"The biggest thing I think junior people have to worry about right now is a misapprehension by the C-suite that these techniques work better than they actually do,\" Marcus said.\n\nAs of Friday morning, Shumer's post has been viewed more than 80 million times on X alone. In a Substack post expanding on his criticisms, Marcus called Schumer's post \"weaponized hype.\"\n\n\"The general impression that he conveys is basically that the sky is falling now, and at most, I think what's really happening is the junior people are under some threat, and I think that threat is actually exaggerated,\" Marcus told Business Insider.\n\nShumer previously told Business Insider that he wrote his essay in part to reach people like his dad, who may be skeptical or avoid AI entirely. He felt compelled to warn them about what might be on the horizon, even \"if there's just a 20% chance of it happening.\"\n\nMarcus's biggest critique of Schumer's post is that it doesn't take into account current data and research showing that AI still has a long way to go, and that it didn't present the full context behind a famous Model Evaluation & Threat Research graph assessing AI progress.\n\nHe said that other studies, including a June 2025 paper published by Apple's Machine Learning Research Group, found limitations in what current models can do.\n\nMarcus also said that many leading AI CEOs who have made bold predictions about the future of work have failed to deliver on past ones. He points to xAI CEO Elon Musk's frequent rosy outlook on the number of robotaxis Tesla will put on the road (Musk once said one million by 2020) and to Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton's 2016 statement that the world should stop training radiologists. (Last May, Hinton told The New York Times that his prediction was poorly worded and that while he was wrong on the timeline, the general direction for AI's capabilities in radiology was correct.)\n\n\"What they have all learned to do is to sell the rosiest picture possible, and the media rarely calls them out,\" Marcus told Business Insider.\n\nOn Thursday, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman made waves by predicting that most, if not all, white-collar tasks could be automated within the next year and a half.\n\nOne of the industries Suleyman mentioned is accounting. Marcus isn't convinced.\n\n\"Think about accounting in particular,\" he told Business Insider. \"Even one mistake can cost a client hundreds of thousands of dollars or get them sent to jail or whatever. Accounting is a business that is built on accuracy. If you're not accurate, you don't have a business.\"",

    "title": "I used to be proud of only sleeping 3 hours because I worked so much. Now I realize health is freedom, not wealth.",
    "description": "After years of extreme work and little sleep, a founder explains how health data revealed hidden risks and pushed him to rethink success.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tyler Smith, founder of Hundred Health. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI used to brag about how little sleep I got. It felt like a superpower: I could sleep just three or four hours a night, and still operate at a very high level.\n\nThat helped me get ahead early on. As a teen, I bused tables and sold firewood. By the time I was 19, I bought a house (which was possible because it was the subprime mortgage days). Having a mortgage gave me real responsibility at a young age.\n\nIt also got me thinking about a career. I couldn't believe how much my real estate agent made on the sale. Her commission was about $13,000 — which seemed like $1 million to me at the time — and I thought she didn't do a very good job. I realized that if I did good work in real estate, I could make even more.\n\nI dropped out of college to get into real estate. During the financial crisis, I found a niche helping banks sell foreclosures. In 2006 and 2007, I oversaw about 1,000 home sales a year and managed triple that number of properties.\n\nI was working 14-hour days, seven days a week. It wasn't a good life, but I was young enough that it didn't matter. I fueled myself on energy drinks and embraced the fact that work was my life.\n\nTo help scale, I developed software to track my business's transactions. Other brokerages inquired about what I was using, and soon I had clients paying $2,000 or $5,000 a month to use the software.\n\nI was in the right place at the right time with the right product as real estate transactions went digital. By 2012, that software, SkySlope, was doing $12 million in annual revenue. In 2017, Fidelity bought a majority stake, valuing the company at more than $80 million.\n\nThat deal meant that I had enough money to never work again. I'm wired to build, though, so I planned to use my financial freedom to focus on something with purpose: a mission-driven business.\n\nWhen I was 39, my wife and I were trying to have a child. I took a biological age test, which said my biological age was 47. That stopped me in my tracks, because my own father had died suddenly of a heart attack at 47.\n\nThe test showed me that what I was telling myself wasn't true. I was working out and eating relatively healthy. I looked fit, but the data showed that what was happening inside my body didn't match what was on the outside.\n\nOnce I saw that data, I couldn't ignore it. I spent well over six figures hiring a top-notch healthcare team. My wife and I rented a 2,000 square-foot unit in Sacramento, which we transformed into our own personal wellness center. It had IV infusions, a hyperbaric chamber, a red light bed, cold plunges, massagers — basically anything you can name in the health and fitness world.\n\nWe were building a home in Napa and wanted to know which equipment we would actually use. We spent about $700,000 fitting out the Sacramento space, and eventually over $1 million building the wellness center in our home.\n\nToday, I use the red light bed, oxygen therapy, and cold plunge almost daily. Other therapies — like massagers and bikes — didn't make the final cut. I love the results of the hyperbaric chamber, but don't like lying in it for an hour, so for now, that's out of rotation.\n\nI changed everything about my health and fitness, and because of that, everything in my life changed: my muscle mass and energy levels went through the roof, and my mood improved. I felt better than ever, and friends began to notice.\n\nI know not everyone has the money and access I do. Most people have more data about their health than ever due to smart watches and wearable monitors, but they don't have a team of doctors helping them use that information.\n\nI started Hundred Health not only to provide data, but also to offer a personalized plan for what to do with it. I used to think that wealth was freedom, but now I know that health is — and I would like to help more people access that.",

    "description": "Get your hands on the latest Kindle Paperwhite for much cheaper.",
    "fullText": "Presidents' Day sales are around the corner, and the deals are coming in early; right now, Amazon has the latest Kindle Paperwhite from 2024 in \"Like-New\" conditions for $114.99 (originally $143.99). This Paperwhite in new condition would cost you $159.99, making the refurbished version a much cheaper choice to get while it lasts (discounted Kindle Paperwhites usually sell out quickly).\n\nThe Kindle Paperwhite is the most popular reading tablet from Amazon, and it's the best for most people, according to PCMag's \"outstanding\" review. It offers many improvements over the 11th-generation version from 2021—mainly a larger seven-inch display and a much faster boost in performance. It still retains all of the great attributes that made the previous version great, like a fully waterproof design with an IPX8 rating, enough storage to hold more than 10,000 books, and unlimited cloud storage. If you want an ad-free experience with some better features, get the Signature Edition.\n\nIf you're not sure if this is the right Kindle for you, check out the Colorsoft version—it offers color, so it can make reading manga or comics more lively. We also have a breakdown of every kind of Kindle to help you decide. If you already own the 11th generation, there might not be enough here to warrant an upgrade, unless you just want the latest Amazon has to offer. However, any devices older than that may be worth an upgrade for features like Bluetooth compatibility, which is great for audiobooks.\n\nThe screen features a 300 ppi (pixels per inch) display with 16 levels of background lighting, and optional warm lighting as well. I use this feature to read before bed and not strain my eyes. I also love the absurdly long battery life. This one is estimated at up to 12 weeks on a single charge, depending on your use and brightness settings.",

    "title": "The Easiest (and Cheapest) Ways to Turn Your Attic Into Useful Storage Space",
    "description": "Finishing an attic is expensive and time-consuming, but if all you need is a little extra storage, it's not necessary.",
    "fullText": "If you own a home with an unfinished attic, you’ve probably thought about all that precious space and how you might make it more useful. Your attic already serves an important purpose in temperature and moisture regulation in the house, of course, but that doesn’t mean it can’t do more. If you’ve got the budget, you can transform an attic into a bedroom or office space, or a crisp, well-lit storage option.\n\nIf you don’t have the budget to really build out your attic, though, you can still make it into a more useful space, even if it’s small or slightly scary. With just a few modest purchases (and possibly some sweat equity), you can make your attic an ideal storage space.\n\nYour first step towards making your attic useful is to make it safe to walk around. Even if your attic is shallow and standing up straight is impossible, having a stable surface will reduce your chances of falling through the ceiling.\n\nPutting down plywood or oriented strand board (OSB) is a cheap and relatively easy option, but it’s also labor-intensive and pretty permanent. If you want a faster solution, floor panels like these from Attic Dek are sized to fit most standard joist spacings and are designed to just snap together, allowing you to quickly drop a floor into place without needing to cut them. They come with screws, and it’s a good idea to secure them in place, but if you just need a temporary floor that can bear weight (up to 250 pounds) you can just click them into place and bolt them down later.\n\nIf your attic isn’t wired up or lacks light fixtures, you don’t need to hire an electrician and spend a mountain of cash. Just pick up one or two of these rechargeable ceiling lights and stick them to the ceiling or overhead joist (literally—you place a magnetic sticker on the ceiling and that holds the light in place—no screws required). It’s motion-activated, so every time you haul yourself up into the attic, the light will come on and save you from stumbling about in the dark.\n\nOnce you have a sturdy, safe floor in your attic, you can start installing storage options. You could, of course, just pile up some boxes or bins and call it a day, but you can do a lot better than that without breaking the bank:\n\nInstalling some hanging rods designed for slanted surfaces (like an attic ceiling or rafters) will give you the option of hanging clothing or storage bags without cluttering up the floor.\n\nA few cheap, adjustable shelving units like this one can add all the shelf space you need to keep bins of stuff organized and off the floor, making it easy to store or retrieve items.\n\nIf your attic is tight and trusses make it difficult to store anything, you can install some truss-friendly shelving. This can be a relatively easy DIY job involving screwing some support brackets into the trusses (as seen here). If you don’t have a floor in your attic, you have to avoid placing heavy storage boxes or bins directly on insulation—compressed insulation isn’t very effective. You can purchase some truss brackets that support plastic bins or other storage boxes off the floor.\n\nOnce you’ve got storage, you need a way to get stuff up into the attic, which can be more challenging than you expect. Carrying awkward, heavy boxes up flimsy, pull-down attic stairs is a recipe for accidents, so consider rigging up some mechanical assistance. You can spend a fair amount of money on a fancy lift system that will make bringing stuff up to your attic pretty easy, but if that’s too rich for your blood, you could opt for a simpler winch system that will allow you to haul up to 440lbs of stuff up there at a time. If that’s still a little too much, you could also opt for a classic pulley system, using good old-fashioned mechanical advantage to get your stuff up into the attic.",

    "fullText": "There isn’t that much of a difference between OpenAI and Anthropic. Both are big foundational AI companies. Both have changed how we think about information, code, and work. Both have very similar valuation metrics. Heck, both even have the same investors. One is chasing growth, margins, and building a real business. The other is chasing astronomical destiny. One is a consumer company with 800 million daily users. The other is an enterprise-focused company selling to businesses. The key difference is that one is focused and the other is doing way too many things.\n\nThe real story is that Anthropic, despite its woo-woo ideas about the future, AI ethics, and post-AI morality, is on its way to building up a real money machine. So what can we learn from Anthropic’s recently announced funding? The company raised a whopping $30 billion at a self-disclosed valuation of $380 billion. If you look at the chart, you can see the valuation multiples are surprisingly close. Scratch the surface, and spot the differences.\n\nHere is what stood out to me and why it matters.\n\nHighlights from the Anthropic press release:\n\nWhat’s more interesting is that Anthropic projects positive cash flow by 2027. OpenAI projects $14 billion in losses in 2026 alone, cumulative losses of $115 billion through 2029. Anthropic simply needs to keep doing what it’s already doing. \n\nIf anything Anthropic’s press release also makes it clear that the two companies couldn’t be more different. OpenAI in comparison has 800 million users. Impressive. But since only about 5 percent pay, it needs to monetize through advertising. And since they are building their own infrastructure, OpenAI needs to raise even more money.\n\nMuch as I would like to believe Anthropic’s press release, I am old school. Big numbers deserve to be questioned.\n\nI am pretty certain Anthropic will be asked these, or somewhat similar, questions when they go on the roadshow for the IPO. Anthropic’s decision to release these numbers in its fundraising press release is indicative of their seriousness about going public. Why does this matter beyond the numbers?\n\nWhoever goes public first sets the standard.\n\nAnthropic has already hired Wilson Sonsini to advise on an IPO. If it files first, it puts real numbers in an S-1. Revenue mix, margins, cost of compute, path to profitability. Public markets care about these things in ways that private rounds do not. Every analyst covering OpenAI’s eventual offering will use Anthropic as the yardstick. This will be a problem not just for OpenAI but for everyone else selling AI to businesses.\n\nI use both products. I pay them both the max amount of money as an individual and I find value in both of them. At present, if I was forced to pick one, I would go with Anthropic. But that is for now. I am not very loyal to one or the other. If OpenAI was doing better for me, guess which chatbot will stay open longer, and which API will get more use? But in the first quarter of 2026, Anthropic seems the best-positioned company in a race where the finish line keeps moving. Elon is having a hissy fit over their funding. That tells you who is the leader. OpenAI is burning cash like a Concorde burned fuel.\n\nWelcome to 2026, when AI’s big boys have to start wearing their big boy pants and show their true worth.",

    "description": "Growing opposition to vaccines in the U.S., driven by recent government policy changes, makes it difficult to see a return on investment in vaccine development, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said this week.",
    "fullText": "Moderna is scaling down its investments in vaccine development as the U.S. market grows increasingly hostile to immunizations, CEO Stéphane Bancel told Bloomberg News at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n“You cannot make a return on investment if you don’t have access to the U.S. market,” Bancel told Bloomberg, noting that high-level headwinds have made the vaccine market “much smaller.” In particular, the CEO pointed to regulatory roadblocks and diminishing support from health authorities as key problems for Moderna and the vaccine space more broadly.\n\nMoving forward, Bancel told Bloomberg that Moderna will no longer put money into late-stage vaccine studies, though it remains unclear if the CEO was speaking of all vaccines or just those for infectious diseases.\n\nIn a note to investors on Thursday, analysts at Jefferies said Bancel “seems inclined to develop [Moderna’s] Phase III vaccines in oncology/rare diseases,” particularly in high-risk patient populations, while “potentially deprioritizing its pre-Phase III vaccines for infectious diseases.” There are at least 11 of these infectious disease programs that could be put on the back-burner, the analysts noted.\n\nVaccines, Jefferies added, “still have one of the highest ROIs.”\n\nOverall, deprioritizing its infectious disease programs “could help [Moderna] trim costs at a faster clip, providing great visibility to 2028 cash breakeven guide,” Jefferies said.\n\nSince Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. took leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services in February 2025, he has enacted a stream of policies that have made immunization less accessible to Americans and curtailed the industry’s ability to develop new vaccines.\n\nIn May last year, for instance, Kennedy officially removed COVID-19 from routine immunization guidelines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women. Then, last August, he scrapped 22 mRNA vaccine research projects, including contracts with major developers such as Pfizer, Sanofi, AstraZeneca and Moderna.\n\nKennedy has additionally put in position officials who have also thrown up vaccine roadblocks. One key lieutenant, for instance, is CBER Director Vinay Prasad, who last month penned an internal FDA memo claiming that at least 10 children had died “because of” COVID-19 vaccines. Prasad has yet to provide evidence for this claim, and an internal safety review from the FDA stated that the figure is likely overblown.\n\nAt the CDC, Kennedy in June unilaterally emptied the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, before reforming it over the next couple of months with known vaccine critics.\n\nBancel joins Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla in criticizing Kennedy and his “anti-science” policies. Also at Davos, Bourla earlier this week referred to HHS’ vaccine policies as “almost like a religion.”\n\nModerna, which has weathered successive quarters of declining earnings, has been heavily affected by these policy headwinds. In May, the company withdrew the approval application for its combination vaccine for flu and COVID-19. Weeks later, Moderna lost a government bird flu contract potentially worth more than $760 million after HHS terminated the project.\n\nIn the months that followed, Moderna implemented a number of measures to slow its cash burn. These include a 10% workforce reduction in July and the discontinuation of three mRNA vaccines in November.",

    "title": "No, a Sauna Isn't a Substitute for Exercise",
    "description": "A sauna also cannot detox you or melt your fat away.",
    "fullText": "Spending time in a sauna can feel good, but it can also entail a little bit of suffering; after all, if the weather outside were the same as the temperature in a sauna, you’d probably want to hide out in the air conditioning all day. There’s something about unpleasant bodily experiences that makes us think they must be good for us, somehow, and so the sauna has gained a healthful reputation that it doesn’t entirely deserve. Here’s a rundown of what a sauna can and can’t do for you.\n\nIt is technically true that you can lose weight by sitting in a sauna, but that’s not because your body is torching fat; it’s because you’re sweating, and sweat is made of water, and water weighs something. As soon as you rehydrate—which you should—the scale will go right back to where it was at the beginning. After all, as I've discussed in the context of exercise, sweating doesn’t mean that you got a good workout or that you burned calories. It just means you were hot.\n\nPeople who sell saunas and sauna services like to talk up their calorie-burning benefits, but there’s no evidence to suggest you burn significantly more calories sitting in a hot room than you would sitting on your couch at home. Some more skeptical websites cite a modest figure of 1.5 to 2 times as many calories as you would burn sitting at room temperature, but without a citation. If true, that’s about the same as the difference between sitting and standing—so you can skip that trip to the sauna and just spend half an hour standing around.\n\nSo why does your fitness tracker say you burned a ton of calories in the sauna? First of all, don't bring your phone in the sauna, it's bad for the battery. But since you did anyway, I'll explain. The calorie-burning algorithms on your watch are built to estimate your calorie burn from your heart rate under the assumption that you are exercising. If your heart rate increases but you are not exercising, the calculations aren't correct. The calorie burn during exercise comes from the fact that muscles all over your body are contracting over and over again. That is simply not what's happening when you sit in the sauna.\n\nIt’s 2026 and we as a society should be over this “detox” concept, which has been debunked time and time again. Ordinary inconveniences like being tired sometimes aren’t due to some secret toxins that are constantly poisoning you, and even if you do have health issues due to toxins, you should seek medical treatment and not expect smoothies or saunas to cure you.\n\nSaunas and exercise both heat up your body and make you sweat, but there aren’t many similarities aside from that. Remember, exercise makes us stronger and improves our cardiovascular endurance (giving us a higher VO2max, for example). Sweating in a hot room doesn’t do that.\n\nEven this rundown from an exercise science researcher, whose headline draws parallels between running and sitting in a sauna, includes the following disclaimer: \"Before you contemplate cancelling your gym membership and investing the savings in a Jacuzzi, know that regular saunas or baths are unable to replicate all the health benefits of exercise training, such as promoting fat loss and increasing muscle mass. Using hot baths or saunas shouldn’t be considered as a substitute for exercise.\"\n\nWhat that researcher does point out, after the disclaimer, is that there are a few lesser-known benefits of exercise that seem to be related to the increase in body heat and heart rate, rather than from the more obvious strain on our lungs or muscles.\n\nWhen your body temperature rises, blood vessels near the surface of your skin dilate (get wider) and this process may help cell growth and repair. In other words, simply raising body temperature may be good for your blood vessels. That's not something we normally think about, but healthy blood vessels are a part of a healthy cardiovascular system.\n\nIf you find saunas relaxing—and many of us do—that can be a health benefit in itself. Now, this isn’t as concrete a benefit as it’s sometimes made out to be. You’re not going to cure your depression or reverse your heart disease just by relaxing in a sauna every now and then. But if you enjoy your sauna sessions, they could certainly contribute to lowering your stress levels and improving your mental health. Pro tip: If you don't have access to a sauna, a hot bath may have a lot of these effects as well.\n\nFor other medical conditions and athletic uses, the pros and cons of a sauna come down to the pros and cons of heat itself. If you have sore muscles, heat often feels good, so athletes often enjoy sauna sessions.\n\nSome skin conditions respond well to the dry air of a sauna, while others can be exacerbated by dry air but could feel better with the humid air of a steam room. Use common sense and check with your medical provider if you want to use a sauna to manage a health condition.\n\nIf we’re talking about health benefits, it’s only fair to discuss risks as well. Saunas are reasonably safe, but people with medical conditions are often advised to steer clear, or to talk to a doctor before deciding to spend time in a sauna. This may include you if you are pregnant, have unusually high or low blood pressure, have epilepsy, or are taking stimulants, tranquilizers, or mind-altering drugs. Spending time in a sauna has also been linked to temporarily lowered fertility because heat impairs the production of sperm.\n\nThe main danger of a sauna is that you could overheat or dehydrate; severe heat illness and dehydration can both be life threatening, and people have died in saunas. Alcohol makes you more susceptible; half of the people who died in saunas, according to a Finnish study, were under the influence of alcohol. (The authors argue that the biggest danger is not alcohol itself, but allowing a drunk person to be in a sauna alone.) So if you choose to spend time in a sauna, be smart about it. Hydrate well, don’t go alone, and don’t expect the sauna to do things that saunas can’t do.",

    "description": "Some users are not happy.",
    "fullText": "They actually did it. OpenAI officially deprecated GPT-4o on Friday, despite the model's particularly passionate fan base. This news shouldn't have been such a surprise. In fact, the company announced that Feb. 13 would mark the end of GPT-4o—as well as models like GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini—just over two weeks ago. However, whether you're one of the many who are attached to this model, or you simply know how dedicated 4o's user base is, you might be surprised OpenAI actually killed its most agreeable AI.\n\nThis isn't the first time the company depreciated the model, either. OpenAI previously shut down GPT-4o back in August, to coincide with the release of GPT-5. Users quickly revolted against the company, some because they felt GPT-5 was a poor upgrade compared to 4o, while others legitimately mourned connections they had developed with the model. The backlash was so strong that OpenAI relented, and rereleased the models it had deprecated, including 4o.\n\nIf you're a casual ChatGPT user, you might just use the app as-is, and assume the newest version tends to be the best, and wonder what all the hullabaloo surrounding these models is all about. After all, whether it's GPT-4o, or GPT-5.2, the model spits out generations that read like AI, complete with flowery word choices, awkward similes, and constant affirmations. 4o, however, does tend to lean even more into affirmations than other models, which is what some users love about it. But critics accuse it of being too agreeable: 4o is at the center of lawsuits accusing ChatGPT of enabling delusional thinking, and, in some cases, helping users take their own lives. As TechCrunch highlights, 4o is OpenAI's highest-scoring model for sycophancy.\n\nI'm not sure where 4o's most devoted fans go from here, nor do I know how OpenAI is prepared to deal with the presumed backlash to this deprecation. But I know it's not a good sign that so many people feel this attached to an AI model.\n\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "description": "Attackers are impersonating ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok.",
    "fullText": "AI-powered browser extensions continue to be a popular vector for threat actors looking to harvest user information. Researchers at security firm LayerX have analyzed multiple campaigns in recent months involving malicious browser extensions, including the widespread GhostPoster scheme targeting Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. In the latest one—dubbed AiFrame—threat actors have pushed approximately 30 Chrome add-ons that impersonate well-known AI assistants, including Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and \"AI Gmail.\" Collectively, these fakes have more than 300,000 installs.\n\nThe Chrome extensions identified as part of AiFrame look like legitimate AI tools commonly used for summarizing, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance. But once installed, they grant attackers wide-ranging remote access to the user's browser. Some of the capabilities observed include voice recognition, pixel tracking, and email content readability. Researchers note that extensions are broadly capable of harvesting data and monitoring user behavior.\n\nThough the extensions analyzed by LayerX used a variety of names and branding, all 30 were found to have the same internal structure, logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure. Instead of implementing functionality locally on the user's device, they render a full-screen iframe that loads remote content as the extension's interface. This allows attackers to push changes silently at any time without a requiring Chrome Web Store update.\n\nLayerX has a complete list of the names and extension IDs to refer to. Because threat actors use familiar and/or generic branding, such as \"Gemini AI Sidebar\" and \"ChatGPT Translate,\" you may not be able to identify fakes at first glance. If you have an AI assistant installed in Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner, and search for the ID below the extension name. Remove any malicious add-ons and reset passwords.\n\nAs BleepingComputer reports, some of the malicious extensions have already been removed from the Chrome Web Store, but others remain. Several have received the \"Featured\" badge, adding to their legitimacy. Threat actors have also been able to quickly republish add-ons under new names using the existing infrastructure, so this campaign and others like it may persist. Always vet extensions carefully—don't just rely on a familiar name like ChatGPT—and note that even AI-powered add-ons from trusted sources can be highly invasive.",

    "description": "Booing at football is an accepted part of the game. It's been around since time began, but are fans increasingly booing their own team?",
    "fullText": "Booing at football is an accepted part of the game. It's been around since time began, as normal now as pre-match pints and half-time pies.\n\nFor players and match officials it is what they have come to expect at some point in their careers. But are fans booing their own team and manager more nowadays? And if so, why?\n\nThis season we've seen some high profile examples in the Premier League, most notably with Thomas Frank on the receiving end of disgruntled Spurs fans.\n\nBefore his seemingly inevitable sacking the Dane was booed by home supporters once again - Tuesday's 2-1 defeat by Newcastle proving to be the final straw.\n\nWith Tottenham having won just two of their past 17 league matches, Frank himself acknowledged he understood the frustration of fans in one of his final interviews.\n\n\"I understand the frustration, I also understand the easiest thing is to point at me.\"\n\nFrank is not alone. Arne Slot and his players have had similar treatment at times this season, albeit from a much smaller number of the Liverpool faithful.\n\nIt's not just at Premier League games either. In the Women's Super League Brian Sorensen couldn't fail to hear the disgruntlement from sections of Goodison Park as Everton's dismal run of form led to his eventual sacking.\n\nWayne Rooney, who made headlines in 2010 after hitting out at England fans for booing the team, remembers being booed quite a lot in his career.\n\n\"It's always been there. Fans obviously have their opinions and sometimes they're with you and sometimes they're against you,\" he said.\n\n\"It's probably just picked up a little bit more now with more TV cameras, with social media and with phones filming from the stands.\n\n\"Obviously if a player or a player's family is getting abused at stadiums then it can become more of an issue, but generally I think booing is fine.\"\n\nLike his former England team-mate, Joe Hart agrees it's part of the game.\n\n\"You get booed by the away fans,\" said Hart. \"That's kind of par for the course. I've probably received a few from home fans in my time - not many. If I was being booed I was probably doing something wrong!\"\n\nBoth players think booing has always been there. But did it affect them?\n\n\"Maybe it did at the time,\" says Hart. \"I've got no scars from it though, put it that way. I was very much focused on what I was doing so whether I was getting applause or boos it didn't make any difference to how I tried to play the game.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool, Spurs and Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy also remembers difficult moments during his career.\n\n\"At Fulham when we were fighting relegation there were lots of boos,\" he explains. \"You have to take it as a challenge. You have to want to overcome it rather than go the other way and let it affect you, drain your energy and put fear into your play.\n\n\"I always felt like it was a challenge to overcome it, to try and do better. I think if you're playing Premier League football and you're at that level that's your job to do so.\n\n\"We all love it when the fans are singing your name when you've scored the winner or when the team's winning - you can't have just one and not the other.\"\n\nWhy do we boo in the first place? The answer lies in thousands of years of human evolution.\n\nStephen Smith is chair of the British Psychological Society's Division of Sport and Exercise Psychology.\n\n\"We love to believe we are logical, rational animals at the pinnacle of evolution but that's not how we work,\" Smith said. \"85-90% of human decisions are irrational, illogical and completely emotionally driven.\n\n\"When fans boo they make a sound which is guttural and vibrates through the bones, which means it has to be deep. It sounds like a hunting animal and it goes to the heart of our DNA.\n\n\"Emotions feed through a crowd like nothing else. Emotions are infectious. It only needs one or two people to start leading the booing and if someone else starts doing it you want to fit in with the tribe.\n\n\"The emotional part of the brain kicks in and says 'right, I want to display my emotions, the tribe around me are doing it with this behaviour, I'm going to fit in with them'. Booing is the most natural behaviour to show that you're displeased.\"\n\nSmith also thinks the psychological relationship between clubs and fans has changed.\n\n\"Previously there was almost an agreement that existed between fans and the club. They wanted you in to come and support the team, wear the colours and support the boys, but they weren't going to rip you off in terms of the cost.\n\n\"Clubs nowadays have changed that model, that psychological contract between club and fans is broken.\n\n\"They've said 'we're just going to treat you as any other customer, all we're interested in is what you have in your wallet, we're not actually interested in your loyalty to the club'.\"\n\nSo is booing your own team and manager ever justified? The fans we spoke to have mixed feelings.\n\nSpurs supporter Ali Speechly says she would never do it but can understand why some fans do: \"I've booed the ref during the game, but I don't think I've ever booed the manager.\n\n\"I think there's definitely a correlation between ticket prices and booing. When you're spending a lot of money on a product and you're not satisfied with that product then you feel more entitled as a consumer - rather than a fan - of voicing your disappointment and your frustration.\"\n\nFellow Spurs fan Darren Harvey says he would boo if the team was consistently bad.\n\n\"I would tend to feel similar to most other fans and therefore if there was booing and I agreed I'd probably go with it.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like certain things are quite funny to be part of a group and you don't think until afterwards that maybe you shouldn't have done that, you just get carried away in the moment.\"\n\nA Manchester United fan we spoke to is less keen, however: \"I heard the boos at Arsenal when they lost to United and I think they're spoilt fans to be honest.\n\n\"You shouldn't really boo your team, you should stick with them through thick and thin.\"\n\nOne supporter, who wishes to remain anonymous, thinks alcohol and drugs play a role.\n\n\"Because you can't drink, fans get tanked up before they come to the match and that creates more of a problem.\n\n\"I was at the Euros final when England lost to Italy. I witnessed men snorting cocaine right in front of me. The use of alcohol and drugs means fans don't care how they come across.\"\n\nThere is no doubt the mainstream media - including the BBC - plays a role in highlighting booing when it takes place.\n\nIn the case of Frank, the fact a large number of Spurs fans have booed this season is newsworthy and therefore inevitably makes headlines.\n\nSocial media plays a huge role too. Influencers - some with hundreds of thousands of followers - can help to spread a certain narrative.\n\nSpeechly says that probably makes fans more likely to boo: \"On social media, the people who get the most traction are the ones who are spreading negativity.\n\n\"Some people whip up a bit of a frenzy and lots of fans follow these people. They then go into the stadium having read and consumed that narrative online and they're already pre-fuelled with that rage.\"\n\nThis is where it gets tricky. It's difficult, perhaps impossible, to prove whether fans are booing their own team and manager more these days.\n\nCompared with a generation ago it's a safe bet to say booing is talked about more nowadays because of the proliferation of media. It's probably hard for fans to escape all that noise.\n\nLet's get the final word from someone who has been on the receiving end of boos.\n\n\"In an ideal world it makes no sense because if its anything that's likely to affect your players' performance and then affects your team's result why would you do it?\" says Murphy.\n\n\"But we don't live in this idealistic world where everyone is logical. The passion of football fans is what makes the game great.\"\n\nFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you",

    "fullText": "NBA legend Chris Paul has announced his retirement after being released by the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe 40-year-old, widely regarded as one of the sport's greatest point guards, was a 12-time NBA All-Star and 2006 Rookie of the Year.\n\nOne of only seven players to enjoy an NBA career spanning 21 seasons, Paul also helped the United States claim Olympic gold medals in Beijing in 2008 and then four years later in London.\n\n\"This is it! After 21 years I'm stepping away from basketball,\" he posted on Instagram., external\n\n\"Mostly I'm filled with so much joy and gratitude! While this chapter of being an 'NBA player' is done, the game of basketball will forever be ingrained in the DNA of my life.\n\n\"I've been in the NBA for more than half of my life, spanning three decades. It's crazy even saying that.\"\n\nPaul, who was nicknamed the 'Point of God', averaged 16.8 points, 9.2 assists, 4.4 rebounds and two steals a game during a 1,370-game career that started at the New Orleans Hornets in 2005 and effectively ended after a second spell at the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nHe also featured for the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, the Phoenix Suns and the Golden State Warriors, but never played on an NBA championship-winning team.\n\nHe came closest to a gold ring in 2021, when Phoenix reached the NBA finals, only to lose to the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nPaul, who retires second in NBA history for both assists (12,552) and steals (2,728),\n\nhad not played since 1 December, with the Clippers trading him to Toronto earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Senior, Ipape, Hughes, Davis, Lam Goals: Cook 3\n\nTries: Jenkins, Croft Goals: Hankinson 3\n\nLeigh Leopards hit the ground running in Super League with an impressive five-try win against Leeds Rhinos.\n\nAdrian Lam's side took command of the game between teams who finished third and fourth last season as tries from Innes Senior and the outstanding Edwin Ipape had them 10-2 up at half-time.\n\nIn a game where tempers simmered and Leeds' Harry Newman claimed he was the victim of an eye gouge, the Rhinos threatened to get back in the game as prop Cooper Jenkins replied to tries from Jack Hughes and Matt Davis early in the second half.\n\nLachlan Lam put the seal on a convincing win to end Leigh's sequence of four successive defeats against Leeds, for whom Brodie Croft added a flattering late consolation try.\n\nTaylor-Wray stars as Warrington beat St Helens\n\nCatalans kick off 2026 with muddy win over Giants\n\nThe Rhinos went into the game with nine players missing through injury, including reigning Man of Steel Jake Connor, but edged ahead early on as Chris Hankinson's penalty was their reward for sustained pressure as Leigh struggled with the new, stricter interpretation of the ruck rules.\n\nAfter that ragged start, the Leopards burst into life as Ipape broke, Bailey Hodgson injected pace and Lam had the presence of mind to hurl a pass to Senior for a good finish on his Super League debut for the hosts.\n\nIpape was causing havoc and when he led another attack and fed Joe Ofahengaue, the Papua New Guinea international was on hand to grab the offload and force his way over.\n\nAny words of hope from Leeds coach Brad Arthur at half-time quickly dissipated as, from the restart, Riley Lumb dropped the ball and Hughes kicked ahead to score, with Davis adding another as the Rhinos defence again wobbled.\n\nJenkins burst through two tackles to expose the Leigh defence for the first time and score, and with a glimmer of hope Leeds went forward.\n\nNewman furiously claimed his eye had been gouged following a tackle and with tempers fraying he was sin-binned shortly afterwards following a clash, with Davis following him for his part in the melee.\n\nAnother Lumb error handed Leigh territory and Ipape dummied to go right, switched left, and Lam gathered his pass and swivelled out of Tom Holroyd's attempted tackle to seal the win, although Croft gave Leeds' travelling support something to cheer late in the game.\n\nLeigh coach Adrian Lam told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\n\"First home game, with a few new faces in our team, so it was important that we won in front of our own fans in a sold-out stadium.\n\n\"The game went in patches depending on how the referee refereed the game, and I'm not a fan of it. There were too many stoppages and I didn't really need to make any changes in the game because we had time-outs, and checking decisions, and six-agains. Just frustrating, but they can influence the outcome quite easily.\n\nOn Lachlan Lam and Adam Cook partnership: \"They're going to be great together. I'm confident it will come good but it will take Adam and any new player coming over roughly 10 weeks to find their feet. I'm pretty excited about what's going to happen between those two.\"\n\nLeeds head coach Brad Arthur told BBC Radio Leeds:\n\n\"I was really happy with our effort, our fight, and thought we had some good periods of physicality, but some detail… two scrappy tries that you can't afford at this time of the year, some red-zone penalties giving teams a leg-out, at times a bit disjointed with the ball.\n\n\"[Missing nine players] takes away some of your cohesion with the ball. Jake [Connor] has been in there the whole time and you take him out and young Browny [George Brown] who last week had to play full-back because we didn't have a full-back when it would have been nice to play him at half last week.\n\n\"They're not excuses, just reasons why, but I said to the group that we kept fighting hard. We weren't at our best with some of the execution.\"\n\nLeigh: Hodgson; Senior, Niu, Brand, Charnley; Cook, Lam; Trout, Ipape, Mulhern, Ha;ton, Alick-Wienke, Ofahengaue\n\nInterchanges: Hughes, Davis, Badrock, Horne, O'Brien.\n\nLeeds: Miller; Lumb, Newman, Hankinson, Hall; Croft, Brown; Jenkins, O'Connor, Holroyd, McDonnell, O'Neill, Watkins.\n\nInterchanges: Nicholson-Watton, Levi, Cassell, Littlewood.",

    "description": "After the announcement that he will manage both Northern Ireland and Blackburn Rovers this season, how will Michael O'Neill juggle two jobs?",
    "fullText": "It's something you normally only see in video games, but Michael O'Neill will manage both club and country for the rest of the season.\n\nThe news that O'Neill would join Blackburn Rovers on a short-term deal until the end of the campaign comes just six weeks before Northern Ireland's World Cup play-off semi-final with Italy.\n\nNorthern Ireland have not featured at a World Cup in 40 years and are underdogs to beat both the Italians, and then either Wales or Bosnia-Herzegovina, to reach the finals.\n\nAt his new role with Blackburn Rovers, his job is to guide the club out of the relegation places in the Championship with 15 games left.\n\nThere's a lot on the line for O'Neill with club and country, so how will he juggle both jobs?\n\nO'Neill to juggle Blackburn & Northern Ireland roles\n\nGeorgia v Northern Ireland to be behind closed doors\n\nNorthern Ireland supporters could be forgiven for having a sense of deja vu, after O'Neill took charge of Stoke City in November 2019 in a deal that was set to have him guide NI into the Euro 2020 play-offs alongside his duties at the Championship club.\n\nHowever, the Covid-19 pandemic pushed the play-offs back and O'Neill's sole focus became Stoke City, until he made a full-time international return in 2022.\n\n\"This opportunity came to light and it was something that appealed to me,\" O'Neill said on his Blackburn opportunity.\n\n\"Having had discussions with the IFA and with Blackburn, we felt it was something that was feasible, and that was the most important thing for both parties.\n\n\"It's something that I believe I'm capable of doing and both parties will benefit from it.\"\n\nHaving so much on the line for both Northern Ireland and Blackburn has left people questioning how he can balance the two responsibilities.\n\nNorthern Ireland fans spokesperson Gary McAllister told BBC Sport that O'Neill's dual role had \"not been well received\" by supporters, but the 56-year-old does not have any concerns.\n\n\"If I felt for one minute it would distract [from the Italy game], I wouldn't have taken the opportunity,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"And I wouldn't have done that to Blackburn Rovers, either. It's important they have my focus.\"\n\nFor O'Neill to make the opportunity work, preparation has been key. He will take over day-to-day training at Blackburn - alongside Damien Johnson, Steven Davis and Phil Jones - and a lot of his groundwork for the World Cup play-off has already been sorted.\n\nO'Neill said he and his team had studied the Italians, which led him to say \"I don't think there will be any surprises\" from Gennaro Gattuso's side, adding he has already been to Bergamo to visit Atalanta's stadium for the fixture.\n\nHe said: \"November to March is a long period of four months which leaves you with a lot of downtime.\n\n\"The reality of the situation is we've done a lot of work on Italy and we've watched them as much as we can watch them.\n\n\"All the preparation is in place for our training base, so really between now and the game in March, I would just be watching games and watching players.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland face Italy on 26 March - just five days after Blackburn Rovers take on Championship leaders Middlesbrough, and O'Neill feels it will be business as usual after that game as he hopes his NI squad come through their final fixtures unscathed by injury.\n\nHe said: \"I know my squad extremely well. I know pretty much the squad that I'll pick for March and I know pretty much the team that I hope to pick in March as well.\n\n\"I'll be sitting in the hotel on 21 March after Blackburn Rovers have played Middlesbrough hoping that my squad's all going to turn up, and that's something that's not in my control.\n\n\"For me, the benefit of being on the grass will sharpen me coming into the games in March, instead of coming in after four months and having to be in the technical area.\n\n\"I don't see really any downside to it.\"\n\nWhile O'Neill will job share until the end of the season, he doesn't feel an international manager could go part time, and the opportunity with Blackburn came about at an ideal time.\n\nNorthern Ireland's last game was against Luxembourg in November, and O'Neill says he has made the most of that time to prepare Northern Ireland for Italy.\n\nFrom next season, the September and October international windows will be combined into a quadruple header.\n\n\"I don't think it's possible to do it on a part-time role, but I think a situation like this is possible to do, or else I wouldn't try to do it,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"I think that it's feasible to do it at this time in the season, but it wouldn't be something that would be feasible to do September, October and November, because you're rolling into the games much quicker.\"\n\nO'Neill added that the four-month gap between World Cup qualifying and the play-off made the opportunity become a reality.\n\nIt all comes back to preparation and organisation.\n\n\"I think the biggest difference [to the Stoke City situation in 2019] is the fact that we're so well prepared already for Italy,\" he said.\n\n\"That gives me comfort then to look at this opportunity.\"\n\nO'Neill has been brought in at Blackburn to save the club from dropping into League One for the first time since 2018.\n\nHowever, success with his club could cause issues on the international stage.\n\nO'Neill has consistently spoken about having Northern Ireland's players playing at the highest level, but a significant number of players will be going up against O'Neill's Rovers to avoid the drop.\n\nAt Sheffield Wednesday, who seem doomed after their points deduction earlier in the season, goalkeeper Pierce Charles has been a positive in a difficult and injury-hit year.\n\nMoving up the table, there is a strong Northern Ireland contingent at Oxford United, with Brodie Spencer, Jamie Donley, Jamie McDonnell and Ciaron Brown.\n\nOne point above Blackburn, Terry Devlin's Portsmouth are also in danger while Isaac Price, who has been such a key player for O'Neill with Northern Ireland, is far from safe at West Brom.\n\nHowever, for O'Neill, he said he isn't \"having that blood on my hands\" and the fate of those clubs lay with their respective managers.\n\n\"At the end of the day, my job is to do the best I can for Blackburn Rovers,\" he said.\n\n\"The lads who manage those respective clubs, their job is to do the best for their clubs as well. I don't think that's an issue at all.\"\n\nO'Neill refused to be drawn on his future beyond the end of the season but said there was no guarantee he would join Blackburn if he kept them in the Championship.\n\nHis comments on the part-time international management rule that out as a long-term option, so his future in the summer will be either club or country, and not both.\n\n\"The agreement is in place as to the end of the season and we're not looking any further than that at this moment in time,\" O'Neill said.\n\nO'Neill is contracted until the end of the Euro 2028 finals, and although he said there is a release clause in his contract, he still harbours ambitions to reach that tournament with Northern Ireland.\n\n\"I'm ambitious as a manager and I want to manage at the highest level I can,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"This is not about leaving Northern Ireland. It's not about that.\n\n\"It's about an opportunity that's been presented to me, which I think I'm capable of doing in the time frame that we've discussed.\"",

    "fullText": "Tries: King, Taylor-Wray, Hopoate, Thewlis Goals: Sneyd 4\n\nTries: Welsby, Sailor, Feldt Goals: Hastings\n\nCai Taylor-Wray put in a breakthrough performance as the young Warrington Wolves full-back inspired his side to an opening night Super League win over St Helens.\n\nThe 19-year-old, filling the boots of Matt Dufty who left the club last month, scored a try from a lung-busting run and was crucial in two more as the Wire earned their win in a fantastic encounter at a sold-out Halliwell Jones Stadium.\n\nToby King slid over the line to put the Wire ahead before Taylor-Wray ran in while Albert Hopoate rounded out the half.\n\nJack Welsby and Tristan Sailor touched down in quick succession as St Helens turned the game on its head but Josh Thewlis hit back to put the shine on a thumping win for the hosts, with Kyle Feldt running in a late consolation shortly before the hooter.\n\nCatalans kick off 2026 with muddy win over Giants\n\nLeigh impress in opening victory over Leeds\n\nKing's opener came after a sustained spell of pressure from the Wire with Hopoate prospering from a wayward goal-line drop-out, with George Williams going on to provide the offload for King to power over the line.\n\nIf that was good, their second try was even better - after picking the ball up deep in his own half, Taylor-Wray raced in from 70 metres and outran Saints full-back Welsby to the line.\n\nTaylor-Wray was in the mix once more as he showed incredible pace to weave his way through the St Helens defensive line as the Wire went on to feed Hopoate through to score at the corner.\n\nSaints thought they had hit back when Welsby went over but, under new rules brought in this season, the try was reviewed by video referee Chris Kendall after the fact despite being given on the field.\n\nUpon viewing the try again, however, Kendall ruled it out having judged that David Klemmer obstructed Kelepi Tanginoa in the build-up and Saints had another chalked off soon after following an Alex Walmsley double movement.\n\nSaints continued their pressure and were rewarded when Welsby dummied Liam Byrne to go over but, as he extended his right arm out during grounding, he suffered what looked to be a painful shoulder injury which ruled him out for the final 20 minutes.\n\nJackson Hastings missed the extras but atoned soon after when he put in a pinpoint kick towards Sailor who dotted down under the posts with ease.\n\nBut Hastings' night got worse soon after when the former Man of Steel and St Helens debutant was sent to the bin for barging into Taylor-Wray shortly after he offloaded for Thewlis to score Warrington's fourth try of the evening.\n\nWarrington Wolves boss Sam Burgess:\n\n\"I think it was a good night all round for the club. It was the biggest crowd for a long time and a sellout. The connection between the club, the team and town has grown over the off-season and I thought the players played with great spirit tonight.\n\n\"I thought Cai had a bit of an indifferent night. He did some amazing things on the ball that we've all seen but there's some parts of his game that he's still young and raw with.\n\n\"He made errors tonight and he's going to make them all year long. We're just going to have to be patient with that. We're happy to see him develop. He's not going to be the finished article just yet but what he does bring is that he's exciting for us. He's a great player to watch and coach.\"\n\n\"I thought we dipped our toe in the water defensively, which is unlike Saints. Maybe you try and have a little think about what the reason for that would be. Maybe it's overconfidence.\n\n\"We came in with a spring in our step to be honest. We were really confident and ultimately I thought Warrington did a really good job. They were more aggressive than us. They were a lot quicker around the ruck.\n\n\"We didn't move quick enough defensively, we didn't put our bodies in front enough. We lost the ruck and you get what you deserve in that respect. Never doubt that the boys would still be fighting and would come out. We had three disallowed tries and came out over the whitewash a couple of times so they kept fighting which is good.\"\n\nWarrington: Taylor-Wray; Thewlis, King, Hopoate, Smith; Williams, Sneyd; Yates, Walker, Byrne, Stone, Harrison, Currie.\n\nInterchanges: Sipley, Crowther, Philbin, Tanginoa.\n\nSt Helens: Welsby; Feldt, Robertson, Macdonald, Cross; Sailor, Hastings; Klemmer, Clark, Delaney, Wright, Whitley, Shorrocks.\n\nInterchanges: Lomax, Walmsley, Host, Dagnall.",

    "fullText": "Wendy’s is closing several hundred U.S. restaurants and increasing its focus on value after a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter.\n\nThe Dublin, Ohio-based company said Friday that its global same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 10% in the October-December period. That was worse than the 8.5% drop expected by analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nU.S. same-store sales fell even further in the fourth quarter. Wendy’s said late last year that it planned to close underperforming U.S. restaurants, but it gave more details about those closures Friday.\n\nWendy’s said it already closed 28 restaurants in the fourth quarter and ended 2025 with 5,969 U.S. locations. It expects to close between 5% and 6% of its U.S. restaurants – or 298 to 358 locations – in the first half of this year.\n\nThose actions come on top of the closure of 240 U.S. Wendy’s locations in 2024. At the time, the 57-year-old chain said many of its locations are simply out of date.\n\nLike McDonald’s, Taco Bell and other rivals, Wendy’s also plans to emphasize value as it tries to win back inflation-weary customers.\n\n“One learning from 2025 around value, we swung the pendulum too far towards limited-time price promotions instead of everyday value,” said Ken Cook, Wendy’s interim CEO and chief financial officer, in a conference call with investors.\n\nIn January, Wendy’s introduced a permanent “Biggie Deals” value menu with three price tiers: $4 Biggie Bites, $6 Biggie Bags and an $8 Biggie Bundle. Cook said Wendy’s also has new products coming this year, including a new chicken sandwich.\n\nWendy's said its revenue fell 5.5% in the fourth quarter to $543 million. That was higher than the $537 million analysts had forecast.\n\nWendy's expressed confidence that its U.S. turnaround plans and international growth will help arrest its sales slide this year. The company said it expects global systemwide sales — which includes sales at both company-owned and franchised restaurants — will be flat this year. Systemwide sales fell 3.5% last year.\n\nWendy's shares rose nearly 5% in mid-day trading Friday.",

We'll savour that.\n\n\"But like we did last time, back burner now for the FA Cup, concentrate on the league.\"\n\nFor star man Ollie Rathbone, the goal is to keep aiming for the stars.\n\n\"The club's on an incredible journey and we just want to keep adding to that,\" Rathbone told BBC Match of the Day Wales.\n\n\"It's another special night, and it's good to get back to winning ways at home.\"\n\nHaving hoped for time to savour Wrexham's progress, Parkinson's ruthless streak swiftly returned to the fore, as it has done so often during his glorious reign at Stok Cae Ras to date.\n\nWhen asked about memorable nights becoming standard, the 58-year-old responded: \"Let's not get too blasé about it, but listen, we've had so many great nights here and we want more.\n\n\"We're greedy, why shouldn't we be?\"\n\nThe Wrexham manager is only too aware that his side have a strong chance of drawing a Premier League team in the fifth round.\n\nAnd while his wish was ultimately for another home tie in the last-16, goal scorer Windass had a different outcome in mind when it comes to Monday's draw.\n\n\"Hopefully not a big team away because you don't touch the ball,\" said Windass.\n\nIt was a disappointing night for the 1,269 away supporters in north Wales as they saw their side fail to register a single shot on target.\n\nKieran McKenna's starting line-up showed 10 changes from the Tractor Boys' 2-1 win at Derby County six days earlier - fully emphasising the Northern Irishman's desire to put his best resources into securing a top two spot in the Championship.\n\nThe Ipswich boss had no regrets over his decision to make wholesale changes as his side remain firmly in the hunt to clinch an immediate return to the top-flight.\n\n\"Look, it was good players coming into the team. When you make a lot (of changes) at the same time, players who have not had a lot of minutes or need minutes, you're not going to be at your absolute best,\" he told BBC Match of the Day Wales.\n\n\"I know the reasons why we've done it. For me, the right reasons for the football club and I believe in the players who came in. The whole group will be stronger for it.\n\n\"We have 16 league games now in a really short space of time and we're going to need all of those boys.\n\n\"We're disappointed for the supporters that we couldn't go through but we'll use the lessons from tonight that will stand us in good stead for the weeks ahead.\"",

    "description": "After Igor Tudor agrees to take charge of Tottenham for the remainder of the season, BBC Sport takes a look at what supporters can expect to see from his side.",
    "fullText": "Igor Tudor has agreed to take charge of Tottenham for the remainder of the season, so what can supporters expect to see from his side?\n\nFollowing his appointment as interim head coach, Tudor's first game in charge will be a significant one as Spurs host north London rivals Arsenal in the Premier League on 22 February.\n\nThat will allow the 47-year-old less than a week to attempt to implement his style of play once the players return to training on Monday - and they could be in for a shock.\n\n\"His style is intense,\" George Boxall, a football journalist based in Marseille, where Tudor managed between 2022 and 2023, tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"The players do a hell of a lot of running. There's lots of intensity, lots of pressing.\n\n\"He is a really strong personality and he could be a good appointment for Tottenham if they feel they need an electroshock.\"\n\nTudor has been out of work since being sacked by Juventus in October 2025 and is set for his first spell in England, after previously taking charge of clubs in Italy, France, Turkey, Croatia and Greece.\n\nHe is tasked, first and foremost, with easing Tottenham's relegation fears, after a 2-1 loss to Newcastle in Thomas Frank's final match on Tuesday left them five points above the bottom three.\n\nHaving earned a reputation as a no-nonsense defender during a playing career in which he won 55 caps for Croatia and made more than 150 appearances for Italian giants Juventus, there is one certain non-negotiable for Tudor as a manager.\n\n\"He asks his players to run a lot. In a previous interview he said 'If you don't run, you don't play',\" says L'Equipe journalist Pierre-Etienne Minonzio.\n\n\"In his one season in Marseille it was always the same way of playing - 3-5-2 - and it was great to watch.\n\n\"It was not easy because Marseille's best player was Dimitri Payet, a very gifted player but not well-known for running, and he didn't play.\n\n\"It was a joke in L'Equipe - if Igor Tudor had Lionel Messi in his squad, Messi would not play!\"\n\nTudor's sole season in France saw Marseille finish third behind Paris St-Germain and Lens, despite surpassing the club's points total from the previous campaign when they finished second.\n\n\"He did pretty well in Ligue 1. What I liked is that he doesn't try to be liked. He is very direct, says what he thinks and doesn't try to be attractive. There is no seduction,\" says Minonzio.\n\n\"It is the same with the players. He keeps his distance and his obsession is to make training intense with a lot of running so they can be physically fit for the game.\"\n\nTudor won back-to-back Serie A titles with Juventus in 2001-02 and 2002-03, also starting in the 2003 Champions League final, which his side lost to AC Milan.\n\nHaving begun his management career with former club Hajduk Split, Tudor had spells with Galatasaray, Udinese, Marseille and Lazio before he replaced Thiago Motta at former club Juventus in March 2025.\n\nInitially appointed as interim head coach, Tudor was given the job full-time after leading Juventus to a fourth-placed finish in Serie A and Champions League qualification.\n\n\"Tudor is an aggressive manager and that is also what he demands from his clubs,\" says Italian football journalist Daniele Verri.\n\n\"A lot of pressing. When he conquers the ball, he goes vertical. Big strong defenders. He likes to play on the wings. But the main characteristic is being aggressive.\n\n\"Juventus brought him in because he was a former player and they wanted Juventus DNA, someone fans could identify with due to his past, being aggressive, vertical, fighting hard.\"\n\nBut, according to Verri, Damien Commoli's arrival as Juventus' general manager that summer led to growing tension.\n\nTudor was sacked after just seven months following an eight-game winless run, leaving The Old Lady eighth in Serie A and 25th in the Champions League's league phase.\n\nHe departed with eight wins in 17 league games for a win rate of 47.1%.\n\n\"Commoli and Tudor never really got on. Tudor wanted more say during the transfer market, he wanted Kolo Muani to stay and that didn't happen,\" says Verri.\n\n\"He kept changing the starting 11 and that brought uncertainty. Tension grew. Tudor criticised what Juventus did in the market during press conferences, and openly criticised the players after the Lazio defeat before he was sacked.\n\n\"After a relatively good start, he lost control of the team and they stopped performing. The fans were obviously not happy, they are used to winning.\n\n\"Juventus never really had the impression they could take the next step with Tudor.\"\n\nAnalysis by BBC Sport senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel\n\nFirst of all, they wanted an interim head coach until the end of the season. And that immediately narrows the field down.\n\nWithin that, the Spurs hierarchy were looking for someone with top level managerial experience who plays attacking football.\n\nAfter reviewing their options, it is understood Spurs felt Tudor fit the bill for a few key reasons.\n\nHe has experience of working at some top European clubs – and managing big name players.\n\nTudor's reputation is for aggressive football with an attacking intent. This element was particularly important to Spurs after criticism of their style of play under Frank.\n\nTottenham are also said to have admired his work improving teams on a short-term basis.\n\nFor example, his Lazio team were unbeaten in the league for his first two months after he joined.\n\nAt Juventus, he lost only one of his first nine games. In his first full season, he was unbeaten for his first eight matches. His downfall came quickly, however, following that run after losing three away games in a week – to Real Madrid, Lazio and Como.\n\nTudor will be an interim manager and it is thought that they will be looking to secure a different, long-term option in the summer.\n\nHowever, like with Michael Carrick at Manchester United, it may well be an intriguing conundrum if he hits the ground running and sustains a good run of form through what is left of the season.\n\nHajduk Split (2013-2015): In charge for 70 games with a points per game (PPG) average of 1.63, winning the Croatian Cup in 2012-13\n\nPAOK (2015-2016): 45 matches with 1.51 PPG\n\nKarabukspor (2016-2017): 21 matches with 1.29 PPG\n\nGalatasaray (2017): 34 matches with 1.79 PPG\n\nUdinese (2018): Four matches with 1.75 PPG\n\nUdinese (second spell, 2019): 21 matches with 1.33 PPG\n\nHajduk Split (second spell, 2020): 18 matches with 1.56 PPG\n\nHellas Verona (2021-2022): 36 matches with 1.47 PPG\n\nMarseille (2022-2023): 48 matches with 1.83 PPG\n\nLazio (2024): 11 matches with 1.91 PPG\n\nJuventus (2025): 24 matches with 1.58 PPG\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "A fan group has condemned homophobic chanting as a \"stain on our game\" after multiple arrests were made during the FA Cup fourth round match between Hull City and Chelsea on Friday.\n\nSpectators were warned over the PA system to stop discriminatory chanting late in the first half of the match at Hull City's MKM Stadium, and that CCTV inside the ground was being monitored.\n\nA second-half update confirmed that action had been taken, including arrests.\n\nThe club did not confirm the number of arrests made. BBC Sport has contacted Humberside police for comment.\n\nAn on-screen message displayed inside the ground read: \"There has been discriminatory chanting from fans inside the stadium. This is unacceptable and must cease immediately.\"\n\nIt comes after Hull City reiterated in a statement on Thursday that \"any chanting of a homophobic, racist or discriminatory nature is entirely unacceptable and will not be tolerated\".\n\nThe club added: \"Any supporter found engaging in such behaviour will face serious consequences, including immediate ejection from the stadium, the possibility of a banning order, and potential criminal prosecution.\"\n\nChelsea Pride, the club's official LGBTQ+ supporter group, said in a statement: \"Tonight, homophobic chanting was once again directed at our supporters. This is utterly unacceptable.\n\n\"We acknowledge that Hull City made stadium announcements, confirmed CCTV was being monitored, and that arrests have been made. Action matters. Accountability matters. Consequences matter.\n\n\"But let us be clear, the fact that this chant is still being heard in 2026 is a stain on our game.\"\n\nPremier League club Chelsea beat their Championship opponents 4-0 to reach the fifth round.\n\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior said he had been unaware of the chanting as he was focused on the game, but added: \"Any discriminatory language in any form about anything is unacceptable, so I hope it gets dealt with.\"\n\nRosenior continued: \"The fourth official mentioned something to me, but I was so focused on the game. I honestly don't know what's happening.\"\n\nHull City manager Sergej Jakirovic said: \"This is not a place for this, for sure, in the stadium and also in public as well. This is not good.\n\n\"The stadium is not a place for that and this is the reason why they have been arrested.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Why Anthony Elanga is loving his time at Newcastle following his £55m move from Nottingham Forest in the summer.",
    "fullText": "Anthony Elanga's eyes light up.\n\nThe Newcastle United forward is talking about the inordinate amount of time he spends in his \"man cave\".\n\nBut you won't find a game console, stocked fridge or pool table in there.\n\nThis is Elanga's recovery room.\n\n\"My partner won't be too happy about that,\" he said. \"But she knows and appreciates it a lot.\n\n\"It's that extra 1% I'm always trying to find. That will pay off. I've always told myself that.\"\n\nSo much so, after completing his £55m move from Nottingham Forest last summer, and finding a home in the North East, Elanga set about kitting out his new house with a gym, hyperbaric chamber, red light therapy bed, sauna, plunge pool and, even, a 3G football pitch.\n\nThe forward works with a strength and conditioning coach, sports therapist and chef, and had a similar set-up during his time at the City Ground, where he had a hand in 18 goals during an injury-free campaign last season.\n\nElanga has not hit such heights for Newcastle yet, but his determination to succeed has been a constant and he put in his best performance for the club in the 2-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday night.\n\n\"There's still so much more to come,\" he vowed.\n\nGreat attitude but goals have dried up - what's happened to Woltemade?\n\nNewcastle confirm £55m signing of Forest winger Elanga\n\nIt has clearly been a period of huge change for Elanga on and off the field.\n\nAs well as joining a new club, the 23-year-old recently became a father for the first time.\n\nIt was the proudest moment of his life.\n\n\"Bringing Blair into this world and raising her here, it's probably the best feeling ever,\" he said.\n\n\"She's a little Geordie who's going to be raised in Newcastle. She's going to have the accent as well, which is nice.\n\n\"I just can't wait for her to be walking around and touching the football, hearing her talk, having her integrate with other kids here in Newcastle. It's hard to describe. I wouldn't change that feeling for the world.\"\n\nBlair's arrival has clearly given Elanga added perspective.\n\nIt has taken the Swede - like so many before him - a little while to adapt to the intensity, structure and detail of life under Eddie Howe.\n\nNot least during a relentless fixture schedule, where there has been little time to physically train in recent months.\n\nFollowing one or two groans from the terraces, it got to the point last month where Howe said that Elanga needed to feel \"safe\" at St James' Park and \"free to express himself\".\n\nThe supporters responded by singing Elanga's name and encouraging him during a brief cameo against PSV Eindhoven just a few days later.\n\nThey did so once again after he scored his first goal for the club versus Manchester City earlier this month, and after he was substituted during the victory at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday night.\n\nNo wonder Elanga took his time to come off the field after he saw his number go up.\n\n\"I made sure to walk even slower,\" he smiled. \"If I could have stayed there, I would have.\"\n\nIt was a night where Howe received the biggest ovation of all from the away end.\n\nThe Newcastle head coach previously admitted he was not doing his job \"well enough\" following a bruising 3-2 defeat against Brentford last week.\n\nIt led to a lot of soul searching behind the scenes, and the players knew they had to step up.\n\n\"We always want to fight for the gaffer because we know what he has done for each and every single one of us as players,\" Elanga said. \"I've been here for seven months, but I've felt like he's improved me so much.\n\n\"There are things people don't see on the training ground, but he's helped me so much it's unbelievable. He was one of the reasons I wanted to come here because I knew he would improve me as a player.\n\n\"Going on the pitch, we always want to fight for him, even more so that game against Tottenham. Yes, we did that but can we do it again, again and again?\"\n\nThat question has repeatedly been asked of this side throughout a rollercoaster campaign.\n\nNewcastle reached a third EFL Cup semi-final in four years, are favourites to progress past Qarabag into the last 16 of the Champions League and have an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Aston Villa to look forward to on Saturday.\n\nBut Howe's side are 10th in the Premier League for a reason.\n\nThey have won just three away games in the top-flight all season, and only relegation-threatened West Ham have dropped more points from winning positions than the Magpies (19).\n\nNewcastle have been desperately searching for a sustained run of form - individually and collectively - and Elanga is the first to admit that he is \"not where I want to be just yet\".\n\nBut the forward lives by the French saying précis pas pressé, which translates as precise not rushed.\n\nHe feels like he \"couldn't ask for a better place\" to develop.\n\n\"I just want the fans to know I'm committed and the rest will naturally follow,\" he said.\n\n\"Every time I pull on that shirt, there will always be heart and desire – every touch, every tackle, running back, running forward.\n\n\"They expect that from the team as well so hopefully we can continue to build, stay consistent with what we do and remain positive because if you do so, I'm sure we will be fine.\"\n\nElanga has already come full circle at Newcastle as he prepares to return to Villa Park, the scene of his debut on the opening day.\n\nThere is a place in the FA Cup fifth round at stake and getting back to Wembley one day is a source of inspiration for Elanga after he watched on from afar as Newcastle ended a 70-year wait for a major domestic trophy by winning the EFL Cup last season.\n\n\"I could see they were building something special,\" he added. \"This group is very unique.\n\n\"It's probably one of the tightest groups I've ever worked with. The togetherness is unreal here. It just shows with what they did last season.\n\n\"I just wanted to be a part of that. I was at Forest last season and on the outside looking in at what they were cooking here at Newcastle. It just made me want to come here.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

I'm committed to big fights only.\n\n\"I'm the champion, this is a voluntary defence, and I chose this.

    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Bob Evans, the chain of family-style restaurants founded and headquartered in central Ohio, has a new owner.\n\nNew York-based investment firm 4×4 Capital announced on Feb. 4 that it has acquired Bob Evans Restaurants. The deal transfers ownership of the 78-year-old brand from San Francisco-based private equity firm Golden Gate Capital. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nBob Evans operates more than 400 restaurants in 18 states and employs more than 15,000 people. The company is based in New Albany and traces its roots to a 12-stool diner opened in 1948 by founder Bob Evans in Gallipolis, Ohio.\n\nDublin keeps Irish Festival ticket prices unchanged for 2026\n\n“We are proud of what we accomplished in partnership with Golden Gate Capital and excited to begin this next chapter with 4×4’s hands-on partnership,” said Mickey Mills, the restaurant chain’s CEO, who will continue to lead the brand. “Together, we look forward to investing in and enhancing our operations, guest experience, and brand.”\n\nGolden Gate Capital purchased Bob Evans in 2017 for $565 million. At the time, the firm split the restaurants from Bob Evans Farms, the brand’s consumer-packaged good business, which was acquired by Post Holdings for $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Golden Gate explored a potential $600 million sale of the restaurant chain, though a transaction did not materialize. Reports in 2024 indicated the company had hired investment bank Kroll to oversee another sale process.\n\n“We are truly grateful to the terrific team at Bob Evans for their strong stewardship of this iconic brand,” said Neale Attenborough, a managing director at Golden Gate. “We wish the team all the best as they enter their next phase of growth.”\n\n‘Love is Blind’ fans buzzing over central Ohio ties\n\nBob Evans boasts itself as a farm-inspired, family-style restaurant brand known for breakfast offerings, such as its Farmer’s Choice Breakfast, and roasted turkey dinners.\n\n4×4 Capital, founded in 2018, focuses on investing in middle-market consumer goods and services companies across North America. The firm said it takes an active ownership approach aimed at accelerating growth and operational performance.\n\n“What truly sets the Bob Evans brand apart is its distinctive hospitality, welcoming ambiance, and fresh, flavorful food — delivering real value for the whole family,” said Gustavo Assumpção, co-founder and partner at 4×4 Capital, who will serve as executive board chair. “We look forward to partnering with Mickey and the team to maximize long-term growth.”",

    "description": "Fox News analyst Andrew McCarthy says Justice Department's failed attempt to charge six Democratic members of Congress amounts to intolerable abuse of power.",
    "fullText": "A conservative lawyer issued a blistering takedown of President Donald Trump’s attempt to prosecute six Democratic members of Congress.\n\nAndrew McCarthy, a Fox News legal analyst and National Review editor, said an effort by the Justice Department to criminally charge the Democrats made another Trump impeachment more likely.\n\nTrump was impeached twice during his first term in office. In each case, he was acquitted on all counts by the Senate.\n\n“The president will be impeached promptly if Democrats retake control of the House after the November midterms, an outcome his abuses of power have also made highly likely,” McCarthy wrote in a column published in the National Review Wednesday.\n\n“That will be the legacy of yesterday’s reported failed attempt by the Trump Justice Department to criminally charge the ‘Seditious Six,’ as the Democrats in question were labeled by Trump supporters.”\n\nMcCarthy personally characterized Trump’s attacks on the six Democrats as “intolerable” and “impeachable.” He wrote that there was “no plausible justification for the proposed indictment” against Sens. Mark Kelly (Ariz.) and Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) and Reps.

    "title": "Hiding pace? Too slow? What pre-season testing told us",
    "description": "BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson assesses what we learnt  - and what we didn't - from the first pre-season test in Bahrain.",
    "fullText": "There were two key talking points at the first of two pre-season tests in Bahrain - whether the new cars were still \"Formula 1\", and the performance of the new Red Bull engine.\n\nFour-time champion Max Verstappen said the revised cars and engines had turned the highest level of motorsport into an exercise in \"management\".\n\n\"As a pure driver, I enjoy driving flat out,\" Verstappen said. \"And at the moment, you cannot drive like that. A lot of what you do as a driver, in terms of inputs, has a massive effect on the energy side of things. For me, that's just not Formula 1.\"\n\nThe reigning world champion Lando Norris did not agree, saying the new cars were \"a lot of fun\" and pointing out that Verstappen was welcome to race somewhere else if he didn't like it.\n\nMercedes' George Russell - who has a tense relationship with Verstappen and a friendly, wind-up one with Norris - was somewhere in the middle.\n\n\"If you've got the best cars for us to enjoy, it doesn't mean it's going to give the best racing,\" said Russell. \"And you can argue potentially the racing will be a bit more chaotic.\"\n\nRed Bull advantage 'pretty scary', says Russell\n\nIf you watched the hour's worth of coverage shown on television at the end of each day, you might have been wondering what all the fuss was about.\n\nThe cars are clearly different in some ways from previous years, but they still look and sound recognisably like F1 cars on a superficial level.\n\nIn the cockpits, though, they are very different, as a consequence of the biggest regulation change in the sport's history.\n\nThe cars, engines and tyres are all built to new rules this year and they are running for the first time on carbon-neutral sustainable fuel.\n\nThe engines are at the heart of the drivers' concerns, whether enjoying the cars or not.\n\nThe cars are energy starved - the electrical part of the engine now produces about half its total power, while the batteries are about the same size as last year.\n\nThe various ways of recovering the energy so it can be deployed to maximum lap-time effect are changing the traditional sense of what being a racing driver is about.\n\nThe demand for energy recovery is forcing teams to run the electrical motors against the engines along the straights and in the corners.\n\nThat means the engines have to rev high in the corners, so drivers are using lower gears. As Russell pointed out, drivers have to take the corners in ways that maximise energy use over a lap, rather than simply go as fast as they can at all times. As a consequence, they will not always be on the limit of grip.\n\nVeteran Fernando Alonso, a two-time world champion who is regarded by his peers with the highest possible levels of respect, said the team's chef could drive his car around Turn 12, so far below the limit was he in the attempt to save electrical energy.\n\n\"Here in Bahrain, Turn 12 has historically been a very challenging corner,\" Alonso said, referring to an uphill right-hand sweep towards the end of the lap.\n\n\"You used to choose your downforce level to go Turn 12 just flat. So you remove downforce until you are in Turn 12 just flat with new tyres and then in the race. So it was a driver skill, decisive factor to go fast in a lap time.\n\n\"Now in Turn 12 we are, like, 50km/h slower because we don't want to waste energy there and we want to have it all on the straights.\n\n\"So to do Turn 12 at 200km/h instead of 260, you can drive the car, the chef can drive the car at that speed.\n\n\"So I understand Max's comments. But at the same time this is Formula 1 and it has been always like that.\n\n\"Now it is the energy, last year or two years ago, when he won all the races, it was downforce. He could go in the corners at 280km/h and we could go in the corners at 250km/h because we didn't have the downforce.\"\n\nAlonso urged caution before jumping to too many conclusions at this early stage of the new rules.\n\n\"We still love motor racing, we still love competing and for the regs I understand there is less input by the driving skills,\" he said, \"but I think after three or four races maybe we have a better idea.\"\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nJudging competitiveness in testing is always difficult because there are so many variables and teams do not reveal the specification in which they run their cars. Indeed, in many cases teams may try to deliberately fool people.\n\nBut that did not stop Red Bull's rivals noticing something striking about their new engine - it seemed able to deploy more energy for longer on a more consistent basis than other teams.\n\nAlthough Verstappen set only the seventh fastest absolute lap time of the test, Russell said Red Bull's underlying pace was \"pretty scary\".\n\nHe said that, on current evidence, Red Bull were \"going to be ahead\" at the first race, adding: \"We hope we can catch up.\"\n\nRed Bull technical director Pierre Wache rejected this analysis, saying \"clearly the top three teams - Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren - are in front of us\".\n\nRace simulations are usually the best way of judging relative pace, and there Verstappen was consistently gaining about 0.6secs a lap on Norris on the straights when they were running concurrently. Fuel loads and engine modes are not known, of course.\n\nBut the quickest race simulation of the week was done by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, who had the edge on pace over Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari when running at the same time on Friday.\n\nHamilton was matching the pace set by team-mate Charles Leclerc the day before, which was a chunk quicker than Norris was managing at the same time.\n\nThe complication here is that there may well be an element of politicking involved, because in the background there is a rumbling row about the engine rules, with Mercedes at its centre.\n\nTheir rivals believe Mercedes have found a loophole in the rules defining the engines' compression ratios. The claim is that this allows them to comply with the rule that dictates the compression ratio is measured at ambient temperature, but then run the engine on track at a higher ratio by clever exploitation of thermal expansion.\n\nFerrari, Honda, Red Bull and Audi are said to be pushing for a ruling from the FIA before the first race that would stop this.\n\nSo when Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff described Red Bull as the \"benchmark\" on the first day of the test, there were those who wondered whether he was doing so in an attempt to persuade the powers that be that a rule change before the first race was not necessary.\n\nBut perhaps Mercedes' rivals were playing this game, too. Verstappen described Wolff's remarks as \"a diversion tactic\". Leclerc said he believed Mercedes were \"hiding a lot more\".\n\nOn the competitive picture, according to Leclerc, Red Bull and Mercedes were at the front, with Ferrari a little behind, \"but it doesn't seem to be too much of a gap for now\". World champions McLaren, he said, were \"a little bit more difficult to understand\".\n\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella urged people to \"just be careful looking too much into what we see in testing. However, early indications from a competitiveness point of view, definitely put Ferrari and Mercedes at the top of the list in terms of those that seem to be ready from a performance point of view in particular\".\n\nAston Martin 'look four seconds off top teams'\n\nBehind the top four, there appears to be a gap of in the region of 1.5 to two seconds before a midfield group comprising Haas, Alpine and Audi, followed by Racing Bulls and Williams. At the back are Cadillac and Aston Martin, who are the one team being completely transparent about their performance.\n\nThere is so much attention and expectation on Aston Martin, with Alonso at the wheel, design legend Adrian Newey at the helm since March, and Honda their new works engine partner.\n\nBut the year has started badly. The car is way off the pace - around four seconds, Alonso's team-mate Lance Stroll said on Thursday.\n\nBreak that down over the lap using GPS data available to all teams, and it seems about 1.5secs of it is from the engine and the rest from the car, which performs worse the slower the corner gets.\n\nHow, one might wonder, is this possible?\n\nThe answer seems to be a combination of the car design process being behind, partly because of Newey's late arrival, partly because the team are building their own gearbox for the first time ever, and Honda being behind because… well, there is no clear answer to that one.\n\nHonda officially pulled out of F1 at the end of 2021, and dismantled much of its engine department before changing its mind in 2023. But it still had people working on upgrading its existing engine in the meantime, and its lead time for the new regulations has not been very different from Red Bull's, and yet the Japanese company seem to be nowhere in comparison.\n\nAlonso was not happy about Aston Martin's performance on Thursday, throwing his gloves down at one stage after getting out of the car. And who can blame him?\n\nThis could be his final season in F1. He is 45 in July and out of contract at the end of the year. Spending it at the back was not what he was expecting.\n\n\"Definitely we are not in the position we wanted to be,\" Alonso said, pointing out they had been late to start testing, that reliability was still not good, and that was costing them time to hone the car.\n\nThe former F1 driver Pedro de la Rosa, who has been with the team as long as Alonso and has now been appointed team representative to take some of the load off Newey, said: \"Looking back is always easy. If we had possibly started earlier, if Adrian would have been here not 2 March, but a few months earlier, if Honda wouldn't have gone and then come back - it's ifs and buts.\n\n\"Bottom line is we are slow. We're not where we want to be. Let's get a plan together. Let's look ahead, not back [at] what went wrong.\n\n\"It was many reasons. The important thing is that we we know what they are. That's what gives us the confidence that slowly, gradually, the difference will shrink.\"\n\nFastest lap times, Bahrain test one\n\n1 Kimi Antonelli (Ita) Mercedes one minute 33.669 seconds\n\n2 George Russell (GB) Mercedes 1:33.918\n\n3 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Ferrari 1:34.209\n\n4 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 1:34.273\n\n5 Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren 1:34.549\n\n6 Lando Norris (GB) McLaren 1:34.669\n\n7 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1:34.798\n\n8 Oliver Bearman (GB) Haas 1:35.349\n\n10 Franco Colapinto (Arg) Alpine 1:35.806\n\n11 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Audi 1:36.291\n\n12 Isack Hadjar (Fra) Red Bull 1:35.610\n\n13 Gabriel Bortoleto (Brz) Audi 1:36.670\n\n14 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Alpine 1:36.765\n\n15 Alex Albon (Thi) Williams 1:36.793\n\n16 Liam Lawson (NZ) Racing Bulls 1:36.808\n\n17 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Cadillac 1:36.824\n\n18 Carlos Sainz (Spa) Williams 1:37.186\n\n19 Arvid Lindblad (GB) Racing Bulls 1:37.470\n\n20 Lance Stroll (Can) Aston Martin 1:38.165\n\n21 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Aston Martin 1:38.248\n\n22 Sergio Perez (Mex) Cadillac 1:38.653\n\nF1 2026 cars in pictures at Bahrain testing\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?\n\nListen to Back at Base on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "Chelsea striker Liam Delap turns in \"top\" performance in the 4-0 win over Hull City with a hat-trick of assists after missing a sitter.",
    "fullText": "Liam Delap started to celebrate when he thought he had ended his eight-match Chelsea goal drought in his side's 4-0 hammering of Hull City in the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nThe problem was the ball hadn't crossed the line after he had blocked a clearance from home keeper Dillon Phillips.\n\nIt summed up the frustration for the 23-year-old striker, who joined Chelsea in the summer following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship in a deal worth £30m.\n\nDelap has failed to convince Blues fans so far, netting just twice in 23 appearances and his last goal coming in a 2-1 defeat at Fulham in early January.\n\nIt looked like he had ended that run in the 23rd minute of the tie at the Championship promotion hopefuls, where he had a loan spell in the 2023-24 season.\n\nWith the game still goalless, Delap pressured Phillips into a mistake as he tried to clear and the ball looped up, struck the underside of the bar and bounced down onto the goalline.\n\nYet he showed no urgency to put the rebound into the net.\n\nFirst Delap raised his arm to celebrate, then appealed to the officials, before collecting the loose ball and having a shot blocked by the recovering Phillips.\n\nDelap, though, recovered impressively from the error to finish the match with three assists as Pedro Neto's hat-trick and an Estevao Willian strike sent eight-time FA Cup winners Chelsea into round five.\n\nAnd he was able to joke about the bizarre moment afterwards as he told BBC One: \"I swear on my life I almost ran off [the pitch].\n\n\"I thought it went in and then I was waiting for the ref to blow his whistle. Obviously, I should have waited for the ref to blow his whistle. It's silly from me but yeah, crazy.”\n\nPremier League record goalscorer Alan Shearer, speaking on BBC One during commentary of the game, said: \"Goodness me. What is Delap doing?\n\n\"It is as if he is thinking, 'I have all the time in the world'. He ambles to it and he takes his time. What are you waiting for?\n\n\"Liam Delap has not had a good four minutes. He has given it away twice and missed a sitter. Delap has been poor and he has been given the opportunity tonight. Delap looks very lazy, his performances have to improve.\"\n\nNeto hat-trick helps Chelsea beat Hull to reach fifth round\n\nArrests made after discriminatory chants at Hull City\n\nThe former Manchester City striker has started just two of Chelsea's last nine Premier League games, but was handed a chance by Liam Rosenior, with in-form forward Joao Pedro dropping to the bench.\n\nAnd despite Delap's misjudgement, the Blues boss praised the forward for his response and part in the success.\n\nThe ball he played to Neto for the opening goal in the 40th minute was the first pass he had completed in the final third, having lost possession eight times beforehand.\n\nHis second assist for Estevao came after some brilliant hold-up play, while he teed up Neto for the second time at the MKM Stadium with a powerful drive into the box.\n\nRosenior called Delap's performance \"top\" and said: \"To be a number nine, especially in a system that we play, it's not always about yourself.\n\n\"It's about bringing other people into play. It's about sometimes making sacrifice runs so other players get the space.\"\n\nAnd former Blackburn and Newcastle striker Shearer added: \"Delap recovered well from that start and has been instrumental in the win. He deserves a lot of credit for that.\"\n\nEx-Manchester City defender Micah Richards hopes Delap can \"replicate that in the Premier League\".\n\n\"I think Liam Delap's game was brilliant,\" he told BBC One. \"What I liked about it, is when Hull set up in this five, Delap was thinking if he could get into the space.\"\n\nWhile Delap must wait for his next goal, former Spurs and Manchester City midfielder Michael Brown added on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Delap can do anything. He is like a throwback and is that all-around number nine.\n\n\"He is very effective when he is on his game. He is good in the air, he can hold the ball up well, he can defend and he can finish.\n\n\"I think he is another outlet. Chelsea now have a plan B if they want to use it and that could be an option.\"\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Matt Weston cements his status as the best skeleton racer in the world, making history by winning Olympic gold in emphatic fashion in Cortina and securing Team GB’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Games.",
    "fullText": "Standing at the top of the winding Cortina sliding track with Olympic gold in his sights, Matt Weston knew what he had to do.\n\nHaving laid the foundations for skeleton gold on Thursday - tidying up errors from his first run to produce a statement second, each time setting the track record - the Briton merely needed more of the same on Friday.\n\nWhat he produced was not only a masterclass in sliding but also a remarkable display of composure and focus to clinch gold - Team GB's first medal of the Games - and cement his place at the top of the sport.\n\n\"It means everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally, I've worked so hard for this,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But everyone back home - my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone who has sacrificed everything for this. I've missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment. It feels amazing. Hopefully I made you proud.\"\n\nWeston set a track record on all four of his runs and could have eased off in his final attempt having already built a significant margin of 0.39 seconds, but ramped things up on what was ultimately a victory lap lasting 55.61secs, finishing with a sensational overall time of 3:43.33.\n\nIt left an almost impossible task for the chasing pack and Germany's Axel Jungk finished 0.88secs behind to take silver, while compatriot and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer secured bronze, 1.07secs behind Weston.\n\nThe pressure to deliver was there. The 28-year-old from Redhill was the heavy favourite to top the podium in Italy having dominated the sport in the past four-year cycle, but no British man had won an Olympic skeleton gold medal before.\n\nHe also carried the weight of Team GB teetering on the edge of overall disappointment at the Games, having been tipped for a record medal haul at Milan-Cortina but watching those ambitions begin to slip away.\n\nWeston blocked out the noise of 'helmet-gate', of seeing his peer Vladyslav Heraskevych disqualified from the competition just moments before the first heat, and of the disaster that was Beijing 2022, where GB failed to win a skeleton medal for the first time since 2002.\n\nHe put it all aside to add the Olympic crown to his two World Championship titles and three Crystal Globes - the overall World Cup trophies.\n\nFour years ago, it was a different story.\n\nHis overwhelming disappointment at missing out on the Olympic podium almost led to him quitting the sport and he told BBC Sport earlier this year he has had to teach himself to \"love the pressure and expectation\".\n\nFrom speaking to friends and family to knowing when to rest and eating lots of pasta, Weston has figured out the secret to his own success, and now he's reaping the rewards.\n\nThe new champion knows what it feels like to walk away from an Olympics empty-handed, having finished 15th at his maiden Games in Beijing.\n\nKnowing he did not want to feel that again, he has worked on switching his mentality and says that has paved the way for his success.\n\nIn 2023 he became Britain's first men's world champion in 15 years, taking silver the following year but reclaiming his title in 2025.\n\nHis first World Cup title came in 2024 and he has been unrivalled since, earlier this year becoming the first man to defend the trophy twice - winning five of the seven races this season and finishing second in the other two.\n\nArriving at this Games as reigning world, European and World Cup champion, the pressure was on to deliver.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston told BBC Sport after run two on Thursday.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nHe represented England at taekwondo as a teenager, winning various medals at national level, but a back injury brought that particular sporting career to an end.\n\nHe was also a gifted rugby player but, like many skeleton racers, it was through a talent identification programme that Weston discovered his love and aptitude for the winter sport nine years ago.\n\nQuickly rising up the sport came with its own issues and, following that disappointing result four years ago, Weston had to learn to embrace the pressure and, once winning became the norm, carry the weight of being the favourite.\n\nThat attitude has served him well in Italy as he has been able to block out the noise, pointing to enjoyment as the key to his success.\n\nIt has not just been on the track where Weston has blocked out the noise.\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by discussion around the British team's desire to a wear a new helmet design in Italy.\n\nThey ultimately lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), banning them from wearing their new helmet.\n\nWeston and team-mate Marcus Wyatt, who was also tipped for success but finished ninth, were confident it would not make a difference, pointing to the triumphs they have enjoyed all season.\n\nThat came before Weston saw Ukrainian Heraskevych disqualified moments before the men's competition started on Thursday.\n\nAnd after a week of no medals for the British team in Italy, pressure on Weston gradually increased.\n\nBut he knew what he needed to do to win gold, stating he would settle for nothing less in Cortina.\n\nThat doesn't always mean being the first to arrive at the track and the last to leave.\n\nHe sat out Wednesday's final training runs in favour of a rest, opting for some light stretching and mental respite by speaking to his fiance about anything other than sliding.\n\nPlus, eating a lot of pasta, abiding by his motto \"pasta makes you faster\".\n\nUltimately, skeleton training is tricky, particularly for a British athlete.\n\nWith no ice tracks in Britain - only a push-start track at the University of Bath - a lot of time is spent in the gym working on speed and explosiveness to improve that all-important start.\n\nWith one run down the icy track taking less than a minute, it means the British sliders spend around two and a half hours per year actually completing runs and a lot of time visualising the track, understanding the twists and turns to make for a seamless run.\n\nBut Weston has got his rituals down to a tee and not only is he the first British man to win winter gold since Christopher Dean topped the ice dancing podium alongside Jayne Torvill in 1984, but also the first British man to win skeleton gold.\n\nHis success may not end there, as he partners Amelia Coltman in the mixed team event, newly introduced for Milan-Cortina, on Sunday.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Ilia Malinin, the red-hot favourite for men's figure skating gold at Milan-Cortina 2026, suffered a nightmare as he fell twice and missed out on the medals entirely.\n\nIn a remarkable men's free skate, many of the major medal contenders struggled with their routines. Of the final six athletes, five suffered falls.\n\nThe only one to skate clean, Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan, was left stunned as he won gold – his country's first Winter Olympic gold in 32 years.\n\nYuma Kagiyama of Japan, regarded as Malinin's nearest rival for gold, fell on a quad flip and had to settle for silver. Bronze went to his compatriot Shun Sato.\n\nThe USA's Malinin finished eighth after a horrendous free skate in which he visibly crumbled under the pressure.\n\nCompeting in his first Olympics, the 21-year-old arrived with the nickname 'Quad God' having become the only skater to successfully land the quadruple axel.\n\nThe move requires a skater to launch themselves into a jump, spin four and a half times in the air, and cleanly land backwards.\n\nBut Malinin did not pull out this move at all in the Games, although it was registered in his planned elements. Indeed, in this final he only performed a single axel, to groans from the crowd.\n\nAnd, going for a quad lutz, he fell to the ice in a moment that made the Olympics stop.\n\nNo-one expected it. And certainly no-one thought he would fall again, but he did just that two elements later.\n\nAt the end, Malinin grabbed his hair and put his hands to his knees. As he left the ice he could only shake his head on the verge of tears. The Quad God, mortal.\n\nWeston wins emphatic skeleton gold for first GB medal\n\nVonn needs more surgery but 'feels more like herself'\n\nMalinin had come in for some criticism at these Games, particularly around his performance in the team event, in which he was outscored by Kagiyama in the short program before errors in the free skate – in which he had not originally been expected to compete - almost allowed Japan to scoop gold.\n\nReacting to the pressure, Malinin's team took him out of the Olympic bubble to train 35 miles away in Bergamo before the men's event as they hoped it would help him reset.\n\nAnd his cleaned-up performance in the individual short program – finishing five points ahead of the field – seemed like that that of a man in no mood to lose his two-and-a-half-year unbeaten competition streak.\n\nHis lead into the free skate was ominous – this is where Malinin dominates. At the Grand Prix Final, he was third after the short but still finished 30 points clear of the field after the free, landing seven quads.\n\nUsually, he has such an advantage because of a deadly combination of fearlessness and ability. His program for the free skate has a much higher technical score than any of his rivals, and judges will give extra credit for ambition while also rewarding with a higher component score.\n\nBut this was a timid routine. The quad axel subbed for a single, a quad loop reduced to a double. Dreams, turned to rubble.\n\nOn his quad salchow, he only executed a double, then fell. Reality hit, just like the ice.\n\nMalinin's free skate was the 15th best of the night. It earned just 156.33 points, more than 40 behind Shaidorov.\n\nHe performed a backflip for the crowd's entertainment, but it seemed like a forlorn call to the good times of only last week.\n\nIn the team event he had also landed the first legal backflip at an Olympic Games since US champion Terry Kubicka in 1976 - after which it was banned for safety reasons.\n\nThanks in part to skaters like France's Surya Bonaly - who performed the move illegally but successfully at Nagano 1998 - the backflip is now legal again.\n\nMalinin became the first to land it at the Games on only one foot and did the flip again in the short program.\n\nBut really, none of that mattered. And after the scores came in, Malinin went straight to Shaidorov to congratulate him.\n\nThis is Kazakhstan's first Winter Olympic gold medal since Lillehammer 1994, when Vladimir Smirnov won the men's 50km cross-country skiing. That was 10 years before Shaidorov, 21, was born.\n\nAfter a slight slip on the quad lutz, Shaidorov kept his head when all about were losing theirs and produced two clean quad techniques of his own.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "\"I don't need to motivate these players, they are fully aware where we are in the league and what we have done,\" said Manchester City manager Andree Jeglertz.\n\n\"Our attacking play was marvellous throughout the whole game. I'm really impressed and proud.\"\n\nThese comments came after his side had thrashed Leicester City 6-0 to regain their 11-point lead at the top of the Women's Super League.\n\nManchester City have won 14 of 16 games this season, including all nine of their home league matches, only dropping points in defeats at Stamford Bridge and Emirates Stadium against the defending WSL and European champions respectively.\n\nLast Sunday, they were stunned in losing to Arsenal but against Leicester showed their reaction to a rare setback with a superb performance against the league's bottom side.\n\nWhile the chasing pack all have at least one game in hand, City's closest challengers Manchester United are 11 points behind, Chelsea 12 and Arsenal a further point behind in fourth.\n\nWhile those three teams are fighting for Champions League places, it feels a stretch to imagine any of them stopping City claiming their second WSL title.\n\nIndeed against Leicester, despite scoring six, a rampant Manchester City side will be disappointed not to have got more.\n\nThey had 31 shots on goal with 15 on target, recording an xG of 4.61 and an astounding 232 passes in the final third, all highest totals for a WSL side this season.\n\nThis result increased their goal difference to +34, almost twice as good as next best Manchester United (+18) and made it 47 goals from 16 games, an average of 2.94 per game.\n\nMan City go 11 points clear in WSL after thrashing Leicester\n\nManchester City's desire for excellence can be summed up by the attitude of Lauren Hemp, who was player of the match after supplying two assists and creating 11 chances for her team-mates.\n\nAsked how satisfied she was, the England winger replied: \"Yeah, but no goal - I think I need to practise my shooting! But I am really happy to contribute where I can.\n\n\"We are really pleased. We've got a really confident group, everyone is contributing and the substitutes got involved too.\"\n\nMissing out on a Champions League spot last season means Manchester City have played 22 games in all competitions this season while, at the end of this weekend, rivals Chelsea will have played 25, Arsenal 27 and Manchester United 28.\n\nThe squad looks fresh as a result of the extra rest, none more so than star striker Khadija Shaw, who has scored 15 league goals this season, surpassing the 12 she scored last campaign.\n\nEven with the Asia Cup on the horizon and the departure of key players such as Yui Hasegawa, they look well equipped to prosper. Record signing Sam Coffey made her first start in this game and impressed in midfield.\n\nOn Sky Sports, ex-Manchester City captain Steph Houghton noted her old side's determination to succeed this season.\n\n\"There is always an added pressure when you are top of the league with a big points difference, and as a player you naturally feel in those first few days after being beaten [by Arsenal],\" she said.\n\n\"That was the perfect reaction.\"\n\nWith six games left, Manchester City need 12 points to claim the title. If results go their way, they could even win it at Old Trafford in three games' time on Sunday, 29 March.\n\nMaybe that would be enough to satisfy Jeglertz and this hungry group of players.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "Circuit Judge Mark Hayes has ruled in favor of Spartanburg County in a years-long dispute over the prominent display of a Confederate flag near I-85.",
    "fullText": "A Confederate flag that has been on prominent display along Interstate 85 in Spartanburg County has been ordered to fly no longer, according to a ruling by Judge Mark Hayes.\n\nOn Jan. 29, Hayes rejected the Adam Washington Ballenger Camp #68, Sons of Confederate Veterans' appeal of a decision by the Spartanburg Planning and Development Department, which said the 120-foot flagpole was in violation of county regulations.\n\nThe flag was located on Teaberry Road, near I-85.\n\nAccording to the county, because the lot was vacant and had no primary use, such as a residence or business, the “accessory” use of the flagpole was noncompliant with land-use rules.\n\nIn 2023, the Spartanburg County Board of Zoning Appeals ruled in favor of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, overturning the county's decision.\n\nThe matter then went to the circuit civil court, with the county seeking to overturn the zoning appeals board’s decision.\n\nThe Confederate flag has long been a politically contentious symbol in South Carolina. Critics point to its connection to white supremacist groups and the South's history of slavery. Flag defenders have described it as a symbol of regional pride and respect for their ancestors.\n\nWhile the flag's display along I-85 -- in a location where more than 80,000 passed by on an average day -- sparked controversy, the flag flew for many years in a place of even greater prominence: the South Carolina statehouse.\n\nThe Confederate flag was placed atop the statehouse in 1961 in a move to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Civil War.\n\nIt was also in the midst of the Civil Rights era, and Southern states were resisting the push for equality for Black citizens. The flag became a symbol of that resistance for many.\n\nMore: Debate over Confederate flag took on psychology of its own\n\nSouth Carolina kept the Confederate flag flying above the statehouse until 2000, when a compromise was reached to place a smaller version of the flag on the Confederate soldier monument in front of the Capitol building.\n\nThe compromise followed years of debate over the flag's meaning and its appropriateness as a state symbol.\n\nIn 1999, the national NAACP called for a boycott of South Carolina, putting economic pressure on the state.\n\nEventually, the state's business leaders signaled support for removing the flag from the statehouse dome.\n\nFormer Gov. Nikki Haley called for its removal from the statehouse grounds altogether in 2015 after white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine people inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n\nThe flag could once be seen driving south on I-85 and was located off Teaberry Road in Spartanburg County.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Greenville News: Spartanburg County Confederate flag along I-85 ordered to be removed",

    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — A four-vehicle crash in Downtown, Columbus resulted in at least one death, a fire, and caused Interstate 71 North to close Friday morning.\n\nAccording to police, one vehicle traveling in the wrong direction caused a four-vehicle crash that then started a fire on I-71 North, near the East Broad Street exit. Columbus Fire Chief Jeffrey Geitter told NBC4 that one person was hospitalized in critical condition. Columbus police later confirmed that one person died.\n\nLive updates: Milan Cortina Olympics, February 13\n\nIn a released incident report, police state that a black Chrysler Town & Country was traveling southbound in the northbound lanes when it struck a Ford F-150 and a semitruck traveling in the north. A few minutes after the initial crash, a Ram 1500 slowed to avoid the crash, but was hit from behind by a second semitruck.\n\nThe crash was captured on ODOT traffic cameras. NBC4 edited the clip to show the initial crash involving the wrong-way driver and the moments before the vehicle involved in the second crash caught fire.\n\nThe driver of the Ram was hospitalized in critical condition, but later pronounced dead. The drivers of the semitrucks were not injured, while the driver of the Chrysler ran away.\n\nOne of the vehicles was engulfed in flames when emergency crews arrived and all northbound lanes on I-71 were closed since the incident, which occurred just after 2 a.m. Additionally, exit ramps from I-70 to I-71 North were also closed.\n\nThe highway reopened at 9 a.m. Friday after a seven-hour closure.\n\nMatt Bruning, Press Secretary for the Ohio Department of Transportation, told NBC4 that following the Columbus Division of Police investigation, ODOT will review the area.\n\n“There is a lot with this crash that obviously is very concerning and we’ll certainly be waiting to see what the investigation shows occurred and look at is there anything else that could be done from an engineering standpoint and we do that with literally every fatal crash,” he said.\n\n.01% of all crashes in Ohio are wrong-way crashes, according to Bruning.\n\n“It’s very rare we have these types of crashes, but when they happen, they’re very serious and that’s why ODOT takes them so seriously,” he said. “We work very closely with the law enforcement agency that’s investigating that crash to find out how did that driver start going the wrong way, where did that occur, and then we’ll look at are there other counter measures we could put in place. In many cases, there are not.”\n\nBruning said since 2022 the number of wrong-way crashes in Ohio has decreased. He also said over the years the department has taken various steps to try and prevent wrong-way crashes. Those include signage, reflectors, and wrong-way detection technology in certain locations.\n\n“There are a lot of questions certainly we’ll have that hopefully Columbus police are able to find the person and ask those questions because we have them and I’m sure a lot of other people for various reasons have those questions as well,” Bruning said.\n\nAny person with knowledge of the involved vehicle or driver is encouraged to contact the Accident Investigation Unit at (614) 645-4767. Persons wishing to remain anonymous may contact Central Ohio Crime Stoppers at (614) 461-8477.",

    "description": "A record-breaking gravitational wave signal let scientists \"listen\" to a distant black hole merger and put Einstein's gravity to its toughest test yet.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nScientists have used the loudest gravitational-wave signal ever recorded to put Albert Einstein's more than 100-year-old theory of gravity to its toughest test yet — and once again, it passed.\n\nThe signal, called GW250114, came from the merger of two black holes — each about 30 times the mass of the sun — about 1.3 billion light-years from Earth. The event caused ripples through space-time, called gravitational waves, which washed over Earth on Jan. 14, 2025, and were detected by the U.S.-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).\n\nScientists say the event closely resembles the one that resulted in the first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015. That suggests the black holes in both mergers were similar in size and distance from Earth.\n\nHowever, this new signal was recorded with roughly three times the clarity of that groundbreaking 2015 discovery, allowing scientists to test Einstein's theory of general relativity more rigorously than ever before.\n\n\"It was very clearly the loudest event,\" Keefe Mitman, a postdoctoral researcher at the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science and co-author of the new paper, told Live Science. \"This one event provided more information than everything we've seen before regarding certain tests of general relativity.\"\n\nThe signal's exceptional clarity stems from a decade of steady upgrades to the detectors, Mitman said. Those improvements reduced noise from sources that once interfered with cosmic signals, including seismic vibrations and even passing trucks. As a result, the detectors were sensitive enough to the minuscule distortions in space-time — changes 700 trillion times smaller than the width of a human hair — caused by the recently detected black hole merger.\n\nThe findings are detailed in a study published Jan. 29 in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nBecause the recently detected signal was so clear, Mitman and his colleagues could zoom in on a fleeting stage after the merger known as the \"ringdown.\" During this phase, the newly formed black hole briefly vibrates — much like a struck bell — emitting gravitational waves in distinct patterns, or \"tones,\" that encode key properties of the black hole, including its mass and spin.\n\nIn GW250114, researchers detected the two primary tones predicted for such a merger. Each tone yielded an independent measurement of the black hole's mass and spin — and both matched, effectively verifying general relativity, the team reported in the study.\n\nFor the first time, scientists also confidently identified a more subtle, short-lived \"overtone\" that appears right at the start of the ringing — another feature long predicted by general relativity.\n\n\"This event made it very, very obvious that, indeed, this prediction of general relativity was present in the signal, which was really exciting,\" Mitman told Live Science.\n\nHad the measurements disagreed, he added in a statement, \"we would have had a lot of work to do as physicists to try to explain what's going on and what the true theory of gravity would be in our universe.\"\n\nEarlier analyses of the same event, published in September 2025, confirmed another major prediction rooted in general relativity that Stephen Hawking proposed more than 50 years ago. Hawking predicted that a black hole's surface area — the size of its event horizon — can never shrink, even though enormous amounts of energy escape during a merger as gravitational waves.\n\nIn GW250114, scientists estimated that the two original black holes had a combined surface area of about 93,000 square miles (240,000 square kilometers) — roughly the size of Oregon. After the merger, the resulting black hole had a surface area of about 155,000 square miles (400,000 square km) — closer to the size of California — which is consistent with Hawking's prediction.\n\nDespite general relativity's repeated success at describing large-scale cosmic phenomena, physicists suspect the theory cannot be the complete description of gravity in our universe. For example, it cannot explain dark matter or dark energy, which are needed to hold galaxies and their clusters together and to explain the universe's accelerating expansion, respectively. Nor does it reconcile cleanly with quantum mechanics, the framework that governs nature at the smallest scales.\n\nScientists hope gravitational waves from energetic black hole mergers might someday show subtle deviations from Einstein's predictions, which could potentially reveal new physics.\n\nThe ringdown phase is especially promising for such tests, Mitman said. Many \"beyond-Einstein\" theories predict slightly different vibration patterns during the ringdown phase — so measuring more than one tone, as his team did with GW250114, can help scientists place constraints on any possible deviations from general relativity.\n\nIf a discrepancy were to be found, researchers could compare the data with predictions from alternative theories of gravity to determine which, if any, matches reality.\n\n\"There has to be some way to resolve this paradox to make our theory of gravity consistent with our theory of quantum mechanics,\" Mitman said in the statement.\n\nNext-generation detectors, including the proposed Einstein Telescope in Europe and the U.S.-based Cosmic Explorer, will be 10 times more sensitive than current facilities. In addition to detecting more events like GW250114, these detectors will be able to observe lower-frequency gravitational waves, which correspond to more massive black holes, thereby allowing scientists to probe entirely new classes of these cosmic behemoths.\n\n—Science history: Gravitational waves detected, proving Einstein right — Sept. 14, 2015\n\n—The universe is rippling with a faint 'gravitational wave background' created by colliding black holes, huge international study suggests\n\n—Unproven Einstein theory of 'gravitational memory' may be real after all, new study hints\n\nResearchers are also looking ahead to the European Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which is expected to observe gravitational waves from supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Planned for launch in 2035, LISA is expected to detect a flood of events and could reveal dozens of distinct tones within a single black hole merger event, Mitman said.\n\n\"We're living in the regime where we don't have enough data, and we're kind of just twiddling our thumbs waiting for more data to come in,\" Mitman said. \"Once LISA is online, we'll be overwhelmed.\"\n\nIf funding for gravitational-wave science continues, he added, \"we're going to see more and more of these golden events and really start to learn wonderful things about the nature of gravity in our universe.\"",

    "title": "JD Vance: A Prisoner of the Caucasus",
    "description": "Pietro A....",
    "fullText": "The vice president’s trip adds fuel to regional fires.\n\nIf there is one characteristic that defines the erratic and incoherent “Donroe Doctrine” of President Trump, then it must be the principle that “might makes right” in international politics. The Trump administration has little need for international law. It is willfully and blatantly disregarded and, indeed, discarded. Instead, from Greenland to Gaza, from Venezuela to Iran, the “law of the jungle” reigns supreme.\n\nThe essence of the “Donroe Doctrine” can be observed in the administration’s approach to both war and peace. An example of the latter is what occurred earlier this week when Vice President JD Vance flew to the Caucasus in a bid to bolster American influence and pressure on Iran’s northern frontier, at a time when tension between Washington and Tehran has never been higher. Amid profound domestic crises in the US, it would seem prudent to avoid dragging America into such far-flung adventurism, in a part of the world that is virtually unknown to most Americans. Yet there was Vance, stoking tensions with a large regional power—Iran—and a massive atomic superpower—Russia—all while quietly sanctioning democratic decline and ethnic cleansing in the post-Soviet Caucasus.\n\nVance’s Caucasian itinerary consisted of two of the three South Caucasus states—Armenia and Azerbaijan. Georgia, once the favorite of American neocons, was conspicuously avoided. In 2008, its president, Mikheil Saakashvili, had bungled his way into a confrontation with Russia at the behest of the Bush administration. Facing a bear-like reaction from Moscow, Tbilisi was left in the lurch by Washington. While Georgia has since learned from this painful episode, Armenia’s Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan’s Ilham Aliyev have decided to try their luck at the “Saakashvili” approach, with ample encouragement from President Trump. It is at their own peril that they ignore the clear warnings from Russia and Iran against any American presence on their borders.\n\nVance arrived first in Armenia, flying into Yerevan from Milan on a rainy Monday afternoon. A major part of his visit was to reinforce American commitment to the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP). Hailed by the Trump administration as a “historic” project to bring peace to the region, the known details of this initiative indicate that it is more likely to bring war than peace. TRIPP involves Armenia effectively relinquishing control of its crucial southern border with Iran to a joint US-Armenia company (with the US holding a 74 percent stake) for a period of 49 to 99 years.\n\nNaturally, any plan to establish a long-term US or NATO presence on Iranian and Russian frontiers is bound to raise alarms in Moscow and Tehran. Yet in Yerevan Vance not only brushed aside such concerns but even pledged to export $9 billion in the sphere of civil nuclear cooperation, in remarks that raised more questions than answers in Armenia. Observers of the vice president’s press conference with Pashinyan were treated to a stream of empty platitudes of “peace,” even though only a declaration of intent has been signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Indeed, despite Pashinyan’s confident assertion that peace had been definitively established between Baku and Yerevan under President Trump, the fact remains that a formal peace agreement has never been inked between the parties. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan continues to advance territorial claims on Armenia.\n\nVance failed to utter a single peep about Pashinyan’s abuses in office. Despite being catapulted to power in 2018 on proclaimed promises of political reform, Pashinyan instead embarked on a course of de-democratization. Under his neoliberal administration, poverty and inequality have worsened and corruption has flourished. Freedom of speech has come under assault, leaving Armenia with one of the highest pre-trial detention rates in Europe. The democratic right of the Armenians of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) to self-determination—the cornerstone of Armenia’s 1988 Karabakh movement—was betrayed by the PM to the whims of an aggressive Azerbaijan. Even the Armenian Apostolic Church, the country’s foremost religious institution with roots extending back to the time of Christ, has not been spared Pashinyan’s wrath. Despite widespread public trust in the church, Pashinyan’s government has arrested an Armenian bishop and three Armenian archbishops, including the beloved Archbishop Mikael Ajapahyan. Samvel Karapetyan, a prominent supporter of the church, has also been arrested. Even the patriarch of the church—Catholicos Karekin II—has come under attack.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Vance was mum on the sorry state of Armenian democracy. Instead, he took a page from the playbook of Walter Duranty and openly endorsed Pashinyan, emphatically stressing the government’s commitment to “markets” and “prosperity.” “All too predictably, the allegedly devout, pious, believing Catholic US vice president whispered not a word of protest against Pashinyan’s jailing of clergy of the Armenian Apostolic Church,” noted James Carden, a former State Department adviser for the Obama administration. “Instead, these and other unjustly imprisoned will be sacrificed on the altar of TRIPP—none of which redounds to the interests of the Armenian or American people.” Even the most potentially redeeming element of Vance’s trip to Armenia—his visit to the Armenian Genocide monument at Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan—was marred by controversy. Vance, who was accompanied only by his wife, Usha, and not by Pashinyan, laid flowers at the monument’s eternal flame and posted about it on Twitter/X, only to delete the post soon after, out of fear of offending NATO member Turkey.\n\nWhile in Baku, Vance met with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and inked a strategic partnership agreement with him. “For us, it’s a great honor to be a strategic partner to the most powerful country of the world—[the] United States of America,” Aliyev underscored in his press conference with Vance. The Azerbaijani president likewise boasted of “cooperation in defense sales” with the US, a remark likely to be viewed critically in Tehran, given fears of Israeli use of Azerbaijan as a potential “forward base” against northern Iran. For his part, Vance praised Aliyev, noting that “other than President Trump, the only leader in the world that has really good relations with both the Turks and the Israelis is President Aliyev.”\n\nAs in Yerevan, Vance sidestepped the “inconvenient” matter of Baku’s democracy deficit, alluding only to the atrocious state of affairs when referencing the fact that Aliyev’s wife, Mehriban, now absurdly serves as the country’s vice president. “Hopefully that doesn’t give the [US] second lady any ideas,” remarked Vance, in a joke censored by Azerbaijani state television. Nothing was mentioned about Azerbaijan’s pervasive problem with political prisoners and dissidents, such as Bahruz Samadov and Igbal Abilov, to say nothing of the 19 Armenian prisoners languishing in Baku’s jails, such as Ruben Vardanyan. Behind closed doors, Vance reportedly raised the issue of the latter group to Aliyev, but Aliyev’s response is unknown. The vice president did praise Azerbaijan’s army for having “some of the toughest and fiercest troops anywhere in the world,” although he failed to mention that this same army had ethnically cleansed the indigenous Christian Armenian population of Artsakh in September 2023.\n\nNaturally, the Vance visit failed to impress Moscow or Tehran and, by any objective measure, has only succeeded in antagonizing the two Eurasian giants. As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warns that US-Russian relations are “moving in the wrong direction,” the clouds of war continue to gather over Iran. Thus, rather than promoting “peace,” the Vance tour of the Caucasus will only add fuel to the fire of regional tension, signaling a continuation of the reckless interventionism that has come to define US foreign policy in the post–Cold War era.",

    "description": "Bloomberg reported on the stunning numbers in a Thursday article, noting that Russia is now losing more men than it is able to recruit.",
    "fullText": "(Bernat Armangue/Russian Presidential Press Service/AP photos)\n\nRussia’s Vladimir Putin lost twice as many soldiers in January of 2026 as the Soviet Union lost during its entire campaign in Afghanistan in the 1980s, pointed out CNN’s Jim Sciutto this week.\n\nBloomberg reported on the stunning numbers in a Thursday article, noting that Russia is now losing more men than it is able to recruit.\n\nAlex Wickham, the UK Political Editor for Bloomberg, shared the report on X and noted, “ Russia sustained around 9,000 more battlefield losses than it was able to replace in January, according to assessments from Western officials.” Wickham continued:\n\nThe development signals Ukraine’s new strategy of killing more Russian soldiers than the Kremlin can replenish via recruitment is having some success.\n\nRussian forces were unable to achieve any significant gains on the ground in January even as they took these very heavy losses, the officials said.\n\nAbout 35,000 Russians were KIA in December, roughly equal to Moscow’s monthly recruitment, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nBut in January Russian losses exceeded recruitment.\n\nBloomberg’s reporting put Russian losses for January just around 44,000 dead on the battlefield, a number Sciutto made even more eye-popping with added context. The Soviet Union lost some 14,500 to 23,000 troops between 1979 and 1989 fighting in Afghanistan, although estimates vary.\n\nSciutto shared Wickham’s post and wrote, “In a single month, Russia had twice as many soldiers KIA as its entire ten-year war in Afghanistan, which helped bring down the USSR. The losses are staggering.”\n\nIn a single month, Russia had twice as many soldiers KIA as its entire ten-year war in Afghanistan which helped bring down the USSR. The losses are staggering. https://t.co/IlzR8Fi4uQ\n\n— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) February 12, 2026\n\nWickham added some additional analysis on what Russia’s losses mean for the ongoing war in Ukraine: “While the situation is difficult for Ukraine, especially for civilians without heating, Russia is taking incredibly high losses for no reward. At the current rate it will still take Russia two years to fully take Donetsk Oblast, according to the assessments. It raises further questions for Putin’s ability to make a breakthrough on the ground, despite the Russian narrative – at times echoed by Trump – that its victory is inevitable. It suggests Ukraine still has leverage in negotiations.”\n\nThe post Bombshell Report Finds Putin Lost Twice the Number of Troops In January as the Soviets Lost In 10 Years Fighting In Afghanistan first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The sports media is ignoring the story, but wealthy sports figures are all over the Epstein files.\n\nChild sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein did not want to ingratiate himself only to billionaires. He wanted to spend time with people who shaped the culture, and as we saw during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show, nothing shapes the culture quite like the athletic industrial complex.\n\nThe website Front Office Sports went through the latest tranche of hurriedly redacted Epstein files, and it is shocking just how many NFL franchise owners are in these e-mails and assorted documents. They include—and this is a partial list—Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots; Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants and first cousin of Jessica Tisch, the current New York City police commissioner; Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins; Zygi Wilf, owner of the Minnesota Vikings; and Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons. There are more NFL owners in the Epstein files than attended the Super Bowl.\n\nDenials have already been sputtered, and the owners’ public relations machines are working in overdrive to deny that they are anything more than incidental acquaintances of Epstein. But how many were actually friends with Epstein is less relevant than the fact that everyone who associated with Epstein ignored and excused what was often happening in plain sight around them. And as hard as their PR mavens are working to deflect attention, the sports media is working just as hard to ignore it all.\n\nAfter all, who could possibly imagine that Kraft would be involved in anything illicit when it comes to exercising power over young women? ESPN has essentially not covered the sports figures involved with Epstein. There are scant few articles under the byline “ESPN News Services,” which draws from the Associated Press. There has been no investigative journalism or televised commentary on one of their yak-fests. When one considers that the NFL now owns a portion of ESPN, not to mention that the NFL is central to much of its programming, the network’s blasé attitude toward the story is odious.\n\nEven more damning in the released files is the repeated presence of LA 2028 Olympic chairman Casey Wasserman. He says he did nothing wrong, though two Los Angeles supervisors and two members of the City Council have now called for him to resign from his role with the Olympic organizing committee. LA City Council member Monica Rodriguez said that Wasserman represents “a threat to the integrity of the games.”\n\nWassermans’s clients are already leaving his talent agency in protest. Olympian Abby Wambach and popstar Chappell Roan have dropped Wasserman and are calling for him to step down from the agency that bears his name.\n\nOf course, by any moral marker, Wasserman should not be allowed within 500 yards of the Olympics (or a school). His e-mails to Epstein’s partner in child trafficking, Ghislaine Maxwell, date back 20 years and include unredacted tidbits like, “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” LA Mayor Karen Bass, however, has not joined the call for him to disappear from the 2028 Games, already being called “The Epstein Olympics.”\n\nThe unconvincing excuses for keeping Wasserman at his post include the difficulty of replacing the chair of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee at this late of a date, as well as his ability to raise corporate cash. After what the organizing committee described as an “internal investigation,” Wasserman, whose grandfather Lew Wasserman was one of Hollywood’s most powerful people, is staying on as chair. We need to fight to see every page of the Epstein files with only the names of the survivors and victims redacted—but that is not enough. To paraphrase journalist Nolan Higdon, it is becoming more and more difficult to “shield the architects of the second Gilded Age”—and they deserve no such protections.\n\nThe Epstein files have exposed that global elites have never been wealthier and more influential, but they’ve become drunk on power after decades of plunder. This second Gilded Age isn’t ending until the exposure is total and its criminal offenders are frog-marched out of the owners’ boxes.",

    "fullText": "Southern California will experience a mild, sunny warming trend through Sunday before a series of three cold storm systems arrive starting Monday.\n\nCoasts and valleys will reach the low 70s this weekend; Monday’s storm could drop up to 2 inches of rain in lower elevations and 4 inches in mountains.\n\nMeteorologists are still determining the exact moisture levels of the third potential system expected to hit the region on Thursday.\n\nLOS ANGELES - Southern California is bracing for a significant shift in weather as three powerful storm systems are forecast to end a warm dry spell, bringing heavy precipitation and hazardous conditions through late next week.\n\nA warming trend fueled by light offshore winds will occur from Friday through Sunday, according to the latest NWS forecast.\n\nDuring this window, coastal areas and valleys should see highs in the upper 60s to low 70s, while mountain and inland areas will remain in the 50s and 60s.\n\nThe NWS has identified Sunday as a \"transition day\" before the first and strongest of two storm systems arrives from the northwest.\n\nThis initial wave is expected to deliver the heaviest rainfall on Monday, with 1 to 3 inches forecast for coastal and valley regions and 2 to 5 inches in the mountains.\n\nThe storm will also bring a risk of thunderstorms, strong winds, and high surf. Snow levels will initially sit around 6,500 feet but are expected to tumble as colder air moves in.\n\nA second storm is slated for Tuesday into Wednesday, followed by a third on Thursday.\n\nFriday – Sunday: Mild warming trend with peak temperatures on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nSunday Night: The first storm system reaches the Central Coast.\n\nMonday: Widespread heavy rain and the start of the \"wettest\" period of the week.\n\nTuesday – Wednesday: The second storm arrives; snow levels begin to drop significantly.\n\nThursday: A third system may impact the region, though moisture levels are unconfirmed.\n\nWhile the timing for the first storm is relatively certain, the NWS notes that \"it’s always difficult to time these features 4 or more days out,\" particularly regarding the exact end of the second system.\n\nWhile debris flows are a major concern, the precise locations of the most intense rain rates within burn scars remain difficult to pinpoint until the storm is closer.\n\nSnow levels are expected to undergo a dramatic change as the week progresses.\n\nWhile the snow level will start near 6,000 feet on Monday, it is forecast to fall to between 3,000 and 3,500 feet by Wednesday.\n\nThis could lead to significant snowfall in lower mountain passes and potentially hazardous driving conditions.\n\nClear drainage: Ensure gutters and storm drains are clear of debris to prevent localized flooding.\n\nMonitor burn scars: Residents near recent burn areas should stay alert for weather updates and be prepared to evacuate if debris flow warnings are issued.\n\nAvoid the surf: Stay away from rock jetties and the water, as large breaking waves and dangerous rip currents are expected.\n\nPrep for snow: If traveling through mountain passes Tuesday or Wednesday, carry tire chains and an emergency kit.\n\nThis report is based on information from the National Weather Service.",

    "description": "The agency, which regulates U.S. passports, began issuing cease and desist orders to not-for-profit libraries in late fall, informing them they were no longer authorized to participate in the Passport...",
    "fullText": "NORWICH, Conn. (AP) — The U.S. State Department has ordered certain public libraries nationwide to cease processing passport applications, disrupting a long-standing service that librarians say their communities have come to rely on and that has run smoothly for years.\n\nThe agency, which regulates U.S. passports, began issuing cease and desist orders to not-for-profit libraries in late fall, informing them they were no longer authorized to participate in the Passport Acceptance Facility program as of Friday.\n\n“We still get calls daily seeking that service,” said Cathleen Special, executive director of the Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut, where passport services were offered for 18 years but ceased in November after receiving the letter. “Our community was so used to us offering this.”\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the order was given because federal law and regulations “clearly prohibit non-governmental organizations” from collecting and retaining fees for a passport application. Government-run libraries are not impacted.\n\nThe spokesperson did not respond to questions as to why it has become an issue now and exactly how many libraries are impacted by the cease and desist order. In a statement, they said, “passport services has over 7,500 acceptance facilities nationwide and the number of libraries found ineligible makes up less than one percent of our total network.”\n\nThe American Library Association estimates about 1,400 mostly non-profit public libraries nationwide could potentially be affected, or about 15% of all public libraries, depending on how many offer passport services.\n\nDemocratic and Republican members of Congress from Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Maryland are pushing back, sending a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month asking him to extend the existing program until Congress finds a permanent solution.\n\n\"In a time when demand for passports is surging, libraries are among the most accessible passport acceptance facilities, particularly for working families and rural residents,” the members wrote.\n\nThe lawmakers' letter said people will have to travel long distances, take unpaid time off from work or forgo getting a passport when demand is surging due to Real ID requirements. If Republicans in Congress impose strict new voting rules, citizens could need their passport or birth certificate to register. People fearing immigration agents are also increasingly carrying passports to confirm their citizenship.\n\nThey said the change is particularly disruptive to their states, where many public libraries are structured as nonprofit entities. They predicted some libraries, which benefit financially from passport processing fees, will have to lay off staff, cut programs or close their doors if not allowed to continue providing passport services.\n\nPublic libraries are organized differently in each state. In Pennsylvania 85% of public libraries are non-profit organizations, versus being a department of a local municipal government. In Maine, it's 56%; Rhode Island, 54%, New York, 47% and Connecticut, 46%, according to the American Library Association.\n\nPennsylvania Reps. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat, and John Joyce, a Republican, have proposed bipartisan legislation that would allow 501(c)(3) non-profit public libraries to continue to serve as passport acceptance facilities by amending the Passport Act of 1920. A similar companion bill is pending in the Senate.\n\nDean, who first learned about the policy change from a library in her district that has provided passport services for 20 years, called the State Department's interpretation of the law “nonsense.”\n\nIn Joyce's rural, south-central Pennsylvania district, the Marysville-Rye Library is one of only two passport facilities serving the 556-square-mile Perry County, according to the letter to Rubio. Now the county courthouse will be the only remaining option.\n\nThe State Department noted that 99% of the U.S. population lives within 20 miles of a designated passport processing location, such as a post office, county clerk's office or government-run library authorized to accept in-person passport applications.\n\n“Should the removal of an ineligible facility affect passport services, we will work to identify new eligible program partners in the impacted area,” the agency spokesperson said.\n\nBut Special said the Norwich post office had often referred people to her library for passports when someone needed service outside regular hours or had children who needed to be watched and entertained while their parent filled out the paperwork. Library staff also assisted applicants with language barriers.\n\n“And now the burden falls on them to do all of it and that’s tough on them,\" she said of the post office down the street. \"I don’t know how they’re keeping up, to be honest, because it was such a popular service with us.”",

    "fullText": "(FOX40.COM) — The Sacramento Police Department is continuing its investigation into the tragic death of a 3-year-old boy.\n\nOfficers arrived at the 3300 block of Douglas St. around 12:30 p.m. Thursday for a medical aid call. They said they first found the child with serious injuries.\n\n“Despite life-saving measures, that boy was pronounced deceased on scene by fire personnel,” Allison Smith, a spokesperson for the Sacramento Police Department, said.\n\nPolice said the investigation is just beginning.\n\n“Currently, this is a suspicious death investigation and the Sacramento County Coroner’s Office will release the identity of the deceased after next of kin have been notified,” Smith said.\n\nFOX40 asked Smith about the nature of the child’s fatal injuries.\n\n“Right now, I just have preliminary information,” Smith said. “They were serious injuries in nature and enough to unfortunately cause them to pass away on scene.”\n\nOfficials also could not confirm whether or not any weapons were found at the scene.\n\n“We can tell you we’ve been in contact with the family members,” Smith said. “I don’t know specifically who was at home with the boy when this all occurred, but someone appeared to be at home and they contacted the fire department.”\n\nPolice said the scene appears to be contained, which means they do not believe there is any imminent threat to the public.\n\n“This is a tragic incident,” Smith said. “Any time a child dies, it’s difficult — unimaginably difficult for the family and everybody who responded to the scene … first responders, family members, loved ones.”\n\nOne neighbor, T. Henderson, has lived in the area for about ten years. She said this is the first time she’s seen something like this happen there.\n\n“It almost makes me want to cry,” Henderson said. “I’m still really in shock that this is actually happening this close to home.”\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact the Sacramento Police Department.

    "description": "It can take months to treat the fungal infections, which were first reported in the U.S. in 2024",
    "fullText": "Minnesota is seeing the largest outbreak of sexually transmitted ringworm in the U.S., with infections disproportionately affecting men who have sex with men.\n\nMore than 30 confirmed or suspected cases of the fungal infection have been reported in the state since last July, according to the Minnesota Department of Health, and all were within the Twin Cities metropolitan area.\n\nThe ringworm - known as trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII, or “TMVII” - was first reported in New York City in June 2024.\n\nMinnesota’s Health Department said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is aware of other sporadic cases in larger cities across the U.S.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Public Health previously said the first patient with TMVII had traveled to California before he was diagnosed in New York.\n\nTMVII has been circulating in Europe and among people who traveled to Southeast Asia for sex tourism for several years, but is not currently considered widespread in the U.S.\n\nTMVII is the only known sexually transmitted fungal infection, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nSometimes confused for eczema or psoriasis, TMVII spreads through skin-to-skin contact or exposure to fungal spores. The ringworm can spread through genital contact, as well as to the face, bottom, torso, arms and legs.\n\nIt can cause painful and itchy red, coin-like rashes, sometimes with bumps or pimples on top.\n\nInfections can vary in severity, sometimes leading to complications even with treatment.\n\nPatients may see lesions and open sores that increase the risk for secondary bacterial infections and lead to harmful inflammation.\n\n“Some patients might develop painful and persistent rashes that can lead to scarring or worsening infections that need to be treated with antibiotics,” health officials warned last month.\n\nDiagnosing TMVII infection requires advanced testing, although most labs have trouble distinguishing TMVII from two other fungal infections known as T. mentagrophytes and T. interdigitale, according to the CDC.\n\nPatients may require weeks or even months of oral medication, and people should avoid using steroid creams, as they will worsen TMVII infection.\n\nTo prevent exposure, people should avoid sexual contact if they or their partner has a new rash and avoid sharing personal items, such as clothing, towels, bedding and razors.\n\nItems should be washed and dried on high heat, and fungal spores can be killed with common disinfectants or strong detergents.\n\nPeople who believe they have a rash should make sure it is covered with bandages or clothing and wash their hands with soap after touching the infected area to reduce the risk of spread to other areas of the body.\n\n“While the overall public health risk is low, state health officials say MSM, people who use anonymous apps, and people with a history of sexually transmitted infections may be at higher risk,” according to the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
