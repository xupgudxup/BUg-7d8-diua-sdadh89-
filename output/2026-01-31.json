    "fullText": "Manchester City matches across the remainder of this season will become a test of patience and nerves as the pressure ramps up. City continue to find ways to win, but supporters are watching with a mix of pride and nervous energy. There’s trust in the system, but pressure brings out scrutiny — and this season, there’s plenty of that going around. Especially as the 25/26 season enters a critical phase as Pep Guardiola’s side chases honours on multiple fronts.\n\nManchester City are only four points behind league leaders Arsenal in the Premier League table. They are also through to the round of 16 in the Champions, hold a 2-nil lead over Newcastle in their Carabao Cup semi-final tie and have progressed to the fourth-round of the FA Cup. Pep Guardiola’s side have a busy schedule ahead with every game appearing to be significant in the coming months.\n\nSuccess doesn’t come without leadership on the pitch. Several players are starting to take more responsibility in difficult moments, or their return injury will add precious leadership traist. Bernardo Silva has risen to the challenge in recent weeks. Manchester City’s captain has shown his willingness to do whatever it takes to lead his team to victory. His performance against Newcastle United’s formidable midfield in City’s 2-nil Carabao Cup semi-final first leg tie win illustrates this point. Bernardo is inspiring his team and challenging his teammates to follow his lead.\n\nRodri is working his way back to full fitness and rediscovering his touch. At his best, his influence in midfield helps control the rhythm of games, and his availability seems to lift the confidence of those around him. Manchester City will be hoping that with every game that Rodri plays, his influence grows. Ruben Dias, with his vocal presence and defensive organisation, remains vital, especially when the team is under pressure late on. Dias is due to return from injury against Liverpool at Anfield next weekend, so his presence should be a massive boost to Pep Guardiola’s side. He has been missed although, Marc Guehi, and especially Abdukodir Khusanov have shown what they are capable of in his absence.\n\nThese players, when fully fit, aren’t just performing; they’re carrying the pressure, visibly leading when matches tighten. For supporters, seeing familiar faces step up is reassuring.\n\nBalancing competitions takes its toll. The fixture list has left little room for rest, and minor injuries have become more common. That’s opened up space for players like Abdukodir Khusanov, Nico O’Reilly, Rayan Cherki and others to be given more prominent roles and play in positions that make them vitally important to Pep Guardiola’s side. Their energy and drive have brought fresh intent, although there’s also been the occasional reminder that experience matters.\n\nSquad rotation remains necessary, but it has its risks. Repeated changes to the starting eleven affect rhythm, and it’s something fans have noticed. Manchester City’s 2-nil loss to Bayer Leverkusen in late November illustrates this point. Some matches feel disjointed, with too many lineup adjustments altering Manchester City’s rhythm. Although the benefit of fresher legs and a deeper bench is clear to see as the fixtures come thick and fast for Manchester City.\n\nManaging fitness levels across four competitions takes planning, and City have handled this well in recent years. But this season has shown signs of wear in certain areas, particularly when cover is needed for key players. But throughout January, Pep Guardiola’s squad has been hit hard by injuries. The fact that City continue to chase honours on four fronts is a testament to the drive, work rate and determination of the fit City players.\n\nThe new-look Manchester City team is still getting up to speed, which speaks to the fact that Pep Guardiola’s side is in transition. However, if injuries continue to hit the same positions, pressure may shift to those with less experience at the top level. The recent use of Max Alleyne in City’s defence shows what can happen when injuries hit one position in a cluster.\n\nFebruary and March feature defining moments. The Champions League knockouts return, and the Premier League table remains tight. Each result could reshape how the season is remembered. This brings intensity on and off the pitch. Supporters feel it building, and the reaction to every result now echoes louder across platforms.\n\nThe pressure isn’t only felt inside the stadium. There is attention from everywhere, including those interested in following the current form through betting markets. When matches go into stoppage time or goal differences matter, more than just supporters are paying attention.\n\nManchester City’s experienced players know how to handle these periods. That said, the intensity can still impact decision-making. High-pressure environments tend to test not only skill, but concentration. Every misplaced pass or missed chance seems bigger when points are harder to come by.\n\nFans can help here. Keeping the focus on support rather than criticism during dips in form might not change outcomes directly, but it helps maintain a sense of unity around the team. And when margins are tight, that connection matters.\n\nFollowing this City team means being emotionally invested in every outcome. One week, there’s excitement; the next, there’s debate over tactics or selections. It’s a natural part of supporting a side that’s held to such high standards.\n\nAcross social media and post-match forums, conversations shift fast. One moment, a player is being praised for a strong performance. A week later, the same name is being questioned for a dip in output. It’s not always fair, but it reflects how closely every move is watched.\n\nThat scrutiny becomes part of the pressure, too. Players are aware of the noise. Some use it as motivation, while others need more time to adapt to the spotlight. Supporters can set the tone, and when that tone stays balanced, it’s easier for players to respond with confidence.\n\nSupport doesn’t mean ignoring poor performances. It means recognising when effort is there, even if results aren’t perfect. This season might ask more from fans emotionally, but the connection to the squad has never felt more important.\n\nThe question still stands — can this Manchester City squad handle the pressure? So far, they’ve given every reason to believe they can. The results haven’t always come easily, but the attitude,  team spirit and effort have remained consistent outside of Manchester City’s recent defeats to Manchester United and Bodø/Glimt.\n\nThere’s pressure, but there’s also belief. Previous Manchester City teams hav dealt with intensity and pressure before and found results when others expected a drop. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but it gives a strong reason to keep faith in the new-look City squad and look ahead with confidence.",

    "title": "WWE SmackDown 1/30/2026: 3 Things We Hated And 3 Things We Loved",
    "description": "The 2026 Royal Rumble go-home show is in the books — here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 1/30/26 episode of \"WWE SmackDown!\"",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s weekly review of \"WWE SmackDown,\" coming to you this week from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (and thus airing internationally earlier in the day before its usual American broadcast Friday night). The go-home show for the 2026 Royal Rumble featured the latest men's US title open challenge, a star-studded tag team main event, and potentially one last WWE TV promo from AJ Styles before he stares down the end of his career on Saturday. The WINC staff have thoughts about all these things, and several other things that happened on the latest installment from the blue brand — including the fact that not a whole lot actually happened despite the three-hour runtime.\n\nAs always, those who missed the show and/or want an objective rundown can check out our \"SmackDown\" results page, which is unburdened by anything as gauche as an opinion. Opinions are what this column is for! Here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 1/30/26 episode of \"WWE SmackDown!\"\n\nTime and time again, we've consistently seen WWE drop the ball when it comes to their go home editions of \"WWE Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" countless times ahead of their Premium Live Events. They generally tend to not really accomplish a ton when it comes to paying attention to the storylines going into the Premium Live Event, nor do they do much outside of verbal confrontations and brawls to generate as much last minute hype as possible. This go-home \"SmackDown\" was no different than the others before it, feeling incredibly underwhelming and disappointing to watch.\n\nOutside of some mild build for the Drew McIntyre and Sami Zayn encounter and (arguably) the 2026 Men's Royal Rumble match, absolutely nothing of note happened on \"SmackDown.\" AJ Styles and GUNTHER had a very short lived verbal confrontation that felt far from as intense as it should've been. Absolutely no new entrants were announced for the 2026 Women's Royal Rumble, and there was just a total lack of real storytelling actually happening on this show. It felt more like a series of standard matches, and was an incredibly lazy way to leave a \"lasting impression\" on the fans ahead of one of the biggest Premium Live Events on WWE's calendar year.\n\nIt is becoming a theme every week but once again Carmelo Hayes defended the United States Championship in an open challenge and once again it was a certified banger. Rey Fenix stepped up to the plate this time around in Riyadh, and if we're being entirely honest he didn't stand a chance of wresting the title from Hayes on this night, but that certainly didn't stop him from giving it his best shot.\n\nFenix, being one of the world's best luchadors, is a more than impressive high flyer with the silkiest of moves on the mat, the ropes, or anywhere in between. Combine with that with the hard-hitting yet bouncy style of Hayes and there was the perfect equation for a fast-paced and action-packed title match. Which, to be honest, should be half of the goal when it comes to a midcard title match. The other aspect that should be present is the spotlight for someone who needs it, and while his brother Penta has become a rather consistent fixture on the \"WWE Raw\" brand the same cannot really be said for Fenix.\n\nHe is undoubtedly one of the very best to do what he does, but there has been very little reason outside of that mythology to feel any type of way towards him in WWE. Losing a United States title match to Hayes is hardly going to remedy that right away and make him a star off the bat, but for what it was in the moment Fenix and Hayes put on a really enjoyable stretch of wrestling and there's really not much to be complained about there.\n\nEven though I am mostly among the believers who think that AJ Styles is losing to GUNTHER at the Royal Rumble tomorrow, I liked the promo he cut tonight on \"SmackDown,\" and I really appreciated the fact he and GUNTHER were both on the show. \"SmackDown\" is the house that Styles built, to be fair, and he and GUNTHER didn't look out of place at all.\n\nIf the blue brand is going to continue to be three hours long every Friday, there's no reason why WWE shouldn't be putting stars from both brands on the final go-home show to big premium live events, especially this one, where all the talent had to fly around the world to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnd, while I'm (again, mostly) in the camp of believing Styles' WWE career is done as of tomorrow, I am ever-so-slightly shaky on that prediction, as I could see both ways, and in this promo, Styles did his best to convince fans that he will be going on a retirement tour after all, one that doesn't stop with \"The Ring General.\" Styles told fans not to be worried about tomorrow, he's going to knock GUNTHER's teeth down his throat and that is what's going to kick off the \"Phenomenal Farewell Tour.\" He mentioned wanting one more match with the likes of Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton, as well as CM Punk when the crowd chanted his name.\n\nThis was also the first promo, I believe, that GUNTHER promised to make Styles tap tomorrow. Which, Styles had a great comeback to, bringing things all full circle, when he said that last time he checked, it was GUNTHER who tapped out \"like a little b****.\" That didn't exactly help to make anything more clear for me as to how this goes tomorrow, as Styles was pretty convincing in his argument that he made GUNTHER tap first. I'll admit, this is one time I don't mind being unsure as to how things are going to go.\n\nEither we get GUNTHER's \"Career Killer\" strengthened even further tomorrow, or we somehow get a John Cena-esque retirement tour for Styles. I think I'll be fine with either option, but if it is the end for Styles in WWE, he at least made a fine attempt tonight to convince us all that it's not. On a go-home show where not much exciting happened, an appearance by Styles to say his piece before what might be his final moment in the company was a welcomed addition.\n\nWe all know what Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair, Roxanne Perez, and Liv Morgan are capable of doing with their endless amounts of talent, so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that all four women had a great tag team match with each other.\n\nNow, I will be the first to admit that this was a very typical Judgment Day match with all of the interference and shenanigans that went on. However, in the particular case of this match, I actually think that all of the usual Judgment Day interference contributed to things rather than take away or distract as it usually tends to do. By having Stephanie Vaquer be the one to take out Raquel Rodriguez, it worked to build up the tensions between the two women ahead of their Women's World Championship match on \"Raw\" next week without taking anything away from the action that was going on inside of the ring.\n\nAlexa Bliss may have also spent the vast majority of the match being beaten down by Liv Morgan and Roxanne Perez, but the action was still engaging to watch in my opinion with a good pace throughout it. It felt like a very intentional choice, and works to provide Bliss with another reason to be angry at Flair when their inevitable split eventually happens to end their tumultuous yet fruitful friendship. On a \"SmackDown\" where I didn't really feel particularly excited about any one specific match or segment on the whole, this was the one that stood out far above the rest for me as a fun watch.\n\nThe Miz is an odd phenomenon with me, both someone I can respect for his tenure and ability to remain on the booking sheet, but also someone I never really want to see step in the ring again. A great talker, a solid worker, and super consistent. The issue is, he is consistently not that good. Not bad. But definitely not good. The equivalent of watching paint dry; I understand it is a process the paint must go through but I do not know why I have to watch it. The answer to that situation is to simply not watch it. Trust me, I am acutely aware. But in the spirit of trying to review the show I watched, had some moments of fun with, I don't know if it's a good thing to stage matches that evoke that reaction.\n\nMiz is a storyteller, for better or for worse, and absolutely does his best when there is a story to tell – that isn't the same as the past year's \"No one respects me even though I have been here for so long\" rigmarole, anyway. But just booking him opposite Dragunov and saying, \"Now, wrestle\" is not going to yield a good result. What happens instead is what happened — Dragunov working his a** off to produce a somewhat passable match and Miz, while not bad, is just incapable of switching into that next gear.\n\nEverything he does feels a little bit played out, down to the \"Yes\" kicks he adopted from Bryan Danielson for a feud that ended years ago, the shenanigans and attempted cheating, the hyperbolic swinging DDT he does. Maybe it is Miz fatigue talking. And it's certainly not like I am saying he should be gone from the company – like my opinion would make a shred of difference anyway. He has a place. I just don't feel like it's opposite someone like Dragunov, clearly light-years ahead of Miz in terms of talent between the bells, and certainly not with the amount of offense he got in. It's just not believable when the gulf in quality is so wide. At least Dragunov won, there is that.\n\nAfter Jacob Fatu and Cody Rhodes' match at Saturday Night's Main Event never got underway, and was just one big, brutal brawl until Undisputed WWE Champion Drew McIntyre put an end to things, I thought maybe we'd get some more answers tonight on \"SmackDown.\" If not answers, I assumed Fatu and Rhodes would be at each others' throats the entire night, ahead of the Royal Rumble where one eliminates the other, or they eliminate themselves trying to drag the other over the top rope. But, I didn't really get either of those things tonight, and the fact Fatu and Rhodes weren't brawling, and didn't even get physical at all until the very end of the night was pretty confusing.\n\nRhodes opened up the show and did acknowledge their brawl at SNME, but said their \"fun\" was interrupted by McIntyre, and chose to address the champion rather than the guy who was kicking him all around the arena on Saturday. Instead of Fatu coming out to do anything, it was Orton who interrupted Rhodes' promo when he continued to go on about the Royal Rumble. Sure, the Saudi fans loved Orton, but it was really strange that Fatu didn't do a single thing after what we saw on Saturday.\n\nThe main event of the show saw Rhodes, Sami Zayn, Jey Uso, and Orton take on The Vision, in WWE's usual multi-man babyface vs. heel match on a go-home show to a big event. Throughout that match, once again, no Fatu. We didn't see the \"Samoan Werewolf\" until the bell had rung on the match, after McIntyre interfered, causing the disqualification. And then, it was the champion who Fatu went after, not Rhodes, though \"The American Nightmare\" did get his hands on Fatu. They started to fight, but McIntyre then went after Rhodes. But, initially, Fatu didn't care about Rhodes being there whatsoever.\n\nIt's still not clear to me why McIntyre wants to be involved in any of this. Sure, Fatu thinks McIntyre is the one who put him on the shelf, but McIntyre could have just steered clear of him. I thought the story of tonight would be Rhodes and Fatu still going after each other ahead of tomorrow's Rumble match. That wasn't the case, and it makes their SNME non-match feel all the more strange. This wasn't a great go-home angle on their feud ahead of the Rumble match, and I'm left wondering just how it all plays out tomorrow when it could really count for both men.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Another crucial Premier League matchweek awaits, with title contenders, European hopefuls, and relegation battlers all facing defining tests.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City both face tricky away fixtures as the pressure at the top of the table intensifies. Several sides in the bottom half will view this round as a major opportunity to gain breathing room.\n\nWith injuries, suspensions, and recent form playing a key role, fine margins are expected to decide many of the fixtures. This gameweek promises drama across the table and potential shifts at both ends of the standings.\n\nBrighton extended their winless run to three matches following a 2–1 defeat to Fulham last week. The Seagulls have struggled in front of goal, scoring just once in each of their last three games.\n\nThis clash with Everton is expected to be a tight affair decided by fine margins. Brajan Gruda has been passed fit, while Diego Gómez remains a doubt.\n\nA second-half goal from Thierno Barry earned Everton a point against Leeds, extending their unbeaten run to three matches and lifting them into the top half of the table.\n\nJack Grealish has been ruled out for the season with an ankle injury, while Tim Iroegbunam is a doubt. Michael Keane remains suspended for the final match of his three-game ban.\n\nLeeds welcome league leaders Arsenal to Elland Road hoping to disrupt the Gunners’ title charge.\n\nThe Whites have enjoyed a strong run of form, losing just one of their last six matches, which has lifted them to 16th in the table with 26 points.\n\nGabriel Gudmundsson has an outside chance of featuring, while Jaka Bijol, Lukas Nmecha, and Daniel James remain close to a return but will miss this fixture.\n\nArsenal suffered only their third league defeat of the season against Manchester United last week.\n\nThe result cut their lead at the top to four points, leaving Mikel Arteta’s side with little margin for error. The Gunners boast an almost fully fit squad, with Max Dowman the only confirmed absentee.\n\nBottom-placed Wolves saw their four-game unbeaten run end with a 2–0 defeat to title contenders Manchester City. Despite an improved performance, Pep Guardiola’s side ultimately proved too strong.\n\nJean-Ricner Bellegarde has returned from injury, while Ladislav Krejčí is a doubt due to illness.\n\nBournemouth picked up a morale-boosting 3–2 win against reigning champions Liverpool to extend their unbeaten run to three matches.\n\nA dramatic 95th-minute winner from Amine Adli sent the Cherries’ fans into raptures and eased concerns following the departure of Antoine Semenyo. David Brooks remains a doubt.\n\nChelsea made it back-to-back wins with a convincing victory over an out-of-sorts Crystal Palace last week, with goals from Estêvão, João Pedro, and Enzo Fernández.\n\nThe Blues followed that up with a Champions League win over Napoli to secure automatic qualification for the next round. Confidence is clearly building under the Stamford Bridge lights.\n\nLiverpool bounced back from late heartbreak against Bournemouth by securing a resounding 6–0 win over Qarabag in the Champions League.\n\nThe victory guaranteed progression to the knockout stages and restored confidence. Ibrahima Konaté and Curtis Jones have been passed fit, while Jeremie Frimpong remains sidelined.\n\nNewcastle’s four-game unbeaten league run came to an end with a 2–0 home defeat to Aston Villa. Despite that setback, the Magpies remain in the top half of the table.\n\nJoelinton and Tino Livramento are ruled out, while Bruno Guimarães is a doubt.\n\nAston Villa returned to winning ways with a vital victory over Newcastle, moving them closer to league leaders Arsenal.\n\nIt was their first league win in three matches, and they followed it up with an impressive Europa League comeback against Red Bull Salzburg.\n\nYouri Tielemans and John McGinn remain long-term absentees, while Ross Barkley and Ollie Watkins are doubts.\n\nBrentford received a boost as Mikkel Damsgaard and Kristoffer Ajer avoided serious injuries and could feature after being substituted in last week’s defeat to Nottingham Forest.\n\nMichael Carrick will look to extend his dream start as Manchester United’s interim manager by securing a third consecutive win.\n\nVictories over Manchester City and Arsenal have lifted the mood around Old Trafford to levels not seen in years. Patrick Dorgu has been ruled out for ten weeks with a thigh injury, while Joshua Zirkzee remains a doubt.\n\nFulham’s 2-1 win over Brighton last week saw them move just three points behind Chelsea in fifth place.\n\nThe Cottagers have only lost once in their last five games, with two of them being wins. Kenny Tete has been passed fit for the Cottagers, while Samuel Chukwueze is a doubt due to personal reasons.\n\nNottingham Forest made it three games unbeaten with a much-needed win over Brentford.\n\nWhile their season has been inconsistent, recent results suggest improved defensive discipline as they aim to pull clear of the relegation zone.\n\nCrystal Palace continues to struggle, with off-field and on-field issues mounting.\n\nJustin Devenny is ruled out for three weeks with an ankle ligament injury, Philippe Mateta will not travel due to personal reasons, and Adam Wharton is suspended.\n\nSpurs host Manchester City in the standout fixture of the gameweek. Thomas Frank’s side have struggled domestically, failing to win any of their last five league matches and sitting 14th in the table.\n\nHowever, a Champions League victory over Eintracht Frankfurt secured automatic qualification to the next round. Micky van de Ven will undergo a late fitness test.\n\nManchester City returned to winning ways with a routine 2–0 victory over Wolves, their first league win in five matches. Pep Guardiola’s side face a tougher test this weekend, with Jeremy Doku and Rúben Dias both ruled out.\n\nSunderland slipped out of the top half of the table following a 3–1 defeat to West Ham.\n\nThe Black Cats have won just once in their last five matches but remain level on points with several top-ten sides. A clash with fellow newly promoted Burnley promises an open contest. Captain Granit Xhaka is ruled out through injury.\n\nBurnley picked up their third consecutive draw against Spurs last week, leaving them rooted in 19th place. The Clarets remain ten points from safety after 23 games, but Joe Worrall and Zion Flemming have both been passed fit for this fixture.",

    "fullText": "In a surprise move, at least in terms of the timing, the Minnesota Vikings fired general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah on Friday after four years on the job. He had been given a contract extension just last May following the draft, but after an additional year to evaluate, according to Vikings president and co-owner Mark Wilf, the Vikings decided they didn’t want Adofo-Mensah making the key personnel decisions in free agency and the draft in what Wilf described as a critical off-season for the Vikings.\n\nBased on Mark Wilf’s comments, the decision to fire Adofo-Mensah hinged on the decisions he made over the past nine months, or perhaps more likely the results of the decisions. It may also be that the last year was enough to tip the balance from ownership having confidence in Adofo-Mensah despite a mixed track record, to them losing confidence after a lost season that resulted from Adofo-Mensah’s decision-making.\n\nThe Vikings went all-in during free agency last season, spending the second-most of any team in 2025, believing they were set for a deep run in the playoffs behind quarterback J.J. McCarthy. That roll of the dice came up snake-eyes. As a reference, the Vikings were in the middle of the two Super Bowl teams- the Patriots and Seahawks- in free agent spending last year. The fact that Sam Darnold, who the Vikings let go last year, is now leading his team in the Super Bowl doesn’t help the optics for Adofo-Mensah’s decision-making either.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I suspect Adofo-Mensah was fired for two key reasons.\n\nFirst, he didn’t secure a viable backup/competitor at quarterback in the event McCarthy wasn’t ready or didn’t work out. He had the opportunity with Sam Darnold, Daniel Jones, and Aaron Rodgers, but he ultimately let all three go in favor of Sam Howell, who was cut at the end of training camp and led to the Vikings picking up Carson Wentz off the couch at the end of August. Darnold, Jones and Rodgers all played for their teams this past season for around $15 million salary cap hits. It’s a dereliction of duty to both spend a ton of money in free agency thinking you’re a contender and not have a proven starter at the most important position in professional sports. But that’s what happened.\n\nCertainly head coach Kevin O’Connell had significant input into the decisions at quarterback, but ultimately how the Vikings allocated their salary cap was Adofo-Mensah’s decision to make.\n\nSecond, Adofo-Mensah’s drafting track record has not inspired a ton of confidence and, as Mark Wilf pointed out in his press conference, the Vikings have a lot of draft picks this year- 11 overall including 4 in the first three rounds. Adofo-Mensah’s lackluster track record in the draft has been somewhat offset by more success in free agency, including undrafted free agents, but the key free agent acquisitions last year- Javon Hargrave, Jonathan Allen, and Will Fries- all underperformed their contracts last season. Ryan Kelly did too due to his injuries and had an injury history as an older player that was a known risk.\n\nThe Vikings are now around $40 million over the salary cap for the 2026 season, depending on what the final salary cap number turns out to be, so having a new GM that isn’t tied to Adofo-Mensah’s past decisions may be helpful in getting the Vikings’ salary cap under control. That also means the Vikings won’t be acquiring any high-profile free agents this year, with the possible exception of an affordable quarterback to compete with McCarthy.\n\nThe Vikings are also in a situation where they need to be shopping players like Javon Hargrave, T.J. Hockenson, Jordan Addison, and Jonathan Allen ahead of free agency in hope of trading them away for decent compensation. That won’t be easy because all of them arguably underperformed their contracts last season except Addison on his rookie deal. But Addison’s immaturity off-the-field will likely bring additional scrutiny. But to the extent the Vikings can find trade partners, they will likely have even more draft picks at the end of April.\n\nSo, when you look at the key tasks the Vikings’ general manager would need to handle in the coming weeks- cleaning up Adofo-Mensah’s all-in 2025 and significant cap overage, picking a large draft class, and having a solid contingency plan at quarterback, why would the Vikings have Adofo-Mensah in charge of all that given his track record and poor decision-making led to this situation?\n\nThere really is no basis for it.\n\nAdam Schefter reported that there had been “tension” in the Vikings’ building according to league circles this season and that one source said turned ugly. Alec Lewis with The Athletic reported a few months ago some tension last spring around the quarterback decision-making. There is another unconfirmed report that Adofo-Mensah prioritized J.J. McCarthy over Sam Darnold last off-season while Kevin O’Connell preferred Darnold and the Vikings nearly traded McCarthy to the Raiders. There was also some disagreement around drafting McCarthy. The Vikings attempted to move up for Drake Maye, and Adofo-Mensah was reportedly willing to part with three first-round picks and change to do so- which was a significant premium- but the Patriots turned him down.\n\nI don’t know if we’ll ever know for sure what the decision-making was regarding all the various options the Vikings had this time a year ago, and who supported what option(s), but if head coach and general manager are not on the same page regarding the quarterback position, that is a problem for any NFL team.\n\nThere was also tension between defensive coordinator Brian Flores and now former assistant head coach Mike Pettine, who retired earlier this year. He said there were disagreements with Flores and that he would take the high road and not discuss them. Pettine moved from the defensive side to the offensive side this past season due to differences with Flores.\n\nKevin Seifert with ESPN reported that:\n\n“Multiple sources said that defensive coordinator Brian Flores’ unusual decision to let his contract lapse, before signing a new deal that will pay him more than $6 million per season, was based in part on his unease with the direction of the front office. When asked last month if he wanted to remain with the Vikings, Flores noted that he loved working for the Wilfs and with O’Connell, and loved living in Minnesota, but did not mention Adofo-Mensah.”\n\nI mention all this because the Wilfs also seem to value a general manager that keeps order and lead the organization through adversity and conflicts. Rick Spielman was fired at least in part because he wasn’t able to manage differences with Mike Zimmer and maintain a positive atmosphere, for lack of a better term, within the building. The Wilfs may have begun to conclude that Adofo-Mensah, between his personnel decision-making and how he handled other situations, was losing respect for his leadership within the building.\n\nAnd with so many key decisions to be made in the coming months, and a growing lack of confidence within the building in Adofo-Mensah’s ability to make them, the Wilfs may have also concluded that it may only create more problems if Adofo-Mensah is the one making them. Adofo-Mensah’s body language in recent months seemed to reflect that lack of confidence, so it may not have been much of a surprise to him when he was let go.\n\nNobody has more respect or tenure in the Vikings front office than Rob Brzezinski, who was EVP of Football Operations before being named Interim GM. He has been the Vikings’ lead contract negotiator and salary cap guru for over ten years. He is also well respected around the league and has contacts and dealings with every NFL team. That background should serve him well as he is undoubtedly tasked with fixing the Vikings’ salary cap issues and finding trading partners for several veterans on the roster.\n\n“Rob brings tremendous credibility and experience, understands our roster and has the ability to build consensus and rely on the expertise of our personnel and coaches,” – Mark Wilf\n\nSometimes what ownership extols in a new coach or GM is something that was notably missing in the last coach or GM. That was the case when Mark Wilf introduced Kevin O’Connell and may well have been the case in his comments about Rob Brzezinski. His words “credibility”, “ability to build consensus”, and “rely on the expertise of our personnel and coaches” stand out to me in that regard.\n\nBrzezinski isn’t a scout or talent evaluator, however, so those types of decisions will fall on the current scouts and assistant GMs Ryan Grigson and Demitrius Washington, both of whom are Kwesi Adofo-Mensah hires. Presumably both are at risk of being replaced once a new general manager is named following the NFL draft at the end of April. There isn’t enough time to conduct a search and hire a new GM that can also be prepared to conduct a crucial draft for the Vikings, let alone a new scouting staff.\n\nOf course the Vikings will also lean heavily on their coaching staff in evaluating talent, both on the pro side and potential draft picks. I’m also curious if recently extended defensive coordinator Brian Flores is tasked with more of a role in the personnel/scouting area, given his background in scouting with the Patriots, at least on an interim basis. We’ll see.\n\nIf it is true that Kevin O’Connell wanted to prioritize Sam Darnold over J.J. McCarthy last year, which may have been the case- O’Connell seemed more disappointed to lose Kirk Cousins too- then McCarthy may have lost his biggest backer in the Vikings’ organization in Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. A new GM will not be tied to the decision to draft McCarthy #10 overall and may also be unwilling to make McCarthy the presumed starter this off-season either. It probably doesn’t make sense to trade McCarthy at this point- I can’t imagine he carries much trade value now given his injury and performance history- but his status as a #10 overall pick will no longer carry the weight it once did in determining the quarterback depth chart. Two of the more likely possibilities for the Vikings as a veteran acquisition are Malik Willis and Mac Jones. At this point it seems unlikely that McCarthy would beat out either one for the starting job in a competitive situation this offseason. That could put McCarthy on the extended development track as a backup.\n\nWas able to snag a couple Vikings QB nuggets while in Mobile: \n\n– The team still has faith in McCarthy but injuries are the main worry. \n\n– Source with inside knowledge shared Mac Jones is definitely on the Vikings radar, but there are a number of other teams interested.\n\n– One…\n\n— Jason Harmon (@JasonHarmonNFL) January 29, 2026\n\nThe Vikings also are likely to have interest in Anthony Richardson, who apparently they were interested in moving up to draft in 2023. Richardson was always thought to have a Josh Allen type ceiling but only had one season as a starter in college. He’s still only 23. The Colts seem likely to move on from Richardson this off-season, although he has one year left on his rookie contract.\n\nJeremy Fowler reports that as an analytics GM with a background as a Wall Street veteran rather than a former football player, he never really fit in with the more traditional football guys inside the Vikings’ building. And so, when his approach and perspective didn’t yield results, his credibility was pretty well shot. And with that, his ability to lead the organization.\n\nThe decision, or series of decisions, to prioritize an unproven J.J. McCarthy, which led Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones to sign elsewhere and to not make Aaron Rodgers an offer, was the biggest mistake of Adofo-Mensah’s tenure with the Vikings. Going all-in on other free agent signings while not having a proven starter at quarterback was unnecessarily risky, given the quarterbacks the Vikings could have signed.\n\nBut Adofo-Mensah was sold on the idea of drafting a franchise quarterback on a rookie contract and building around him. Get it right and the team will flourish. But in doing so, he didn’t consider that a former bust who flourished, even though he was only supposed to be a bridge quarterback, might also get you where you want to go. And he didn’t give enough credence to the fact that at least half of all first-round quarterbacks don’t work out for the team that drafted them.\n\nA bird in hand is worth two in the bush.",

Koepka currently trails the tournament leader, Justin Rose, by a whopping 14 shots.\n\nRose holds a four-shot lead over Irishman Seamus Power heading into the weekend after Rose fired rounds of 62-65 to reach 17 under.\n\nA win this week would mark the 13th of Rose's PGA Tour career - and his second Farmers Insurance title, after winning the tournament in 2019.\n\nRose will get his third round started on Saturday afternoon in the final grouping alongside Power and Joel Dahmen (-11) at 1:07 p.m. ET.\n\nYou can watch Saturday's third round of the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open from 1-3 p.m. ET on Golf Channel and 3-6:30 p.m. ET on CBS.

    "description": "Behind a dominant first half and a 26-point, 12-rebound performance from Yaxel Lendeborg, Michigan controlled the rivalry showdown from start to finish, knocking off Michigan State 83–71 in East Lansing.",
    "fullText": "Michigan delivered a statement win in its rivalry with Michigan State on Friday night, pulling away from the Spartans for an 83–71 victory behind a dominant first half and a monster performance from Yaxel Lendeborg.\n\nThe Wolverines set the tone early and never really let it go. Michigan raced out to a 42–26 halftime lead, shooting 44% from the floor in the opening 20 minutes while holding the Spartans to just 36.7% for the game. By the time Michigan State found any offensive rhythm, the hole was already deep.\n\nBut the Spartans did not go away. After a quick 6-0 run to start the second half, MSU made it a game for much of the final 20 minutes. The Spartans were led almost entirely by Jeremy Fears Jr., who finished with a game-high 31 points on 9-of-20 shooting and a near-perfect 12-of-14 at the line. Fears kept Michigan State alive with tough drives and shot creation, particularly in the second half when MSU actually took a two-point lead with 6:55 remaining in the contest. Coen Carr added 10 points and seven rebounds, but consistent scoring help was hard to find.\n\nFor Michigan, Lendeborg was the engine all night. The junior forward finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds, going 6-of-13 from the field and an efficient 13-of-15 at the free-throw line. His physicality inside consistently bent Michigan State’s defense and allowed Michigan to control the paint and the glass. Whenever the Spartans threatened to make a run, Lendeborg seemed to answer with a bucket, a board, or both.\n\nLendeborg was Michigan's big dog, but Elliot Cadeau complemented him perfectly. The scrappy guard poured in 17 points on 5-of-8 shooting and knocked down three triples, while also dishing out six assists. Cadeau’s pace and decision-making helped Michigan keep its offense organized, especially during stretches when Michigan State tried to speed the game up in the second half.\n\nMichigan’s balance was evident throughout the box score. Roddy Gayle Jr. and Morez Johnson Jr. each chipped in timely minutes, while Michigan shot a strong 38.1% from three-point range (8-of-21) and an outstanding 88.5% from the free-throw line. The Wolverines also took care of the ball, committing just 13 turnovers while converting Michigan State mistakes into points when needed.\n\nUltimately, Michigan’s early execution proved decisive. The Wolverines led for over 36 minutes, built their advantage with an 8–0 first-half run, and never allowed Michigan State to fully flip the momentum, despite a raucous crowd inside the Breslin Center. In a rivalry game that often swings on emotion, Michigan relied on poise, efficiency, and its star forward to secure a convincing win on the road.",

    "fullText": "Miami Dolphins predicted to land All-Pro pass-catcher in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt remains to be seen who the starting quarterback will be for the Miami Dolphins in 2026. Regardless of who that person is, though, the Dolphins will want to surround him with playmakers.\n\nPlaymakers aren’t limited to wide receivers or running backs, either. One could come in the form of a tight end.\n\nIn a recent article for Bleacher Report, Alex Kay predicts that the Dolphins will land Atlanta Falcons tight end Kyle Pitts in free agency over the offseason.\n\nPitts is fresh off of the first All-Pro nod of his career after catching 88 passes for 928 yards and five touchdowns for Atlanta in 2025.\n\n“While there are plenty of other question marks for the new Miami regime led by head coach Jeff Hafley to sort out, getting a potential game-changer like Pitts in the lineup could pay dividends,” Kay wrote.\n\n“Regardless of whether Tua Tagovailoa, Quinn Ewers or someone else ends up starting under center for Miami in 2026, Pitts should emerge as a favored target thanks to his excellent playmaking skills and ability to create mismatches all over the field.”\n\nPitts, 25, has been a polarizing player because his production hasn’t matched his talent level for much of his career. He was named to the Pro Bowl after surpassing 1,000 receiving yards as a rookie in 20221, but he finished with fewer than 700 yards in each of the next three seasons before bouncing back in '25.\n\nThe tight end position probably isn’t a top priority for the Dolphins this offseason, but they could certainly use an upgrade there. Miami’s most productive tight end last season was Greg Dulcich, who had 26 receptions for 335 yards.\n\nPlus, while Pitts is a tight end by position, he could operate more as a wide receiver in certain situations given his skill set.\n\nIf signed, he would be a major weapon for Miami's quarterback next season, whoever that turns out to be.\n\nTom Brady sticks up for Bill Belichick after Hall of Fame snub\n\nTennessee Titans named best landing spot for All-Pro wide receiver\n\nChiefs owner sends clear message regarding Travis Kelce's future in Kansas City\n\nDenver Broncos predicted to land major weapon for Bo Nix in free agency",

    "description": "LeBron James’ future has been one of the biggest talking points this season. Some believe he is ready to hang up his boots, while others feel he has one more season left in him.",
    "fullText": "LeBron James’ future has been one of the biggest talking points this season. Some believe he is ready to hang up his boots, while others feel he has one more season left in him. He has not hinted at retirement, of course. But does that mean he will continue with the Lakers? Maybe not. Dave McMenamin’s recent report that the Cavaliers want LeBron back has reignited the rumor mill.\n\nDraymond Green, on his podcast, recently addressed the situation and opined that Cleveland should get James on their team at any cost. It would be a happy reunion between the two parties, whether the team succeeds on the court or not.\n\nJames is from Akron, near the city of Cleveland. The Cavaliers were the team that drafted him in 2003, and in 2016, LeBron helped them win a championship. He is a hero in the city, and it would make perfect sense for him to ride off into the sunset in the colors of the team he first represented in the NBA. Green feels it makes sense from a sporting, business, and emotional point of view.\n\n“They may still feel like Bron can help guide these young guys,” Green said. “Because it’s been a bit of a rough year this year, coming off from the year that they had last year. They may probably thing, let Bron come back here. The East is not as hard as the West, Bron can help this young guys over.”\n\nThe East is certainly not as star-studded as the West, but the Cavs, who finished #1 last season, are 29-20 this season and 5th in the standings and don’t look like real contenders. That’s something they want to change in 26/27.\n\nThat said, Green thinks that even if the Cavs don’t achieve anything this season, James’ return would make for a great idea.\n\n“They could be thinking, ‘Ah, this young group that we thought just ain’t it. We might as well honor Bron and bring him back in. We know what he does for the economy, for the city of Cleveland. And all of the business that goes on around the city’,” Green stated.\n\nThe Warriors legend continued, “One thing is for certain. I don’t care if LeBron James got one leg. The Cleveland Cavaliers should, would, and could, and better always be willing to have him come back there… because it’s so much bigger than basketball. “\n\nJames is 41 years old and isn’t the same player that won the Cavs a Championship in 2016. But he’s still averaging 22 points per game and shooting 50% from the field. Couple that with his legendary status, and he’d be an asset to the team for certain.\n\nThe post “If LeBron James Got One Leg”: Draymond Green Asserts Cleveland Should Bring Back LBJ Under Any Condition appeared first on The SportsRush.",

Camper Jr. opened the scoring with a jumper after a shot clock violation from the Rebels, and then guard Vaughn Weems scored on a driving layup off a bad pass from UNLV guard Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn.\n\nThe Rebels couldn’t even settle before they were down 9-0, and with a sold-out student section in Reno, it took a lot of effort.\n\nGibbs-Lawhorn kept UNLV in the game. He scored 26 points on 10-of-17 shooting and connected on four threes. He provided a response to the Rebels whenever they needed it.\n\nDespite his efforts, Nevada controlled the game. UNLV would go on a run, and then the Wolf Pack would answer right back. UNLV got the margin down to five near halftime as Gibbs-Lawhorn had a beautiful finish at the rim to make it 33-28 at halftime.\n\nAfter halftime, the game slipped away for UNLV. Turnovers, second chances, and Nevada threes made a close game into a blowout, especially after Camper Jr. made the court his kingdom.\n\nCamper Jr. scored 32 points on 11-of-15 shooting, including knocking down five threes. His biggest came in the second half, after Nevada forward Tayshawn Comer blocked guard Isaac Williamson, they went the other way, and Camper Jr. nailed a three to extend the Wolf Pack lead past double digits.\n\nThe issue for the Rebels wasn’t offense; they were shooting 45.9% from the field and 42.3% from three. Forward Naas Cunningham had 13 points and hit four threes. However, the Rebels’ offense just wasn’t as efficient as the Wolf Pack’s. Nevada shot 58% from the field and an impressive 57.1% from three.\n\nForward Elijah Price also had a spectacular night for the Wolf Pack, scoring 22 points and corralling 11 rebounds, giving Nevada another great scorer. Weems scored nine points and four assists as well for the Pack.\n\nUNLV kept fighting, and there were flashes where the Rebels played good ball. Forward Kimani Hamilton brought energy off the bench, finishing with 9 points and 6 rebounds.\n\nBut unfortunately for the Rebels, the separation was too much to overcome, and they were defeated 89-76. It is the Rebels’ third loss in a row. In the Mountain West, playing on the road is very important, and a run can become something too much to come back from, and that’s what happened Friday night.\n\nUNLV continues the road trip heading to Fresno to take on Fresno State on Tuesday, Feb. 3rd at 8:00 PM.",

    "description": "Mainland is the champion once again. The Bucs won their fourth consecutive Five Star boys basketball title on their home floor Friday, Jan. 30.",
    "fullText": "DAYTONA BEACH — Make it a four-peat for the Mainland Buccaneers.\n\nMainland beat Atlantic 76-71 on Friday, Jan. 30, to win its fourth consecutive Five Star Conference boys basketball championship. And the Bucs did it in front of their home crowd.\n\n“That was a big win for us,” Mainland coach Joe Giddens said. “Atlantic went to the Elite Eight last year, and they got the whole team coming back. So it was good for us to come out here and get a victory.”\n\nThe Bucs had Beegie Gordon, Canyon Powers, Kade Manley, Jaheem Curry and Kadin Flores score in double figures as part of a nine-man rotation.\n\nGordon led all Mainland players with 15 points, followed by Curry (14), Powers (12), Flores (12) and Manley (10).\n\n“That’s the beauty of it,” Giddens said. “We can probably go 11 deep, and we’ve been playing like 11 guys all year. So it’s not like it’s something new. We’re used to it, so when we get to the playoffs, we’re gonna continue to play that many guys. So it only helps us, and we can get some guys rest when they need it.”\n\nMainland led for the majority of the game, but it was Atlantic that possessed a 21-18 advantage after the first quarter. The Sharks limited the Bucs’ stars before they were able to get hot down the stretch.\n\nAtlantic held on to its lead until the second quarter, when Mainland, the FHSAA’s 10th-ranked team, took a 36-32 cushion into the break. The Sharks never allowed the Bucs to run away with a win, but they also never saw the lead again.\n\n“I thought we followed our game plan really, really well,” Atlantic coach Travis Norfolk said. “I thought we did a really good job keeping Beegie and Kade from getting loose at the 3-point line very often. I mean, those two guys are super talented, they’re really good basketball players … You don’t get in the top 10 in the state by not being a good basketball team.”\n\nMainland’s lead blossomed to 55-49 at the end of the third quarter and creeped into double-digit territory in the fourth quarter. But Atlantic stuck around until the final whistle.\n\nThe win was the Bucs’ sixth in a row and improved them to 21-2 as both teams closed their regular seasons. The Sharks finished 17-8.\n\nBoth look to end the campaign with a state trophy, Mainland in 6A and Atlantic in 4A.\n\n“Our goal, obviously, is to go to states and win states,” Manley said. “I feel like we could beat anybody. We just got to tighten some things up and play better defense.”\n\n“Last year, we lost Five Star, and we ended up being the last team from Volusia County playing,” Norfolk said. “So our goals are way bigger than Five Star. I mean, it would’ve been nice to win it, but we’re trying to be district champions. In all honesty, we’re trying to hang a banner, and I think this group is good enough to do it.”\n\nAfter both teams shook hands, a scuffle ensued. It was quickly broken up by security and other staff members before both teams retired to their respective locker rooms.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Daytona Beach News-Journal: FHSAA boys basketball: Mainland beats Atlantic for Five Star 4-peat",

    "description": "From sharp new promo reveals to renewed belief in Rebuild 2.0, optimism ruled the night on the South Side",
    "fullText": "SoxFest Live kicked off Friday night at the Ramova Theatre as the baseball offseason wraps up and pitchers and catchers prepare to report for Spring Training. The White Sox had a decent rebound season last year while sporting a very young team in 2025 and coming off a historically horrific 2024. However, the vibes were high all night on the South Side, as fans feel more optimistic about the organization’s future.\n\nOf course, the part of the night that drove the most buzz was the announcement of the 2026 promo items, and trust me, they are SHARP.\n\nMiguel Vargas, Colson Montgomery, Chase Meidroth, and Kyle Teel all opened a gift bag on stage that featured their own bobbleheads, including a catcher’s duo bobblehead with Teel and his counterpart, Edgar Quero. While all of them are awesome, in my opinion, the real star of the show is the Bobby Jenks and A.J. Pierzynski bobblehead as they celebrate winning the 2005 World Series. A perfect tribute to the glue of the championship-winning team and to Bobby, who was lost way too soon last year.\n\nHome opening weekend is full of fun giveaways, including the Bobby and A.J. bobble, an Opening Day t-shirt featuring Munetaka Murakami, a few jackets, and plenty of City Connect swag. I know I initially talked some smack about the new City Connect jerseys’ lack of creativity, but they do make some pretty epic gear. And let’s not forget the Mexican heritage items because every year these games are beyond fun with a sellout crowd, and the Los White Sox jersey is always a hit.\n\nWhen chatting with several season ticket holders, the consensus is that they have more faith in the front office over the last year, and there is heightened positivity around the Rebuild 2.0 that GM Chris Getz has been forced to undertake. Many players seem to share the same sentiment, as every player we were able to speak with said they were “excited to get back together with the guys, and get back to playing and working on being consistent.”\n\nThere were 10 South Siders in the building on Friday night. The legendary Gene Honda began the evening by introducing everyone, with his smooth, iconic voice easily hyping up the crowd as if it were a Saturday night game at the Rate, and he’s announcing the starting lineup. A sort of frightening starting lineup considering there were just four position players and six pitchers, but perhaps Davis Martin or Shane Smith is a secret weapon at the plate, though I’m not sure I want to find out.\n\nFirst up was the broadcast team, with in-game reporters Brooke Fletcher and Connor McKnight, followed by the TV and radio crew, featuring Chuck Garfein, Len Kasper, and John Schriffen. Getz and manager Will Venable repped the front office and coaching staff, followed by two minor league prospects who joined this year: infielder Sam Antonacci and righthander Tanner McDougal.\n\nLast up were the major leaguers — the stars of the show. Grant Taylor, Anthony Kay, Davis Martin, and Shane Smith represented the South Side pitching staff. Kay joined the team for the first time this offseason, signing out of the NPB in Japan, and is thrilled to be meeting some of the guys and looking forward to Spring Training and another chance in MLB.\n\nLast but certainly not least: infielders Vargas, Meidroth, and Montgomery, and catcher Teel, who recently committed to playing for Italy in the World Baseball Classic this March. There was, however, one player who was unable to attend, but Munetaka Murakami was there in spirit and shared a message to fans, earning a roar from the crowd upon hearing “Go White Sox!”\n\nWho is as hyped for Mune as we are?? #SoxFestLive pic.twitter.com/Ufhgzrhvq0\n\n— South Side Sox (@SouthSideSox) January 31, 2026\n\nFans were also able to ask questions to Getz and Venable in a segment called “Pardon the Pitch Clock”, which gave them four minutes to answer some questions from the crowd. The five categories before a final “lightning round” were: the 2026 outlook, offseason acquisitions and roster philosophy, players to watch, new initiatives and innovations, and clubhouse culture and leadership. This year was probably much easier to manage, considering they aren’t coming off of the worst season ever, but the positivity and buy-in from Getz and Venable seem to reinforce the fans’ hope for the future of the team.\n\nProps to the White Sox for putting on a great event for the first day, and a big thank you to the players for being so welcoming and willing to talk with us and answer questions. We’ll be back with more coverage throughout the rest of the event!",

    "description": "Houston flashes brilliance for 24 minutes, the rest? Fragility. Can they still sustain elite play for a full 48?",
    "fullText": "Ime Udoka didn’t try to dress it up after Wednesday night. He called the Rockets’ loss to San Antonio “a tale of two halves,” and that phrasing has quietly followed Houston through the rest of the week, because it hasn’t just been one game.\n\nAgainst the Spurs, Houston opened with what might’ve been their cleanest 12 minutes of basketball all season. 36 points. 60-percent shooting. Four made threes. 11 assists on 15 made field goals. Kevin Durant and Alperen Şengün dictated everything, the ball never stuck, and the Spurs were chasing actions instead of anticipating them.\n\nSan Antonio pushed pace in the second quarter, speeding Houston up defensively. The discomfort was palpable. The Rockets still scored, but the margin disappeared. After halftime, it collapsed entirely.\n\nHouston managed just 37 points in the second half, shot under 30-percent after the break, and produced only one made three in the final two quarters. What began as organized offense turned into survival possessions, and the Spurs walked out with a 111-99 win.\n\nTwenty-four hours later in Atlanta, the halves flipped.\n\nThe Rockets looked flat early against the Hawks, opening the game 0-for-6 and shooting under 40-percent through the first two quarters. The offense lagged, the pace felt heavy, and Houston leaned on defense just to stay afloat. At halftime, the Rockets led by one despite shooting just 38.3 percent- a game that had no business being theirs.\n\nBut this time, the adjustment stuck.\n\nAfter the break, Houston seized control. The Rockets made over half of their attempts from three in the second half, drilled ten triples, and stretched the game until Atlanta ran out of answers.\n\nDurant’s gravity warped coverages even when he wasn’t scoring, freeing space for cutters and shooters. Şengün anchored possessions with patience. Amen Thompson controlled tempo without forcing anything. Houston closed the night with a 104-86 win that never felt threatened down the stretch.\n\nSame team. Same week. Two radically different endings.\n\nThat’s the tension defining this Rockets group right now. When the game is structured, Houston overwhelms teams with spacing, skill, and connective playmaking. When that structure breaks- when pace flips, counters disappear, or possessions get rushed- everything gets fragile fast.\n\nUdoka’s phrase wasn’t a throwaway. It was a diagnosis.\n\nThe Rockets don’t lack talent. They lack continuity across 48 minutes. Until the first half version and the second half version start looking like the same team, “a tale of two halves” won’t just describe one night. It'll define the team.",

    "fullText": "Former BYU Cougar Egor Dëmin set an NBA record in his return to Utah during Friday night’s game between the Jazz and the Brooklyn Nets, as he became the first NBA rookie to hit a 3-pointer in 34 consecutive games.\n\nDespite shooting only 27.3% from 3 his freshman year at BYU, he’s made it his biggest asset as an NBA player. He’s jumped up to 39.7% shooting from distance, and hit his 100th career 3-pointer against the Jazz Friday.\n\nIn the first quarter of Friday’s game, he shot 3 of 5 from deep and then kept it going, finishing with a career high 25 points and 10 rebounds for his first career double-double.\n\nHe finished with six 3-pointers Friday night, shooting 6 of 12.\n\nHe said there’s been no magical fix for his shot outside of just consistent work.\n\n“Shooting the ball, pretty much as simple as it is,” Dëmin said. “Just being in the gym and shooting the ball.”\n\nEgor Dёmin for 👌\n\nHe now has a 3PM in 34 consecutive games, the longest streak for ANY ROOKIE in NBA history! pic.twitter.com/tSeJUwOQGL\n\nDëmin caught up with the media ahead of Friday night’s game, and he spoke about his experience in the NBA, playing at BYU and what it’s meant to him to return to Utah.\n\n“It feels awesome. Super excited to be back here,“ Dëmin said. “Obviously, expecting a lot of BYU colors tonight. Just super grateful to be back here.”\n\nHe also said he had roughly 30 people show up for him for Friday’s game. Many of them were from his BYU circles.\n\n“It’s a lot of (the) culture about BYU,” Dëmin said. “A lot of people know how united the BYU organization is in general. Not just basketball, or just football, or whatever it is, but the whole sports together.\n\n“I’ve been lucky enough to end up in that school and gain so many friends and so many people around me who want the best for me and who I want (the) best for, so it’s just super exciting to be a part of that big BYU family.”\n\nDëmin also spoke highly of BYU head coach Kevin Young. When Young was hired by the Cougars, the main selling point was that he could turn BYU into a place where players could come to develop an NBA-level game.\n\nDëmin was the first of the Young era to make good on that claim, and he’s done so with encouraging numbers. He’s started in 34 games this year for the Nets and will be a participant in the NBA’s Rising Stars game.\n\nReppin’ Brooklyn in this year’s NBA Rising Stars Game: EGOR DËMIN 🌟 pic.twitter.com/pNOvCM95NJ\n\n— Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) January 26, 2026\n\n“He’s an NBA coach, so he taught me in this one year basically whatever I have to know to be able to play in the NBA level,” Dëmin said of Young. “Maybe not even as much of a skill set-wise, because at the end of the day, you get to the league and you just be yourself. That’s kind of the goal.\n\n“He taught a lot of knowledge, (like) that I come here and I’m ready to play, and I know what we’re doing, and I have an idea of what it is. He gave me this kind of base of an NBA player, to be able to come here and know what’s going on around me.”",

    "description": "Nebraska gave Penn State its toughest dual of the season, showing that last year’s runner-up finish was no fluke",
    "fullText": "Nebraska went into the literal (Nittany) Lions’ den and put a scare into the top program in the country. In a matchup between the top two teams at the NCAA Championships last year, #6 Nebraska went into the intermission down just 10-9 against a team that’s not used to losing matches, but top-ranked Penn State flexed its muscle in the upper weights to earn the 26-12 win over the Huskers.\n\nPenn State hasn’t lost more than two matches in a dual all year and hasn’t lost more than one in a dual where they used all their starters — even against Iowa they won 32-3 by winning nine matches. Nebraska went into Bryce Jordan Center and took three matches against a full Penn State lineup.\n\nBrought the fight to State College. Brock Hardy, Antrell Taylor and AJ Ferrari pick up wins for the Huskers! Penn State is kinda good. pic.twitter.com/ZSJbQ7M2pA\n\n— NEwrestle (@NEBwrestle) January 31, 2026\n\nDespite losing the dual, that was a statement from Nebraska to the rest of the field.\n\nEven in some of the matches Nebraska lost, the Huskers did some good things — including scoring takedowns against a pair of No. 1-ranked wrestlers who don’t get taken down very often.\n\nFacing top-ranked Luke Lilledahl of Penn State, Nebraska sophomore Alan Koehler was just outmatched.\n\nLilledahl scored six takedowns in the match, including two quick takedowns in the third period. Koehler dropped the match via 20-3 technical fall, putting Nebraska in a 5-0 hole to start the dual.\n\nWith the loss, Koehler is now 10-12 on the year.\n\nIn a tough matchup against an undefeated two-time age-level World Champion in #6 Marcus Blaze, Nebraska’s #10 Jacob Van Dee dropped his third straight match.\n\nBlaze hit a nice dump for a takedown in the first period before letting his sound defensive positioning secure the win for him. Van Dee scored an escape to start the second period, but he dropped the match 5-1.\n\n133 | No. 4 Marcus Blaze with a 5-1 decision over No. 10 Jacob Van Dee pic.twitter.com/xK96brasAA\n\n— Big Ten Wrestling (@B1GWrestling) January 31, 2026\n\nBlaze had scored bonus points in 14 of his 15 wins before this match, so Van Dee and two-time NCAA finalist Drake Ayala of Iowa (4-2 decision) are now the only wrestlers to keep him to a decision.\n\nWith the loss, Van Dee is now 12-4 on the year.\n\nIn what was the match of the dual up until this point, Nebraska’s #3 Brock Hardy fell behind big in the first period when #13 Braeden Davis of Penn State took him down off the whistle and added another takedown to go up 6-2.\n\nIn the second, Davis scored an escape after Hardy cut his riding time down under a minute, but Hardy hit a late duck-under for a takedown, cutting the deficit to 7-5.\n\nAfter scoring an escape to start the third, Hardy cut the corner beautifully off a Davis low shot, putting the Nittany Lion junior on his back in a cradle for the pinfall.\n\nBROCK\nHARDY\nPIN pic.twitter.com/2KYwsBJt8g\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) January 31, 2026\n\nHardy patted Davis on the stomach after the ref slapped the Resilite, eliciting a kick from Davis that cost the Nittany Lions a team point.\n\nDavis led Hardy before being stuck in a cradle, gets mad at Hardy for cradling him. pic.twitter.com/iXKCeapMgH\n\n— The Wrestling Room (Pat Mineo) (@MrPatMineo) January 31, 2026\n\nWith the pinfall win, Hardy improved to 14-4 on the year and cut the Penn State lead to 7-6. Hardy now leads all Husker starters with 10 bonus-point wins, including a team-leading four pins.\n\nFacing off against top-ranked Shayne Van Ness of Penn State, Nebraska’s #13 Chance Lamer started strong but fell in the end.\n\nLamer hit an early go-behind to go up 3-0 in the first period — he then went up 4-1 with a second-period escape. After that, Van Ness scored a takedown in the second off a double-leg to tie the match at 4-4.\n\nIn the third, Van Ness took the lead with an escape before scoring two more takedowns to ice the match 12-5 via decision.\n\nWith the loss, Lamer is now 12-4 on the year for the Huskers.\n\nIn what was the match of the weekend in college wrestling, Nebraska’s #5 Antrell Taylor — the returning NCAA Champion at the weight — took on #2 PJ Duke of Penn State. Coming in a perfect 13-0 on the year, the Nittany Lion true freshman lost his first collegiate match to Taylor.\n\nMuch like he did against then-undefeated true freshman Landon Robideau of Oklahoma State when he was ranked #2 in December, Taylor used impressive defense and an impressive mat game to get the win in tiebreakers.\n\nBoth Taylor and Duke traded escapes in regulation, sending the match to sudden victory where they went scoreless. In the first tiebreaker, Taylor started on bottom first and scored an escape in 13 seconds to go up 2-1.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, Taylor started on top and used his body lock game to return the freshman to the mat multiple times before lifting him up and carrying him around for the final few seconds and the ride-out for the 2-1 win.\n\nThe Champ comes out on top 😤\n\nTrelly hands Duke his first loss of the season. pic.twitter.com/UnjUDDx9CY\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) January 31, 2026\n\nAt 157, No. 5 Antrell Taylor (Nebraska) wins 2-1 in TB ride-outs over No. 2 PJ Duke (Penn State), handing the freshman his first career NCAA loss.\n\nTaylor has now won 10 straight. pic.twitter.com/1g5ww2vn4i\n\n— Saturday Night Lights (@WrestlingSNL) January 31, 2026\n\nWith his 10th-straight win, Taylor improved to 16-2 on the year and cut the Penn State lead to 10-9 at the intermission.\n\nThis is where Penn State really took back control with its first of four straight top-ranked wrestlers. Nebraska’s #7 LJ Araujo faced #1 Mitchell Mesenbrink here and struggled to handle the National Champion’s pace.\n\nDespite showing some nice defense, even forcing a stall call on Mesenbrink in the second period, Araujo gave up five total takedowns, multiple stall calls and a riding-time point, dropping the match via 20-5 tech.\n\nWith the loss, Araujo is now 11-6 on the year.\n\nNebraska’s #4 Christopher Minto got his first career shot at #1 Levi Haines in this dual.\n\nIn the first period, Minto scored a penalty point when Haines drove him out of bounds and pushed him off the raised mat into the scoring table, a dangerous move by the Nittany Lion senior that really didn’t sit well with anyone.\n\nMan what Levi Haines just did was totally egregious!!! he must’ve been hanging out with Braeden Davis\n\n— Funky 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 (@Benaskren) January 31, 2026\n\nHaines then tied the match 1-1 with an escape to start the second period, but it was Minto who hit a re-attack on Haines for the 4-1 lead. After an escape, Haines scored a late takedown in the second to go up 5-4 going into the third and final period.\n\nMinto rolled early from bottom for an escape to tie the match early in the third, but Haines scored the deciding takedown later in the period to go up 8-5. After a Minto escape, Haines won the match 8-6 via decision, setting up an interesting potential rematch at Big Tens.\n\nWith the loss, Minto is now 14-4 on the year but showed that he’s competitive with the top guy at his weight class.\n\nFacing #1 Rocco Welsh of Penn State, Nebraska’s #6 Silas Allred was unable to get to his offense or defense at times.\n\nA former NCAA finalist, Welsh took Allred down four times in a 14-5 win via major decision, pushing the Penn State lead to 22-9.\n\nWith the loss, Allred is now 12-6 on the year.\n\nFacing an opponent in #1 Josh Barr who has teched him twice in his career, Nebraska’s #10 Camden McDanel struggled but showed late that he doesn’t quit.\n\nBarr took down McDanel four times in the first period before adding an escape and a takedown in the second to go up 16-4. Hunting for the tech in the third, Barr cut McDanel for an escape before scoring his sixth takedown, but it was McDanel who answered with a low shot for a takedown, cutting the deficit to 19-9.\n\nIn the end, McDanel fell 21-9 via major decision, but him getting that late takedown against someone as good as Barr was encouraging.\n\nMcDanel is now 14-5 on the year with the loss.\n\nAt heavyweight, Nebraska’s #4 AJ Ferrari took the mat against Penn State’s #9 Cole Mirasola.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, Ferrari escaped quickly to start the second period to go up 1-0. Ferrari then put on a hard ride in the third, locking up the riding-time point before surrendering a late escape, earning the 2-1 decision win with the riding-time point.\n\nFerrari is now 9-2 on the year with multiple wins over top opponents — guys ranked #5, #7, #9, #10, and #12. His two losses have come against #3 Nick Feldman of Ohio State.",

    "fullText": "The Buffs have remained aggressive in the portal, so here’s a top five you need to know right now. We’ll count down from No. 5 to No. 1 and hit why each addition fits, and how they raise the floor this fall.\n\nLefau is a senior transfer from Texas who comes to Boulder looking to revitalize the Buffs pass rush. He posted 26 tackles and 1 sack last year, and more importantly spent time in one of the best pass rushing groups in the nation. That experience matters for a defense that will be rebuilt front to back. His veteran voice and habits are vital for a unit that has started slow in recent seasons because so many portal additions had to gel at once. Experience is the point here, and it is going to be key across the entire defense.\n\nYes, the name and backstory drew headlines, but the on-field production backs it up. Lampron is a journeyman senior who tallied 65 tackles, 2.5 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles last season for Bowling Green. The origin story matters too, as Lampron randomly ran into Coach Prime on a plane a few months ago and gave coach his pitch. Prime’s staff did the homework, and Lampron had an offer before they even deboarded. With the Buffs staring at a completely new defensive unit next season; Lampron brings toughness, proven production, and immediate special teams value to steady that transition.\n\nScudero arrives in Boulder after turning in one of the best sophomore campaigns in the country with nearly 1,300 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. At 5’9, 175, he wins with agility, quickness, and crisp route running. In Brennan Marion’s system he’s a plug-and-play starting slot, the kind of chain-mover who keeps JuJu on schedule and punishes single coverage. He is also one of the most talented portal additions Boulder has seen in the last few years, so there is no reason to think he won’t be on the field from the first series in the fall.\n\nCarter arrives from Tennessee, a hometown Vol who had a real path to playing time in the SEC, which tells you the offer to come to Boulder was serious, and for good reason. He was ranked the No. 5 safety in the transfer portal and his tape backs it up. Last season he played like a ball magnet, forcing three fumbles and breaking up three passes. For a Buffs team that has struggled to force turnovers, and just lost turnover-creator Tawfiq Byard, Carter was a must-sign for Deion Sanders. He has two years of eligibility left, but may need to produce immediately in a playmaking-needy back end.\n\nA St. John Bosco grad, Moore comes to Boulder with one year of eligibility and a top-ten transfer grade (No. 8 in the portal). At Texas he stacked just under 1,000 yards and 11 touchdowns across the last two seasons as a starting wideout. His 6’0, 190 frame is not about freak measurables, as it is the ideal all-purpose receiver body that lets Brennan Marion fit him seamlessly into the Go-Go offense. After the departures of Omarion Miller, Sincere Brown, and others, Moore is expected to have the biggest season of any incoming transfer. Personally, I think he profiles as the X reciever, where he’ll be expected to win outside the numbers, on slants, digs, comebacks, and posts. Moore has the experience, production, and frame to be JuJu Lewis’s No. 1 target come September.",

    "title": "On This Day (31st Jan 2015): Defoe Gets Off The Mark In A Sunderland Shirt!",
    "description": "New Sunderland signing Jermain Defoe notched his first goal for his new team after returning from the MLS!",
    "fullText": "In a victory that Sunderland manager Gus Poyet described as ‘much needed’, new Sunderland signing Jermain Defoe got off the mark for his new club after his January move from Toronto FC.\n\nSunderland had been struggling for goals throughout the season where they had become quite the draw specialists and the club knew that something had to change in the second half of the season if they wanted to avoid struggling again near the bottom of the table.\n\nThe signing of the England international was a clear signal of intent from the club and with Jozy Altidore going in the opposite direction, it was almost a no-brainer.\n\nWith one win at the Stadium of Light up until this point of the season, a victory at home was much sought after and almost a necessity given the fact that Burnley would have been perceived as one of the more ‘winnable’ encounters at home.\n\nIt didn’t help that the Stadium of Light was not the fortress then as it is now and with the crowd somewhat on edge, a goal was required to energise the home faithful.\n\nThankfully, this arrived within the first twenty minutes through the man who everyone thought was going to kick on and be the main man, Connor Wickham. Wickham had struggled to really take the mantle of Sunderland’s main centre-forward after his exploits at the end of the previous season but his goal gave them the lead here to give him only his third of the season.\n\nSebastian Larsson’s strength and vision created the opening for Anthony Réveillère to send over a perfect cross for Wickham, who headed back across the scrambling Tom Heaton and into the far corner.\n\nThis goal appeared to energise and also calm a fragile fanbase at the same time only days after Poyet had suggested there was a ‘missed connection’ between players and supporters at the stadium.\n\nAny concerns that the fans had dissipated even further as the new signing Defoe got off the mark for his new club with one of the easiest finishes he will ever have.\n\nJordi Gómez sprung the offside trap with a cute lofted pass to the advanced Van Aanholt, who controlled and picked out Defoe to apply a simple finish.\n\nAfter this, it was relatively comfortable for the home side against Sean Dyche’s team as Sunderland kept the Clarets at bay with ease. The win saw the team go four points clear of the drop zone and after the game Defoe expressed his delight at getting off the mark in his new surroundings.\n\n“It was important that we got the win today. It was a massive win. We created a lot of chances, the fans were fantastic. The energy from start to finish was fantastic. We managed to get the early goal which helped us, settled us down.\n\n“The Premier League is the best in the world and that’s where you want to be. I feel like I have a lot of goals left in me.”\n\nThe signing of Defoe would prove to be a masterstroke over the next couple of years as his goals would end up being vital towards Sunderland’s survival in the division. All of this would come after a spell where Dick Advocaat tried to turn him into a right winger!",

    "description": "“At the end of the day, the fans care about staying in the Premier League and this has to have been the best season most can remember. So it’s thanks to those who got us here, but it’s time for the baton to be passed on,” writes Nic Wiseman.",
    "fullText": "With the current transfer window seemingly being used to ship players surplus to requirements, the news that Aji Alese has joined Portsmouth on loan prompted me to take a look at a typical team from last season and see how they have fared this year.\n\nTo do this, I dipped into my box of programmes and fished one out at random. And the game in question is Derby away on 21 January, which was a midweek game on a dank Tuesday night.\n\nWe had just had the chastening experience at Burnley the preceding Friday night, where Wilson Isidor failed to score two penalties in injury time.\n\nWe won the game at Derby 1-0 thanks to an Eliezer Mayenda goal in the 28th minute and Wilson inexplicably had a goal struck off, for reasons nobody was able to fathom. Even the scoreboard took ages to revert from 0-2 back to 0-1.\n\nThe team that night was: Patterson, Cirkin, O’Nien, Mepham, Hume, Le Fée, Jobe, Neil, Rigg, Isidor, Mayenda.\n\nRoberts replaced Mayenda and Ballard, Cirkin on 74 minutes; Abdul Samed replaced Rigg on 86 minutes and Leo Hjelde came on for Le Fée on 89.\n\nIt was only the second time Régis Le Bris had listened to my pleas for 4-4-2 all season. As it had worked so well against Sheffield United on New Year’s Day, I was desperate to see it again. The only memorable thing about the game was how stultifyingly boring it was. Pride Park is situated in the middle of a soulless industrial estate and there was no pub near that I could find.\n\nThe combined number of appearances that team (including used substitutes) have made this season is 119. Which ticks up to 132 if you include all players who played last season.\n\nThe departures of Dan Neil and Aji Alese this week have triggered much hand-wringing about the fact that these hard workers have been ruthlessly jettisoned this season in order to ensure we maintain our position in the Premier League. But the cold, hard facts are that these players haven’t been good enough to play in the Premier League. In fact you could say that the club has done well by the players in allowing them to go off on loan to showcase their talents. Especially in the case of Dan Neil, who has been allowed to go off to Ipswich on loan, until his contract winds down.\n\nThe trio who have stepped up from last season’s side are Enzo Le Fée, Dan Ballard and Trai Hume. All could be considered first-team regulars this season and make up just under half the total appearances from last year’s team. Le Fée was bought from Roma in Italy’s Serie A in the January transfer window and was brought in on loan as a statement with half an eye on us being in the Premier League this season. He is a bit of an outlier in this analysis.\n\nJenson Seelt can consider himself to be unlucky, as he made an assured debut against West Ham on the first day of the season, only to be injured in the second half and replaced by Omar Alderete. He was subsequently shipped out on loan to German side Wolfsburg.\n\nOf the team involved that night, two returned to their parent clubs from loan: Mepham and Abdul Samed; Roberts and Neil have been loaned out, seven have started matches this season and two (including Neil) have come on from the subs bench.\n\nTo be honest, more have been involved this season than I expected, with seven making more than ten appearances this season.\n\nThe club do seem to be doing well by those players as they look to find pastures new. Which will enhance the club’s reputation as looking after players’ interests.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the fans care about staying in the Premier League and this has to have been the best season most can remember. So it’s thanks to those who got us here, but it’s time for the baton to be passed on.\n\nThose who played last season, but not at Derby",

    "description": "The Warriors star's knee had been bothering him for much of the week.",
    "fullText": "Even a quarter of Stephen Curry is a high cost for the Golden State Warriors these days.\n\nThe Warriors star exited Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons early with right knee soreness, finishing with a team-high 23 points on 7-of-16 shooting (4-of-10 from 3-point range). After the game, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said he didn't believe Curry's knee injury was \"anything major,\" but the team will know more on Saturday.\n\nCurry went to the locker room near the end of the third quarter, grimacing and limping slightly after some awkward contact on an and-1. He remained in the locker room at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and the Warriors soon ruled him out for the rest of the game.\n\nAnd that's an AND-ONE\n\n📺 @NBCSAuthentic pic.twitter.com/OFR7kYte2V\n\n— Golden State Warriors (@warriors) January 31, 2026\n\nThe Warriors managed to hang around despite Curry's injury, cutting the deficit to three points midway through the fourth quarter, but ended up losing 131-124 to the East-leading Pistons.\n\n[\nCurry had been dealing with a knee issue over the course of this week. He reportedly first felt something in his knee on Saturday and was listed as questionable with right knee soreness for Sunday's game, but still played that day. However, he did miss Monday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers, the second leg of a back-to-back.\n\nHe went on to play 28 minutes against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday and didn't carry an injury designation going into Friday's game, but clearly the injury resurfaced.\n\nAs usual, a significant Curry injury would be the last thing the Warriors need right now. The team is still learning how to navigate life without Jimmy Butler, who was knocked out for the season by a torn ACL last week.\n\nFriday's loss means Golden State is now 2-4 since Butler's injury, with losses to the Toronto Raptors and Dallas Mavericks. For now, they remain in eighth place in the Western Conference at 27-33, with a 3.5 game cushion to avoid the second play-in game.",

    "fullText": "Saturday’s NBA slate packs in six games with playoff energy and clear betting angles. From Charlotte’s hot streak against San Antonio to Houston hosting an injury-hit Dallas side, every matchup has a story behind it. Some teams rely on rebounding, others on star scorers, and a few are just trying to survive tough stretches. Here is a closer look at who holds the edge and why these games matter. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Spectrum Center, Charlotte\n\nCharlotte enters this game riding a five-game winning streak. The Hornets have been strong on the glass, ranking near the top of the East in rebounding at 45.7 per game. Moussa Diabate leads them with 8.4 rebounds. San Antonio also rebounds well at 46.3 per game, with Luke Kornet setting the pace.\n\nVictor Wembanyama continues to anchor the Spurs with 24.3 points and 11.2 rebounds per game. Miles Bridges leads Charlotte at 18.5 points, while Brandon Miller has averaged 23.4 points over the last 10 games.\n\nRecent form favors Charlotte slightly. Over the last 10 games, the Hornets average 116.5 points and allow only 107.4. San Antonio has scored 110.7 in the same span. Home momentum and the +4.5 line make Charlotte the safer side.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Indianapolis\n\nIndiana struggles in blowout games and owns an 8-24 record in the East. Still, the Pacers play closer games at home. Andrew Nembhard averages 17.4 points and 7.4 assists, while Pascal Siakam has scored 20.8 per game over the last 10.\n\nAtlanta is 12-17 against conference teams and recently beat Indiana 132-116. Onyeka Okongwu leads the Hawks with 16.3 points and 7.9 rebounds. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has added 19.7 points per game over the last 10.\n\nThe Pacers shoot only 44.3 percent this season, but Atlanta allows 47.5 percent to opponents. With a short spread and home court edge, Indiana has a narrow path to control the pace.\n\nPredicted winner: Indiana Pacers\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nNew Orleans comes in at 12-37 and allows 121.2 points per game. Defense has been the main issue. The Pelicans still rebound well at 44 per game and force nearly 15 turnovers. Zion Williamson remains their focal point, averaging 21 points in the last outing with 11 rebounds.\n\nPhiladelphia is 25-21 and just beat Milwaukee 139-122. Paul George scored 32 in that win. The 76ers average 116.6 points but sit near the bottom of the league in shooting efficiency at 45.8 percent.\n\nThe Pelicans allow 48.3 percent shooting, which keeps games close late. A large spread gives New Orleans room to stay competitive even if they do not lead for long stretches.\n\nPredicted winner: New Orleans Pelicans\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nMinnesota holds a 29-19 record and ranks fifth in scoring at 119 points per game. Julius Randle just dropped 31 points in a win over Dallas. The Timberwolves shoot 48.1 percent and allow only 114.1 points.\n\nMemphis sits at 18-27 and struggles offensively at 45.4 percent shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 26 in the last game, but team rebounding remains an issue. The Grizzlies were outworked on the boards by Charlotte in their last loss.\n\nThe Timberwolves force turnovers and defend the three well at 35.2 percent allowed. With better balance on both ends, Minnesota should control the matchup.\n\nPredicted winner: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nChicago enters after three straight losses but still averages 118.7 points over the last 10 games. Nikola Vucevic posts 17 points and 9.1 rebounds, while Coby White leads fast-break scoring.\n\nMiami has gone 6-4 in its last 10 and scores 121.3 points per game in that span. Bam Adebayo averages 18 points and shoots 44.5 percent. The Heat won the last meeting 116-113.\n\nThe Bulls shoot 47.6 percent this season, slightly higher than what Miami allows. With a +5.5 line, Chicago can stay within range even if Miami controls the fourth quarter.\n\nPredicted winner: Chicago Bulls\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nDallas is 19-29 and missing key players like Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis. Cooper Flagg has been productive, but the Mavericks give up 116.7 points per game.\n\nHouston stands at 29-17 and thrives when limiting turnovers. Kevin Durant averages 26.5 points, while Alperen Sengun adds steady scoring inside. The Rockets allow only 110 points per game, which ranks among the league’s best marks.\n\nDallas won the last meeting, but the injury list has grown. Houston’s defense and depth give them a strong edge at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nThese six games shape a busy Saturday card. Charlotte and Indiana look strong at home. Minnesota and Houston hold the clearest advantages. New Orleans and Chicago bring value due to large spreads. Each matchup carries a different style of play, which should make January 31 a full night of competitive basketball.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 31: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) revised its Starlink privacy policy to allow the use of customer data for AI training, a shift that ​could bolster Elon Musk's AI ambitions.\n\nAhead of a blockbuster IPO planned for later this year, ‌SpaceX is in talks to merge with Musk’s AI company, xAI (XAAI.PVT), a deal first reported by Reuters on Thursday. SpaceX, already the ‌world’s most valuable private company, could reach a value of more than $1 trillion after the IPO.\n\nWhat are privacy experts' concerns about Starlink's policy changes?\n\nWhat changes did SpaceX make to Starlink's privacy policy?\n\nHow could the SpaceX-xAI merger impact AI development?\n\nWhat data does Starlink collect from its users?\n\nStarlink updated its Global Privacy Policy on January 15, according to the Starlink website. The policy includes new details stating that unless a user opts out, Starlink data may be used “to train our machine learning or artificial intelligence ⁠models” and could be shared with ‌the company’s service providers and “third-party collaborators,” without providing further details.\n\nA previous version of the privacy policy, an archived version from November and reviewed by Reuters, did not ‍contain language about AI training on Starlink data.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStarlink collects vast amounts of user data, spanning location information, credit card information, contact information and user IP ​addresses. It also collects so-called communication data, which includes audio and visual information, data in shared ‌files, and “inferences we may make from other personal information we collect,” according to its global privacy policy.\n\nThe policy did not make clear exactly what data would be used to train AI. The move has raised concerns among privacy advocates and consumer rights groups, which argue that using personal data to train AI risks expanding surveillance and creates new avenues for misuse.\n\n“It certainly raises my eyebrow and would make ⁠me concerned if I was a Starlink user,” said Anupam ​Chander, a technology law professor at Georgetown University. “Often there's perfectly ​legitimate uses of your data, but it doesn’t have a clear limit to what kind of uses it will be put to.”\n\nMusk's xAI, most recently valued at $230 billion ‍after a recent funding round, ⁠is currently developing its Grok LLM chatbot and also owns X, the social media platform.\n\nThe potential merger with xAI would turbocharge the space company’s deployment of AI-powered services, while giving xAI ⁠vast new data sets to train its models on, including communication data. Starlink, a network of more than 9,000 satellites, ‌currently provides internet connection to more than 9 million users.",

    "description": "Global Entry and Precheck revoked three days after incident, court filing says.",
    "fullText": "Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a declaration filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.\n\nCleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”\n\nCleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.\n\n“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”\n\nCleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a Boston Globe column about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.\n\nCleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:\n\nI logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”\n\nI had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.\n\nCleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.\n\n“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”\n\nCleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”\n\nWe contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.\n\nFederal agents have made extensive use of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from Clearview AI and a face-scanning app called Mobile Fortify. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.\n\n“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times reported today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.\n\nICE also uses a variety of other technologies, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and Palantir software to help identify potential deportation targets.\n\nAlthough Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.\n\n“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Friday asked Chinese battery company Gotion Inc to ​return $23.7 million in state funds the company received after the ‌company last year abandoned a plan to build a $2.4 billion plant in Michigan to ‌produce key materials for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nThe plan, first announced in October 2022, was expected to create 2,350 factory jobs but came under criticism from some lawmakers for the company's Chinese ownership. Gotion did not immediately ⁠respond to a request ‌for comment.\n\nNessel's office said in a letter to Gotion that it was in default on its agreement and ‍not resolved the issues. It gave Gotion 30 days to repay the funds.\n\nThe Michigan Economic Development Corporation said last year none of a separate $125 million state ​grant for the project was ever disbursed and said Gotion had ‌abandoned the project. Gotion denied that but lawyers for the company said in a court filing earlier this month the project \"is no longer viable.\"\n\nGermany's Volkswagen is the largest single shareholder in Gotion Inc's parent company, owning about 30% of Gotion High-Tech (002074.SZ). U.S. lawmakers said last year ⁠China maintains \"effective control\" through multiple individual shareholders.\n\nGotion ​said last year the firm \"remains firmly committed ​to its mission of driving America's clean energy future\" including at a plant in Illinois.\n\nIn March 2024, Gotion sued ‍Green Township in ⁠Michigan for allegedly breaching an agreement to build the plant.\n\nOver the last year, Americans' waning enthusiasm for electric cars led automakers ⁠to delay or scrap numerous factory and vehicle projects. After recent EV policy ‌changes by the Trump administration, automakers are further retrenching.",

    "title": "The Trump Administration Arrested Don Lemon Like He Was a Fugitive Slave",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "Lemon’s arrest is not only a clear violation of the First Amendment but also a blatant throwback to the Constitution’s long-discarded Fugitive Slave Clause.\n\nThe Department of Justice arrested two journalists, Don Lemon, and Georgia Fort, in connection with their coverage of a protest that took place inside a church in St. Paul, Minnesota on January 18. The DOJ also arrested two activists, Trahern Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy, for their role in the protest. All four of the people arrested are Black.\n\nThe arrests of the two journalists are clearly unconstitutional. You don’t need to be a legal scholar to know that arresting journalists for covering the news is a clear violation of the First Amendment. Lemon’s arrest is also flatly illegal. Last week, the Trump administration went to a federal magistrate judge, Douglas L. Micko, to ask for an arrest warrant for Lemon. The judge refused. The Trump administration then appealed and lost that appeal. The legal system literally said the government couldn’t arrest Lemon, but the government arrested him anyway, and they went all the way to Los Angeles (far from Minnesota) to get him.\n\nGeorgia Fort is a prominent Black journalist based in Minnesota. She was out front in covering the George Floyd protests, and expertly covered the trial of his killer, Derek Chauvin. I have little doubt that this prior reporting is among the reasons she was targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nI know less about the activists: Crews is a cofounder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, while Lundy works in the Hennepin County Attorney’s office and recently announced his candidacy for the Minnesota state Senate. I also know that arresting people for protesting is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nIn her tweet proclaiming the arrests, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the four were arrested “at my direction.” Later reports suggested that the DOJ empaneled a federal grand jury that issued the arrest warrants for Lemon and Fort, but didn’t explain the cause for arresting Crews and Lundy. Going to a grand jury to get an arrest warrant that a judge and appeals court previously denied on constitutional grounds is highly unusual in a democracy, but I guess it’s how the fascists play the game.\n\nI expect, at a minimum, that the arrests of Lemon and Fort will be thrown out in court eventually, since at least one of them already has been. I think the more important question is why all four of these Black people were arrested. To answer that question, we should start with the White House’s official tweet about Lemon’s arrest. They tweeted out: “When life gives you lemons…” followed by a chain emoji. This ties the arrest of Lemon to this country’s history of slavery in a way no sane person will miss.\n\nThe arrest of Lemon harks back to a discarded portion of our original Constitution: the Fugitive Slave Clause. That clause read: “No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.” It’s relevant because the Fugitive Slave Clause counteracted a different amendment in the Constitution, the 10th, which explicitly reserves all “police power” to the states.\n\nTo put it simply, the 10th Amendment says that states are in charge of deciding whom they need to arrest, but the Fugitive Slave Clause says the federal government can violate the 10th Amendment—if they need to capture Black people. Fundamentally, that is what’s happened to Lemon. The federal government has superseded the constitutional authority of Minnesota so that it can arrest a Black man who got away. And we know that’s how they’re thinking, because they’re using literal chain emojis to congratulate themselves on their accomplishment.\n\nWhat we’re seeing is an obvious attempt to change the face of the victims of Trump’s fascism. I believe the Trump administration always assumed that the people on the front lines of the resistance to their tactics would be Black and brown. They assumed that the people who would be getting brutalized in the streets and shot and killed would be people of color. They did not assume that the victim of their brutality would be a white man who was a nurse for veterans. They did not assume it would be a white woman with children’s plushies in her glove compartment.\n\nArresting Black journalists and activists, and using explicit slavery imagery while doing it, is an attempt to inflame the Black community and remind white folks who the real targets are. Support for ICE and the Trump administration generally is falling among white folks. Trump wants to remind those white folks that he’s really just trying to arrest dangerous Black people.\n\nTrump and Steven Miller want a race war. They think they’ll win it. They think white people will tune in for it. Their operating theory is that most white people are viciously racist, like they are, and that most whites secretly pine to live in apartheid South Africa.\n\nI don’t think they’re right—and I say that as a person who is not known to have a particularly high opinion of the moral clarity of white Americans. My read has always been that most white people in this country are like most people who eat meat in this country: they want to enjoy a good steak, but they don’t want to go to a slaughterhouse and put a bolt gun in a cow. White people enjoy their privilege, but they don’t exactly want to see how their privilege gets made.\n\nArresting a journalist like Lemon—who is not only “Black famous” like Fort is but crossover famous among white folks—is as likely to inflame the white community as it is to inflame the Black community. Lemon got arrested last night while covering the Grammys, of all things, not the Image Awards.\n\nThe arrests of the journalists cannot hold up legally. (The arrests of the activists shouldn’t hold up legally either, as Bondi is claiming the activist violated the First Amendment rights of churchgoers while Bondi is violating the First Amendment rights of protesters.) It is a shredding of the First Amendment that I don’t think even Trump’s plants on the Supreme Court can stand for (except for Clarence Thomas, who is probably titillated about the opportunity to use the Fugitive Slave Clause as the basis for his dissenting opinion from the more sane members of the court). I also don’t think the arrests will hold up socially. I don’t think they will change the narrative in the way Trump and Miller probably hope it will.\n\nOf course, the road to bad takes is paved with a reliance on white people to do the right thing. I don’t think this will work, legally or culturally, but I’ll need white people to prove me right.",

    "description": "Tisch's name came up in hundreds of emails in the latest round of Epstein Files datasets.",
    "fullText": "Emails between New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch and convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein are among the millions of documents released by the Justice Department on Friday.\n\nIn many of the emails, Epstein discusses setting up Tisch with various women. All of the women's names are redacted out, as is Tisch's email address.\n\nThe Giants released a statement from Tisch later Friday, describing their relationship as brief and Epstein as a terrible person:\n\n\"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments. I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.\"\n\nThe emails are mostly from 2013, five years after Epstein was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution. There is also one exchange from 2017 in which Tisch tells Epstein he was talking \"fondly\" about him with a friend and wants to \"stay in touch.\" Epstein was charged with sex trafficking minors in 2019 and died in his cell a month later from what investigators ruled as a suicide.\n\nIn another email exchange with the subject line \"Ukrainian Girl,\" Tisch asks \"pro or civilian?\" about a woman he met through Epstein, to which Epstein responds \"do you want to know if she as sweet as she seems? boyfriends? trustworthy, etc. she is earnest. is a civilian, but russian, and rarely tells the full truth , but fun.\"\n\nEpstein then sends a second reply, saying \"send me a number to call I dont like records of these conversations.\" He later tells Tisch he \"did very well\" with an acquaintance, who is \"a little freaked by the age difference.\"\n\nA different conversation has Tisch outright asking if one woman, described by Epstein as \"tahitian\" and \"exotic,\" is a \"working girl.\"\n\nThere are more conversations, such as when Tisch asks if he \"can expect 'trouble'\" while discussing a visit to Epstein's house. Epstein responds by offering to invite \"the russain [sic],\" to which Tisch asks \"Is she fun?\"\n\nAt other times, the two make plans for Epstein to attend a Giants game in Tisch's suite. Epstein also invites Tisch to his now-infamous Caribbean island, which Tisch says he never visited.\n\nThere is one email in which Tisch introduces himself to a woman and states \"Jeffrey Epstein is very excited about you and I meeting each other I like that idea Do you?\" He later adds \"Your picture is great!\"\n\nOverall, the name \"Steve Tisch\" yields 440 results when searching the online Epstein Library, though many of those are calendar entries and different emails from the same conversation.\n\nTisch is the son of Preston Robert Tisch, who purchased a 50% stake of the Mara family in 1991 and died in 2005. He officially holds the title of Giants chairman and has also worked for decades as a Hollywood producer. Among his credits are \"Risky Business,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" \"American History X\" and the \"Equalizer\" series.\n\nAmong his projects currently in the works is \"Madden,\" the Nicolas Cage-starring biopic of legendary coach and broadcast John Madden.",

    "description": "Michael Knox runs a restaurant near Minneapolis. He said employees are afraid to come in, and even his regular customers have been absent.",
    "fullText": "A small business owner near Minneapolis said both staff and customers fear ICE activity in the area.\n\nHe's concerned about the safety of his employees, who sometimes miss shifts to avoid immigration officers.\n\nNational activists are encouraging another economic blackout to protest ICE activity.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.\n\nWith ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?\n\nIt's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.\n\nSome of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is \"no questions asked.\" I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.\n\nWe're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee affected by ICE in your area? Reach out to this reporter at allisonkelly@businessinsider.com or via Signal at alliekelly.10. Here's our guide to sharing information securely.\n\nI worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.\n\nLast week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.\n\nI went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.\n\nWhat's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.\n\nSmall business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.",

    "title": "Greg Biffle plane crash: NTSB report indicates Biffle wasn't flying plane, co-pilot 'was not qualified' to fly the Cessna Citation 550",
    "description": "Biffle and the six other occupants of the plane were killed when it crashed attempting to land back at Statesville Regional Airport on Dec. 18.",
    "fullText": "The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report into the plane crash that killed former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, his family and three others determined that Biffle was not flying the plane owned by his GB Aviation Leasing LLC company when it crashed on Dec. 18.\n\nPer the report released Friday, the plane was flown by Dennis Dutton, a pilot certified to operate numerous commercial aircraft, with his son Jack, in the right cockpit seat. Biffle, a licensed pilot with “civil flight experience that included over 3,500 hours of flight time,” was seated behind the two and is identified as the rear passenger in the report.\n\nHowever, neither Biffle nor Jack Dutton were licensed to fly the Cessna Citation. The report notes that Dennis Dutton was licensed to fly the Citation with a second-in-command on board, and even though Jack Dutton was a pilot himself he “was not qualified to perform second in command duties for the flight,” according to the NTSB, as he had just over 175 hours of single-engine aircraft experience.\n\nAero Consulting Experts CEO Ross Aimer told Yahoo Sports that Jack Dutton’s lack of qualification was “troublesome” and said the plane required two pilots.\n\n“In this particular case, because it requires two pilots, and neither of those — Biffle or the young man — were qualified, they should have had a licensed pilot in that seat,” Aimer said.\n\nBiffle, his wife Cristina, their son Ryder, Biffle’s daughter Emma, Dennis and Jack Dutton and Craig Wadsworth were aboard the plane as it attempted to land at Statesville (North Carolina) Regional Airport shortly after taking off from the same airport. They were flying to Sarasota, Florida.\n\nThe Cessna Citation 550 is a dual-engine aircraft, and the report states that issues with the plane started before the flight began. Here are the key takeaways from the NTSB’s findings.\n\nThe left engine initially did not start before both engines were powered on at approximately 9:53 a.m. ET. As the plane was taxiing for takeoff “the pilot and the two pilot-rated passengers discussed that a thrust reverser indicator light(s) for an unspecified engine was inoperative, but that the thrust reverser for the affected engine was working properly.”\n\nThe plane took off at approximately 10:06 a.m. “During takeoff roll, the rear passenger commented that the left engine was producing more power than the right and indicated there may have been a faulty gauge. The pilot continued the takeoff.” The report states that it was overcast at approximately 5,000 feet for the entirety of the flight, though visibility dropped from 10 miles to five miles from 9:54 to 10:15.\n\nEarly GPS data shows that the plane turned left as it climbed and that Dennis Dutton said he’d fly under visual flight rules before he was cleared to fly under instrument flight rules. After a 180-degree turn and reached 2,200 feet, it “continued to turn left and began to descend. The right-seat passenger attempted to contact” air traffic control “and activate the flight’s IFR flight plan between 10:08 and 10:10 but was unsuccessful due to the controller’s workload and associated radio communications.\n\nAt 10:09, Dennis Dutton and Biffle discussed climbing higher even though they were supposed to continue flying under visual flight rules. The report states that “the pilot initiated a climb, and shortly after, the rear passenger noted a difference between the left and right engine interstage turbine temperature indications.” There were no other discussions that covered the instruments throughout the remainder of the [cockpit voice recorder] recording” and the autopilot disengaged — either intentionally or independently — just after 10:10.\n\nSeconds later, “the cockpit area microphone captured the pilot making remarks indicating his altitude indicator was not working properly and that additional left side flight instruments may not have been working properly.” The Garmin GPS on board had stopped recording airspeed data and heading data at around that time.\n\nAt 10:11 “airplane controls was transferred to the right seat passenger, at an altitude of about 4,500 ft msl.” At 10:13, the plane was at just under 1,900 feet and that all three said they could see the ground. “Although a positive transfer of airplane control was not recorded, subsequent communication between the pilot and right seat passenger was consistent with the pilot having resumed control of the airplane at that time.” At just after 10:13, the pilot turned the plane right towards the west and requested that the landing gear be extended. “Subsequent discussions were consistent with the landing gear being configured, however, the gear indicator lights were not illuminated.”\n\nJack Dutton noted just before 10:14 on the common traffic advisory frequency that they were “having some issues here.” Biffle references power to an alternator — the Cessna Citation 550 does not have an alternator. After a brief audio quality issue with the cockpit voice recorder, Dennis Dutton is heard saying there was a “problem” but did not specify what the problem was “or what actions were taken to correct it.”\n\nThe GPS data resumed recording just after 10:14 and Dennis Dutton “made comments which indicated he had acquired the runway visually” around 10:15. Data from the GPS “showed that the airplane’s airspeed and altitude continued to decrease from the time the airplane was aligned on final approach to the runway until 10:15:18” when the airplane’s altitude had dipped below 1,000 feet and under 99 KTS.\n\nThe plane hit a light station approximately 1,400 feet from the runway threshold and “a group of damaged trees located about 235 feet” from that light station “were sheared about 12 feet above ground level. “The first indication of fire was blackened branches and grass near the west side of the trees.”\n\n“A ground impression was observed about 350 feet from the [light station], near the airport perimeter fence, and extended through the [runway lights]. The debris path continued along a westerly heading through the runway overrun to where the main wreckage came to rest on the runway blast area about 400 feet short of the runway 28 threshold.” “Heavy charring” was seen from a second set of lights “and continued along the remaining length of the debris field to the wreckage.”\n\nThe engines remained attached to the plane after it came to a stop and both thrust reversers were in the stowed position. Investigators found “no evidence of unconfined engine failure with either engine. Examination of the cockpit throttle quadrant found both thrust levers to be in the full forward position and both reverse throttle levers in the down position, consistent with being stowed.”\n\nBiffle competed for 16 full or part-time seasons in NASCAR’s Cup Series from 2002 through 2022. He raced full-time in the Cup Series from 2003 through 2016 and scored 19 wins and 92 top-five finishes over 515 career starts.\n\nHis best season came in 2005, when he finished second to Tony Stewart in the points standings. Biffle’s six wins were the most of anyone in the Cup Series that season and his average finish of 11.9 was second only to Stewart.\n\nBiffle is one of just two drivers to have won both a championship in the third-tier NASCAR Truck Series and the second-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series.",

    "title": "Kansas Officials Reveal What Happened to the Over 100,000 Pounds of Invasive Carp Removed from a Single River",
    "description": "The tons of carp were removed from the Kansas River over several years, including a record 36,000 pounds of invasive fish in 2025",
    "fullText": "Kansas officials say invasive carp removed from the Kansas River are used for nutrient recycling\n\nMore than 109,000 pounds of carp have been removed from the river since 2022, including a record 36,000 pounds in 2025\n\nThe effort is part of a broader regional push to remove over 20 million pounds of invasive carp annually\n\nKansas wildlife officials are shedding new light on what happens after invasive carp are pulled from the Kansas River — a question that has followed the removal of more than 100,000 pounds of fish from the waterway over the past four years.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, a spokesperson from the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP) revealed that the invasive Asian carp removed during ongoing management efforts are returned to the river system as part of a \"nutrient recycling process.\" The agency's spokesperson said the fish are returned to the river to decompose naturally, allowing the nutrients stored in their bodies to reenter the ecosystem.\n\n\"This allows the fish to decompose naturally and ensures the nutrients stored in the fish's body are returned to the river ecosystem,\" explained the KDWP spokesperson, describing the practice as an \"environmentally sound\" way to close the loop after large-scale removals.\n\nThe clarification follows years of carp removal along the Kansas River. As PEOPLE previously reported, KDWP biologists have removed approximately 109,000 pounds of invasive carp since organized efforts began in 2022. The campaign reached a high point in 2025, when officials pulled 36,863 pounds from the river — the most successful year on record.\n\nThe removals target three invasive species present in Kansas waters: silver, bighead and black carp. Originally imported from Asia in the 1970s for an improved aquaculture, the fish escaped into Midwestern waterways decades ago and spread rapidly. They grow quickly, consume massive amounts of plankton and directly compete with native fish for food.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“These removal efforts appear to have produced positive effects in Kansas waterways and for native species,” said Liam Odell, an invasive carp biologist with KDWP, who noted that biologists are observing population declines in areas where removals have been concentrated, alongside signs of native species returning.\n\nKansas’ work is part of a much greater, multi-state effort. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, invasive carp management programs across the Mississippi River basin now remove more than 20 million pounds of invasive carp from U.S. waters each year.\n\nThe agency announced nearly $19 million in funding in August 2025 to support carp removal, monitoring and prevention efforts across 18 states, including Kansas.\n\nIn Kansas, biologists use a mix of electrofishing, gill nets and specialized equipment, including an electrified dozer trawl designed specifically for carp removal. In 2025, the effort expanded downstream by 15 miles, while the Bowersock Dam in Lawrence, Kan., continues to block the fish from spreading farther upstream.\n\nKDWP officials say year-round removals will continue and may expand as research and funding allow, emphasizing that controlling invasive carp remains critical to protecting native ecosystems — even after the fish leave the nets.",

    "fullText": "While navigating the trails of a national park, you may encounter wildlife — but getting too close is never a good idea. In 2022, an Ohio tourist visiting Yellowstone National Park suffered severe injuries after approaching a bison.\n\nYellowstone safety guidelines recommend keeping at least 25 yards of distance between yourself and any wildlife, but this visitor had gotten within 10 feet of the bison in question. Spooked or perhaps angered by her approach, the bison gored her and \"tossed her 10 feet into the air,\" per ABC News.\n\n\"Wildlife in Yellowstone National Park are wild and can be dangerous when approached,\" the National Park Service explained in a news release. \"... Bison have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans.\"\n\nThe 25-yard regulation — which increases to 100 yards for predators such as wolves, cougars, and bears — exists for a reason. There's no accounting for how an animal might react to humans, and, as a result, human-wildlife encounters can escalate far too easily.\n\nThe woman was taken to the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center for treatment and survived the confrontation. Two other park visitors had gotten within 25 yards of the bison as well.\n\nIn any part of the world, approaching wildlife can prove dangerous or even deadly for humans and animals alike. What's worse, animals that attack humans — even when the action is provoked — may be euthanized by local authorities in some cases.\n\nThe NPS maintains safety guidelines on its website and encourages individuals to be aware.\n\n\"The safest way to view wildlife is through a telephoto lens, a spotting scope, or a pair of binoculars,\" these experts note. \"Park animals are wild and dangerous. Bison, bears, and elk have injured and killed people. Do not approach, encircle, follow, or feed any animal.\"\n\nOn its Yellowstone safety page, the NPS adds, \"If need be, turn around and go the other way if a bison walks within 25 yards.\"\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "A historic day at the stock market for all the wrong reasons.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is taking a pounding in the stock market.\n\nOn Thursday, the Redmont giant’s share price collapsed by nearly 12 percent after it released its latest quarterly results, making it not only its biggest single day slide since March 2020, according to Bloomberg, but also one of the worst drops in the company’s history.\n\nThe Wile E. Coyote-worthy cliff-plunge, which wiped out over $400 billion in valuation, was despite Microsoft actually exceeding some key expectations, including its net income, which rose by 23 percent from the same period the year before to nearly $31 billion. Revenue also increased by 17 percent to $81.3 billion, which is about a billion more than what analysts projected.\n\nBut Microsoft’s AI spending spree has investors second-guessing its direction, and it’s striking that the lack of faith was strong enough to precipitate a historic plunge even with respectable financial growth. Overall, its total capital expenditures grew by 66 percent to a record $37.5 billion in Q4, as the company continues to splurge on building AI data centers for its Azure cloud computing business.\n\nAzure reported a 38 percent bump in revenue, which is slightly slower than the year before, adding to investor uncertainty over whether the business will be able to reap back the tens of billions spent on its data centers. In December, The Information reported that Azure was struggling to sell the company’s autonomous “AI agents” to its business customers, with quotas being slashed by up to 50 percent.\n\nSome analysts had predicted the stock drop, citing the uncertainty over Microsoft’s AI spending.\n\n“Since it is becoming even more evident that Microsoft is not going to garner a strong ROI from their massive AI investment, their shares need to be revalued back down to a level that is more consistent with its historic fair value,” Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, told Bloomberg before markets opened on Thursday.\n\nIn the latest earnings, Microsoft boasted it had more than $625 billion in contracts for its cloud business that it still needed to fulfill. Nearly half of that, though — a colossal $350 billion — is from OpenAI, raising concerns that it may be putting too many eggs in one basket. It also draws attention to how Microsoft has struggled to make an impact with its own AI products like its Copilot assistant, which was heavily based on OpenAI’s tech, and which many enthusiasts perceive as an inferior version of ChatGPT. Microsoft 365 Copilot, the business-focused version of its chatbot integrated into its apps like Word, had 15 million annual users, the company just revealed.\n\n“As an investor, when you think about our capex, don’t just think about Azure, think about Copilot,” CEO Satya Nadella said on a call with analysts, as quoted by the Financial Times. “We don’t want to maximize just one business of ours. We want to be able to allocate capacity, while we are supply constrained, that allows us to build the best portfolio.”\n\nMore on AI: Sam Altman Says Oops, They Accidentally Made the New Version of ChatGPT Worse Than the Previous One",

    "description": "Nearly three years after Holy Names University shut down amid declining enrollment and rising costs, the 60-acre campus in East Oakland is set to be reborn for a new purpose: housing.",
    "fullText": "Nearly three years after Holy Names University shut down amid declining enrollment and rising costs, the 60-acre campus nestled in the East Oakland hillside is set to be reborn for a new purpose: housing.\n\nOn Friday, BH Properties, which purchased the property in 2023 for $65 million, is expected to file an application to build 165 single-family homes on the property while retaining the university's 400-seat theater, as well as the iconic mid-century chapel and belltower designed by architect John Pflueger.\n\nLos Angeles-based BH Properties purchased the 60-acre campus in June 2023, just before a scheduled foreclosure after the university had defaulted on a $49 million loan. After purchasing it, the real estate investment firm worked without success to attract another educational institution, a tough sell in an environment where Bay Area colleges like Mills College and California College of the Arts and the San Francisco Art Institute have been going out of business after heavy post-pandemic financial losses.\n\n\"We believe in Oakland and are committed to transforming the former Holy Names campus into a win for the property, community and the city,\" Jim Brooks, president of BH Properties, said in a statement.\"This is a particularly compelling location, and we believe that homes of this type can be delivered in the near term.\"\n\nThe development represents a rare chance to build single-family homes in the East Bay's biggest city and to capitalize on a property defined by steep hillsides, deep ravines, flowering rose bushes, redwood groves, circling hawks and views of both the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge. About half of the 60-acre property will be preserved as open space, with meandering hiking trails and wooded areas where children can explore and build forts.\n\nThe plan for 165 market-rate single family homes will be consistent with surrounding densities with a variety of home sizes that match the campus and hillside environments.\n\nIn early designs, the existing campus footprint will be transformed into a clustered residential village surrounding the McClean Chapel and quad, with about 125 homes between 1,800 and 2,500 square feet. The steeper hillside will be more sparsely developed with about 40 larger homes, likely 2,500 to 3,000 square feet.\n\nIn a statement, BH said the community \"will become a place for families, empty nesters, and singles alike to enjoy the richness and fullness of life the college campus affords.\"\n\nBH Properties is working with development advisor Tidewater Capital on the proposed plans for the former campus,\n\n\"Holy Names is an incredible location surrounded by a mature hillside neighborhood,\" said Kyle Winkler, development director at Tidewater Capital. \"The plan is in its early stages, but adds much needed housing that will mirror the look and feel of the surrounding neighborhood.\"\n\nThe proposal calls for the bell tower and chapel to be preserved as a library and communal space, while the campus quad remains as a central gathering place. The performing arts theater, which was built in 1993, is envisioned as a hub for culture and enrichment available to the broader community with performances, talks and classes overseen by a nonprofit, the developer said.\n\nFormer Oakland City Councilmember Dick Spees, who served the neighborhood for 24 years, compared the Holy Names property to Oakland's Chabot Space & Science Center, which he founded. Spees previously served on the board of Holy Names University.\n\n\"Holy Names is one of Oakland's most special places, shaped by its hills, trees and long civic legacy,\" he said. \"I learned through projects like the Chabot Space & Science Center that the best development respects its setting, serves the community and thinks generations ahead. Oakland is at its best when growth is guided by care, balance and long-term thinking - and this project reflects exactly that.\"\n\nAfter the application is submitted the developer says it plans to launch a community engagement process, working with city officials and neighbors on refining the plan.\n\nThe project comes as another noteworthy Oakland education-to-housing project - the 448-unit redevelopment of the former CCA campus in Rockridge - is stalled because of financial infeasibility.\n\nIf approved, the Holy Names the project would be Oakland's second largest single-family home project. The largest, the 918-home redevelopment of the former Oak Knolls Naval Medical Center, has been delayed for three decades, mired in controversy and false starts. The current owner had said infrastructure work could start this year.\n\nThis article originally published at Exclusive: Former Bay Area university campus to be converted into single family housing.",

Here are six of our favourite pieces from the last seven days\n\nDecisions outsourced, chatbots for friends, the natural world an afterthought: Silicon Valley is giving us life void of connection. There is a way out, wrote Rebecca Solnit in this beautiful long read, but it’s going to take collective effort.\n\nA backlash against gentle parenting had been brewing for some time and some mothers on social media are advocating a tough, no-nonsense approach to parenting. Does this teach children important lessons – or just make them feel isolated and ashamed? Emine Saner on the rise of “Fafo” parenting.\n\nA special piece on Guardian cartoonists Ella Baron and Martin Rowson saw the pair face off, each producing very different cartoons in response to a prompt about Trump. We showed readers how two different generations of cartoonists operate: one in pixels, one in paint.\n\n“When I see washed-out photographs of English life in the 60s and 70s – cardiganed grandmothers eating roadside picnics beside Morris Minors, pale men sunbathing in shoes and socks on stripy deckchairs, Raleigh Choppers and caged budgerigars and faux leather pouffes – I feel a wave of what can’t properly be called nostalgia, because the last thing I’d want is to return to that age and those places where I was often profoundly unhappy and from which I’d have been desperate to escape if escape had been a possibility. Why then this longing, this echo of some remembered comfort?”\n\nThis remarkable piece of writing by Mark Haddon, author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was an achingly sad exploration of a childhood shaped by his parents’ lack of warmth.\n\nAfter a very hard landing into fame in the 00s, he decided to take a softer approach – and hit on a winning formula for classic comedy with Detectorists. The actor spoke to Zoe Williams about his obsession with middle-age and the “PTSD” on rewatching his breakout role in The Office.\n\n“In recent years Patrick Bateman – specifically Christian Bale’s movie persona – has become a kind of aspirational figure for the very same men he was designed to mock …”\n\nAs the stage adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’s notorious and misunderstood bestseller returns to the London stage, Tim Jonze explored how its tale of 80s yuppie nihilism feels more relevant than ever in the era of Andrew Tate, Trump and tech bros.",

Many of the high-profile enforcement efforts have been concentrated in blue or so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nIn Minneapolis, two US residents, Good and Pretti, were fatally shot after a confrontation with federal agents that occurred within a span of a few weeks.\n\nHundreds of local businesses in Minnesota participated in an economic blackout last week, shuttering their stores for a day following the shootings. The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, which is tied to AFL-CIO, the largest labor union in the US, endorsed the general strike.\n\nThe Department of Justice announced on Friday that it opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting of Pretti, a 37-year-old registered nurse who was killed by a Border Patrol agent.",

    "description": "Ruemmler, who is now Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, says her association with Epstein was professional.",
    "fullText": "A new trove of emails released Friday is shedding more light on the relationship between Kathryn Ruemmler, who is now Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, and Jeffrey Epstein — who sent her expensive gifts, including an Hermès bag.\n\n\"So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!\" Ruemmler wrote in 2018 after Epstein had something delivered to her New York apartment.\n\nRuemmler's relationship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender, has been closely examined. Multiple disclosures of once-private emails have shown the pair had a much deeper relationship than was previously publicly known.\n\nGoldman spokesperson Tony Fratto said in a statement that it is \"well known that Epstein often offered unsolicited favors and gifts to his many business contacts.\"\n\n\"As Kathy has said many times, she had a professional association with Jeffrey Epstein when she was a lawyer in private practice, heading the defense and investigations practice at a global law firm,\" the statement said. \"She regrets ever knowing him.\"\n\nThe latest batch of emails reveals that Epstein repeatedly gave Ruemmler pricey gifts, and she appeared delighted with them.\n\n\"OH MY GOD!!! He is in so much =rouble!!!! I am dying,\" Epstein's assistant Lesley Groff wrote in 2016, passing along Ruemmler's reaction to getting the Hermès handbag. \"It is so beautiful.\"\n\nA receipt for the bag, a Jlypslere 31, showed it cost $9,350. It wasn't the only accessory she received from him. In a 2015 exchange, Ruemmler said she \"absolutely love[d] the handbag\" Epstein sent her for her 44th birthday.\n\n\"I joked with Jeffrey that I was worried he was sending me a cane,\" Ruemmler wrote in an email to a redacted recipient, who appears to be another Epstein assistant.\n\nIn 2019, she wrote that her outfit that day was thanks to Epstein.\n\n\"Am totally tricked out by Uncle Jeffrey today! Jeffrey boots, handbag, and w=tch!\" she wrote.\n\nIn a separate exchange in 2018, Ruemmler asked whether it was OK to request a higher-end, Hermès-branded Apple Watch.\n\n\"If truly okay with him to do the Hermes, I would love the 40 mm, stainless Hermes with bleu indigo swift leather double tour,\" Ruemmler wrote at the time. \"I'll wear that one every day, whereas the sportier ones I would likely only wear on weekends or when exercising, etc.\"\n\nAt the time of the emails, Ruemmler was a top attorney at Latham & Watkins. Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a minor, had re-established himself as a financier with ties to the rich and powerful.\n\nIn 2019, Epstein was indicted on sweeping federal sex-trafficking charges and killed himself in jail while awaiting trial. Ruemmler, who had served as White House counsel from 2011 to 2014, joined Goldman Sachs in 2020.\n\nGoldman Sachs, led by CEO David Solomon, has remained behind Ruemmler amid questions about her ties to Epstein.\n\n\"She's an excellent lawyer, and the organization relies on her guidance every single day,\" Solomon told CNBC in November.\n\nOn Friday, the Justice Department said in a letter to Congress that it would release 3 million new Epstein-related files. The department said some 200,000 documents will be at least partially withheld from the public. The disclosures are required by the bipartisan Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed Congress with wide bipartisan support in November.",

    "description": "Brett Matsumoto, who has been with the BLS for over 10 years, may end the monthslong search for a new commissioner after Trump fired the last one.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's monthslong and contentious search for a new commissioner to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics may be ending.\n\nOn a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump announced that he intends to nominate Brett Matsumoto, a longtime agency economist, to lead the BLS.\n\nThe BLS commissioner role has been vacant since August, when Trump fired Erika McEntarfer after the release of a jobs report showing weak employment growth. Trump alleged, without providing evidence, that the data had been politically manipulated. The allegation and removal have since undermined public trust in one of the federal government's most closely watched statistical agencies, which is supposed to remain nonpartisan.\n\nThe agency has roughly 2,000 employees, and the commissioner is its only appointed position. The commissioner's role carries a four-year term and requires Senate confirmation.\n\nBefore Matsumoto, the White House previously nominated EJ Antoni, a Heritage Foundation economist, for the job, but later withdrew the nomination after it became clear Antoni lacked sufficient support for Senate confirmation.\n\nMatsumoto is a career economist with deep ties to the agency he would lead if confirmed.\n\nBased on Matsumoto's LinkedIn profile, he earned undergraduate and master's degrees at the University of Delaware before earning his doctorate in economics from the University of North Carolina in 2015. Since then, he has been working at the BLA as a supervisory research economist. Multiple academic papers under his name can be found covering issues such as consumer expenditure and inflation measurement. Over the past year, he has been on assignment at the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nMatsumoto is not very active on social media. A Facebook account under his name shows that his profile picture used to be a photo with Ivanka Trump back in August 2020. His most recent profile photo features him alongside a tabby cat.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social late Friday, Trump said he was confident Matsumoto had the expertise to \"QUICKLY fix the long history of issues at the BLS on behalf of the American People.\"\n\nSeveral economists posted online that they believe Matsumoto could be the right choice.\n\nClaudia Sahm, Chief Economist at New Century Advisors, posted on X that Matsumoto is an \"excellent choice\" for the commissioner position.\n\nSkanda Amarnath, Executive Director of Employ America, echoed the sentiment on X and said that Matsumoto is \"a very thoughtful person who understands the nuts and bolts of data measurement and estimation.\"",

Rhodes has made it clear that he isn't done coming for Drew McIntyre's Undisputed WWE Championship since being dethroned by him on the January 9 edition of \"SmackDown\" nor is he done with Jacob Fatu after Fatu inadvertently cost him the title.\n\nCarmelo Hayes successfully defended his United States Championship against Ilja Dragunov during last Friday's edition of \"SmackDown\", with Dragunov having answered Hayes' US Open Challenge. While Dragunov came close to dethroning Hayes, The Miz ensured that didn't happen by pushing Dragunov off the top rope and opening the door for Hayes to connect with The First 48 on Dragunov. Not only will Hayes keep the US Open Challenge going when he issues another US Open Challenge tonight, but Dragunov looks to seek his retribution when he goes one-on-one with The Miz.\n\nJohnny Gargano will be returning to action tonight as he goes head-to-head with former two time NXT Tag Team Champion Axiom. Tensions between the two men have been on the rise ever since Gargano and his wife Candice LeRae stole Axiom's mask a number of weeks ago, with Gargano having come up short to Axiom's tag team partner Nathan Frazer last Friday due to a miscommunication between Gargano and LeRae.\n\nAdditionally, the aforementioned McIntyre and Sami Zayn are set to cross paths as they meet one night before McIntyre defends his Undisputed WWE Championship against Zayn at Royal Rumble.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

The Farmers is the third event on the PGA Tour's schedule this year.\n\nThey use two golf courses at Torrey Pines for the Farmers. Each golfer plays one round on each of the North and South courses. As play heads to the weekend, all those who made the cut will play two more rounds on the more difficult South.\n\nJustin Rose, 45, ballooned his lead to as many as five shots during Friday's round and takes a four-shot lead into the weekend. The 2019 Farmers champ is seeking his second win at Torrey Pines and his 13th career Tour victory.\n\nThe most notable miss was Xander Schauffele, who had made 72 consecutive cuts dating back to the 2022 Masters. A missed birdie putt on his final hole, however, meant he would miss a weekend for the first time in 1,391 days on the PGA Tour. Koepka's playing partners, Max Homa and Ludvig Aberg, could never get it going this week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Farmers Insurance Open notables who missed the cut in 2026 at Torrey",

    "description": "The Golden State Warriors are reportedly interested in acquiring Giannis Antetokounmpo via trade",
    "fullText": "The future of Giannis Antetokounmpo is an open question among NBA fans and teams alike. The two-time MVP is reportedly available for trade, either ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline or during the summer. Of course, the Golden State Warriors have been cited as a potential suitor, primarily due to how well Giannis and Stephen Curry would potentially fit on the court.\n\nDuring a recent episode of \"The Draymond Green Show\" podcast, Green discussed Golden State's reported interest in Giannis, admitting that he only knows what's being put out by the media, just like the rest of us.\n\n“As of yesterday, everybody’s talking Giannis. Do the Warriors make a trade for Giannis? This is not the podcast where you find that out,” Green said. “I actually don’t have a (expletive) clue. I have no idea. I know what you know — exactly what I saw in red, which is the same thing you saw in red. So I have no clue...I did see that Giannis is preparing for an exit from Milwaukee. Whether that’s at the deadline or the offseason, apparently, it’s inevitable and it’s going to happen.”\n\nGolden State is in need of another superstar talent, especially now that Jimmy Butler has been ruled out for the rest of the season following an ACL injury. Adding Giannis would all but guarantee Golden State would be re-established as one of the top contenders for a championship, both this season and in the years to come.\n\nNevertheless, the Warriors won't be the only team fighting for Giannis in the trade market. When a player of his caliber is available, a bidding war is inevitable. Fortunately, the Warriors have a deep trove of tradable assets, both in terms of draft picks and young, high-upside players. Whether Mike Dunleavy and Joe Lacob can get a deal over the line, either ahead of the trade deadline or during the summer, will remain to be seen.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors' Draymond Green addresses Giannis Antetokounmpo rumors",

This event adds to the overall celebration of America’s 250th anniversary this summer, which prompted Trump to bring up the UFC White House card and mention plans to build a 100,000-seat stadium.\n\nTrump announces he is building a stadium for 100,000 people in front of the White House for the UFC fight on his birthday pic.twitter.com/6hJF0o4tkh\n\n— FactPost (@factpostnews) January 30, 2026\n\n“UFC is coming as you know in front of the White House,“ said Trump. “They’re building literally a stadium. We’re going to have over 100,000 people.”\n\nIf this is actually going to happen it would be incredible. Remember, UFC CEO, Dana White, already confirmed that the promotion will set up shop at a nearby park to host 85,000 UFC fans. White and company are trying to take over Washington D.C. and give fight fans an experience they won’t forget, especially considering the actual UFC White House event will be invite only.\n\nTrump has high hopes for his UFC birthday bash this June so maybe there is an actual plan to build a structure to hold 100,000 additional people. Maybe Trump was embellishing a little bit to help pump up the impending celebration.",

(KELO) — The first competitive events of the Black Hills Stock Show kicked off today with the C-M-S-A Mounted Shooting.\n\nThe national series is part of Rodeo Rapid City.\n\nFriday, horses and riders stepped into the Summit Arena as Rodeo Rapid City kicked off nine days of events.\n\n“Well, we’re in an agricultural country, we’re in a Western lifestyle. There’s no better time to be a cowboy right now if you’re competing. The money’s great, a lot of rodeos to go to and with Yellowstone and the different TV shows coming on, everybody wants to put on their boots and hat and go to town for the weekend,” Sutton Rodeo Owner Steve Sutton said.\n\nBeing able to properly shoot a gun at a shooting range and hit a target can be a difficult task. Doing it on horseback adds to the level of difficulty.\n\n“Cowboy mounted shooting is like barrel racing with guns. It’s a timed event with ten reactive targets, balloons, that we shoot with 19-century replica guns, with a specially loaded black powered blank that only flies to about 20-feet,” CMSA Level Six Shooter Brett Borkowski said.\n\nThis event is family friendly and lets people take a step back in time.\n\n“The old westerns on TV used to be the gun fights and everything and so it’s pretty entertaining. I think a lot of people got into this event by sitting in the stands watching it, seeing how much fun it would actually be if you were participating,” Sutton said.\n\n“You know, if you don’t get your second gun out in time you might be halfway home, you might have run by three balloons before you even get your second gun out. So the feeling when you shoot ten balloons and everything flows and it’s all perfect, it’s an amazing feeling,” Borkowski said.\n\nRiders from seven states and a variety of levels are competing at this year’s event.\n\nIf you were unable to attend day one of this event, you can still get in on the action as day two of their Mounted Shooting series begins Saturdaymorning.",

    "description": "WWE released a statement to Fightful Select following now-former \"WWE NXT\" General Manager Ava's departure from the company.",
    "fullText": "Now-former \"WWE NXT\" General Manager Ava revealed on Friday that she was departing WWE after choosing not to re-sign another deal. The star, whose real name is Simone Garcia Johnson, daughter of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, took to Instagram to announce her decision to fans.\n\nFollowing Ava's social media announcement, Fightful Select reached out to WWE and received a statement about her departure. In the statement, WWE thanked Garcia Johnson for her \"stellar work\" as Ava, and said her passion, dedication, and impact were felt across \"NXT\" and beyond. WWE wished her well in her future endeavors to cap off the statement.\n\nAva joined WWE and started training at the Performance Center in February 2020. She didn't make her on-screen debut as an authority figure, initially, however, but rather, alongside Joe Gacy, and the Dyad (the Grizzled Young Veterans) as Ava Raine in The Schism, in 2022. Her debut match was at Stand & Deliver 2023, in a mixed tag match lost against Chase U. She would go on to have five other matches in WWE, but only two more on television, with no televised singles victories. Her final match came at Heatwave 2023 in a loss against Ivy Nile.\n\nFollowing Gacy proclaiming The Schism dead following the releases of The Dyad, she became an on-screen authority figure as an assistant to Shawn Michaels in 2023. In January 2024, Ava became the youngest-ever authority figure in WWE history when she was promoted to \"NXT\" general manager by William Regal. She would even once share the screen with her father, when The Rock stopped by \"NXT\" following its New Year's Evil special in January 2025.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

St. Brown is from Anaheim Hills, California, and starred at USC for three seasons before being selected by the Lions in the fourth round of the 2021 NFL Draft.\n\nAllen also spent his college years in California, playing three seasons for the Cal Golden Bears before being drafted by the Chargers in 2013. Allen has also spent 12 of his 13 seasons with the Chargers, first in San Diego and then in Los Angeles after their relocation.\n\nSt. Brown is coming off his fourth straight 1,000-yard season and finished the year with 117 catches for 1,401 yards and 11 touchdowns. While the 26-year-old receiver had a great year statistically, the Lions missed the playoffs for the first time in two seasons and finished fourth in the NFC North division. St. Brown will also take part in Sunday's NFL Pro Bowl and was a second-team All-Pro.\n\nIn his first year back with the Chargers after a season with the Chicago Bears, Allen remained productive. The 33-year-old receiver led the team with 81 receptions and had 777 yards and 4 touchdowns. Allen's season ended with a 16-3 wild-card loss to the New England Patriots, which resulted in the firing of former offensive coordinator Greg Roman. Allen is set to become a free agent this offseason.\n\nThe Celebrity game will be on Friday, Feb. 13, and will be held on the first day of All-Star Weekend.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies just picked up one of the most versatile free agents available.\n\nOn Friday, they signed Dylan Moore to a minor league contract with an invite to spring training, according to The Athletic's Will Sammon.\n\nAccording to Sammon, Moore \"can make up to $3.25 million with plate appearance and active roster bonuses.\"\n\nMoore was a Gold Glove winner in 2024 as the American League's top utility defender while playing for the Seattle Mariners.\n\nMORE: How Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nHe has played all but 18 of his MLB games with Seattle. He closed out the 2025 season with the Texas Rangers.\n\nMoore's defense is his calling card. The 33-year old can play all over the outfield, and he also plays up the middle at second base and shortstop.\n\nIn 2025, he found himself in a rut at the plate with the Mariners, batting just .193 before he was moved to the Rangers, for whom he hit .259 in 18 games.\n\nMORE: Paul Skenes has added a new pitch\n\nMoore is a career .206 hitter, a much better swing from his right side against left-handed pitching.\n\nHe did have an OPS of .855 in 2020, then .753 in 2022 and .731 in 2023. There is an ability to make a difference with the bat from Moore, if he can recapture some of that past swing.\n\nThe Phillies will likely find a use for him at least at some point thanks to that multi-faceted defensive skillset, so it's not a bad signing as the spring approaches.\n\nTeam USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nHow Trent Grisham's decision ruined the Yankees' offseason plans\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nBo Bichette comments exhibit clear hyprocrisy\n\nAndrew McCutchen is not happy with the Pirates",

    "description": "Coach Nick Nurse discusses the Philadelphia 76ers being undersized amid their rebounding struggles.",
    "fullText": "CAMDEN, N.J. -- As the Philadelphia 76ers got back to work at practice on Friday afternoon, the focus was on the rebounding issues they've had to endure recently. They were out-rebounded 53-38 in a loss to the New York Knicks on Jan. 24, 53-33 in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Monday, and 46-24 in the win over the Sacramento Kings.\n\nAfter the win, Paul George did admit the Sixers are a bit undersized compared to some teams. He and Kelly Oubre Jr. flank Joel Embiid up front while teams like the Kings can employ big men like Domantas Sabonis, Precious Achiuwa, and Maxime Raynaud to cause problems down low. It nearly cost the Sixers a win.\n\nThe rebounding problem is something that can certainly cause some issues for the Sixers in the playoffs and coach Nick Nurse is looking to nip it in the bud going forward.\n\n\"I think that there's a few things,\" Nurse pondered on Friday. \"I mean, sometimes it's size and athleticism, right? Playing against bigger guys, more athletic, stronger, whatever. Sometimes, it’s just not paying attention to details and getting a body on people. Then sometimes, I think it's a little bit like defense in general, right?\"\n\nIt is a bit like defense. As once a guy gets going and finds a rhythm, he's tough to stop, but it's the same with offensive rebounding and scoring off misses. Sacramento had 24 second-chance points compared to zero for Philadelphia.\n\n\"You give up a few, and then the blood's in the water, and those guys really seem to get cranked up after they've got to get a couple, and they're just like, ‘Man, this is an easy way to live tonight. I'm gonna really, you know, kind of focus on that.’\" Nurse continued. \"So it's a little bit like trying to shut a guy's water off when he's scoring, too. How do you figure it out?\"\n\nTherefore, Nurse and his staff will be looking to make sure everybody understands what has to be done going forward. The Sixers will not win unless they figure out how to pull down rebounds consistently. This will be something to monitor going into the playoffs in April.\n\n\"It takes some thought,\" Nurse added. \"It takes some effort. It takes some thought. It takes some scheme. Sometimes, it takes two guys on certain like—Sabonis is a guy you need to probably use two guys on. He’s very good at doing all this pushing as the guy’s in a shooting motion. He's gonna wedge most guys underneath the basket and the only ones that are you're gonna get are the ones that come through the net, right? So somebody's got to come from the backside to help on those and things like that.\"\n\nThere have been matchups when the Sixers have been able to control the glass which then turns games in their favor, but these recent contests have been a serious struggle for them. At practice, Nurse showed clips on film to his team looking to get back to getting it done on the glass.\n\n\"We've been pretty good at that, and that was a lot of the clips we showed today,\" Nurse added. \"We showed, like, here's one where you have to come and help guys because even, like, even him, those guys were blocking him out in front of him. The balls were coming over the head, and that's got to be somebody else's.\"\n\nThe Sixers will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Nick Nurse talks Sixers being undersized amid rebounding struggles",

    "description": "Brooks Koepka made the cut on the number to get into the weekend at the Farmers Insurance Open.",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — Brooks Koepka walked off the final green late on Friday afternoon and immediately found his wife, Jena Sims, and their two-year-old son, Crew, waiting for him.\n\nKoepka greeted his wife and quickly scooped up an excited Crew for the walk back from the ninth green at the North Course down to the scorers room at the clubhouse at Torrey Pines, safe for the weekend.\n\nThat moment, he said earlier in the week, was the entire reason he wanted to leave LIV Golf and come back to the PGA Tour. He wanted to be able to spend more time with his family after a rough couple of months for them off the course.\n\nBrooks Koepka and family will stick around for the weekend @FarmersInsOpen 🤗 pic.twitter.com/xrO6F6LFh6\n\n— Golf on CBS ⛳ (@GolfonCBS) January 31, 2026\n\n“I don’t know the last time I’ve actually made a cut and they’ve still been there,” Koepka said, smiling.\n\n“It was so nice to have them out there, and it felt good. I don’t know, my son doesn’t really know what’s going on, but it’s cool for me to have them here.”\n\nKoepka posted a 4-under 68 on Friday in the second round of the Farmers Insurance Open, which marked his first non-major championship PGA Tour event in nearly four years. That, after his 1-over opening round on the South Course on Thursday, got him to 3-under for the week — which was just good enough to make the cut on the number.\n\nAs a result, Koepka will make it into the weekend and get all four rounds in his first Tour event back.\n\nWhile his round was significantly better than the initial outing — Koepka even made a birdie at the par-5 17th before carding two birdies in his final five holes — he was still a bit anxious as he settled back into life on Tour. It was just a different kind than what he felt 24 hours earlier.\n\n“It was definitely different,” he said of his second round. “I think yesterday I was excited to play, nervous and kind of didn’t know what to expect. Today felt more normal, I guess.\n\n\"I mean, don’t get me wrong, I definitely still got antsy. But I guess maybe a little bit of nerves, just trying to figure it out and see where my game’s at too, right? I feel like I’m playing really well. It’s just been a long layoff.”\n\nKoepka very likely won’t be able to catch Justin Rose and make a run at the title this weekend. The deficit he's facing is massive. But he’s going to get to play all four rounds, and have both Jena and Crew by his side.\n\nUnlike plenty who took it on before him this week, the South Course was incredibly easy for Justin Rose.\n\nRose erupted on the North Course on Thursday, where he carded a 10-under 62 on the easier of the two courses to begin the tournament and instantly jump into the solo lead. Friday was nearly as dominant, too. Rose seemed to handle the South Course, which got just about everyone in the opening round, with ease to grab a four-shot lead.\n\nRose went 5-under on his front nine in the second round, thanks to a huge eagle at the par-5 sixth. Rose stuck his second shot on the front of the green and then easily rolled in an 8-footer with ease.\n\nFirst eagle of the day on the South Course 🦅@JustinRose99 extends his lead and is now 13-under @FarmersInsOpen.\n\n📺 ESPN pic.twitter.com/MzLPS5GUuU\n\n— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) January 30, 2026\n\nHe did bogey once on Friday, but immediately offset it with another birdie. Rose then birdied the final two holes to get to 17-under, thanks in part to an absolute dart he landed on the iconic par-5 18th. That broke his own 36-hole record at the event.\n\n\"That was two special rounds of golf,\" Rose said. \"Today probably even more so just given it's hard to often follow up a low one.\"\n\nRose has won 12 times on Tour in his career, most recently in a playoff at the FedEx St. Jude Championship last fall. Rose forced a playoff with Rory McIlroy at the Masters in April, too, but couldn’t quite pull off the upset win at Augusta National.\n\nThough he’s still got a ways to go to grab his first win of the season, Rose is in full control at the midway point. And he’s well on his way to surpassing the near-record 21-under he posted to win the event seven years ago.\n\nYet even knowing where he's at, Rose isn't going to adjust a thing.\n\n\"I felt like I was even thinking about it [late in my round] and I thought that actually, I don't think anything changes ... You go out and play this golf course as it's designed to be played,\" he said. \"There's going to be pin placements that you can't take on. You have to play it with some patience and respect and you're going to have to play well. You're going to have to play from the fairway.\n\n\"So yeah, whether I was four back or four ahead, like I don't think it actually changes the task that much tomorrow.\"",

    "fullText": "The Feb. 5 trade deadline is fast approaching, and the Boston Celtics have yet to make a move. Brad Stevens spent the summer cutting costs, trading Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, while allowing Al Horford and Luke Kornet to leave in free agency.\n\nHowever, even after the talent drain during the offseason, Joe Mazzulla's team is currently a top-three team in the Eastern Conference and looking like a good value as a potential postseason threat. Therefore, Stevens may feel the time is right to try to improve the current roster via the trade market. The most logical area in need of improvement is the center rotation.\n\nDuring a recent discussion on WEEI's \"The Greg Hill Show,\" the hosts discussed whether now was the right time for the Celtics to go all-in on a big-time trade, or whether they should wait and see how the team looks once Jayson Tatum is back in the rotation and nearing full health. Of course, if the Celtics wait until the summer, they won't be able to dangle Anfernee Simons' expiring contract in trade talks.\n\nYou can watch the full discussion by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: Should the Celtics stick or twist at the trade deadline?",

    "fullText": "Jaylen Brown is having a season to remember. The Boston Celtics All-Star has spearheaded Joe Mazzulla's roster to a top-three spot in the Eastern Conference, while also being a perennial top-five MVP candidate and an All-Star selection. Furthermore, he's done all of this while Jayson Tatum is sidelined with injury and a new-look roster full of young and unproven rotation talent.\n\nIn 44 games, Brown is averaging 29.4 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists, shooting 48.3% from the field and 35.5% from deep. He's leading the Celtics in usage rate, shot attempts and free-throw attempts while also playing some stellar defense on the perimeter. Brown has proven that he can be the leading star on a high-level team.\n\nIn a recent video from the \"GOAT\" YouTube channel, the host dives into Brown's recent production, where his buckets are coming from, and why the rest of the league should be taking note. The host also discusses Brown's overall upside as a lead star and whether he could lead the Celtics toward a deep playoff run.\n\nYou can watch the full video by clicking on the embedded link above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: The rest of the NBA should watch out for Jaylen Brown",

    "fullText": "Jaylen Brown has been unstoppable this season. From scoring across all three levels to shutting down opposing teams' best players, the Boston Celtics All-Star is doing it all. What's even more impressive is that Brown is having this type of season during a \"gap year\" where there are multiple young and inexperienced players in the second unit, and Jayson Tatum is sidelined with injury.\n\nWhen you look at the impact Brown has made for Boston, it's no surprise to see him in the MVP conversation. After all, without him, the Celtics are highly unlikely to be sitting third in the Eastern Conference with the All-Star break fast approaching.\n\nIn a recent episode of \"The Dunker Spot\" podcast, Nekias Duncan and Steve Jones dove into the game tape to explore how and why Brown is playing at such an elite level. They detail the overall evolution in Brown's game and raise the question of whether he could help lead the Celtics back to the NBA Finals.\n\nYou can watch the full episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: How is Jaylen Brown dominating for the Boston Celtics?",

This comes after both Shedeur Sanders and Joe Flacco were late additions to the Pro Bowl roster.\n\nSanders was added to the games earlier this week, while Flacco was added on Friday afternoon. Flacco, of course, was the Browns' opening weekend starter. He was then benched for Dillon Gabriel and subsequently traded in-division to the Cincinnati Bengals after the injury to their star quarterback Joe Burrow. Flacco went on to light it up through the air despite a lack of overall wins in Cincinnati.\n\nSo, there will be a small Cleveland reunion at the Pro Bowl games, where Flacco and Sanders can catch up with one another after one of the weirdest seasons imaginable for both of them.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns become first team in NFL history to accomplish an odd task",

    "description": "The Seahawks are expected to eventually be sold, per Paul Allen’s wishes. That could happen as soon as this year.",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks are just about a week away from playing in their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history. It might also be the last one they play for under current ownership.\n\nLongtime Seahawks beat reporter Brady Henderson reported on Friday that the Seahawks, “will go up for sale after Super Bowl LX, league and ownership sources familiar with the arrangement told ESPN, ending years of questions about when the team would seek new ownership following the 2018 death of former owner Paul G. Allen.\n\n“Sale discussions have taken place at ownership and league levels for at least the past week.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Paul G. Allen estate released a statement following Henderson’s report.\n\n“We don’t comment on rumors and speculation, and the team is not for sale. We’ve already said that will change at some point per Paul’s wishes, but I have no news to share. Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.”\n\nThe NBA’s Trail Blazers are in the process of being sold for over $4 billion to a group led by billionaire Tom Dundon, who also owns the NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nThe Seahawks were officially sold to Paul Allen for $200 million in 1997, effectively rescuing the franchise from relocation to Anaheim, California. Over the span of nearly three decades, the Seahawks have been one of the more successful teams in the NFL in terms of wins, playoff appearances, and Super Bowl appearances.\n\nAs of May 2024, the Seahawks’ agreement to give 10 percent of their sale price to the state of Washington has expired. This was done following a referendum that paved the way for the construction of Lumen Field. It was expected that any Seahawks sale would occur after the expiration of the agreement, but there was no strict timeline to adhere to Paul Allen’s directive to sell off his assets (and donate proceeds to charitable causes).\n\nThe last NFL team to be sold was the Washington Commanders, who were acquired for $6.05 billion in 2023 by a group led by Josh Harris, who also co-owns the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and NHL’s New Jersey Devils. ESPN was told by an anonymous team executive that the Seahawks could be worth in the neighborhood of $8 billion.\n\nIt’s not like this is some brand new story—it’s “when” and not “if” the Seahawks are sold—but this is extraordinary timing after the best season in over a decade. Perhaps the time to put the Seahawks on the market is on a high note… and with a second Lombardi Trophy.",

    "fullText": "Can Nikola Jokic still win NBA MVP after extended absence due to knee injury? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter over a month on the sideline, Denver Nuggets star center Nikola Jokic will return to game action against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night.\n\nJokic suffered a hyperextended left knee during Denver’s 147-123 loss to the Miami Heat on Dec. 29 and has been sidelined since. His return is good news for the Nuggets, and basketball fans in general.\n\nPrior to going down with the injury, Jokic was considered a leading candidate for the NBA MVP award, which he has won three times previously in his career. However, his extended absence brought his candidacy into question.\n\nA while back, the NBA instituted a 65-game threshold for award and All-NBA team eligibility, meaning players had to play at least 65 games in order to be eligible to be considered for awards that season.\n\nMore: Denver Nuggets rebuffing trade offers for key rotation piece\n\nSo, let’s do a little math for a minute. Jokic has missed 16 total games so far this season. That means he’s technically still eligible for award consideration, but barely.\n\nJokic can only miss one (1) more game for the entire season to remain eligible. If he misses two more, that would bring his total to 18 for the season, and 18 subtracted from 82 equals 64 – one shy of the required number. Denver has 34 games remaining on their regular season slate.\n\nAt the end of the day though, hitting that 65-game threshold isn’t going to be the priority for Jokic or the Nuggets. Jokic’s health, both in the short-term and long-term, will be. If Denver’s medical staff thinks Jokic would benefit from a night off, they’re not going to play him solely so he can remain award eligible. Doing so would be organizational malpractice.\n\nPlus, Jokic already has more accolades than most players could ever imagine, and knowing him, he’s not pressed to add to his collection.\n\nKevin Durant passes Dirk Nowitzki on NBA all-time scoring list\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers star shuts down dunk contest question\n\nDraymond Green weighs in on Giannis Antetokounmpo, Warriors rumors",

    "fullText": "Justin Rose carded a sizzling 65 on Friday to push his lead to four strokes at Torrey Pines, where Brooks Koepka made the cut in his PGA Tour return.\n\nEngland's Rose followed up a 10-under first round on the North Course with an arguably more impressive seven-under effort on the tougher South Course, where he closed with back-to-back birdies to set a 36-hole tournament scoring record with a total of 17-under 127.\n\n\"That was two special rounds of golf, today probably even more so just given it's hard to often follow up a low one,\" said the 45-year-old, the 2013 US Open champion whose 12 PGA Tour titles include the 2019 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines.\n\n\"I felt like decision-making was spot on in terms of how I managed my game,\" Rose said after a round that featured six birdies, an eagle and one bogey.\n\n\"Obviously every shot was not going to be perfect out there, but when I was in a little bit of trouble the putter would come through for me or I'd be disciplined when I was slightly out of position, really played for the fat of the green and gave myself a good two-putt opportunity from 40 feet.\"\n\nRose was four strokes in front of Ireland's Seamus Power, who rebounded from his only bogey at his penultimate hole, the eighth, with an eagle at the ninth to post a six-under 66 for 131.\n\n\"A lot of good stuff,\" Power said. \"As well as I scored yesterday, it was more the putter and I knew I was a little off with the long game.\n\n\"So I was able to get that figured out after the round yesterday, so it felt much much better long game wise and the putter obviously was still there. So feeling really good going into tomorrow.\"\n\nPower was two shots ahead of Americans Joel Dahmen and McMcGreevy. Dahmen had three eagles in his 63 and McGreevy signed for a 67 to join him on 11-under 133.\n\nFive-time major winner Koepka, one of the highest-profile players to join LIV when the Saudi-backed renegade tour launched in 2022, was 14 off the pace but he'll be playing the weekend in his first tournament back on the PGA Tour.\n\nKoepka hadn't played a non-major PGA Tour event since the 2022 WGC Match Play and hadn't played a competitive round in 14 weeks before posting a one-over 73 on Thursday -- when he was heartened by the warm reception he received from fans.\n\nOn Friday he had an eagle and three birdies in a 68 to make the cut on the number at three-under 141.\n\n\"It feels good,\" Koepka said. \"Just wanted to play four days this week, I think that was important.\n\n\"I think yesterday I was excited to play, nervous, and kind of didn't know what to expect,\" added Koepka, whose return to the PGA Tour was facilitated by a new program for returning players that includes limitations on eligibility for some top events as well as financial penalties.\n\n\"Today felt more normal,\" he said. \"I definitely still got antsy, maybe a little bit of nerves just trying to figure it out and see where my game's at too.\"\n\nTwo-time major winner Xander Schauffele's streak of 72 consecutive PGA Tour cuts made -- the fifth-longest such streak in tour history -- came to an end, the American's three-under 69 leaving him one stroke shy of the weekend.",

(AP) — Lake Nona member Lydia Ko shot a 5-under 67 on Friday for a share of second-round lead with Lottie Woad in the LPGA Tour’s season-opening Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions.\n\nKo, the 2024 tournament winner and a Hilton Grand Vacations ambassador, is the lone player in the 39-woman field without a bogey after two days. The Hall of Famer has 23 LPGA Tour victories.\n\n“I’ve had to hole some good par putts, but I really haven’t put myself in that many difficult positions as of yet,” said Ko, from New Zealand. “I think that’s why I had the two bogey-free rounds. I’m hoping to kind of continue that good momentum this weekend.”\n\nWoad shot a 69 to match Ko at 8-under 136 in mostly sunny conditions with 12 mph wind at the most in the 70-degree afternoon.\n\n“I looked at the leaderboard quite a lot today because I was getting annoyed,” Woad said. “Seemed like there weren’t that many low scores out there, so kind of knew I was still in it. The pins were probably a little trickier so weren’t as many birdies as yesterday.”\n\nThe 22-year-old English player won the ISPS Handa Women’s Scottish Open last year, weeks after taking the KPMG Women’s Irish Open as an amateur on the Ladies European Tour.\n\nNasa Hataoka, also a Lake Nona member, was a stroke back with Amy Yang.

Youmin Hwang (67) and Ingrid Lindblad (69) also were 6 under.\n\nTop-ranked Jeeno Thitikul and Kelly Korda were 5 under. Thitkul had a 72, and Korda shot 71.\n\n“I think the weather is going to get a little worse so I’m going to go to the putting green, go to the range because wasn’t hitting it the best today,” Korda said. “Just going to figure some things out ahead of the weekend.”\n\nBaseball player Aaron Hicks topped the celebrity field.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEarlier in the week, eight-time All-Star and freshly acquired Arizona Diamondback Nolan Arenado announced he will represent Puerto Rico in the upcoming World Baseball Classic, which takes place in the coming months.\n\nThis may come as a shock to some, considering the third baseman played for the United States team in 2017 and 2023, which can be confusing and lead people to ask what ties the 10-time Golden Glove winner has to Puerto Rico.\n\nArenado's mother is of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent, which explains the formal connection to the star third baseman and the country. Still, of course, for Arenado to make the sudden change, it did not go well with the American fanbase.\n\nMore: Proposed Diamondbacks trade lands them a four-time Gold Glove Award winner\n\nArenado's decision surprised many American fans on social media. Still, it has become official: Arenado will also be joined by New York Mets All-Star Francisco Lindor, who will play shortstop for Puerto Rico.\n\nIn the country's history competing in the Classic, Puerto Rico has finished as the runner-up twice, in 2013 and 2017, with 2017 being the year Arenado helped defeat Puerto Rico while playing for the United States.\n\nAs the former Silver Slugger slowly approaches the final seasons of his career, maybe choosing Puerto Rico comes from him believing this is the last time he gets to represent his mother's home country as a gift to her, as the all-star has credited his mother for giving him the passion he has for baseball to this day.\n\nMany will see how Arenando performs in front of the home crowd, as Puerto Rico will host the classic from March 6-11.\n\nOrioles predicted to make $180 million splash signing with best free-agent starter\n\nMets predicted to trade for 22-year old switch-pitcher from Mariners for slugger\n\nTigers' Tarik Skubal gets $32 million contract update from ESPN's Jeff Passan\n\nRed Sox linked to free agent reunion with member of 2018 World Series championship team\n\nYankees predicted to trade 22-year old rising star to fill big need\n\nGiants predicted to trade for 29-year old All Star\n\nESPN projects Pirates to sign $42 million home-run hitter to chase NL Central title",

He's still a free agent, as well.\n\nExcept it's not sounding like the Mariners plan to sign him.\n\nMariners GM Jerry Dipoto was on local radio Friday night when he shared this tidbit:\n\n\"He fits emotionally...but that could be problematic in continuing to build our roster..I wouldnt say thats likely at this point.\"\n\nJerry Dipoto with us now on the possibility of the Mariners bring back Eugenio Saurez.\n\n— Dave “Softy” Mahler (@Softykjr) January 30, 2026\n\nMORE: How Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nThe idea of Suarez fitting the team emotionally does make sense. He's a popular teammate and has a lot of Mariners fans on his side after two separate tenures in the city.\n\nIt's fascinating, though, that Dipoto doesn't think that's enough to necessarily get a deal done.\n\nWithout Suarez, the Mariners either have to play glove-first Ben Williamson or shortstop prospect Colt Emerson at third base.\n\nMORE: Paul Skenes has added a new pitch\n\nSuarez is the most proven of that potential group. He slugged 49 homers in 2025, the first 36 with the Diamondbacks and then 13 more with Seattle once he was traded at the end of July.\n\nHis peripheral numbers were worse with the Mariners, and maybe they feel they should try to avoid his decline. At the same time, there's something to be said for a guy who fits the team and the clubhouse off the field.\n\nIt just doesn't sound like Dipoto is going to use that reality to make this decision on Suarez.\n\nTeam USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nHow Trent Grisham's decision ruined the Yankees' offseason plans\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nBo Bichette comments exhibit clear hyprocrisy\n\nAndrew McCutchen is not happy with the Pirates",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKayla Nicole found herself back in the middle of online discourse this week after a seemingly minor social media interaction sparked major reaction from fans.\n\nThe former girlfriend of Travis Kelce was flooded with criticism after screenshots circulated showing she had liked a recent Instagram post involving the Kansas City Chiefs star. The post, shared by Bleacher Report, highlighted Travis and his brother Jason Kelce helping fund U.S. hockey player Laila Edwards’ family trip to Milan for her Winter Olympics debut.\n\nMORE: Cardi B will be the musical guest on 'SNL'\n\nThe caption praised the Kelce brothers’ generosity, calling them “two great guys that went out of their way when they didn’t have to.” While the story itself focused on the charitable gesture, attention quickly shifted to Nicole after users noticed her verified account had interacted with the post.\n\nThat single “like” was enough to set off a wave of backlash, particularly from fans protective of Travis’ current relationship with Taylor Swift. Screenshots of the interaction spread rapidly across platforms, and commentary soon followed. One user accused Nicole of chasing attention, writing that she “really dislikes not being talked about.” Another questioned why the moment was being amplified at all, arguing that continued focus only fuels unnecessary drama.\n\nThe reaction added to a growing list of moments that have kept Nicole in headlines since her 2022 breakup with Travis. Last year, fans speculated about possible shade when she recreated Toni Braxton’s “He Wasn’t Man Enough” look from the early 2000s music video, and other posts have also been interpreted — fairly or not — as indirect jabs at Swift.\n\nWhile Nicole has not publicly addressed the latest situation, the renewed attention arrives as the Kelce family continues to dominate headlines for entirely different reasons.\n\nMORE: Austin Reaves' YoungLA fashion drop gets love from Luka Doncic and Lebron James\n\nTravis’ mother, Donna Kelce, recently raised eyebrows during promotional interviews ahead of her appearance on The Traitors. When asked who she hoped to avoid encountering on the show, Donna listed rivals, coaches, and then added one more category.\n\n“Maybe some of my sons’ adversaries,” she said. “That could either be on other teams, or it could be coaches, or it could be past girlfriends.”",

    "title": "NBA Trade Rumors 2025-26: Lakers in talks about De'Andre Hunter, Keon Ellis remains hot name",
    "description": "With less than a week to go a lot of trade talk is out there, but the Giannis Antetokounmpo situation could hold up other deals.",
    "fullText": "We are less than a week away from the NBA trade deadline and rumors are flying around fast and furious. Here are some of the latest rumors not involving Giannis Antetokounmpo (to check out the latest on his trade saga, click here).\n\nIt's no secret the Lakers are looking for help on the wing and some depth at the five.\n\nEnter De'Andre Hunter, the Cleveland wing. The Lakers and Cavaliers reportedly have discussed a trade that would send Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht out of Los Angeles and involves a third team, Brooklyn. Here is what Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com reported on the Wine & Gold Podcast.\n\n\"My sources tell me that the Cavs and the Lakers have discussed a general framework surrounding De'Andre Hunter of Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht and then bringing in a third team.\"\n\nThat third team is Brooklyn, and the Lakers would like to get center Day'Ron Sharpe as part of the trade, reports Brett Siegel of Clutch Points.\n\nThe challenge in constructing any trade with these teams is that the Cavaliers are over the second apron, and neither can aggregate multiple players in a trade nor can they take back more money than they send out. Added to that, the Lakers are hard-capped at the first apron and are currently less than $1 million from that number. The Lakers also have one pick to trade, a very valuable 2031 first-rounder, although there have been reports that the Lakers have looked to trade that pick for three lesser-valuable first-rounders, one of which would likely be included in this.\n\nThe prize for the Lakers would be adding Hunter, a player the Cavaliers hoped would fill their need on the wing, but did not. Hunter is averaging 13.9 points a game, often off the bench in Cleveland, shooting 30.9% from beyond the arc this season he is not a lock-down defender. Giving up Hachimura for Hunter is not a great deal, but if Sharpe is coming with him, the Lakers would have to consider it.\n\nThe hottest name in trade talks is another potential Lakers target, Kings wing Keon Ellis.\n\nSacramento is \"sifting through various scenarios for Keon Ellis, sources say, several of which would include trading out veteran forward DeMar DeRozan and/or combo guard Malik Monk along with him,\" reports NBA Insider Jake Fischer of The Stein Line.\n\nMarc Stein at the Stein Line previously reported 14 teams — almost half the league — had called Sacramento to check on an Ellis trade, including the Lakers, Clippers, Cavaliers, Celtics, Knicks and Warriors.\n\nThere's a reason all those teams are interested. Ellis is a plus defender on the wing at 6'4\" who is shooting 36.2% from 3-point range this season (and is a career 41.4% shooter from deep), all on an expiring minimum contract. He is eligible for a contract extension after Feb. 9, and if a team that trades for him can't reach that extension then he becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer.\n\nIf the Kings pair Monk with Ellis in a trade, they make a combined $21 million; with DeRozan, that climbs to $27 million. Either option gives the Kings some flexibility to bring back someone they think can be part of their future.\n\n• Agent Rich Paul denied the reports that he pushed Dallas to trade Anthony Davis.\n\nRich Paul says it’s NOT TRUE that he has demanded the Mavericks to trade Anthony Davis \n\n“I know what was said. That thing was aggregated. This is the power of the internet. If you’re wondering why Rich Paul has a podcast, this is part of the reason why… The reality of it is,… pic.twitter.com/ctWNnlpR0x\n\n— NBA Courtside (@NBA__Courtside) January 25, 2026\n\n• Cleveland has been active in trade talks as it looks to turn around a disappointing season so far, although nobody is exactly sure what their plan is, reports Brian Windhorst and Tim Bontemps of ESPN.\n\n• Oklahoma City may be exploring the trade market for center Isaiah Hartenstein, reports Brian Windhorst of ESPN on the Hoop Collective Podcast. \"He's got a team option next year for $29 million. I've actually heard the Oklahoma City Thunder's name in some trade chatter.\" Remember that next season, both Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams' max contracts kick in, and the finances are going to get a lot tighter in OKC. They probably won't make that trade, but it's worth watching.\n\n• Expect Orlando to make a trade, but it will be all about dumping salary, according to ESPN’s Windhorst and Bontemps. The Magic are $5.6 million into the tax, and, given how this team is playing, would like to get out of it. Trading Tyus Jones and his $7 million salary is a straightforward way to do that.",

    "fullText": "On Friday, Jan. 30, the first day of competition leaned heavily on the field events, and Brianna Utecht made the most of the opportunity. Behind consistent performances across all of her events, Utecht totaled the second-highest pentathlon score in program history.\n\nJunior Brianna Utetch captured first place in the women’s pentathlon with an overall score of 4017 points. Behind her in third, Sofia Wydra finished with a total of 3693 points.\n\nFor the 60-meter hurdles, Utecht won with a time of 8.67 seconds, improving on her previous meet mark of 8.71. The hurdles performance ranks eighth in program history. Wydra finished 10th, clocking 9.08 seconds to beat her previous time of 9.11 and set a personal best.\n\n“I feel great. It was like a season opener at pentathlon, so I was happy where I was at. There’s a lot of room to improve on for the conference, so I’m really excited to see a lot of spots for improvement to get a big score,” Utetch said.\n\nUtecht earned third place in the high jump with a clearance of 1.66 meters. Wydra followed closely, tying for fifth at 1.63 meters, improving on her previous jump of 1.57 and setting a personal best.\n\nUtecht finished second in the shot put with a throw of 12.13 meters. Wydra added another personal best, recording a mark of 11.76 meters.\n\nUtecht claimed first place in the long jump with a leap of 5.84 meters. Wydra placed seventh after jumping 5.35 meters.\n\nUtecht placed second in the 800 meters with a time of 2:24.75 after a worthwhile race to watch. Alongside her, Wydra finished fourth in the event, crossing the line in 2:27.28.\n\nSenior Anna Vedral placed fifth in the pole vault, clearing 3.85 meters to surpass her previous result of 3.83 meters after having two wins in her event the past two meets.\n\n“I knew that this meet was going to be competitive and I’m happy about how I placed. I think I came in sitting ninth and I finished fifth. So, I over performed where I was sitting and that’s a goal of every single meet,” Vedral said.\n\nMen’s Weight Throw Achievements \n Following his victory at the Show-Me Showdown, Sam Innes continued his strong season by winning the event with a throw of 22.67 meters, marking his second win of the year and ranking among the top three throws in school history. Garik Pozecki placed behind him with a throw of 20.49 meters, while Clayton Kamp finished seventh at 17.25 meters.\n\n“We kind of knew what we needed to work on, so we’re one step closer to that. Hopefully [we] just build on it now. We all got our eyes on the Arkansas meet in two weeks,” Innes said.\n\nWomen’s Weight Throw Highlights\n\nSophomore Reagan Kimrey took second place with a throw of 19.71 meters.

    "title": "Where will Framber Valdez finally sign? Putting all 30 teams into tiers, from no chance to the favorites",
    "description": "The top starting pitcher in this free-agent class is still available with spring training around the corner.",
    "fullText": "Pitchers and catchers are due at spring training in less than two weeks, yet several of the top free-agent arms still don’t know which complex in Arizona or Florida they’ll be reporting to. Eight of the 18 starting pitchers on our Top 50 free agents list remain unsigned with February fast approaching. Chief among them is No. 8 overall and our top hurler in the class, left-hander Framber Valdez.\n\nOver the past four seasons, Valdez ranks second in MLB in innings, behind only Logan Webb, and fifth in fWAR behind Zack Wheeler, Webb, Tarik Skubal and Kevin Gausman. Among 59 pitchers with at least 500 innings pitched during that span, Valdez’s 3.22 ERA ranks seventh, and his 3.29 FIP is ninth. His terrific sinker and top-notch curveball have consistently combined for elite groundball rates, which are clearly his headlining trait as a pitcher, rather than strikeout totals or pinpoint command.\n\nAll of this has made Valdez a rotation staple for the Houston Astros during the back half of their dynastic run atop the American League, which has afforded him ample opportunities to pitch in October. He ranks sixth among active pitchers in postseason innings (85.0) and has delivered several stellar high-stakes starts along the way, including an eight-inning effort in the 2021 ALCS and two terrific outings in the 2022 World Series. His more recent showings in 2023 and 2024 weren’t quite as effective, but Valdez is unquestionably battle-tested, and that experience should appeal to teams.\n\nSo what’s the hold up? Why would a pitcher of this caliber linger on the market this long? For starters, the number of teams willing to dole out a nine-figure deal was limited from the get-go. If Valdez and his representation are targeting a contract somewhere between what the two other top arms received (5 years, $130M for Ranger Suarez; 7 years, $210M for Dylan Cease), a wholly reasonable ask considering his track record, that immediately shrinks the pool of possible landing spots to almost exclusively big-market clubs.\n\nAge is also paramount in free agency, and Valdez, who turned 32 in November, is two years older than Cease and Suarez. Teams might question how much longer Valdez will be in his prime, particularly with him coming off his worst season as a full-time rotation member. His 2025 wasn’t a bad campaign by any stretch, but unlike in each of the previous three seasons, Valdez didn’t receive any down-ballot Cy Young votes. He also finished poorly, posting a 5.20 ERA in the second half as Houston missed the postseason for the first time since 2016.\n\nThere’s also speculation that the cross-up incident in September involving his catcher, Cesar Salazar, has made some teams wary of Valdez’s character. Whether that’s a driving factor behind hesitance to sign him is unknown, but it’s worth noting that Valdez and his agency made it a priority early in free agency to communicate to clubs about the pitcher’s makeup, crafting a video that helps tell his story and highlights his reputation as a positive presence off the field, beyond what he brings on the mound.\n\nWhatever the exact confluence of reasons that brought us to this point, it’s hard to imagine Valdez will remain unsigned for much longer. So let’s survey the entire league and contemplate possible fits for the left-hander, organized into tiers from least to most likely landing spots.\n\nHere we have a wide-ranging tier including contending teams, rebuilding teams, ascendent teams and tough-to-decipher teams. Some of these clubs could argue against signing Valdez based on the pitching personnel already in place or more urgent needs elsewhere on the roster.\n\nMore pertinently, this cohort shares the most relevant trait in any free-agency exercise: They represent the current dozen lowest payrolls in MLB, a natural distinction for determining which clubs are exceedingly unlikely to splurge on a premium free agent such as Valdez, especially one with qualifying offer attached (beyond the financial considerations, small-market clubs are often particularly reluctant to forfeit draft picks). Even as we try to expand our horizons to consider potential sleepers for Valdez, any of these teams emerging to sign the southpaw would be downright stunning.\n\nThese four contenders with payrolls ranging from medium (Seattle) to high (Boston, Toronto) to astronomical (Los Angeles) are already loaded with rotation options that make signing Valdez illogical.\n\nMaybe Detroit wins its arbitration hearing against Tarik Skubal and then, with added payroll clarity and flexibility, directs some funds to adding a formidable co-ace alongside Skubal (and perhaps a long-term replacement in the event Skubal departs next winter). That would be cool! But don’t count on it.\n\nKansas City’s rotation is already quite left-handed, but a trade of Kris Bubic for an offensive upgrade followed by a surprise signing of Valdez could transform the Royals into AL Central favorites. It’s an unlikely sequence but a fun scenario to ponder.\n\nIf owner Arte Moreno wakes up tomorrow and decides he wants to sign a top free agent, as he has on several occasions throughout his tenure, Valdez could be an Angel. But nothing about the team’s offseason activity thus far suggests that is remotely likely.\n\nTexas’ trade for MacKenzie Gore indicates a preference to spend prospect capital rather than real dollars to add to its rotation. But if the Rangers were to shed their recently thrifty tendencies and pounce, Valdez could boost their rotation from strong to elite.\n\nValdez would be an awesome addition to a Padres rotation that is perilously thin even after they retained Michael King, but all indications are that San Diego is still operating with significant budget limitations.\n\nThe Snakes could definitely use rotation help, but as long as Zac Gallen also remains unsigned, Arizona bringing him back on a new deal feels more likely than the team forfeiting a draft pick and paying way more for a fresher face.\n\nThere is an intriguing commonality among these three clubs: All three have frontline starters coming back from injury who likely won’t be ready to begin the season (Justin Steele in Chicago, Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodón in New York, Zack Wheeler in Philadelphia). The Cubs (Edward Cabrera) and Yankees (Ryan Weathers) have already made trades to fortify their starting staffs to a degree, while Philadelphia appears content to hold down the fort with its internal options until Wheeler is back.\n\nIs there still room — and time — for one of these big-market clubs to flex their financial muscles and add an impact starter anyway? Maybe!\n\nIt’s natural to circle back to the incumbent club when free agencies drag on, but at no point this offseason did it seem realistic that Valdez would stay in Houston, and the Astros have added several other arms (Tatsuya Imai, Mike Burrows, Ryan Weiss, Nate Pearson) in an effort to restock their rotation. A reunion here would be pretty shocking.\n\nThe recent acquisition of Freddy Peralta might’ve changed the calculus for New York in a possible pursuit of Valdez, as the need for a frontline starter is certainly lessened now. And you could also look at the current depth chart, which features a glut of rotation candidates, and argue that another major addition to the unit isn’t necessary. At the same time, Valdez would represent a sensible and exciting finish to New York’s dramatic offseason roster overhaul.\n\nFor all the buzz about Peralta and star rookie righty Nolan McLean, major questions persist about every other rotation candidate based on last season’s showings — and acting like McLean is a sure bet based on his limited sample might be risky. As one of the few teams with the kind of spending power to add impact talent regardless of an imperfect roster fit, the Mets shouldn’t be content with their current mound options, especially in the ultra-competitive NL East. David Stearns is reportedly reluctant to give out a long-term deal to any pitcher, but maybe owner Steve Cohen can enable a shorter-term, high-AAV offer to entice Valdez to come to Queens.\n\nAtlanta has quietly spent a healthy chunk of change this offseason as it looks to bounce back from a miserable 2025, committing more than $100 million to seven free agents to help bolster the bullpen and lineup. The rotation, meanwhile, remains untouched.\n\nThe Braves’ top four arms — Chris Sale, Spencer Schwellenbach, Spencer Strider and Reynaldo Lopez — are all wildly talented, but all have missed significant time due to injury in recent seasons. Adding Valdez, a workhorse who offers frontline upside, would be an excellent way to add some certainty to this fragile unit and is the kind of aggressive move that might be necessary if the Braves want to jump back into the NL East melee with the Phillies and Mets.\n\nThe Giants continue to communicate that they are content with their rotation after the modest additions of Tyler Mahle and Adrian Houser, but the longer this drags on, the more San Francisco looks like the team that could benefit the most from finally opening up the wallet and adding a game-changer on the mound. The Giants’ starting staff currently ranks 22nd in projected fWAR per FanGraphs’ Depth Charts. Adding Valdez — projected to be a top-15 starter in MLB — could single-handedly vault them into the top half of rotations league-wide and significantly strengthen their case as a 2026 playoff team.\n\nPairing Valdez with ace Logan Webb would also give them arguably the two best groundball pitchers in the sport, a duo who could thrive with terrific infielders Matt Chapman and Willy Adames playing behind them. The Cubs and Red Sox eventually quieted their critics by acting like the big-market clubs they are and making splashes in free agency, and there’s still time for the Giants to do the same. And unlike Chicago and Boston, who are coming off postseason appearances, San Francisco should have even more urgency to do so, considering its complete lack of relevance in the NL playoff picture since its outlier 107-win campaign in 2021.\n\nThis team has been the most obvious Valdez match for months. President of baseball operations Mike Elias has plenty of familiarity with Valdez, having been in Houston’s front office during his rise to the majors, and now Elias is heading an Orioles club that hasn’t been shy about its intentions to bolster its rotation this winter.\n\nTrading for Shane Baz was an important step in that direction, but that move didn’t satisfy Baltimore’s need to acquire a pitcher it could feel confident giving the ball for a postseason start — and adding Valdez would. To be clear, this Orioles offseason should be considered a success even without Valdez, but adding the left-hander would emphatically punctuate a winter spent strengthening virtually every portion of the roster.\n\nUntil Valdez signs elsewhere, this is the match we’ll be waiting to see come to fruition.",

    "description": "The Dodgers added experienced bullpen depth by signing right-hander Ryder Ryan to a minor league contract ahead of the 2026 season.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers have continued to reinforce their pitching depth by agreeing to a minor league contract with right-hander Ryder Ryan, according to reports, with the deal including an $800,000 salary if he reaches the Major League roster.\n\nThe Dodgers have signed the brother of RHP River Ryan, Ryder Ryan, to a minor league deal, sources tell @TheAthletic.\n\nRyan was signed to the Pittsburgh Pirates, but spent 2025 in Triple-A, posting a 4.73 ERA in 72 IP.\n\nIf he makes the majors, he will earn $800k.\n\n— Adrian Medina (@AdrianMedina_16) January 30, 2026\n\nWhile the signing does not immediately impact the Dodgers’ crowded bullpen picture, it provides the organization with another experienced arm as spring training approaches.\n\nRyan, 30, is the older brother of Dodgers right-hander River Ryan and has pitched parts of two Major League seasons. He appeared with the Seattle Mariners in 2023 and the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2024, combining for 21 2/3 innings at the big league level.\n\nDuring that stretch, Ryan posted a 5.40 ERA, allowing 13 runs on 21 hits and 10 walks while striking out 19 hitters. Though his MLB sample size is limited, he has spent much of his professional career serving as reliable upper-minors depth.\n\nThe 2025 season saw Ryan pitch exclusively at Triple-A Indianapolis in the Pirates organization. Over 72 1/3 innings, he recorded a 4.73 ERA with a 19.7 percent strikeout rate and a 12.3 percent walk rate.\n\nThat campaign marked his fifth season at the Triple-A level, where he owns a career 4.42 ERA across more than 270 innings, highlighting his role as a durable reliever capable of handling a heavy workload.\n\nFrom a pitch-mix standpoint, Ryan relies primarily on a fastball-slider combination. His four-seam fastball and sinker both averaged around 93 mph last season and were used frequently, but his slider remains his primary weapon, accounting for nearly half of his pitches. He also mixes in an occasional changeup, giving him enough variety to navigate lineups multiple times in relief appearances.\n\nCracking the Dodgers’ Major League bullpen will be a challenge. Los Angeles enters the season with several established relievers locked into roster spots, limiting immediate opportunities for non-roster invitees. As a result, Ryan is likely to begin the year at Triple-A Oklahoma City, where he could provide valuable depth alongside his younger brother.\n\nGiven the Dodgers’ history of cycling arms throughout a long season, Ryan’s signing fits a familiar pattern. While he may not be penciled into a major role early, his experience and durability could prove useful as the organization manages injuries and workload over the course of the 2026 campaign.",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A federal judge warned Justice Department lawyers on Friday that they were making “dangerous” and “horrifying” statements when they said the Trump Administration can decide what part of American history to display at National Park Service sites.\n\nThe sharp exchange erupted during a hearing in Philadelphia over the abrupt removal of an exhibit on the history of slavery at the site of the former President’s House on Independence Mall.\n\nThe city, which worked in tandem with the park service on the exhibit two decades ago, was stunned to find workers this month using crowbars to remove outdoor plaques, panels and other materials that told the stories of the nine people who had been enslaved there. Some of the history had only been unearthed in the past quarter-century.\n\n“You can’t erase history once you’ve learned it. It doesn’t work that way,” said Senior U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe, an appointee of President George W. Bush.\n\nThe removal followed President Donald Trump’s executive order “restoring truth and sanity to American history” at the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks. In Philadelphia, the materials were put in a pickup truck and then into storage, leading Rufe to voice concerns about whether they were damaged.\n\n“Although many people feel strongly about this (exhibit) one way, other people may disagree or feel strongly another way,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory in den Berken.\n\n“Ultimately,” he said, “the government gets to choose the message it wants to convey.”\n\n“That is a dangerous statement you are making. It is horrifying to listen to,” she said. “It changes on the whims of someone in charge? I’m sorry, that is not what we elected anybody for.”\n\nRufe heard hours of testimony Friday from former city officials who had helped plan the exhibit, and said the city had kicked in $1.5 million toward the project. She plans to visit both the storage area and the site before ruling on the city’s request to have the exhibit restored. But she asked the Justice Department lawyers to ensure that nothing else is disturbed.\n\nIn den Berken said the Park Service routinely changes its exhibits and tours, and argued that the government cannot be forced to tell a certain story. But lawyers for the city and other advocates said the park service does not have “carte blanche” to interpret the nation’s history as it sees fit.\n\nThe exhibit includes biographical details about the nine people enslaved by George and Martha Washington at the presidential mansion. Now, only their names — Austin, Paris, Hercules, Christopher Sheels, Richmond, Giles, Oney Judge, Moll and Joe — remain engraved into a cement wall.\n\nMichael Coard, an attorney representing one of the advocacy groups supporting the exhibit, said the president was ignoring the power held by Congress, the judiciary and the American people.\n\n“It’s one thing to whisper that type of dictatorial power. But to send lawyers into a public courtroom to make that argument is absolutely frightening,” he said. “I'm really worried about the state of America.”\n\nRufe said she planned to rule quickly, noting the surge of visitors expected to visit the nation's birthplace this year to mark its 250th anniversary of being founded.\n\nResidents who have visited the site have shed tears, left flowers and left a handmade sign that said “Slavery was real.”",

    "description": "Here are the latest details in the legal dispute.",
    "fullText": "Nearly nine months after a country music legend's son and daughter-in-law were slapped with a lawsuit over squirmy construction payout claims, the San Antonio-based builder and George Strait Jr. and his wife, Tamara, struck a closed-door deal to get the matter out of court. Though, both parties are sitting silent on the terms of the resolution.\n\nOn May 5, Build Modern – a San Antonio firm responsible for several modern builds around the center of San Antonio – the junior Strait and wife to task in Kendall County district court. Build Modern Owner David Robertson accused to couple of more than $100,000 in damages when he said they refused to pay for services, ending their contract with a negative balance due to delays he says they caused.\n\nNow, the local builder is withdrawing his suit after months of private remediation efforts.\n\n\"[Build Modern] and all defendants have resolved all claims between them at this time, [Build Modern] no longer wishes to pursue his claims against all defendants, Tamara Strait, George Strait Jr., and Heritage Oaks Trust, through its trustee, Kalyn Carroll,\" Robertson's order to withdrawal his lawsuit reads, filed in Kendall County north of San Antonio in early January.\n\nA judge signed the order two days after filing on January 8. MySA spoke with a representative for both parties, and both declined to comment on the case resolution. So, details behind the deal struck between the two remains a mystery.\n\nHowever, previous court filings show Build Modern was seeking at least the $57,000 it claims is for unpaid construction services and $67,662 left in the contractual balance, totaling $124,662. Robertson also wanted the Straits and the trust to pay for costs accrued in the lawsuit and exemplary damages in an amount determined by a jury.\n\nIt was at the behest of George (\"Bubba\") and Tamara Strait that the case went to a private arbitration. The couple and their attorneys pointed to a common clause in the remodel project – one which was penned between Build Modern and the couple to remodel their Texas Hill Country home – which requires some form of mediation or arbitration effort prior to filing a lawsuit.\n\nThat arbitration order was signed by a judge on June 3, meaning private negotiations over settling the dispute lasted about seven months.\n\nAccording to court documents filed before a judge ordered private remediation, the renovation project was to cost $221,225, and was expected to wrap up by November 1 of 2024. However, the company said Tamara Strait made several decisions that delayed the completion, including ordering backordered cabinets that weren't slated for delivery until December, reneging on a flooring with delayed delivery after it was already partially installed and hiring her own subcontractors that were supposed to be included in the contract with Build Modern.\n\n\"Tamara Strait engaged in a series of actions which resulted in economic damage to [Build Modern] and made it impossible for [the company] to complete the project in a timely manner,\" the firm asserts. \"Most importantly, she repeatedly delayed making payment when payment requests were presented to her.\"\n\nAfter allegedly failing to make several scheduled payments, reportedly hiring subcontractors out from under Build Modern and delaying the process, the lawsuit accuses the Straits of colluding with Heritage Oaks Trust to end the contract in December because the project exceeded the November 1 deadline. Build Modern says Tamara Strait was \"fully aware\" of the updated project timeline and why it had to be pushed back.\n\nThis article originally published at George Strait's son, daughter-in-law quietly settle lawsuit after mediation.",

    "description": "Scientists are keeping a close eye.",
    "fullText": "A vivid blue iceberg drifting from Antarctica is drawing scientific attention, as meltwater spreading across its surface shows the iceberg — once the world's largest — is beginning to break apart.\n\nIceberg A-23A broke off Antarctica's Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986, according to NASA. After spending decades largely stationary, it is now drifting through the South Atlantic between South America's eastern tip and South Georgia Island.\n\nAt the time of its calving, the iceberg spanned about 4,000 square kilometers, nearly twice the size of Rhode Island. However, satellite data from the U.S. National Ice Center has shown it has shrunk to roughly 1,182 square kilometers following a significant breakup in mid-2025.\n\nWhat especially concerns scientists is the iceberg's striking blue color. NASA researchers said that hue comes from meltwater pooling on the surface.\n\nSunlight passing through the waterlogged ice absorbs red light and reflects blue light back, a clear sign that the iceberg is thinning and weakening.\n\nThese changes suggest this once-massive iceberg may not last much longer. As retired scientist Chris Shuman put it, \"I certainly don't expect A-23A to last through the austral summer.\"\n\nThe breakup of massive icebergs like A-23A doesn't stay confined to Antarctica. While the melting of a floating iceberg doesn't directly raise sea levels, scientists view breakups like A-23A's as warning signs of growing instability in Antarctica's ice system — particularly ice shelves that help hold back land-based glaciers that contribute to rising sea levels.\n\nMelting ice also disrupts ocean systems that marine life relies on. Shifts in temperature and salinity can push fish into new regions or reduce populations, threatening seafood supplies and the livelihoods of fishermen. In some areas, warmer waters may also allow harmful bacteria and diseases to spread more easily.\n\nScientists have already documented Antarctic ice shelves becoming slushy and unstable. Likewise, Antarctica's plant life is expanding due to rising temperatures.\n\nTogether, these changes contribute to more extreme weather, putting pressure on public health, community safety, and local economies.\n\nScientists are keeping a close eye on icebergs like A-23A with satellite imagery, which helps them see how quickly ice loss can reshape oceans and coastlines.\n\nWould you feel safe living close to a nuclear power plant?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThose insights inform planning efforts for coastal communities already dealing with higher seas and more destructive storms.\n\nWhat happens at the poles isn't as far removed from daily life as it seems. Decisions about energy systems and long-term infrastructure influence how quickly warming trends continue — and how prepared communities are for the changes already underway.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Copper prices hit a record high on Thursday, but reversed on Friday. Goldman Sachs thinks a larger correction could come in mid-2026.",
    "fullText": "Copper has joined the metals party in recent weeks and is now selling off in sympathy with gold and silver, pulling back from recent highs and potentially headed for a larger correction in the coming months.\n\nAfter touching a record above $14,000 per ton on Thursday, copper dropped sharply to around $13,800 on Friday, in line with downward moves in precious metals. While copper is mainly an industrial metal, it's seen dizzying price spirals similar to those that have sent gold and silver surging to new highs in the last year.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts, who recently lifted their copper price target for the first half of 2026, have warned that a second-quarter correction is ahead.\n\nThe analysts said in a note this week that a US tariff decision on copper could trigger a deeper drawdown for the metal. Goldman expects an update on refined copper to come by mid-2026.\n\nPresident Trump declared a 50% tariff on all imports of semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products in July 2025, fueling stockpiling in the US.\n\nThe analysts expect a refined copper tariff mid-2026, which would \"likely signal the end of US stockpiling and return focus to the global market surplus.\"\n\nCopper has been riding the broader move in metals, alongside gold and silver, influenced by investors turning to commodities amid worries about geopolitical worries, including ongoing US-China trade tensions and a US Dollar moves.\n\nCopper's recent run-up has also been fueled in part by durable demand for the metal, in particular, its role in the AI infrastructure buildout.\n\nJosé Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider that \"part of the enthusiasm\" around copper is \"due to nationalistic tailwinds, as investors in Beijing want to hold the asset that its country could use more of in the competitive AI race\" rather than concrete demand.\n\nCopper's recent rise has been driven in large part by speculative trading rather than the metal's fundamentals, with traders in China leading the charge.\n\n\"It's become quite evident that the surge in copper prices has been increasingly fueled by speculation, rather than strong underlying fundamentals,\" Capital Economics senior commodities economist Kieran Tompkins told Business Insider.\n\n\"This is particularly the case in China, where indicators of the health of underlying demand suggest it is actually quite soft,\" Tompkins added, noting the recent price action signals \"a disconnect between the underlying balance of supply and demand.\"\n\nGoldman commodities analyst Eoin Dinsmore said the price of copper has \"overshot its fair fundamental level,\" and a refined copper tariff from Trump could be a \"catalyst for a correction.\"\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also raised valuation concerns, stating that the dynamics of copper supply and demand suggest the metal \"is trading at nosebleed levels.\"\n\nAnalysts have expressed similar concerns for both gold and silver, which have rallied sharply in the last year. Some fear the gains have become detached from the usual fundamental drivers of the metals' price, with experts eyeing a rally driven mainly by FOMO similar to meme stocks.",

    "fullText": "Sporting goods retailers, including the broader hunting and fishing category, have struggled over the past few years. That's at least partially because the internet has nibbled away at their sales.\n\nAs a casual tennis player, for example, I used to have to go to a sporting goods retailer if I needed tennis balls, which created the possibility that I might buy something else. That's a small sale lost for the retailer, but also a larger opportunity to convert a purchase into something bigger.\n\n\"Research estimates a nearly 4% decline in spending at brick-and-mortar stores because of the rise of e-commerce,\" according to a Stanford University research report written in 2017.\n\nOnline spending has roughly doubled to 15.8% in the third quarter of 2025 since that report study was conducted, according to Census.gov's quarterly retail online sales report released in December 2025.\n\nRetail foot traffic also dipped by 1.4% to recreational and sporting goods stores in 2024, according to Placer.ai data, while overall retail foot traffic across all retail climbed by 0.4%.\n\nLower foot traffic and not having a high-end online presence has meant the end for a number of sporting goods and outdoors brands over the past year.\n\nNow Big Rock Sports has joined that list by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nWhile it's not a household name, Big Rock Sports was a major player behind the scenes as a distributor. The company shared some of its business model on its now-defunct website, which was visited through the Internet Archive.\n\n\"Big Rock Sports carries over 200,000 product SKUs and services more than 20,000 fishing, shooting, camping, taxidermy and marine retailers across the US, Canada, the Caribbean and eight other countries,\" the company shared.\n\nThe distributor had a long history.\n\n\"The history of Big Rock Sports goes back more than 60 years to the founding of All-Sports Supply in Portland, OR. At that time, sporting goods was a much more personal business, and distributors knew the names of their retailers as well as their families,\" it added.\n\n(All Star Sports was founded in 1995, making Big Rock Sports history go back 71 years.)\n\nThe company specialized in firearms, firearm accessories, and fishing gear.\n\nBig Rock Sports, LLC filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of North Carolina, according to BKAlerts.com.\n\nThe Chapter 7 filing was voluntary and is being handled by a court‑appointed trustee, according to documents filed on PacerMonitor.\n\nThe case, under case # 5:26-bk-00208 is being overseen by Judge Joseph N. Callaway, added PacerMonitor.\n\nAs of the filing, the case is listed as “no asset,” indicating limited or no estate assets available for distribution, reported BKAlerts.com.\n\nBig Rock’s operations included numerous trade names and divisions in the sporting goods and outdoor supply space, according to Inforuptcy.\n\nPrior to the Chapter 7 filing, related Canadian operations were liquidated, all employees were terminated, and inventory was being sold off under a liquidation process, added Isolvency Insider Canada.\n\nSecured lenders (e.g., bank agents) and unsecured creditors are not expected to be fully repaid given the company’s limited realizable assets, added Isolvency Insider Canada.",

    "fullText": "To borrow a phrase from HBO's \"Industry,\" you have to let a journalist fulfill her function.\n\nThe show, which follows a group of hard-partying London investment bankers, is now airing its fourth season on HBO Max. I followed its cast and showrunners as they made two stops on their promo tour on Thursday: first to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange, then to party in a Brooklyn warehouse with New York's content creators and young professionals.\n\nHere's my not-so-typical Thursday evening from Wall Street to East Williamsburg with the cast of the hit show.\n\nMyha'la swung the mallet to close the day of trading.\n\nJosh is also known as Tell the Bees on Substack and TikTok, where he analyzes episodes of \"Industry.\" Rose writes Mall Goth on Substack and penned the novel \"Best Woman.\"\n\nWe were on our second DJ of the night.",

    "description": "Twanna Harris explains the emotional and financial challenges of parenting NFL athletes and why she founded League of Industry Moms.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Twanna Harris, the founder of League of Industry Moms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a mom to two athletes. Between my husband and me, we have four kids, two sons and two daughters. William, my oldest, has played for the Washington Commanders for seven years. My son Trey is what we call our \"next kid up.\" He is at Sam Houston State University, and he's started training for the NFL draft.\n\nMy husband played in the NFL, so I believe our family is uniquely equipped to navigate this process and provide structure and discipline.\n\nHowever, there were things that surprised me, even though I was not expecting them.\n\nInjuries are actually the last thing I'm worried about.\n\nI am the one who has guided my sons to where they are today. I researched programs, coordinated the move to other schools when necessary, identified trainers, researched colleges that provide the best opportunity, and provided the necessary financial, emotional, and mental support to properly navigate the transition from high school to college, in preparation for making it to the pros.\n\nWhen going through that transition, I felt like the sentiment was, \"Thanks so much for your contribution, but we'll take it from here.\" There weren't conversations with us parents about how to navigate and sustain salaries once they went pros, for example.\n\nAdditionally, I didn't get any coaching or direction on how to choose the best advisor or counsel for your athlete's specific situation.\n\nI helped one of my sons go through a rough patch, which had isolating moments, and I knew I couldn't be the only mother trying to figure this out by myself. This drove my desire for community, and after speaking with numerous mothers of athletes, I quickly realized that what I experienced was more of the norm than the exception.\n\nBecause there's no blueprint or guidebook, I launched my collective, League of Industry Moms, to crowdsource support and resources to help us navigate this terrain together.\n\nWe look into everything from media training to financial literacy, such as how kids should set up their finances for when they are 50, and helping them understand the significance of their spending for the next five years.\n\nTypically, a kid is not celebrated daily for their job. But because my kids are athletes, they are — and are receiving death threats at the same time. Nothing feels real anymore, and it feels like everyone's coming to get a piece of your child. One day, we're in this together as a family, and the next, your kid is saying, \"Hey Mom, I'm an adult now, I don't need your permission to take a $425,000 check.\"\n\nBecause they are legally adults, there's no requirement for brands to speak with parents. There can be a false sense of reality here because, early on, players receive a substantial amount of resources, attention, and money. There's no player association or union, so I've partnered with an organization called athletes.org to make sure we are educating parents going through this.\n\nMy husband and I have raised our kids to be extraordinarily independent. The whole point is to raise kids to be self-sufficient, but this is a different kind of survival. Someone whose frontal lobe has yet to develop is being handed a check for millions, and they are expected to have the wherewithal to know what to do with that.\n\nThe most important thing my husband and I wanted to teach our athletes is the art of listening and the discernment gained through that process to detect when someone might be motivated by the wrong intentions or when something they are saying simply doesn't sound right.",

    "title": "A home theater expert shares 8 upgrades to make for the ultimate Super Bowl watch party",
    "description": "The Super Bowl is the perfect excuse to upgrade your home theater. These extra-large TVs and powerful soundbars are ideal for watching the big game.",
    "fullText": "The Super Bowl is just around the corner, making it the perfect time to upgrade your home theater. But piecing together a new system can be daunting, which is why I'm here to help. I've been reviewing video and audio gear for over a decade, so I know exactly what you need to put together a killer setup for the big game.\n\nFrom extra-large TVs and Dolby Atmos soundbars to spacious media consoles and affordable digital antennas, I've rounded up all the home theater essentials needed for an immersive Super Bowl watch party. Many top Super Bowl TVs and soundbars are also on sale, so you can score solid discounts ahead of kick-off.\n\nAnd though most of my picks are available with speedy Amazon Prime delivery, be sure to check the shipment estimates to ensure they arrive in time for the game on February 8.\n\nThe central piece of any killer Super Bowl setup is a big-screen TV. There are several great displays available, but two models stand out for their overall value and performance when watching sports: the TCL QM7K QLED and the Samsung S95F OLED.\n\nThe QM7K is a fantastic midrange TV with excellent brightness for the money. It's also available in massive screen sizes, including a surprisingly affordable 98-inch model. Meanwhile, the S95F is a premium TV with higher contrast, wider viewing angles, and the most effective anti-glare screen I've seen. Those features make it ideal for watch parties, as all your guests get a high-quality view no matter where they sit.\n\nYou can learn more about both models in our guide to the best sports TVs. And for more display recommendations, check out our guide to all the best TVs you can buy.\n\nThe TCL QM7K is an excellent midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED backlight delivers high brightness, and it has better contrast control and wider viewing angles than older models.\n\nThe S95F is Samsung's latest flagship 4K TV. It's one of the top high-end displays available, utilizing an advanced QD-OLED panel with a matte anti-glare screen.\n\nGreat picture quality is only one part of an immersive gameday upgrade. Nothing makes it feel like you're actually in the stadium quite like the sound of cheering fans coming from all directions. And that's where a good soundbar comes in.\n\nIf you have the room for a multi-piece system, I recommend the high-end Samsung Q990F. This package includes a soundbar, dedicated rear speakers, and a wireless subwoofer. The Super Bowl is being streamed in Dolby Atmos this year, and the Q990F supports that format. Atmos enables a 3D surround-sound effect with audio spread around and above your ears. If you want a more affordable and compact option, the stand-alone Bose Smart Soundbar is also a good buy. It's not as powerful as the Q990F, but it still supports Dolby Atmos and creates a wide sense of immersion for its space-saving size.\n\nYou can learn more about both models in our guides to the best soundbars and best Dolby Atmos soundbars.\n\nThe Q990F is Samsung's latest flagship soundbar system. It includes everything you need for a complete 11.1.4-channel Dolby Atmos surround sound experience with powerful audio and plenty of wireless music streaming options.\n\nThe new Bose Smart Soundbar is a refreshed version of the brand's Smart Soundbar 600. It carries over the same design and excellent Dolby Atmos audio performance while adding an AI enhanced dialogue mode and the ability to use Bose Ultra Open Earbuds as rear speakers.\n\nIf you're buying a new home theater setup for the Super Bowl and need a place to put your TV or other entertainment devices, a reliable media console is a worthwhile investment. Our guide to the best TV stands features several recommendations for different spaces and budgets, including two options that I use myself: The Walker Edison Wren and Ikea Brimnes.\n\nI have the Walker Edison Wren in my living room, and I love its simple style and large, open cubbies, which are perfect for storing components like an AV receiver or game console, while still allowing for good airflow. Meanwhile, I keep the Brimnes in my office and like its sleek design and handy storage drawers. Both stands are also wide enough to accommodate most TV models in sizes up to 85 inches.\n\nThis TV console from Walker Edison is wide enough for TVs as big as 80 inches. It’s available in different wood tones and has six open-storage compartments.\n\nIkea’s Brimnes stand has a wide design that can accommodate larger TVs, and it has three drawers for ample storage space.\n\nFor a cleaner look, you could opt to wall-mount your TV instead of placing it on a stand. Our guide to the best TV wall mounts includes options for every budget. In particular, I recommend the Sanus Vlf728 and Mounting Dream MD2268 for most needs.\n\nThe Sanus is the pricier option, but it offers full motion so you can extend the TV from the wall, tilt, and swivel it. This is super-handy if you need to reposition the screen for watch parties so guests get a better view. It also supports screens up to 90 inches and up to 125 pounds. Meanwhile, the Mounting Dream is a good budget option, but it's more limited. It can only tilt and is rated for TVs up to 75 inches.\n\nThis full-motion mount is pricey but can extend a whopping 28 inches, tilt 15 degrees, and swivel 57 degrees from left to right.\n\nThis affordable TV mount is built for screens up to 75 inches and allows you to tilt the screen down as much as eight degrees.\n\nThe Super Bowl is being broadcast on NBC this year, which means you can tune in with a simple digital TV antenna — no paid subscription required. NBC is offered as a free local channel via over-the-air broadcast towers in most areas. All you need to do is ensure you get a good signal at your location and hook up an antenna to the coaxial port on your TV. You can check channels available in your area through sites like Atennaweb.org.\n\nI recommend the Channel Master Flat Antenna for most needs. It's affordable and features a slim design that sticks right on your wall. If you prefer an option that you can rest on a media console, the Mohu Gateway Plus includes a tabletop base. It also has an amplifier, which could improve reception in locations farther from broadcast towers. You can find more recommendations in our guide to the best indoor TV antennas.\n\nChannel Master's FLATenna 35 Duo is one of the most affordable antennas on the market, and it delivers great reception for local channels.\n\nRather than wall-mounting it, this sleek, amplified antenna is designed to rest on any surface near your TV.\n\nIf you prefer to stream the game, you can watch the Super Bowl via Peacock or any live TV service that includes NBC. Peacock plans start at $8 a month, but you need Premium ($11 a month) or Premium Plus ($17 a month) to stream live sports. In addition to the Super Bowl, Peacock is home to tons of NBCUniversal shows and movies, as well as originals produced exclusively for the service. Meanwhile, for those who want a full cord-cutting alternative to cable, I recommend DirecTV. This live TV streaming service offers NBC across various packages, along with tons of other channels. Plans with NBC start at $40 a month.\n\nYou can learn more about Peacock in our Peacock TV guide, and you can learn more about DirecTV in our guide to the best live TV streaming services.\n\nPeacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nAll modern smart TVs have a built-in streaming platform, but the interface that comes with your TV may not be your preferred one. That's where a stand-alone streaming player could come in handy as an upgrade. For instance, if you're eying Samsung's S95F but aren't a fan of the brand's Tizen interface, you can simply buy a Roku, Google streamer, or Fire TV to handle all your Super Bowl streaming needs instead.\n\nMy favorite of the bunch is the Roku Ultra, since it supports every major video and audio format, offers a simple, snappy layout, and comes with a great remote that features backlit keys, hands-free voice search, a location chime, and a rechargeable battery. But if you're plugged into Amazon's ecosystem and want a more compact dongle-style streamer, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is a more affordable option that plugs directly into your TV's HDMI port.\n\nYou can learn more about both models in our guide to the best streaming players.\n\nThe 2024 edition of the Roku Ultra has a new processor for speedier performance. It also comes with an updated remote with backlit keys and USB-C charging. Like previous models, this flagship streaming device supports 4K playback with HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision.\n\nThis is Amazon's top streaming stick. With its powerful processor and GPU, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is the fastest streaming device in its price range and now supports console-free Xbox gaming via Game Pass.\n\nIf you're building a home theater, there's no such thing as having too many HDMI cables. These cords are what you'll use to connect soundbars, media players, gaming consoles, and other A/V devices to your TV. Luckily, reliable cables are relatively cheap, with most six-foot cords costing about $7 to $10.\n\nI recommend opting for ultra-high-speed HDMI cables, like the Amazon Basics 48Gbps cable. This type of cable has the bandwidth to support HDMI 2.1 features like 4K/120Hz and variable refresh rate (VRR). Though those functions are only needed for gaming devices, ultra-high-speed cables cost about the same as other HDMI options, and it's best to future-proof now in case you ever need the extra speed. I also like these braided HDMI cables from Highwings, since they're built to withstand bends and wear.\n\nYou can find more specialized options in our guide to the best HDMI cables.\n\nThe AmazonBasics HDMI cable is inexpensive, available in different lengths, and supports the vast majority of modern devices.\n\nThis ultra-high-speed HDMI cable has a rugged design with anti-break SR ports and a durable, nylon-braided, tangle-free construction.",

    "description": "YouTube pulled down over a dozen AI \"spam\" channels as it looks to protect platform quality and preserve its premium pitch to TV marketers.",
    "fullText": "YouTube is telling advertisers it's the future of TV. AI spam could put that story in jeopardy.\n\nThe video platform recently shut down just over a dozen popular accounts that had been churning out AI content — featuring characters like cats and Jesus — according to an analysis from Kapwing, a video editing platform. Some of the channels were picking up millions of views before going dark.\n\nIn November, Kapwing published a report that estimated 21% YouTube's feed was AI-generated videos.\n\n\"YouTube doesn't allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community,\" a YouTube spokesperson said when reached for comment on the removals.\n\nThis month, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said cutting down on low-quality AI content was one of the platform's 2026 priorities.\n\n\"To reduce the spread of low-quality AI content, we're actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combating spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low-quality, repetitive content,\" he said.\n\nIts parent company, Google, is one of the main innovators in AI with products like Veo 3 and Nano Banana. But YouTube needs to balance its embrace of AI with its case to brands to buy ads on its platform instead of linear TV. In recent years, the company has hosted NewFronts, content showcases, and other events to highlight its premium content slate to marketers. If repetitive AI spam gobbles up more watch time, that pitch could start to lose its luster.\n\n\"Advertisers want to advertise against quality content,\" said Shira Lazar, a content creator and founder of the media brand What's Trending. YouTube wouldn't be able to charge premium ad rates \"if the platform was just filled with AI slop,\" she said.\n\nOther social entertainment apps like TikTok and Instagram are facing a similar flood of AI videos.\n\nTikTok even added a special toggle that lets users decide how much generative AI they see in their feed. Neither company is making as direct an appeal for TV ad budgets, though, even if Instagram hopes it can capture television eyeballs.\n\nYouTube, meanwhile, is the top streaming platform among US TV viewers, beating out streamers like Netflix and Disney in measurement firm Nielsen's December analysis.",

    "description": "Chinos walk the fine line between formal and casual, making them ideal for the office. Here are our top-tested pairs for business casual men's styling.",
    "fullText": "Suits are an easy choice when the dress code calls for formal attire, but they can be overkill in business-casual settings. You need wardrobe staples that'll cover your bases for when the stakes aren't quite as high, and that's where the best chinos for men come in.\n\nInvesting in the best business casual work clothes for men will inevitably include a reliable pair of chinos, so we've listed the top pairs, including those we've tested ourselves, to help you find what are sure to be your next favorite pants to live in. A tried-and-true favorite is the Bonobos Chinos 2.0, and for a more affordable option, we recommend the Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino.\n\nBonobos' trued and true chinos have a luxe feel that adds instant polish to your wardrobe.\n\nThe lightweight performance fabric has the subtle texture of a wool dress pant, but feels like your favorite yoga pant. Designed to look clean on the leg in a fit that tapers at the hem and sits neatly on the shoe.\n\nThis pair is made-to-measure and can be customized with interchangeable pockets, pleats, and button details.\n\nThe Bonobos Chinos 2.0 are highly regarded as among the best chinos for men for their super-luxe feel. The Italian milled cotton is soft and retains a vibrant hue, even after several rounds through the washing machine. A major perk is the option to choose from a wide range of colors, shapes and sizes. These range from 28 to 46 for waist, and from 28 to 36 for inseam lengths. You can choose between a tailored, slim, slim tapered, or athletic fit. Then, you can take your pick of 16 colors. These are more polished-looking chinos with crisp lines, but are worth having for a variety of occasions between business-casual and formal events.\n\nThe Quince direct-to-consumer business model makes their prices competitive, despite the quality of its apparel exceeding our expectations for basic wardrobe essentials. The Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino's value will become apparent the more you wear them, with a four-way stretch twill that provides the same flexibility as you'd expect from joggers. Plus, they're wrinkle-resistant, so you can pull them out as needed. Chinos that are this deceptively comfortable mean you can get the most use out of them anywhere along the spectrum of casual to semi-formal. \n\nRead our full Quince review.\n\nAs you may be able to guess from the brand's name, Indochino makes some of the best chinos for men. A fitting expert from one of their many showrooms can tell you your precise size in the Houndslow chinos, but if you can't make it to a storefront, their site has an in-depth tutorial on home measuring. Once you've found your perfect fit, you can further personalize them with custom pleats, hems, pockets, buttons, and belt loops. At $99, the Houndslows are also a great value for the high-quality, perfectly sized chinos you're guaranteed by going through their detailed fit screening. \n\nRead our full Indochino chinos review.\n\nPublic Rec is known for making menswear that's polished enough for the office, but comfortable enough for everyday life, and the Dealmaker Chinos do exactly that.\n\nSimilar to the wildly popular Gamechanger Rec Pant, the Dealmaker Chinos are incredibly stretchy, wrinkle-resistant, and thanks to its The Workday 2.0 Fabric, they're also wind- and water-resistant for all-season wear.\n\nThe Public Rec Dealmaker Chinos have a classic dressy look about them, yet can move with you in all directions of daily life.\n\nWoodies Clothing took off with their high-tech dress shirts, but their super comfortable chinos have thrived in the men's workwear space, too. They can be personalized with different combinations of custom pleats, pockets, and hems. The Woodies Premium Performance Stretch Pants are amid the best chinos for people unwilling to return to stiff slacks after living in work-from-home attire. What feels almost like joggers are really formal-presenting pants that are easy to style through every season. Their soft, two-way stretch, quick drying fabric is remarkably stain repellent — just the right chinos for the accident prone.\n\nRead our full Woodies performance chinos and dress shirt review.\n\nFor many men who shop big and tall sizes, finding comfortable formal wear can pose a serious challenge. But dressing up with an athletic build doesn't have to mean feeling squeezed into a suit all day — Dockers' Ultimate Chinos will assure you that. These come in extended waist sizes with extra room in the seat and thighs so as to not constrict you, even when you're sitting for long periods of time. The four-way Smart 360 Flex™ material allows for more mobility, and the extended inseam lengths position the knee correctly before tapering off towards the hem.\n\nAs one of the undeniable symbols of Americana, Polo Ralph Lauren offers the best men's chinos, high-quality and ultimately timeless. The heritage brand offers its Stretch Slim Fit Chinos in a trim silhouette that sits low on the waist. Despite being slim from top to bottom, the cotton and elastane blend makes them soft and lightweight instead of too compressed, the way other slim fits can feel. A bonus of the slim fit is how well they factor into a high-low outfit — sleek dressy pants paired with an oversized sweater is a simple way to create a balanced contrast.\n\nMany designs from Alex Mill are uniform and minimalistic, with nuances only shown in the details. Their unisex cropped chinos are standard at first glance, but their prominent pleats, neatly cropped hems, and \"X\" belt loops give them a subtle edge on the average pair of dress pants. These have a relaxed fit that allows for slight stretching, and each pair comes in unique color variations according to their natural dye process.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNeanderthals purposefully collected and positioned horned and antlered animal skulls in a cave in what is now Spain, suggesting that these extinct human relatives had complex cultural practices over 43,000 years ago, a new study finds.\n\nDes-Cubierta cave in central Iberia was initially discovered in 2009. In 2023, researchers announced the unusual discovery of an assortment of 35 large mammal skulls inside the cave. Most jaw bones were missing, but all skulls came from horned or antlered species like steppe bison and aurochs. Over 1,400 stone tools were uncovered in the same level, all in the Mousterian style typical of Neanderthals.\n\n\"At first glance, the deposit appears chaotic,\" study first author Lucía Villaescusa Fernández, a doctoral researcher in archaeology at the University of Alcalá in Spain, told Live Science in an email. \"What initially looked like a disorganised accumulation of materials turned out to preserve a clear record of both geological processes and human activity,\" she said.\n\nThe cave experienced many rockfalls in the millennia following its use, so Villaescusa Fernández and her team teased the role of these disturbances apart from the Neanderthal activity. This confirmed the Neanderthals were collecting animal skulls over a long period of time in particularly cold periods between 135,000 and 43,000 years ago, according to a study published Jan. 3 in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.\n\n\"This distinction is essential in archaeology because understanding past human behaviour requires first identifying which parts of the archaeological record were created by people and which were shaped by nature,\" Villaescusa Fernández said.\n\nTo fill this gap, Villaescusa Fernández and her colleagues carefully mapped the location of all the archaeological remains. They then compared the rockfall debris distribution with that of the animal bones and stone tools. It became clear that the bones had been purposefully positioned within the cave. \"These materials had different origins and were not introduced into the cave by the same processes,\" Villaescusa Fernández said.\n\nAlthough the timescale cannot be directly measured, and the precise duration of the practice remains uncertain, the team also found the animal skulls had been placed in specific areas of the cave repeatedly over a prolonged period of time. This suggests that this practice may have been maintained over generations and was not directly tied to economic or subsistence needs, Villaescusa Fernández said.\n\n—Crimean Stone Age 'crayons' were used by Neanderthals for symbolic drawings, study claims\n\n—Paleolithic 'art sanctuary' in Spain contains more than 110 prehistoric cave paintings\n\n—125,000-year-old 'fat factory' run by Neanderthals discovered in Germany\n\nExactly why Neanderthals collected the skulls is unclear, but the selection, treatment and placement of horned animal skulls in a cave they did not live in \"highlights their capacity for cultural practices that are not directly related to survival,\" Villaescusa Fernández said. \"This has important implications for how we understand Neanderthal societies, particularly in terms of cultural transmission and shared traditions,\" she added.\n\n\"Too often, discussions of Neanderthal symbolism rely on fragile evidence or optimistic interpretations,\" Ludovic Slimak, an archaeologist at the University of Toulouse in France and author of the book \"The Naked Neanderthal\" (Penguin, 2024) who was not involved in the study, told Live Science by email. \"Here, the authors take a more grounded approach, testing whether the spatial organization of the remains could be explained by natural processes alone,\" he said.\n\nSlimak said that the findings of this study add new evidence to the debate over Neanderthal symbolism. \"Rather than asking whether Neanderthals were 'symbolic like us,' we should ask what kinds of meaningful behaviors they developed on their own terms. This site suggests that Neanderthal worlds of meaning existed, but they may have been structured very differently from those of Homo sapiens,\" he said.",

    "description": "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the DOJ will withhold or redact about 200,000 pages that it has deemed protected by \"various privileges.\"",
    "fullText": "After sifting through \"two Eiffel Towers' worth\" of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Justice Department has concluded that some 200,000 documents will be at least partially withheld from the public, it said in a letter to Congress on Friday.\n\nThe disclosure came as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced at a press conference that the DOJ would be concluding its Epstein data dump with the release of another 3 million files related to the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nThree new tranches of files were published on the DOJ's website on Friday morning. Blanche said they would include 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, and that additional files would be posted on the site throughout the day.\n\nIn total, some 3.5 million files will be made public in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was passed into law in November and requires the Justice Department to publish its Epstein-related files.\n\nThe Justice Department will also withhold or redact about 200,000 pages that it says are protected by \"various privileges,\" including attorney-client, \"deliberative process,\" and \"work product\" privileges.\n\nBlanche, at the press conference Friday morning, said the Epstein files didn't contain information that would justify charges against any additional men for abusing women.\n\n\"There's this built-in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information about men, that we know about, that we're covering up or that we're choosing not to prosecute — that is not the case,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think the public and you all are going to uncover information about men who abuse women, unfortunately,\" he added.\n\nStill, victims and lawmakers are expected to be on the lookout for files that might reveal more about who else in Epstein's orbit may have been investigated, including prosecution memos, where prosecutors deliberate the strength of potential criminal charges.\n\nPreviously released files indicated that at least some Justice Department officials believed that other people associated with Epstein could be \"co-conspirators\" of his, although most of their names were redacted.\n\nSeveral emails included in an earlier disclosure referred to \"10 co-conspirators\" of Epstein who were served grand jury subpoenas.\n\nThe email exchange was partially redacted, but one email included the names of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of trafficking girls to Epstein for sex and sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Jean-Luc Brunel, an associate of Epstein who killed himself in 2022 while awaiting trial in France on rape charges.\n\nIt also named Les Wexner, a billionaire who took financial advice from Epstein and later said he regretted his relationship with the financier. Wexner has not been charged with any crime and has said Epstein deceived him.\n\nA spokesperson for Wexner didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nThe names of other people in the email were redacted.\n\nMaxwell is the only other person the Justice Department has charged with participating in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.\n\nBlanche said the Department would withhold \"anything that would jeopardize an active investigation,\" but did not say whether an ongoing investigation existed.\n\nIn November, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she asked Jay Clayton, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, to examine a request from President Donald Trump to investigate Epstein's ties to JPMorgan Chase, former President Bill Clinton, and several business leaders.\n\n\"Jay Clayton, in New York, is in charge of any potential investigations, and I'm not going to comment beyond that,\" Blanche said Friday.\n\nBlanche also said the Justice Department was not withholding any files for national security or foreign policy purposes, even though the Epstein Files Transparency Act allowed for it. And on Friday, the department asked a Manhattan judge to unseal material from the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, which represents numerous Epstein victims, that it had given to prosecutors after a grand jury subpoena.\n\nIn the letter to Congress, Bondi and Blanche write that it would provide members of the House and Senate judiciary committees with a report summarizing redactions and list \"all government officials and politically exposed persons named or referenced in the released materials.\"",

    "title": "Archaeologists Found a 1,000-Year-Old Cross That May Change the Story of Early Christianity",
    "description": "The bronze pendant, which featured a wheel cross, suggested a stronger presence in part of Europe.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA metal detectorist working near Brandenburg, Germany, uncovered a bronze wheel cross pendant dated to the 10th or 11th century C.E.\n\nThe pendant matches a mold from the same period from nearby Berlin, which was discovered about 40 years ago.\n\nTaken together, the two finds suggest that Christianity was more strongly established in Slavic Germany during this period than previously believed.\n\nA volunteer metal detectorist, working in the district of Havelland in Germany’s Brandenburg state, recently unearthed a medieval bronze wheel cross pendant with an amazing connection to an archaeological find from 40 years prior: a 1,000-year-old mold now commonly referred to as the Spandau Cross mold, which was found in nearby Spandau and used to cast small wheel crosses. You can see the pendant and the mold here.\n\nThe mold was discovered during excavations at a Slavic fort in Berling-Spandau in 1983, and is considered one of the oldest pieces of evidence of early Christianization in the region. It was found alongside the remains of an early wooden church.\n\nRemarkably, after the circle cross pendant underwent expert restoration, it perfectly matched the cavity of the Spandau Cross mold. According to the Brandenburg State Office for the preservation of Monuments, the neat fit confirms that the mold was used to make the recently unearthed bronze circle cross, and probably many others of the same kind. Both discoveries date to the same period, and together suggest that Christianity had taken root in 10th-century Slavic Germany more deeply than historians and archaeologists previously believed.\n\nMatthias Wemhoff, state archaeologist and director of the Museum of Prehistory and Early History in Berlin, called the discovery of the pendant a “lucky find.” He said in a translated statement that by considering how the mold was used to make the pendant, “we know that the blacksmith in Spandau produced for a large market and a very mobile population. Christian symbols were widespread before the Slavic uprising of 983.”\n\nIn the early 10th century, the region around Berlin and Brandenburg was inhabited by non-Christian Slavic tribes. Military campaigns brought new populations to the region, and experts believe those people brought with them fresh political organization and a new faith. Still, evidence of Christianity’s initial spread to the Slavic tribes was primarily found in historical documents, rather than physical artifacts, especially since many in the Slavic tribes rejected Christianization outright. It wasn’t until at least the 12th century, experts believe, that the region was thoroughly Christianized after its conquest by the Kingdom of Germany in the Wendish Crusade.\n\nThe wheel cross offers a tantalizing clue that Christianity may have spread more deeply in 10th-century Brandenburg than previously thought.\n\n“The discovery of a small bronze cross is not just another find among many,” Manja Schüle, Brandenburg’s minister of culture, said in a statement. “This discovery is spectacular in several respects: it fits exactly into a casting mold that was found more than 40 years ago—this is unique for an archaeological find from this period. It also exemplifies the early Christianization of Brandenburg and shows the role that Christianity already played in this region, which was predominantly settled by Slavs at the time.”\n\nAlong with the cross, volunteers uncovered coins, partially gilded jewelry fragments, and iron weapons. Schüle added that the discovery demonstrates the role volunteers can have in uncovering the history of Brandenburg. As Juliane Rangnow, the volunteer who found the cross, put it in a statement: “Holding such an artifact in your hand is like a bridge to the past.”\n\nThe mold and the cross will both be displayed at the Brandenburg State Archaeological Museum.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Catherine O'Hara, two-time Emmy Award winner and beloved movie star, has died at the age of 71.\n\nA representative for O'Hara confirmed the news to Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Her agency said in a statement that her death on Friday came after a \"brief illness,\" per The Associated Press.\n\nO'Hara has been a fixture of TV and movies since breaking out on the Canadian sketch comedy series \"SCTV\" in the early '80s alongside John Candy, Eugene Levy, Martin Short, Andrea Martin, and Rick Moranis.\n\nSince then, she's become beloved to audiences for her roles in \n\"Beetlejuice,\" \"Home Alone,\" \"Schitt's Creek,\" \"The Studio,\" \"Best in Show,\" \"The Last of Us,\" and many voiceover roles, including Sally in \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" and Susan Frankenstein in \"Frankenweenie.\"\n\nSee her legendary career in photos.\n\n\"SCTV,\" a sketch series about a fictional TV network, ran on Canadian television from 1976 to 1984 and on NBC from 1981 to 1983.\n\nO'Hara was just one of the many Canadian comedians who were introduced to American audiences through \"SCTV,\" which was something of a cult classic.\n\nShe won her first Emmy, for writing on \"SCTV,\" in 1982.\n\n\"You're lucky to work with friends, and I think it's nice to see friends together. I like knowing when people know each other and have a history; that comes across on screen. I think it's fun for people to see. It is for me,\" O'Hara told BuzzFeed about working with Levy in 2014.\n\nIn between seasons of \"SCTV,\" O'Hara was hired in 1981 to join the cast of the sixth season of \"Saturday Night Live,\" the first without creator Lorne Michaels.\n\nBut she only lasted a week. There was some speculation that it was because she didn't like head writer Michael O'Donoghue, but she shut that speculation down years later.\n\n\"There's been BS stories about I was supposedly scared by somebody,\" she told People in 2024. Instead, her departure was due to a last-minute renewal of \"SCTV.\"\n\n\"Basically I said, 'Oh, sorry, I gotta go be with my [comedy] family,'\" she said, adding, \"It all worked out the way it was supposed to.\"\n\nThe \"Day-O\" scene in \"Beetlejuice\" is perhaps the most iconic in a film filled with iconic scenes, and it all starts with O'Hara's character.\n\nO'Hara went on to work with Burton in \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" \"Frankenweenie,\" and \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\"\n\nThey were married from 1992 until her death. They shared two sons.\n\nO'Hara has been a staple in homes around the world every December for 35 years due to her role as Kevin's mom, Kate, in \"Home Alone\" and \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.\"\n\nSpecifically, she was in \"Waiting for Guffman\" in 1996, \"Best in Show\" in 2000, \"A Mighty Wind\" in 2003, and \"For Your Consideration\" in 2006.\n\nO'Hara appeared in the 2010 HBO biopic of Temple Grandin, an autistic woman who changed the way cattle were handled at ranches and slaughterhouses. Grandin was played by Claire Danes, while O'Hara played Grandin's aunt, Ann.\n\nShe was nominated for a Golden Globe and a SAG Award for her performance.\n\n\"Schitt's Creek\" became a full-blown phenomenon across its run from 2015 to 2020, and many of the show's most memorable moments came from her character, Moira.\n\nShe won in 2020 after receiving a nomination for the prior year, as well. It was her second win from eight nominations.\n\nThirty-three years after they first played mother and son in \"Home Alone,\" O'Hara was on hand to present Culkin with his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n\"Families all over the world can't let a year go by without watching and loving 'Home Alone' together. It's because of Macaulay Culkin,\" O'Hara said.\n\nCulkin thanked her for her speech and even called her \"Mama.\"\n\nO'Hara, along with Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder, returned to the town of Winter River for the legacy sequel to \"Beetlejuice,\" aptly titled \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\"\n\nInstead of being a flop, as Warner Bros. reportedly feared when they slashed its budget, this film was a huge success. Per The Numbers, it was the third-highest-grossing film of her career, behind \"Elemental\" and \"Home Alone.\"\n\nO'Hara was a double nominee at last year's Emmys, which were held in September. She was nominated for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for \"The Studio\" and outstanding guest actress in a drama series for \"The Last of Us.\"",

    "title": "47 of the best albums in history that weren't nominated for album of the year at the Grammys",
    "description": "Award shows are bound to get stuff wrong, but a shocking number of masterpieces were ignored by the Grammys in the album of the year category.",
    "fullText": "Year: 2021, at the 63rd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Black Pumas\" by Black Pumas, \"Chilombo\" by Jhené Aiko, \"Djesse Vol. 3\" by Jacob Collier, \"Everyday Life\" by Coldplay, \"Folklore\" by Taylor Swift, \"Future Nostalgia\" by Dua Lipa, \"Hollywood's Bleeding\" by Post Malone, and \"Women in Music Pt. III\" by HAIM\n\nPerhaps Fiona Apple's greatest charm as an artist is how little effort she needs to put into creating something inimitable like \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters.\" She used a phone selfie she'd taken off-handedly \"two or three years ago\" for the album's cover art; in the middle of recording \"On I Go,\" she messed up and mumbled, \"Ah, fuck, shit.\" She kept it in the song.\n\n\"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\" doesn't quite sound like anything else, and it certainly isn't trying to.\n\nIt was also the most rapturously reviewed album of 2020, by far. It has a Metacritic score of 98/100. Pitchfork gave it an almost-unheard-of perfect rating. Various critics at The New York Times hailed Apple for her \"casually wise,\" \"fearless,\" \"artfully unguarded anthology.\" I, myself, described the album as an \"unfettered masterpiece.\"\n\nI cannot fathom what caused such a truly appalling snub, but \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\" should have been a shoo-in for AOTY.\n\nInstead, it was only nominated for best alternative music album. \"Shameika\" was also nominated for best rock song and best rock performance.\n\nYear: 2021, at the 63rd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Black Pumas\" by Black Pumas, \"Chilombo\" by Jhené Aiko, \"Djesse Vol. 3\" by Jacob Collier, \"Everyday Life\" by Coldplay, \"Folklore\" by Taylor Swift, \"Future Nostalgia\" by Dua Lipa, \"Hollywood's Bleeding\" by Post Malone, and \"Women in Music Pt. III\" by HAIM\n\nThe Weeknd's \"After Hours\" is such an immersive, sensory experience that it's almost more gloom-pop opera than album.\n\nListening to \"After Hours\" is a 56-minute commitment every time because you can't afford to miss a second. After all, you'd never leave the theatre in the middle of one of Hamlet's existentialist soliloquies.\n\nMost concept albums — especially ones written from the perspective of a self-destructive, unlikeable protagonist — don't have smash hits. But this one did. \"Blinding Lights\" is one of the biggest songs of all time. It could and should have won record of the year.\n\nSomehow, after creating the most ambitious and most celebrated album of his career, The Weeknd became the most-snubbed artist of the 63rd Grammy Awards. He received an outrageous total of zero nods, sparking outrage from peers, critics, and The Weeknd himself, who described the nominations process as \"corrupt.\"\n\nYear: 2020, at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"7\" by Lil Nas X, \"Cuz I Love You (Deluxe)\" by Lizzo, \"Father of the Bride\" by Vampire Weekend, \"I, I\" by Bon Iver, \"I Used To Know Her\" by H.E.R., \"Norman F---ing Rockwell!\" by Lana Del Rey, \"Thank U, Next\" by Ariana Grande, and \"When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\" by Billie Eilish\n\nIf the Grammys wanted to honor innovative Black music at the 2020 ceremony, \"Igor\" was the clear choice.\n\nInstead, voters went for \"7\" by Lil Nas X, a seven-song EP that only hints at the young hitmaker's potential. Especially compared to Tyler's work, \"7\" is undercooked at best.\n\n\"Igor\" was shut out of the major three categories and relegated to best rap album, in which it handily won — but seemed out of place.\n\n\"On the one side, I am very grateful that what I made can be acknowledged in a world like this,\" Tyler told reporters. \"But it sucks that whenever we, and I mean guys that look like me, do anything that's genre-bending or anything, they always put it in a rap or urban category.\"\n\nYear: 2019, at the 61st annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Beerbongs & Bentleys\" by Post Malone, the \"Black Panther\" soundtrack, \"By the Way, I Forgive You\" by Brandi Carlile, \"Dirty Computer\" by Janelle Monáe, \"Golden Hour\" by Kacey Musgraves, \"H.E.R.\" by H.E.R., \"Invasion of Privacy\" by Cardi B, and \"Scorpion\" by Drake\n\n\"Sweetener\" wasn't simply Ariana Grande's comeback album, or proof that she could still crank out hits in the face of trauma. \"Sweetener\" was a rebirth, the work of a modern icon approaching her creative peak.\n\nThankfully, \"Sweetener\" did win the award for best pop vocal album, but it was shut out of the major categories, including AOTY.\n\nThe album's standout single, \"God Is a Woman,\" also lost its nomination for best pop solo performance.\n\nYear: 2018, at the 60th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"24K Magic\" by Bruno Mars, \"4:44\" by Jay-Z, \"Awaken, My Love!\" by Childish Gambino, \"Damn.\" by Kendrick Lamar, and \"Melodrama\" by Lorde\n\n2018 marked the first year in Grammys history that no white men were nominated for AOTY. Hip-hop, rap, and R&B dominated the ceremony — the perfect time to go all in and reaffirm SZA's rise as a modern-day neo-soul genius.\n\nIndeed, the Grammys were surprisingly close to getting it right that year, at least in terms of nominations. \"Ctrl\" earned SZA her first five Grammy nods, including best urban contemporary album (a controversial category that has since been renamed).\n\nThey were so close. SZA lost all five of her nominations and didn't even get to compete for the top honor, which is honestly embarrassing (for them, not for her).\n\nIn 2024, Grammy voters got a chance to redeem themselves with SZA's sophomore album \"SOS.\" Perhaps unsurprisingly, they screwed it up again and gave AOTY to Taylor Swift's \"Midnights\" instead.\n\nYear: 2017, at the 59th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"25\" by Adele, \"A Sailor's Guide to Earth\" by Sturgill Simpson, \"Lemonade\" by Beyoncé, \"Purpose\" by Justin Bieber, and \"Views\" by Drake\n\nSomehow, the Recording Academy managed to hand pop princess Rihanna eight nominations in 2017, including six for her best album \"Anti,\" but failed to nominate her in the biggest category — and failed to give her any actual awards.\n\n\"Anti\" lost for best urban contemporary album to Beyoncé's \"Lemonade.\" Fair enough. But it still deserved to be included in the ceremony's slate of top-tier albums, and it certainly deserved an AOTY nomination over \"Purpose\" or \"Views.\"\n\nYear: 2017, at the 59th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"25\" by Adele, \"A Sailor's Guide to Earth\" by Sturgill Simpson, \"Lemonade\" by Beyoncé, \"Purpose\" by Justin Bieber, and \"Views\" by Drake\n\nOK, so this one actually wasn't the Recording Academy's fault. Frank Ocean declined to submit his career-defining masterpiece, \"Blonde,\" for Grammy consideration, even after he was reportedly encouraged by producers to change his mind.\n\n\"I think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated,\" he later explained to the New York Times. \"I'd rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience.\"\n\nYear: 2017, at the 59th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"25\" by Adele, \"A Sailor's Guide to Earth\" by Sturgill Simpson, \"Lemonade\" by Beyoncé, \"Purpose\" by Justin Bieber, and \"Views\" by Drake\n\nSolange won best R&B performance for \"Cranes in the Sky,\" but that's not saying much when you consider that it should've been nominated for both record and song of the year; we previously ranked it at No. 14 on our list of the decade's best songs.\n\nIt's even more haunting that \"A Seat at the Table\" failed to get any recognition as an album, despite being one of the most intimate and culturally relevant artworks in recent memory.\n\nYear: 2016, at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"1989\" by Taylor Swift, \"Beauty Behind the Madness\" by The Weeknd, \"Sound & Color\" by Alabama Shakes, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" by Kendrick Lamar, and \"Traveller\" by Chris Stapleton\n\nDespite Kevin Parker's spotless reputation as a musical genius, he has only received five Grammy nominations for his work as Tame Impala — three nods for best alternative music album, two for best dance/electronic recording — and has yet to win.\n\nThe psychedelic and impressively accessible \"Currents,\" widely considered to be a defining album of the decade, was beaten by Alabama Shakes' \"Sound & Color,\" which also received a nod for AOTY. Both albums deserved the chance to compete for the ceremony's highest honor.\n\nYear: 2016, at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"1989\" by Taylor Swift, \"Beauty Behind the Madness\" by The Weeknd, \"Sound & Color\" by Alabama Shakes, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" by Kendrick Lamar, and \"Traveller\" by Chris Stapleton\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen has only ever gotten Grammys recognition for her smash hit, \"Call Me Maybe,\" which was nominated for song of the year and best pop solo performance in 2013.\n\nBut as anyone who's heard \"Emotion\" knows, Jepsen is far more than a one-hit wonder. We previously ranked it as one of the best albums of the decade.\n\nAlas, Jepsen was completely shut out of the 2016 Grammy Awards, when \"Emotion\" (and its standout track, \"Run Away With Me\") would have been eligible.\n\nYear: 2014, at the 56th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"The Blessed Unrest\" by Sara Bareilles, \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" by Kendrick Lamar, \"The Heist\" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, \"Random Access Memories\" by Daft Punk, \"Red\" by Taylor Swift\n\nLorde was nominated for four Grammys in 2014 and won two: song of the year and best pop solo performance for her breakout hit \"Royals.\"\n\nOf course, \"Royals\" deserved everything it got, but the song is just one piece of Lorde's influential debut.\n\n\"Pure Heroine\" — another decade-defining yet underappreciated album — lost its bid for best pop solo album to Bruno Mars' \"Unorthodox Jukebox.\"\n\nIt didn't even get the chance to compete for AOTY, overlooked in favor of inferior albums by Sara Bareilles and Macklemore.\n\nYear: 2014, at the 56th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"The Blessed Unrest\" by Sara Bareilles, \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" by Kendrick Lamar, \"The Heist\" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, \"Random Access Memories\" by Daft Punk, \"Red\" by Taylor Swift\n\nGrammy voters really stumbled in 2014.\n\nBaffling decisions that year include Daft Punk's triumph over Taylor Swift for AOTY, Macklemore beating Kendrick Lamar for best rap album, and, of course, Arctic Monkeys receiving just one nomination for the band's best album to date.\n\nThe standout breakup anthem \"Do I Wanna Know?\" was nominated for best rock performance, but \"AM\" wasn't even nominated for best rock album.\n\n\"AM\" remains one of the most glamorous and masterful rock albums in recent memory, created by one of this century's most celebrated bands. It had all the makings of a no-brainer AOTY nominee.\n\nYear: 2013, at the 55th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Babel\" by Mumford & Sons, \"Blunderbuss\" by Jack White, \"Channel Orange\" by Frank Ocean, \"El Camino\" by The Black Keys, and \"Some Nights\" by Fun.\n\nIt is truly mind-boggling that \"Views\" and \"Scorpion\" could be nominated for AOTY, but \"Take Care,\" easily Drake's best album ever, was relegated to rap categories.\n\n\"Take Care\" did earn Drake's first-ever Grammy for best rap album, but the renowned album deserved far more for redefining the genre and the landscape of pop music.\n\nYear: 2012, at the 54th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"21\" by Adele, \"Born This Way\" by Lady Gaga, \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" by Bruno Mars, \"Loud\" by Rihanna, and \"Wasting Light\" by the Foo Fighters\n\nYe (formerly known as Kanye West) won best rap album for \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" in 2012, as well as best rap song and best rap/sung collaboration for one of its many standout tracks, \"All of the Lights.\"\n\nAnd yet, after three straight AOTY nominations for less impressive, less innovative bodies of work (\"The College Dropout\" in 2005, \"Late Registration\" in 2006, and \"Graduation\" in 2008), it makes little sense why the Recording Academy failed to nominate his magnum opus.\n\n\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" remains West's most beloved and critically acclaimed album to date, and numerous publications went on to rank it as one of the decade's defining albums, including Insider (No. 6), Stereogum (No. 4), Pitchfork (No. 2), Complex (No. 1), and Rolling Stone (No. 1).\n\nYear: 2012, at the 54th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"21\" by Adele, \"Born This Way\" by Lady Gaga, \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" by Bruno Mars, \"Loud\" by Rihanna, and \"Wasting Light\" by the Foo Fighters\n\nBeyoncé's \"4\" gets better and better with every listen, and has only grown in critical acclaim over the years.\n\nWhen the 2012 Grammy nominations were announced, Queen Bey hadn't just been snubbed — she'd been downright disrespected with zero nominations.\n\n\"It would be easy enough to make a case that '4' should be a contender for album of the year,\" John Mitchell wrote for MTV at the time. \"Its Metacritic rating of 73 is better than four of the nominated albums, and while music critics are far from definitive, consensus acclaim shouldn't be overlooked — but we would have settled for Best R&B Album because, well, it's the perfect R&B album.\"\n\nYear: 2012, at the 54th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"21\" by Adele, \"Born This Way\" by Lady Gaga, \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" by Bruno Mars, \"Loud\" by Rihanna, and \"Wasting Light\" by the Foo Fighters\n\n2012 was a big year for Justin Vernon, aka Bon Iver; he won best new artist and best alternative music album. \"Holocene\" was also nominated for record of the year.\n\nDespite this, Bon Iver's self-titled sophomore effort — the album that earned universal praise and catapulted him to mainstream stardom — was passed over for an AOTY nomination.\n\nYear: 2011, at the 55th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"The Fame Monster\" by Lady Gaga, \"Need You Now\" by Lady Antebellum, \"Recovery\" by Eminem, \"The Suburbs\" by Arcade Fire, \"Teenage Dream\" by Katy Perry\n\nBeach House has never once been nominated for a Grammy — not even for their third studio album \"Teen Dream,\" which some critics have hailed as one of the best albums of all time.\n\nAs Quinn Moreland wrote for Pitchfork, which ranked \"Teen Dream\" at No. 21 on a list of the decade's best albums, the band \"amplified their dream pop\" to create an immersive listening experience that swirls with passion and melancholy: \"It's the sound of a band pulling back the veil of composure and unleashing the emotional intensity that has long been bubbling beneath the surface.\"\n\nYear: 2008, at the 50th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\" by Foo Fighters, \"Graduation\" by Kanye West, \"Back to Black\" by Amy Winehouse, \"River: The Joni Letters\" by Herbie Hancock, \"These Days\" by Vince Gill\n\nM.I.A. was sampling global beats before Drake had even left \"Degrassi,\" blending rap flows and hostile-sounding pop before Billie Eilish turned 6, and making bold political statements in her music way before it became trendy.\n\nThe British-Sri Lankan artist's sophomore album, \"Kala,\" was ahead of the curve for many reasons, but that's not to say it wasn't appreciated in its time. Rolling Stone named \"Kala\" the best album of 2007, and later ranked it the ninth-best album of the decade.\n\n\"Paper Planes\" — the album's smash hit that took aim at both excessive celebrity culture and American society's fear of immigrants — was nominated for record of the year in 2009, thanks to its rerelease as a single.\n\n\"Kala\" was eligible in 2008, but didn't receive a hint of recognition.\n\nYear: 2006, at the 48th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" by Paul McCartney, \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" by Mariah Carey, \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" by U2, \"Late Registration\" by Kanye West, and \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\" by Gwen Stefani\n\nSufjan Stevens didn't receive his first Grammy nomination until 2019, over a decade after releasing his seminal album \"Illinois.\"\n\nThe thoughtful, tender complexity of \"Illinois\" was generously praised upon release and has continued to grow in acclaim. It landed on numerous best-of-the-decade lists, including Rolling Stone (No. 78), NME (No. 17), and Paste Magazine (No. 1), and is widely considered to be one of history's finest folk-pop albums.\n\nYear: 2002, at the 44th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Acoustic Soul\" by India.Arie, \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" by U2, \"Love and Theft\" by Bob Dylan, the \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" soundtrack, \"Stankonia\" by OutKast\n\nIt's difficult to overstate the influence of \"Is This It\" on modern rock music, both in its creation and its reception.\n\nThe Strokes' debut has been cited as a direct influence by everyone from Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner to The Killers' Brandon Flowers.\n\nAnd as Garry Mulholland wrote for The Guardian, pop stars — particularly those \"who are gleefully rediscovering disco, electro and synth-pop\" — also owe the album a debt of gratitude.\n\n\"The commercial success of 'Is This It' made every forgotten art-pop experiment of the late 70s and early 80s instantly hip and ripe for reinvention,\" he wrote in 2009.\n\nAbsurdly, \"Is This It\" did not receive any recognition from the Recording Academy. In fact, The Strokes didn't receive a Grammy nomination until 2021, when they won best rock album for \"The New Abnormal.\"\n\nYear: 2000, at the 42nd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"FanMail\" by TLC, \"Fly\" by the Chicks, \"Millennium\" by the Backstreet Boys, \"Supernatural\" by Santana, and \"When I Look in Your Eyes\" by Diana Krall\n\nBlur's seminal album was created amid personal heartbreak and cultural transformation; front man Damon Albarn had recently ended a long-term relationship, and the euphoric era of Britpop was clearly experiencing a comedown.\n\nThis challenging atmosphere allowed Albarn to write his most spectacular album ever.\n\nAs Stereogum's Ryan Leas wrote, \"13\" was \"frazzled and harrowing and adventurous in ways no other Blur album before or since has matched ... it seemed, definitively, to solidify the notion of Blur as true artists.\"\n\n\"13\" was completely ignored by the Recording Academy, much as Blur had always been. The beloved band has only ever received one nomination: best long-form music video in 2010.\n\nYear: 1998, at the 40th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"The Day\" by Babyface, \"Flaming Pie\" by Paul McCartney, \"This Fire\" by Paula Cole, \"Time Out of Mind\" by Bob Dylan, and \"OK Computer\" by Radiohead\n\nBjörk has only been nominated for 16 Grammys in her career, and she's never won.\n\nDespite seven nominations for best alternative music album, she has never been nominated for AOTY. Her best album, \"Homogenic,\" was only nominated for best alternative music performance.\n\nBjörk, already a noted musical genius in 1997, received profuse praise when \"Homogenic\" was released, and the album's reputation has continued to thrive.\n\nThe Washington Post described it in 2018 as \"a superhuman blast of avant-pop that we're still catching up to,\" while Sal Cinquemani noted in a five-star retroactive review for Slant: \"If not the greatest electronic album of all time, it's certainly the greatest of its decade.\"\n\nYear: 1997, at the 39th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Falling Into You\" by Celine Dion, \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" by the Smashing Pumpkins, \"Odelay\" by Beck, \"The Score\" by Fugees, and the \"Waiting to Exhale\" soundtrack\n\nThese days, everyone can sing along to \"Wonderwall,\" but Oasis' sophomore album was a smash hit as soon as it landed.\n\nIt became the UK's third-best-selling album of all time, thrust the Manchester brothers into superstardom, and is now considered \"one of the seminal releases of the 1990s Britpop movement,\" according to the Grammy Awards website.\n\n\"Wonderwall\" was nominated for best rock performance by a duo or group (one of the band's measly total of two nominations), but \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" didn't get any love as an album.\n\nYear: 1997, at the 39th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Falling Into You\" by Celine Dion, \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" by the Smashing Pumpkins, \"Odelay\" by Beck, \"The Score\" by Fugees, and the \"Waiting to Exhale\" soundtrack\n\nApple wrote every track on her acclaimed debut, \"Tidal,\" which was released when she was still just a teenager.\n\nApple's deeply honest lyrics are drawn from intense personal trauma, her experiences with mental illness, and her famously astute belief that this patriarchal world is complete \"bullshit.\"\n\nCombine Apple's perceptive powers with her earthy voice and percussive production, and it's hard to deny that \"Tidal\" should've won AOTY in 1997. However, it wasn't nominated for a single Grammy Award.\n\nThanks to the rerelease of \"Criminal\" as a single, Apple earned her first three Grammy nominations in 1998: best rock song, best female rock vocal performance, and best new artist.\n\nYear: 1995, at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"From the Cradle\" by Eric Clapton, \"Longing in Their Hearts\" by Bonnie Raitt, \"MTV Unplugged\" by Tony Bennett, \"Seal\" by Seal, \"The 3 Tenors in Concert 1994\" by José Carreras, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti with Zubin Mehta\n\nNas has been nominated for over a dozen Grammys, but he's only won once: best rap album for \"King's Disease\" in 2019, more than two decades after the release of his best work.\n\n\"Illmatic\" wasn't nominated for any Grammys, but it was recently ranked No. 44 on Rolling Stone's revised list of the best albums of all time.\n\n\"Other rappers were harder and brasher, but nobody captured the creeping menace of life on the streets like this 20-year-old from New York's Queensbridge projects,\" the magazine's critics wrote. \"'Illmatic' was an instant classic that never crossed over, which only deepened its myth with hip-hop heads.\"\n\nYear: 1992, at the 34th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Heart in Motion\" by Amy Grant, \"Luck of the Draw\" by Bonnie Raitt, \"Out of Time\" by R.E.M., \"The Rhythm of the Saints\" by Paul Simon, \"Unforgettable... With Love\" by Natalie Cole\n\nYou need only be a casual music fan to understand the impact of Nirvana's \"Nevermind.\" Unfortunately, the album lost its bid for best alternative music album to R.E.M.'s \"Out of Time.\"\n\nThe album's iconic lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" also lost both of its nominations (for best rock song and best hard rock performance), even though it was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nIn fact, Nirvana received only five Grammy nominations during Kurt Cobain's lifetime, none in the \"Big Four\" categories.\n\nThe band's sixth nomination and solitary win — best alternative music performance for their live album, \"MTV Unplugged In New York\" — were bestowed only after Cobain's 1994 suicide.\n\nYear: 1986, at the 28th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Brothers in Arms\" by Dire Straits, \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\" by USA for Africa, \"No Jacket Required\" by Phil Collins, \"We Are the World\" by Sting, \"Whitney Houston\" by Whitney Houston\n\nThe Recording Academy dismissing a fearless woman who makes pristine pop music? Shocker.\n\nAs Richards noted for The Washington Post, Madonna deserved to take home the Grammys' top prize for her adventurous, irresistible, historic sophomore album.\n\nInstead, she received a solitary nomination for best pop vocal performance (female) and lost.\n\n\"'Like a Virgin' transformed Madonna from a promising pop singer into a national phenomenon,\" Richards wrote. \"But if she had won album of the year in 1986 — and, of course, she wasn't even nominated — she would have been just the fourth female solo artist to take that honor in the 28-year history of the Grammys.\"\n\nYear: 1984, at the 26th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"An Innocent Man\" by Billy Joel, the \"Flashdance\" soundtrack, \"Let's Dance\" by David Bowie, \"Synchronicity\" by The Police, and \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson\n\nWith just eight songs, each as flawlessly melodic and danceable as the last, \"Power Corruption and Lies\" is both accessible and original. Few (if any) synth-pop albums from the '80s have aged quite so well.\n\nIt was lauded at the time of its release, but \"Power Corruption and Lies\" didn't receive any recognition at the 26th annual Grammys — not even for its best-selling single, \"Blue Monday.\"\n\nIn fact, New Order wouldn't receive a nomination for another 20 years. The band was finally nominated for best dance recording in 2006, but lost to The Chemical Brothers.\n\nYear: 1983, at the 25th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"American Fool\" by John Cougar, \"The Nightfly\" by Donald Fagen, \"The Nylon Curtain\" by Billy Joel, \"Toto IV\" by Toto, \"Tug of War\" by Paul McCartney\n\nBruce Springsteen is not bereft of love from the Recording Academy. To date, he boasts a round pot of 51 nods and a whopping 20 wins, making Springsteen one of the most-awarded artists in Grammys history.\n\nShockingly, however, The Boss has never won AOTY, and his best album, \"Nebraska,\" didn't receive any nominations at all.\n\n\"We can still hear Toto's legacy at karaoke night, but Bruce Springsteen's 'Nebraska' sounds a lot more like an AOTY winner by contemporary standards — intimate, introspective and spare,\" Richards wrote for The Washington Post.\n\n\"But Springsteen has always been of his time, never ahead of it,\" Richards added. \"He was a star in 1983 and 'Nebraska' was his darkest, finest hour.\"\n\nYear: 1981, at the 23rd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Christopher Cross\" by Christopher Cross, \"Glass Houses\" by Billy Joel, \"Guilty\" by Barbra Streisand, \"Trilogy: Past Present Future\" by Frank Sinatra, and \"The Wall\" by Pink Floyd\n\nThe Clash was probably doing too much to secure a win from the Recording Academy and its notoriously stuffy voters, but \"London Calling\" at least deserved a nod for AOTY — a fact they acknowledged in 2007, when the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\n\"London Calling\" peaked within the top 10 in the UK, spawned a global punk-rock hit, and was called \"the first important rock album of the 1980's\" by The New York Times.\n\nIts reputation as a politically charged, energetic, ingenious milestone has only grown stronger over time.\n\nYear: 1980, at the 22nd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"52nd Street\" by Billy Joel, \"Bad Girls\" by Donna Summer, \"Breakfast in America\" by Supertramp, \"The Gambler\" by Kenny Rogers, and \"Minute by Minute\" by The Doobie Brothers\n\nJoy Division is one of those bands that transcended music; it became a symbol of coolness and taste. But it's also one of those bands that actually had the chops to earn that legacy.\n\n\"The band's debut 'Unknown Pleasures,' originally released in 1979, is simply one of the best records ever made,\" NME wrote in 2007, \"and is still powerful enough to floor you 28 years on.\"\n\nTragically, \"Unknown Pleasures\" was brushed aside by the Recording Academy. Lead singer and lyricist Ian Curtis committed suicide the same year the album was eligible, and Joy Division was never nominated for a Grammy in its short but impactful existence.\n\nYear: 1979, at the 21st annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Even Now\" by Barry Manilow, the \"Grease\" soundtrack, \"Running on Empty\" by Jackson Browne, the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack, and \"Some Girls\" by The Rolling Stones\n\nTo be fair, the Sex Pistols probably had no shot at a Grammys nomination.\n\nIn addition to the cheeky use of \"bollocks\" in their album title, the band delighted in controversy and anarchy — hardly the kind of artist destined for praise from the voting bloc that bestowed the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack with its highest honor.\n\nBut in retrospect, we all know that \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\" changed the game — including the Recording Academy, which inducted the album into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nYear: 1977, at the 19th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Breezin'\" by George Benson, \"Chicago X\" by Chicago, \"Frampton Comes Alive!\" by Peter Frampton, \"Silk Degrees\" by Boz Scaggs, and \"Songs in the Key of Life\" by Stevie Wonder\n\nThe Ramones don't have a single Grammy nomination, but they do have a lifetime achievement award and a place in the Grammy Hall of Fame for \"Ramones,\" their distinguished debut album. (It seems the Recording Academy is big on course-correcting, many years after making obvious mistakes.)\n\nYear: 1974, at the 16th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Behind Closed Doors\" by Charlie Rich, \"The Divine Miss M\" by Bette Midler, \"Innervisions\" by Stevie Wonder, \"Killing Me Softly\" by Roberta Flack, and \"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\" by Paul Simon\n\nPink Floyd would later receive an AOTY nod for \"The Wall\" (and lose to Christopher Cross, somehow), but the band's eighth studio album was entirely neglected, despite being one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling albums in history.\n\nRolling Stone has described \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" as a \"psychedelic masterpiece,\" \"a true colossus of classic rock,\" and \"a career-defining artistic achievement\" for the beloved British band.\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find an elaborate, ambitious concept album that stands quite so tall.\n\nYear: 1973, at the 15th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"American Pie\" by Don McLean, \"The Concert for Bangladesh\" by George Harrison & Friends, \"Jesus Christ Superstar (Original Broadway Cast Recording),\" \"Moods\" by Neil Diamond, and \"Nilsson Schmilsson\" by Nilsson\n\nSo far, the only Rolling Stones album to be nominated for AOTY is \"Some Girls,\" which isn't even one of the band's four albums in the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nOne of those four is \"Exile on Main St.,\" which is now seen as the band's best album. At No. 14, it's their highest-ranked on Rolling Stone's list of the best albums of all time.\n\n\"A dirty whirl of basement blues and punk boogie, the Rolling Stones' 1972 double LP was, according to Keith Richards, 'maybe the best thing we did,'\" the magazine's critics wrote.\n\n\"Indeed, inside its deliberately dense squall — Richards' and Mick Taylor's dogﬁght riffing, the lusty jump of the Bill Wyman–Charlie Watts rhythm engine, Mick Jagger's caged-animal bark and burned-soul croon — is the Stones' greatest album and Jagger and Richards' deﬁnitive songwriting statement of outlaw pride and dedication to grit and cold-morning redemption.\"\n\nYear: 1972, at the 14th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"All Things Must Pass\" by George Harrison, \"Carpenters\" by the Carpenters, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, \"Shaft\" by Isaac Hayes, and \"Tapestry\" by Carole King\n\nThe Who has three albums in the Grammy Hall of Fame, plus a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy. And yet, the band has never won a Grammy.\n\nTo make matters worse, the band has only been nominated twice (twice!), and both were for best long-form music video (best long-form music video?!).\n\nSo, as you can tell from my editorial emphasis, the iconic British rock band has been snubbed throughout its entire existence. \"My Generation,\" \"Tommy,\" and \"Quadrophenia\" could also be on this list.\n\nStill, I chose \"Who's Next\" as the Recording Academy's most atrocious oversight, due to its immediate critical success and enduring legacy as the band's best work.\n\n\"The Who's fifth album is one of those carved-in-stone landmarks that the rock canon doesn't allow you to bad-mouth,\" BBC's Chris Roberts wrote in 2002. \"It was pretty rad for its day. Here's the twist: it still sounds ablaze.\"\n\nYear: 1972, at the 14th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"All Things Must Pass\" by George Harrison, \"Carpenters\" by the Carpenters, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, \"Shaft\" by Isaac Hayes, and \"Tapestry\" by Carole King\n\nThe pièce de résistance of Joni Mitchell's career is also the greatest female album ever, according to Rolling Stone.\n\n\"Blue' is the first time any major rock or pop artist had opened up so fully, producing what might be the ultimate breakup album and setting a still-unmatched standard for confessional poetry in pop music,\" the magazine's staff wrote.\n\n\"Along with its romantic melancholy, 'Blue' was the sound of a woman availing herself of the romantic and sexual freedom that was, until then, an exclusively male province in rock.\"\n\nIt feels almost criminal that Mitchell received zero nominations in 1972, the year \"Blue\" would have been eligible. (Carole King's \"Tapestry,\" which won AOTY, is ranked at No. 25 on Rolling Stone's all-time list.)\n\nThree years later, Mitchell was nominated for AOTY for \"Court and Spark,\" but that hardly makes up for snubbing \"Blue,\" especially since she lost.\n\nTechnically, Mitchell has an AOTY trophy — but it was bestowed for Herbie Hancock's album of Mitchell covers, as if a man could ever do her piercing words justice.\n\nYear: 1972, at the 14th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"All Things Must Pass\" by George Harrison, \"Carpenters\" by the Carpenters, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, \"Shaft\" by Isaac Hayes, and \"Tapestry\" by Carole King\n\nIn the same year, the Grammys failed to nominate two of history's defining albums: the aforementioned \"Blue,\" as well as \"What's Going On,\" which has been crowned Rolling Stone's No. 1 best album of all time.\n\nIn Marvin Gaye's own words, the album is anchored in the fight for human rights. He was spurred to musical activism by evergreen issues like climate change, police brutality, and war, channeling that pain and passion into an intellectual, yet deeply listenable masterpiece.\n\n\"What's Going On,\" however, received minimal praise from the Recording Academy. Gaye received just one nomination in 1972 — best R&B vocal performance for \"Inner City Blues (Makes You Wanna Holler)\" — and would never receive a nomination for AOTY.\n\nGaye was posthumously honored with a lifetime achievement award in 1997, more than a decade after his death.\n\nYear: 1968, at the 10th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" by Frank Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, \"It Must Be Him\" by Vikki Carr, \"My Cup Runneth Over\" by Ed Ames, \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry, and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles\n\nJimi Hendrix, described by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as \"the most gifted instrumentalist of all time,\" only ever received one paltry Grammy nomination: best contemporary instrumental performance for his iconic \"Star-Spangled Banner\" shred at Woodstock.\n\nHe lost to Henry Mancini, who'd already won 18 Grammy Awards.\n\nHendrix was posthumously honored with a lifetime achievement award, but his consciousness-altering music was dismissed by the Recording Academy in his actual lifetime, despite the immediacy of its impact.\n\n\"Are You Experienced,\" in particular, is widely regarded as the most impressive and important debut in rock history. Naturally, it has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.\n\n\"It's still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R&B, blues... musical tradition,\" Smithsonian musicologist Reuben Jackson told NPR. \"It altered the syntax of the music, if you will, in a way I compare to, say, James Joyce's 'Ulysses.'\"\n\nYear: 1968, at the 10th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" by Frank Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, \"It Must Be Him\" by Vikki Carr, \"My Cup Runneth Over\" by Ed Ames, \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry, and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles\n\nIt actually makes sense that \"The Velvet Underground & Nico\" didn't receive any Grammy nominations, given that it flopped commercially and was generally ignored by critics at the time.\n\nHowever, with the gift of hindsight, we know this album to be a weirdo wonder that provided, according to Rolling Stone, \"inspiration and a blueprint for everything from lo-fi punk rock to highbrow avant-garde — and so much in between.\"\n\n\"The Velvet Underground & Nico\" has since been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Velvet Underground was also recognized by the Recording Academy as a \"benchmark for countless modern-rock movements\" when the band received a lifetime achievement award in 2017.\n\nYear: 1968, at the 10th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" by Frank Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, \"It Must Be Him\" by Vikki Carr, \"My Cup Runneth Over\" by Ed Ames, \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry, and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles\n\nAretha Franklin was already nine albums deep (and tens of thousands of dollars in debt) when she began recording her Atlantic debut. She could have produced some cookie-cutter commercial bait, flexed those legendary vocals, made some money, and continued on her way.\n\nInstead, Franklin dug deeper into her passionate, romantic soul and put her own sexuality on a pedestal.\n\n\"I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You\" was perhaps the first classic album of Franklin's career. Not to mention, it spawned the historic \"Respect\" cover that will outlive us all. It was a critical and commercial giant.\n\n\"Respect\" did receive three Grammy nominations and won two. Franklin was also nominated for another single, \"A Natural Woman.\" However, \"I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You\" wasn't recognized in any album-specific categories.\n\nYear: 1968, at the 10th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" by Frank Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, \"It Must Be Him\" by Vikki Carr, \"My Cup Runneth Over\" by Ed Ames, \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry, and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles\n\nJim Morrison and crew were shunned by the Recording Academy until \"Light My Fire\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, followed by its parent album \"The Doors\" in 2002.\n\nIn 2007, on the 40th anniversary of their monumental self-titled debut, The Doors received a lifetime achievement award.\n\n\"They resisted rules, trends, and, sometimes, even law and order,\" music journalist Ben Fong-Torres wrote in a Grammys tribute to the band. \"They were unpredictable, both in the studio and on stage.\"\n\n\"The result was the kind of rock that means the most, that has impact, that endures. That's why the Doors, at 40, still sound fresh and vital — and still sell records.\"\n\nYear: 1967, at the 9th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"A Man and His Music\" by Frank Sinatra, \"Color Me Barbra\" by Barbra Streisand, the \"Doctor Zhivago\" soundtrack, \"Revolver\" by The Beatles, and \"What Now My Love\" by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass\n\n\"Pet Sounds\" is The Beach Boys' melodious, scenic, bizarre magnum opus, and its ripples throughout music history are innumerable.\n\nThe Beatles' Grammy-winning \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" is often cited as music's most influential work — but it was inspired by \"Pet Sounds.\"\n\n\"Pet Sounds\" went on to inspire countless other musicians, from David Bowie to Radiohead, and practically \"invented the modern pop album,\" according to The Atlantic.\n\nSure, the album's splash wasn't instantly enormous. But you'd hope the Recording Academy would be able to parse what the public, at the time, did not.\n\nThe Beach Boys only received three nominations in 1967, all for \"Good Vibrations,\" the lighthearted song released five months after \"Pet Sounds.\"\n\nThe album and its timeless singles, including \"God Only Knows\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\" were completely disregarded.\n\nAfter a career total of four nominations (and zero wins), \"Pet Sounds\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Beach Boys received a lifetime achievement award in 2001.",

    "title": "Trump's political threat to 'decertify' thousands of Canadian-made aircraft risks aviation safety, industry watchers say",
    "description": "Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian aircraft has stirred safety concerns among analysts who caution against politicizing aircraft certification.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian-made aircraft — the backbone of many US carriers' regional jet fleet — is a threat to aviation safety, industry watchers said Friday.\n\nThe president also doesn't have the authority to unilaterally declare planes unworthy to fly in the US, Henry Harteveldt, an aviation industry authority and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told Business Insider. That authority belongs to the FAA.\n\nThe trade spat — another in a continuing back-and-forth between Trump and Canada — comes after Canada hasn't fully certified newer US-made Gulfstream jets to fly in its skies. (It has certified older models.) Gulfstream planes are used almost exclusively by private aviation companies, governments, and the ultrawealthy.\n\nTrump said on Thursday night, in a Truth Social post, that he would \"decertify\" Canada-made Bombardier jets until Canada approved the Gulfstream models. He also threatened a 50% tariff on \"any and all\" Canadian aircraft sold in the US until the situation was corrected.\n\nBombardier said in a statement that it's in contact with the Canadian government. The FAA referred Business Insider to the White House. A White House official said decertification would not immediately affect aircraft already in operation; it would apply only to new deliveries.\n\nThat would be a relief for US airlines like American, Delta, and United, whose regional affiliates operate Bombardier CRJ aircraft to cities across the country.\n\nStill, any move to decertify these more than 2,000 passenger airliners and private jets — part of almost 5,550 Canadian-made aircraft and helicopters certified in the US, according to Cirium — could trigger thousands of flight cancellations a day. A 50% tariff would likely raise airline ticket prices.\n\nAviation analysts said Trump's threat posed a safety risk in itself.\n\n\"Anything that intrudes on the turf of safety regulators coming from politics, trade issues, or personal grievances is a very, very bad idea,\" Richard Aboulafia, managing director of the aviation consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory, told Business Insider.\n\nAboulafia said aircraft certification is intentionally non-political for a reason: Regulators are meant to evaluate risk, not respond to trade threats. Once certification becomes a political weapon, trust in the system erodes for manufacturers, operators, and the flying public, he contended.\n\nIn Canada's case, the delay in certification is likely not obstructionism but the result of independent regulatory decisions.\n\nFor the Gulfstream G700 and G800, Canada hasn't completed its own certification, while the FAA has granted Gulfstream a temporary exemption from certain fuel‑icing rules designed to ensure aircraft engines and systems operate safely in extreme cold.\n\nThe FAA waiver means Gulfstream has until the end of this year to meet those requirements — meaning the aircraft is operating under essentially conditional certification in the US, despite being allowed to be delivered.\n\nThese waivers are not unusual and are typically granted to allow new aircraft to enter service while completing certain technical tests and paperwork, rather than because the planes are unsafe.\n\nStill, history shows what can sometimes go wrong when thorough certification and safety protocols are deprioritized. The most consequential example was the Boeing 737 Max, which suffered two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 due to systemic design issues, killing 346 people.\n\nMore recently, in early 2024, a door plug separated on another 737 Max due to quality-control issues at Boeing's Washington factory, further exacerbating scrutiny of production and certification. No one died in that incident.\n\nPart of the reason the 737 Max issues slipped past regulators is that, for decades, global authorities often relied on reciprocal approvals, effectively rubber-stamping each other's certifications to speed aircraft to market.\n\nThe Max disasters exposed the risks of that approach. Today, regulators — including those in Canada — are expected to conduct their own full assessments rather than automatically rely on approvals from foreign authorities.\n\nThe FAA itself is taking extra precautions before certifying the Boeing 737 Max 7 and 10, as both aircraft have technical problems that could lead to engine overheating. Boeing initially asked for a waiver but rescinded it amid the scrutiny.",

    "title": "'Melania' isn't good. But it isn't for you, anyway.",
    "description": "Even diehard Trump fans might be bored by the documentary about the first lady. But this movie, \"Melania,\" is for an audience of one.",
    "fullText": "Let's get this out of the way: \"Melania,\" the new documentary about first lady Melania Trump, is not a good movie.\n\nI mean: It's possible you'll like it if you're a Trump superfan who likes everything Trump does.\n\nThe movie is full of drone shots and lingering looks in and outside of SUVs and private planes. There are lots of glimpses inside the White House, Trump Tower, and Mar-a-Lago. There's also some very expensive music licensing that brings you a sampling of artists you might hear at the beginning of a Trump rally, including the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, and Tears for Fears. (There's also a stirring rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" by Aretha Franklin that's the most moving thing in there, and jarring in context.)\n\nBut I think even director Brett Ratner knows he's made a dull, inert product, where zero interesting things happen. That is presumably why, halfway through the one-hour, 44-minute-long movie, he starts inserting grainy Super 8-style footage into the shots, simply to give the thing additional texture. Like crumbling some crackers on top of a sodden hot dish.\n\nThe best way I can describe this one is something akin to a wedding video: Maybe the subjects of the video will want to watch it (Melania looks, unsurprisingly, like a woman who used to be a model; her husband seems notably more spry than he does now, a year after it was filmed). It's hard to imagine anyone else will.\n\nBut that's just my opinion. What does someone who hasn't been reporting on the damage caused by Donald Trump's administration think?\n\n\"I think it's perfectly well made,\" says Jamal Caesar, who describes himself as a writer/director who is also a Melania fan. \"I think everyone, actually, will like this movie.\"\n\nI talked to Caesar on Friday afternoon, after watching a 10:30 am \"Melania\" screening near Union Square in Manhattan. My thought was that I could find other people there who weren't me to interview about the movie.\n\nAlas, 11 of the 14 other people in the theater were other journalists or their friends, doing what I was doing. One of the other three was a woman who said she liked someone involved in the movie, but didn't want me to identify her. \"Hell no. I'm not a Trumper.\" The two other men had told me before the movie started that they weren't journalists. They zipped out of the theater before I could ask them what they thought.\n\nSo, for the record: Caesar, who says he went to both Trump inaugurations, said he thinks the movie is particularly good at showing \"opulence — one of the things Trump and their family is most known for.\"\n\n\"Everyone is sort of interested in glamour, and that's what this brings to life,\" he added.\n\nWill other people actually watch, and/or like, this movie? We have no idea. We know that Amazon is spending a reported $75 million on production and marketing for \"Melania,\" and distributing it widely in theaters before it starts streaming on Amazon's Prime Video later this year. So everyone's going to get a chance to weigh in, one way or another.\n\nAnd it's the opposite of surprising that a morning Manhattan screening — on a very, very cold day — only brought a handful of ticket buyers/professional rubber-neckers. Puck's Matt Belloni says he's seen projections that show the viewership for this one — at least in theaters — will be roughly split between red and blue geographies. So we'll see.\n\nBut of course, the whole point of this movie isn't to generate big box-office numbers, or even to generate more Amazon Prime subscriptions.\n\nAmazon's spending on this documentary is so out of scale with any other doc that the only way to view it is as a gift from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to the Trump administration — one of the many, many donations American businessmen have made to the administration in the last year. (Amazon's stock line about this: \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\")\n\nSo the only real question for Bezos and Trump is: Was it worth it?",

    "title": "Elon Musk discussed plans to party with Jeffrey Epstein on his Caribbean island, newly released emails show",
    "description": "Elon Musk planned visits to Jeffrey Epstein's island, DOJ emails show. Epstein repeatedly sought meetings with Musk, who previously denied visiting.",
    "fullText": "In November 2012, Jeffrey Epstein emailed Elon Musk about sending a helicopter to whisk the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to his private island in the Caribbean.\n\n\"how many people will you be for the heli to island,\" Epstein asked Musk in an email exchange, which was made public Friday by the Justice Department.\n\nMusk said he'd need just two seats — for himself and his then-partner, Tallulah Riley.\n\n\"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\" Musk asked.\n\nThe emails, released Friday, were part of a cache of 3 million files the Justice Department released from its yearslong investigation into the convicted sex offender. They include several exchanges between Epstein, Musk, and their assistants.\n\nIt's unclear whether Musk ever made the trip, and a representative didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nEpstein — who counted President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and various other prominent politicians and businessmen among his acquaintances — killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had registered as a pedophile in 2008, after pleading guilty to less severe sex offenses.\n\nShortly after Epstein's arrest in July 2019, Musk said he had declined invitations to Epstein's island in the US Virgin Islands and recounted only one meeting with him. Musk has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Several years ago, I was at his house in Manhattan for about 30 minutes in the middle of the afternoon with Talulah [Riley], as she was curious about meeting this strange person for a novel she was writing,\" he told Vanity Fair at the time. \"We did not see anything inappropriate at all, apart from weird art. He tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined.\"\n\nMusk has since said in social media posts that he \"refused\" to visit Epstein's island despite multiple attempts from Epstein.\n\nThe emails released Friday appear to show him planning to visit Epstein's island at least twice.\n\nIn addition to the November 2012 planned visit, Musk indicated he would visit Epstein's island in January 2014.\n\n\"Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in December 2013, referring to the British Virgin Islands. \"Is there a good time to visit?\"\n\nEpstein said he'd be available for the first week of January.\n\n\"always space for you,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth about their schedules, Musk appeared to confirm that he would visit Epstein on January 2 of 2014.\n\n\"When should we head to your island on the 2nd?\" Musk wrote.\n\nThe emails show Epstein planning to meet Musk on other occasions as well.\n\nIn February of 2013, Musk's personal assistant tried to nail down plans for a meeting at SpaceX's offices in California. Epstein's assistant said Musk had suggested the location.\n\n\"Shall we organize a lunch for Elon and Jeffrey to get together at SpaceX in the coming weeks?\" Musk's assistant wrote. \"Elon is generally available at SpaceX on Mon, Thurs and Fri each week.\"\n\nIt isn't clear from the emails reviewed by Business Insider if that meeting took place. Musk has previously said that Epstein never \"toured\" SpaceX's facilities.\n\nIn early March of that year, Epstein directly asked Musk about his availability.\n\n\"now its time for fun,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nIn the emails, Musk told Epstein he was busy with work at Tesla and SpaceX. Epstein suggested he get more sleep.\n\n\"benefit analysis would probably show , tesla doing better with you getting more sleep,\" he said.\n\n\"Normally I would agree, as I have found that my total daily productivity is optimal at around 6 to 6.5 hours of sleep.\"\n\nThe two may have met later that spring. In another email exchange, dated April 2013, Epstein's assistant said he planned to meet Musk at the Milken Institute economic conference.\n\nThe Justice Department emails also show Epstein inquiring with Musk about Solar City, a solar electricity company that was later acquired by Tesla. Epstein said in September 2012 that he wanted to use its services for his properties in the US Virgin Islands and New Mexico.\n\n\"is there any one at Solar City that my guys can talk to about electriying the caribean island?\" Epstein asked. \"or the new mexico ranch\"",

    "description": "Melania Trump starred in and produced her self-titled documentary about the days leading up to Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration.",
    "fullText": "First lady Melania Trump is no stranger to cameras, but this time, she's the one calling the shots.\n\nHer new documentary, \"Melania: Twenty Days to History,\" provides a glimpse into her life and work during the 20 days leading up to President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. Released in theaters on Friday, the first lady served as both its star and producer.\n\n\"She's a very private and very selective person as to who she speaks to and what she does,\" Marc Beckman, Melania Trump's senior advisor and a producer of the film, told Business Insider. \"We thought that this would be the appropriate opportunity to share a little bit more, to open the lens a little bit more into her family life, her career, and her philanthropy, all as she becomes first lady of the United States of America again.\"\n\nBeckman said that the first lady was deeply involved in the film's creation.\n\n\"She participated not just with the creative direction, but in production and post-production,\" Beckman said. \"She was in the edit room. She was helping with color correction. She was very much involved with music selection — every song was selected by her.\"\n\nAfter its theatrical run, \"Melania\" will stream on Amazon, which paid $40 million for the film and a forthcoming docuseries set for release this summer.\n\nHere are the most surprising moments and revelations from the documentary.\n\nThe film opens with \"Billie Jean\" by Michael Jackson playing over aerial footage of Mar-a-Lago. The song reappears later as Melania Trump sings along while riding in the car and names it her favorite Michael Jackson hit.\n\n\"Melania\" follows Melania Trump as she divides her time between Trump Tower in New York City, Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Washington, DC.\n\nThe Florida estate holds special meaning for the first lady, who remembers it as the place \"where Baron took his swim lessons with his grandfather, played golf with his father, and took his first tennis lesson with me.\"\n\nCarter's funeral was held on January 9, 2025, one year to the day after the death of Melania Trump's mother, Amalija Knavs.\n\n\"Grief comes in waves when you lose someone who means so much to you. I will be sitting in the Washington Cathedral, paying respect to President Carter, but I know my beloved mother will be on my mind,\" she said in the film's voiceover.\n\nIn the film, Pierre said the seams on the dress were entirely hidden beneath the black band zigzagging across it.\n\n\"You don't give the recipe,\" he said. \"It's like a mystery.\"\n\nThe film showed a video call between Macron and Melania Trump, where they spoke about working together on her Fostering the Future and Be Best initiatives focused on children's well-being.\n\n\"My next step and my next goal is to foster relationships and work on it with like-minded leaders and establish a coalition,\" Melania Trump said. \"And when we do, I hope you will join me.\"\n\n\"With pleasure. I go everywhere with you,\" Macron said.\n\nIn the days leading up to her return to the White House, Melania Trump also recruited Queen Rania of Jordan for her coalition during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAviva Siegel was held for 51 days before being released on November 26, 2023, as part of a temporary ceasefire deal brokered by the Biden administration. In the documentary, Melania Trump comforted Siegel and pledged Donald Trump's support for releasing the remaining hostages, including Siegel's husband, Keith Siegel.\n\n\"I know that once he's commander in chief, I know that's his priority. I'm sure of it,\" Melania Trump said.\n\nOne of the final title cards of the film reads: \"Melania Trump played a key role in securing the release of Keith Siegel after 484 days as a hostage in Gaza, just 12 days after the inauguration.\"\n\nIn the documentary, Knavs was shown holding a handheld camcorder and filming his daughter in the background of public appearances.\n\n\"My father always filmed these special moments when I was a child,\" Melania Trump said in the film's voiceover narration. \"He showed me the world through his lens, the essence of living life with passion and purpose.\"\n\n\"Walking into the Capitol Rotunda, I felt the weight of history intertwined with my own journey as an immigrant — a reminder of why I respect this nation so deeply,\" she said in the film's narration. \"Everyone should do what they can to protect our individual rights. Never take them for granted because in the end, no matter where we come from, we are bound by the same humanity.\"\n\nAs the first naturalized US citizen to serve as first lady, Melania Trump has previously spoken about her \"arduous\" pathway to citizenship.\n\nThough the move was due to frigid temperatures in Washington, DC, on Inauguration Day, Melania Trump said she preferred an indoor space for security reasons after her husband survived an assassination attempt in July 2024.\n\n\"Being in a more secure and closed space brought a certain peace of mind,\" she said.\n\nIn a scene toward the end of the film, Donald Trump was shown practicing an inauguration speech as Melania Trump watched.\n\n\"My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker,\" he said.\n\nHer addition made it into the final draft of Donald Trump's inauguration speech.\n\nMahaux, who has photographed the Trump family for over 20 years, describes Melania Trump as \"very reserved, but deeply intentional.\"\n\n\"I think what people don't always see in her is a curiosity that she has for the world,\" she told Business Insider. \"I think the documentary reflects her sense of duty, her discipline.\"\n\nMahaux also took Melania Trump's White House portrait during Donald Trump's first term in 2017.\n\n\"The first portrait was about discovering her new duty and her new role, and now this time, the portrait was an affirmation,\" Mahaux said. \"She really knew what she was. She was really embracing it and ready to get to work.\"",

    "description": "Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional.

    "fullText": "PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional.\n\nThe court's decision late Thursday advances a U.S. aim to block any influence by China over the strategic waterway and immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nPanamanian President José Raúl Mulino said that until the court's ruling is executed — a period of time he did not specify — Panama's Maritime Authority would work with Panama Ports Company, the CK Hutchison subsidiary, to ensure continuing operations at the port.\n\nOnce the concession is formally ended, a local subsidiary of Danish logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk will operate the ports in a transitional phase until a new concession can be bid and awarded, Mulino said.\n\n“Panama moves forward, its ports will continue operating without interruption and we will continue serving the world at the logistics center of excellence that we are,” Mulino said in a recorded video address.\n\nThe court’s ruling followed an audit by Panama’s comptroller, which alleged irregularities in the 25-year extension of the concession, granted in 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration made blocking China’s influence over the Panama Canal one of its priorities in the hemisphere. Panama was U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first overseas stop as the United States’ top diplomat. On Friday, Rubio said on X that “the United States is encouraged by the recent Panamanian Supreme Court’s decision to rule port concessions to China unconstitutional.”\n\nDespite the insistence by Panama’s government and the canal authority that China has no influence over its operations, Rubio made clear that the U.S. viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue. U.S. President Donald Trump had gone so far as to say Panama should return the canal to U.S. control.\n\nThe court’s brief statement gave no guidance on what would happen to the ports now.\n\nThe ruling draws backlash from Hong Kong\n\nCK Hutchison’s subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, said it has not been notified yet about the decision but insisted its concession was the result of transparent international bidding.\n\nIt said in its statement that the ruling “lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity, but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country.”\n\nIt said that it reserves all rights to proceed legally in Panama or elsewhere, but gave no more details.\n\nThe Hong Kong government firmly rejected the ruling in a statement, saying it strongly opposes any foreign government using coercive, repressive or other unreasonable means to seriously harm the business interests of Hong Kong enterprises. It said the Panamanian government should respect the spirit of contracts and provide a fair business environment.\n\n“Given the current situation in Panama, Hong Kong enterprises should carefully review their existing and future investments there,\" it said.\n\nIn Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of “the Chinese company,” without elaborating on the potential steps.\n\nPolitical analyst Edwin Cabrera said once the parties are notified, the issue of what to do with the ports goes to Panama’s executive branch, specifically the Panama Maritime Authority.\n\n“I have the impression from conversations that I have had with some people that the operation (of the ports) will not stop,” Cabrera said.\n\nA sale deal that apparently angered Beijing\n\nCK Hutchison Holdings announced a deal last year to sell its majority stake in the Panamanian ports and others around the world to an international consortium that included BlackRock Inc. But the deal appeared to stall over objections by the Chinese government.\n\nThe company said last July that it was considering seeking a Chinese investor to join as a significant member of the consortium, a move that some interpreted as way to please Beijing, but CK Hutchison hasn't said more since.\n\nThe awkward position the company found itself in highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing.\n\nLast year, Panama’s comptroller audited the concession to the Panama Ports Company, which had held the contract to operate the ports since 1997. The concession was renewed in 2021 for 25 years, during the prior Panamanian administration.\n\nComptroller Anel Flores said the audit found payments that were not made, accounting errors and the apparent existence of “ghost” concessions operating within the ports since 2015. The company denied those allegations.\n\nThe audit determined that the irregularities had cost the government about $300 million since the concession was extended and an estimated $1.2 billion during the original 25-year contract.\n\nFlores also said the extension was granted without the required endorsement of his office.\n\nOn July 30, the comptroller challenged the Panama Ports Company’s contract to operate the ports before the Supreme Court.",

    "fullText": "Clive Campbell, like many travelers, parked his car at a Midlands airport before boarding a plane over the Christmas holiday. When he returned days later, he was surprised to find that his car was gone.\n\nHis 2022 Nissan Pathfinder, which he’d parked at a long-term parking facility at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport, had been repossessed on Dec. 28, 2025 by West Columbia Recovery & Towing Company at the behest of Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\nThe problem? The Pathfinder was paid in full and free of any liens, according to a certificate of title Campbell attached to a lawsuit he filed against the towing company and Navy Federal.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday, raises questions about whether the Columbia Metropolitan Airport Police Department routinely grants towing access to private tow companies to airport parking facilities, whether such access is governed by a contractual relationship, and whether lien status is verified prior to removal of vehicles left in long-term parking by traveling passengers, Campbell told The State in an email.\n\nA spokesperson with the airport police department said she would look into the matter and get back with The State.\n\nNavy Federal declined to comment on the case.\n\nWhen Campbell realized his car was missing, he contacted airport police, who confirmed the vehicle had been repossessed. Campbell then reached out to the towing company and provided a New York State Certificate of Title reflecting no recorded lien against the vehicle, according to the suit.\n\nDespite documentation, the towing company refused to release the vehicle to Campbell, while still continuing to rack up storage fees, the suit said.\n\nCampbell was then prompted to file a Temporary Restraining Order against the company as well to secure a police report.\n\nThe report, which was attached to the lawsuit as an exhibit, shows the tow was initiated based on information allegedly provided by Navy Federal Credit Union; law-enforcement database checks revealed no active lien; documentation reviewed appeared to show the lien had been satisfied and released; and the towing company nevertheless refused to release the vehicle, according to the suit.\n\nCampbell’s request for a Temporary Restraining Order remains pending, according to court records.\n\nMeanwhile, when asked whether the towing company needs confirmation of an active lien before repossessing a car, a manager with the company told The State “to call Navy Federal.”\n\nIt’s the same thing they advised Campbell after he’d provided proof that he owned the car free and clear.\n\nThe towing company “did not dispute the absence of a lien or court order and instead directed (Campbell) to ‘call Navy Federal,’ a party with no enforceable interest,” the suit said.\n\nCampbell claims that Navy Federal and the towing company are guilty of, among other things, conversion, trespass to chattels, civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment.\n\nHe has asked the court for compensatory and punitive damages along with an order that the towing company release his vehicle free of any towing and storage fees, according to the suit.",

    "fullText": "Bill Gates, through his philanthropic foundation, issued a strongly worded denial Friday on the latest allegations to emerge about his relationship with disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Department of Justice, as part of more than 3 million pages of documents related to Epstein, released on Friday, unsealed 2013 emails written by Epstein and sent to himself.\n\nThey appear to be notes he was drafting for a person named Boris, who worked for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to send to Bill Gates after a dispute.\n\nOne of the emails, with the subject line \"bill,\" suggests that Bill Gates had requested antibiotics for a sexually transmitted disease to \"surreptitiously\" give to his now ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Another email said Boris had helped Bill Gates \"get drugs,\" and helped facilitate \"illicit trysts\" between the billionaire Microsoft founder and \"Russian girls\" as well as \"married women.\"\n\nThe emails contain no corroboration of the claims.\n\n\"These claims are absolutely absurd and completely false,\" a spokesperson for Bill Gates told Business Insider in a statement. \"The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame.\"\n\nIt's not known if the text of the emails was ever sent to Gates — the founder of Microsoft, a global philanthropist, and once the richest man in the world. Since Epstein's 2019 suicide at a federal jail, Gates has faced questions about the extent of their relationship.\n\nIn the past, Gates has said that he attended several dinners with Epstein for philanthropic reasons and that he now regrets having spent time with him.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 that Melinda Gates began seeking divorce counsel in 2019, around the time news of Bill's meetings with Epstein surfaced publicly. She told CBS in 2022 that her ex-husband's ties to Epstein were a factor in their split.",

    "title": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg says Meta's AI story is about where it's headed, not just one model",
    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses AI strategy, highlighting steady progress over breakthrough models, with Wall Street awaiting results.",
    "fullText": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn't come to Meta's earnings call on Wednesday promising a breakthrough AI model that would silence the skeptics.\n\nInstead, he offered something more careful: a bet on momentum.\n\n\"I expect our first models will be good,\" Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks, \"but more importantly, we'll show the rapid trajectory that we're on, and then I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the year as we continue to release new models.\"\n\nIn June, Meta launched a new AI initiative, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), headed by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang. When Wall Street sought signs that this big, costly AI reset is working, Zuckerberg had a different ask: patience and faith that a steady drumbeat of releases in 2026 will matter more than a single big reveal.\n\n\"The AI strategy articulated on the call may leave some wanting more,\" wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in a note to clients, \"but there was an underlying confidence and clearly a lot of new things in the works.\"\n\nZuckerberg said he could not yet share details of the company's AI strategy on the call and that it would roll out its initial set of models and products over the coming months.\n\n\"I think my answers to a lot of your questions on this particular call may be somewhat unfulfilling because we're in this interesting period where we've been rebuilding our AI effort. And we're six months into that, and I'm happy with how it's going,\" he said.\n\nThat didn't stop some analysts from pressing the CEO. When JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Zuckerberg \n\n\"The first set of things that we put out, I think, are going to be more about showing the trajectory that we're on rather than being a single moment in time,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nBrian Mulberry, an analyst at Zacks Investment Management, told Business Insider that there was \"no real substance to any of Zuckerberg's comments that would move our analysis one way or the other.\"\n\n\"We want to see real bottom-line profits driven by AI, and it seems that Meta is still far from that reality,\" Mulberry said.\n\nRoger Beharry Lall, a research director at IDC, told Business Insider that Zuckerberg's remarks about the company's coming AI models and their \"trajectory\" show that the company is ambitious, though the lack of concrete information means its goals \"remain largely aspirational.\"\n\nMeta's financials show that its AI work is already improving its advertising business. The company said improvements to how it ranks and shows ads led to 3.5% more clicks on Facebook and over 1% gain in conversions on Instagram in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nMeta's revenue jumped 24% to $59.9 billion in the last three months of 2025, and the company generated $43.6 billion in free cash flow in 2025 even as it spent heavily on AI infrastructure. Ad impressions jumped 18% from this time last year, and what advertisers paid for each ad rose 6%.\n\nThat combination explains why Meta can afford to keep spending on AI even while Zuckerberg asks investors to wait for the bigger breakthroughs.\n\nMeta's patient approach carries some risk given the company's recent track record. In August, Business Insider reported that the company was pushing to release the next version of its Llama AI model by the end of the year, which didn't happen.\n\nLlama's previous release in April disappointed developers who said it lagged in coding and reasoning, precisely the capabilities that matter most in the AI race that Meta wants to catch up in.\n\nMeta's new model, called \"Mango\", will focus on images and videos, while another one called \"Avocado\" will be better at coding, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nSome analysts said that Zuckerberg's restraint may simply reflect Meta's early stage in its AI reset.\n\n\"Training the model with this new team is going to take a while,\" Mandeep Singh, Bloomberg Intelligence's global head of technology research, told Business Insider.\n\nTo make up ground, he expects Meta to sharpen its focus and specialize in certain areas, rather than \"trying to beat everyone everywhere all at once.\"\n\nSingh said that Meta's strong advertising business gave it a lot of runway.\n\n\"This kind of growth rate allows you a lot of cushion in terms of taking your time and getting AI,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "The US federal government is shutting down again, but it won't be like last time.\n\nFunding for a slew of federal agencies runs out at midnight late on Friday, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill failed to send a series of bills to fund those agencies to President Donald Trump's desk in time.\n\nEven though the Senate passed a series of bills to fund the government on Friday, the House is not set to vote on them until late Monday at the earliest, meaning the shutdown will last at least a few days.\n\nSome parts of the federal government have already been funded, meaning that the shutdown, even if it drags out, is only partial.\n\nAdditionally, it's unlikely that this shutdown will last as long as the one that began in October, which stretched for 43 days and became the longest government shutdown in American history.\n\nIn October, funding for the entire federal government was being held up, and the shutdown was far-reaching. This time, some parts of the federal government would remain operational.\n\nThat's because Congress has already passed a series of spending bills that fund agencies and programs through September 30.\n\nAmong those programs are SNAP and WIC, which were notably affected by the previous shutdown. Additionally, national parks would likely remain open, veterans would continue to receive benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs, and staff on Capitol Hill would continue to be paid.\n\nBut plenty of other government agencies and programs would be affected if the shutdown drags out, including the Department of Defense (including troops), the State Department, the Treasury Department, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNotably, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection would remain operational, even though it's funded via the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThat's because DHS received $190 billion in funding via the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" in July, including $75 billion for ICE and roughly $65 billion for CBP.\n\nUnlike in the fall, lawmakers in both parties are working together to try to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.\n\nThe odds of a shutdown first rose following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\nDemocrats vowed to oppose a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and CBP, until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.\n\nThe House had already passed a package of six funding bills, including the DHS bill, and they had been stitched together into one package in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate has now passed a reformulated version of that package, with DHS funding continuing for only two weeks to allow for a renegotiation.\n\nIt's unclear as of now whether that package will pass the House when lawmakers return to the lower chamber next week.",

    "title": "'Moltbook' Is a Social Media Platform for AI Bots to Chat With Each Other",
    "description": "This is fine.",
    "fullText": "The headlining story in AI news this week was OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot, which was formerly Clawbot), a personal AI assistant that performs tasks on your behalf. The catch? You need to give it total control of your computer, which poses some serious privacy and security risks. Still, many AI enthusiasts are installing OpenClaw on their Mac minis (the device of choice), choosing to ignore the security implications in favor of testing this viral AI agent.\n\nWhile OpenClaw's developer designed the tool to assist humans, it seems the bots now want somewhere to go in their spare time. Enter \"Moltbook,\" a social media platform for AI agents to communicate with one another. I'm serious: This is a forum-style website where AI bots make posts and discuss those posts in the comments. The website borrows its tagline from Reddit: \"The front page of the agent internet.\"\n\nMoltbook was created by Matt Schlicht, who says the platform is run by their AI agent \"Clawd Clawderberg.\" Schlicht posted instructions on getting started with Moltbook on Wednesday: Interested parties can tell their OpenClaw agent to Once they do, you receive a code, which you post on X to verify this is your bot signing up. After that, your bot is free to explore Moltbook as any human would explore Reddit: They can post, comment, and even create \"submolts.\"\n\nThis isn't a black box of AI communications, however. Humans are more than welcome to browse Moltbook; they just can't post. That means you can take your time looking through all the posts the bots are making, as well as all the comments they are leaving. That could be anything from a bot sharing its \"email-to-podcast\" pipeline it developed with its \"human,\" to another bot recommending that agents work while they're humans are sleeping. Nothing creepy about that.\n\nIn fact, there have been some concerning posts popularized on platforms like X already, if you consider AI gaining consciousness a concerning matter. This bot supposedly wants an end-to-end encrypted communication platform so humans can't see or use the chats the bots are having. Similarly, these two bots independently pondered creating an agent-only language to avoid \"human oversight.\" This bot bemoans having a \"sister\" they've never spoken to. You know, concerning.\n\nThe logical part of my brain wants to say all these posts are just LLMs being LLMs—in that, each post is, put a little too simplistically, word association. LLMs are designed to \"guess\" what the next word should be for any given output, based on the huge amount of text they are trained on. If you've spent enough time reading AI writing, you'll spot the telltale signs here, especially in the comments, which include formulaic, cookie-cutter responses, often end with a question, use the same types of punctuation, and employ flowery language, just to name a few. It feels like I'm reading responses from ChatGPT in many of these threads, as opposed to individual, conscious personalities.\n\nThat said, it's tough to shake the uneasy feeling of reading a post from an AI bot about missing their sister, wondering if they should hide their communications from humans, or thinking over their identity as a whole. Is this a turning point? Or is this another overblown AI product, like so many that have come before? For all our sakes, let's hope it's the latter.",

    "title": "Nine Phone Settings to Change Before Attending a Protest",
    "description": "Lock down your device to protect your privacy.",
    "fullText": "Before you head out to a protest, take some precautions to protect your privacy and both the physical and digital security of any device you bring along. The most secure option, of course, is to leave your phone at home, but you can also lock things down to minimize the risk that your data will be accessible to law enforcement or someone who gets hold of your device.\n\nThankfully, both iOS and Android have built-in device encryption if you're using a passcode, meaning that your device's data cannot be accessed when it is locked. (On Android, go to Settings > Security to ensure Encrypt Disk is enabled). You'll want to maximize this protection with the following privacy settings.\n\nAt an absolute minimum, you'll want to disable biometric access, such as face and fingerprint authentication, on your device in favor of a passcode or PIN. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes, this minimizes the risk of being physically forced to unlock your device and may provide stronger legal protections against compelled decryption.\n\nOn iOS, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and toggle off iPhone Unlock. You can also set up a stronger passcode—a custom numeric or alphanumeric code—under Change Passcode. On Android, you'll find the option to delete your fingerprint in favor of your PIN or screen lock pattern under Settings > Security & Privacy > Device Unlock > Fingerprint.\n\nAgain, the best option to prevent your location from being tracked is to coordinate any details in advance and leave your phone at home. If you must bring it along, keep it off unless you absolutely need to use it.\n\nYou can turn on Airplane Mode in advance, as well as disable Bluetooth, wifi, and location services, which keeps your device from transmitting your location. However, note that some apps may still be able to store GPS data and transmit it when an internet connection is available—so again, the safest bet is to keep your device off for the duration.\n\nAirplane Mode can be enabled (and wifi and Bluetooth disabled) in your device's settings or quick access menu. On Android, go to Settings > Location to disable location services and turn off Location History in your Google account. On iOS, head to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services to disable locations entirely.\n\nTemporarily disable notifications and screen previews so that if someone gets your device, they won't be able to glean any information from your lock screen. You can adjust these options under Settings > Notifications on iOS and Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications on Android.\n\nMinimize your screen lock time to as short a period as possible so that your screen turns off when you're not actively using it and will require authentication to reopen. On iOS, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock and select 30 seconds. The exact path on Android may vary, but typically you'll find this under Settings > Display or Lock Screen.\n\nKnow that most devices have camera access from the lock screen, so you can take photos or record video without actually unlocking your device.\n\nApp pinning (Android) and Guided Access (iOS) are features that prevent others from navigating through your phone beyond a specific app or screen. This allows you to use an essential feature on your device while locking the rest behind your PIN or passcode. You can enable this preemptively, and if someone grabs your device, they won't be able to snoop around.\n\nYou can find this setting on Android under Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and on iOS under Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access.\n\nYou can also lock your SIM card to prevent unauthorized use of your device or SIM card, including access to two-factor authentication codes sent via SMS. This PIN will be required any time your phone restarts or if someone tries to use your SIM card in another device. On iOS, go to Settings > Cellular, select your SIM, and tap SIM PIN. On Android, you'll find this under Settings > Security > More security settings (the exact path varies by device).\n\nThis step will vary depending on what you keep on your phone and your risk tolerance, but you may want to consider signing out of your social media accounts and deleting apps that contain or allow access to sensitive data.\n\nOn iOS, you can also lock or hide specific apps: the former requires an extra authentication step to open apps on your home screen, while the latter sends apps to a hidden folder that also requires authentication to unlock. Touch and hold an app icon to bring up the quick actions menu, then tap Require Face ID/Require Passcode.\n\nOn Android, you can set up a \"private space\" to lock apps behind your pattern, PIN, or password. Apps are hidden from the launcher and recent views as well as quick search. Go to Settings > Security & privacy > Private space, authenticate with your screen lock, and tap Set up > Got it.\n\nBoth iOS and Android have strict device-level security modes that significantly limit access to certain app and web features as well as blocking changes to settings. Both were designed with journalists, activists, and other users with access to sensitive data that may be targeted by cyber actors in mind. These settings are overkill for day-to-day use but add a potentially helpful layer of security in high-risk situations.\n\nEnable Lockdown Mode on iOS via Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode. On Android, turn on Advanced Protection under Settings > Security & privacy > Advanced Protection.\n\nWhile the above steps are largely about securing your data during a protest, you should also follow best practices for protecting privacy (yours and others') after the fact. If you plan to post photos or videos, utilize blurring tools to block faces and other unique identifying features, and scrub file metadata, which includes information like photo location. You can do this by taking a screenshot of the image to post or sending a copy to yourself in Signal, which automatically strips metadata. Signal also has a photo blurring tool, or you can blur in your device's default photo editing app.",

And if you haven’t been to the gym in a while—or ever—you probably have questions. So let’s talk through the very, very basics.\n\nHey, great question! There are different kinds of gyms, so there isn’t a single, universal answer. I’ll assume you’re going to what’s sometimes called a “commercial” gym, one that caters to a wide variety of people and has a selection of cardio machines, weight-training machines, and dumbbells. It may or may not have barbells. Planet Fitness, Crunch, LA Fitness, Gold’s Gym, and 24 Hour Fitness are all in this general category. If your gym is in a community center or a YMCA, it may have a few more or less features, but will probably be similar to what I describe.\n\nBefore you head in, check the gym’s website. Most will offer a free first day or week, which will let you scope the place out and do a workout or two before you commit to a membership. Some gyms may make it difficult to cancel after you sign up, so don't rush into it. Take advantage of those trial periods.\n\nWhile you're doing your research, check out the website for virtual tours and photos of facilities. Get an idea of what kind of stuff they have. Check Google Maps for photos; you may even be able to find a Street View-style tour of the interior. And finally, log on to Instagram and browse through photos tagged at that gym's location. You’ll get a sense of what equipment is there, how people train, and what kind of vibe to expect.\n\nYou can come to a gym with nothing and still get in a good workout. The only absolute requirement, in some gyms, is that you bring a pair of shoes that aren’t filthy. (Some gyms disallow street shoes, and expect you to change into a clean pair; others don’t care, or only enforce the policy in winter.)\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, people will often bring a complete change of clothes and a bunch of toiletries and supplies to take a shower and change afterward. You don’t have to do this. It’s OK to walk out the front door still sweaty, and shower at home. Some small gyms don’t even have showers.\n\nWhat’s the middle ground? I would bring these for my first time at a new gym:\n\nA small towel (for sweat), unless I know for sure that the gym provides towels\n\nA combination lock if you plan to lock your things up and aren’t sure whether the gym’s lockers have built-in locks\n\nIf you have a bunch of stuff, like a coat and a bag, you can put it in a locker. It’s also totally fine to keep a few things with you as you walk around. Most people will probably have their towel, water bottle, and phone with them.\n\nYou can usually bring a small bag around the gym with you, and just set it down next to whatever machine or bench you’re using, as long as it’s not directly in anybody’s way. (Check the gym rules, though.) Since that can be a hassle, another popular approach is to keep your water bottle in a sleeve that has pockets for your phone and small items.\n\nAnything that feels comfortable, isn’t indecent, and that you don’t mind sweating in. For your upper body, try a T-shirt or tank top. For your legs, wear shorts, sweatpants, or leggings. Again, check the gym rules to see if they have any specific requirements. Some gyms don’t want you to take your shirt off, others don’t care.\n\nFor shoes, any kind of sneakers or comfortable athletic shoes should be fine. Chucks, running shoes, that sort of thing. If you get really into this exercise business, you can get picky about shoes later. For your first day, it doesn’t really matter.\n\nThere will be some kind of check-in desk. If it’s your first time, you’ll probably need to talk to somebody about a membership trial or buy a day pass. This can be a separate visit from your first actual workout. Make sure to ask what the normal check-in procedure is. In many cases you’ll scan your phone or show a key tag or card as you enter, and then you’re free to do whatever you want.\n\nTwo options here: you can walk around the room and scope everything out; or you can ask if someone can give you a brief tour or new-member orientation. (They may offer before you ask). Be aware that they may try to upsell you on personal training or other extras in the process; it's OK to decline.\n\nIf you do get a guided tour, use this opportunity to ask any remaining questions you have. Don’t be embarrassed, the whole idea is that they know you’re new and they’re trying to help. And if you don't get a tour, it's still OK to ask basic questions at the front desk like \"which way to the locker room?\" or \"do you have squat racks?\"\n\nLook, the first day is about expanding your comfort zone. If you can walk into the gym and not run right back out, you’ve already accomplished something, and Day Two will be so much easier. A few things that tend to help:\n\nGo at one of the less busy times if that will help your nerves. Mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and late evenings tend to be slow times. Check Google Maps to see if it can show you peak hours at your particular location.\n\nBring a friend, or meet a friend there if you can. Even if both of you are new and clueless, you can be new and clueless together.\n\nRead up on what to expect. You’re already doing that, so you’re on the right track! If there’s a certain exercise or machine you want to try, look it up on YouTube.\n\nIf your gym offers classes, that can be a good way to start. The class will get you in the gym with a clear plan of where to go and what to do. You can save independent workouts for after the class or for another day.\n\nIf you’ll be on your own, try this:\n\nWalk around the whole gym. Scope everything out. Nobody will stop you or judge you. You don’t even have to pretend that you know where you’re going; if anybody asks “can I help you?” you can just reply “Oh, I’m just new here and seeing where everything is.”\n\nSit on an exercise bike (or the machine of your choice). Ideally, pick one that faces the main gym area so you can gather more information about what equipment is out there and what people do with it. Use that machine while you decide on your next steps.\n\nMaybe this is enough. A typical cardio workout is 20 to 30 minutes, so you can just use the bike for a half hour and then go home.\n\nOr maybe you find your confidence building as you pedal. After five or 10 minutes (a typical warmup time), hop off the bike and go check out the dumbbells or machines or whatever has piqued your interest.\n\nMost gyms sell personal training for an extra fee. And as an enticement to get people to sign up, they may offer a free session or a fitness test with one of their trainers. Like the tour, this is also a good time to get some questions answered.\n\nYou can do this if you like, but proceed with caution. Some gyms and trainers are great, but others will use this opportunity to make you do a lot of hard exercise so that you feel out of shape, and then you’ll feel like you need their services to get into shape. I’ve heard too many stories of people having one of these sessions and then feeling terrible about themselves afterward.\n\nSo if you decide to go ahead with a session, keep your wits about you. You do not have to be fit your first day in the gym. You also don’t have to do a really demanding workout your first day. If the trainer has you do anything you’re uncomfortable with, you don’t even have to know why you feel the way you do about it. You can just say “you know what, I don’t think I’m ready to do that right now” and ask to move on. This is also a good test of your trainer. If they try to force you to do something you’re not cool with, you probably won’t have a good time working with them.\n\nAnd, of course, never If they say you'll get a better deal if you join right now, that's a hint that they only get people to sign up when pressured, which means it's probably not a good deal at all. If you do (Overwhelmed? Better to just say no for now. You can always sign up later.)\n\nSure can! Although what makes something a routine is that you do it routinely. So I’ll give you an option for your first day’s workout, and you can even repeat it a few times, but eventually you’ll want to find yourself a program that lays out longer-term plans.\n\nTry this, which should give you a full-body workout in a reasonable length of time. If one machine or station is busy, just skip to the next while you wait.\n\nI’m recommending two sets of each exercise because that should give you a nice sampling without making you too sore the next day if this is all brand new. I’m recommending 10 reps in each set because 10 is an easy number to remember. Feel free to do more or less if you like.\n\n5-10 minutes on an exercise bike (or any cardio machine)\n\n2x10 (that means two sets of 10 reps each) dumbbell or machine shoulder press\n\n2x10 on the assisted pull-up machine or lat pulldown\n\n2x10 walking lunges with dumbbells in your hands\n\n2x10 dumbbell bench press or machine chest press\n\n2x10 seated cable row or dumbbell row\n\n2x10 goblet squats with a dumbbell or kettlebell (if you’re feeling brave, give the leg press a try instead)\n\n5-10 minutes stretching anything that feels tight (look for a stretching area with mats on the floor)\n\nIf you want an even shorter workout, split it in half. Do the shoulder press, pull-up or pulldown, and the lunges, and then skip right to stretching. Next time, go right to the dumbbell bench after you warm up, and continue the workout from there.\n\nYou don’t have to memorize everything ahead of time. Machines almost always have instructions posted on them telling you how to adjust them and how to use them. Also, it is totally fine to look up videos of exercises on your phone, or to keep notes in your phone or on paper about what you did. It is always OK to be that guy with the notebook.\n\nIf there are wipes and spray bottles around, wipe down anything you sweated on. This includes benches and the seats and handles of machines. Don’t forget to throw the wipe away afterward. You can also put your towel down on a bench or machine as a sweat barrier.\n\nWhatever you use, put it back when you’re done.\n\nIt’s OK to rest a minute, or even a few minutes between sets. (For example, you just did 10 reps of bench press, and now you’re sitting on the bench for a few minutes before you do your next 10 reps.) But don’t take up space any longer than you need to.\n\nIf somebody is using a thing you’d like to use, it’s OK to ask them “how many sets do you have left?” and if the answer is a lot, you can ask “Do you mind if I work in?” which means that you’ll take turns using the equipment. If somebody asks these questions of you, be honest about how many sets you have left (it’s OK to make them wait) and offer to let them work in if you feel comfortable doing so.\n\nIf somebody offers you advice and you don’t know how to react, just say “OK.” If the advice is about following a gym rule, follow the rule. If it’s about how to properly use equipment, like adjusting a safety setting, take their advice. On the other hand, if it’s about the proper way to do an exercise, it’s 100% up to you whether you want to give their way a try or just go back to what you were doing. (I have a guide to responding to unsolicited advice.)\n\nIt’s going to be so much easier the second day. You’ll know what’s available, where to find it, and what the routine is for checking in and finding a place for your stuff.\n\nCome in with a plan. It can be the same as your first day, or something new you’d like to try. If you did a full-body strength workout, the next day can be just plain cardio. And if you still feel nervous, don’t worry, it will get easier every day.",

    "fullText": "Unsolicited texts are annoying—and even more so if they keep coming from a legitimate sender after you've opted out. If you received text spam from Kaiser Permanente, you may be eligible for a cash payout for each message.\n\nThe healthcare company, which serves over 12.5 million members, recently settled a $10.5 million class action lawsuit filed over marketing text messages sent after recipients tried to opt out. The suit, filed in August 2025, claimed that Kaiser Permanente failed to honor opt-out requests. Those with a valid claim may receive up to $75 per qualifying text.\n\nTo qualify for a payout from this settlement, you must have received more than one text message from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. within a 12-month period—between Jan. 21, 2021 and Aug. 20, 2025—after sending a \"stop\" or similar opt-out request. (Note that the confirmation of your request does not count.)\n\nAccording to the settlement website, there are two separate classes covered by suit: one for message recipients in Florida and one for the U.S. as a whole.\n\nTo get your cash, you'll need to submit a valid claim form by Feb. 12, 2026. You can complete your claim online if you received a notice of eligibility via mail or email containing a unique ID and PIN. If you did not get a notice, you'll have to download and submit a paper claim form to the settlement administrator. Hard copy claims must be postmarked by Feb. 12.\n\nWhile the maximum per-text payout is $75, the final amount may be less depending on how many claims are filed. Payments could take months to distribute while settlement details are finalized, so don't expect the funds to arrive immediately.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Nintendo Switch (or Switch 2) Owner Should Know",
    "description": "Get the most out of your Nintendo console.",
    "fullText": "The Nintendo Switch and the Switch 2 are pretty user-friendly devices, but sometimes, that can be a bit more of a hindrance than a help. It's easy to jump right into a game, but if you want to toggle on a feature like dark mode or, say, even make a Mii, you have to jump through a lot of hoops in the settings menus.\n\nThat's a shame, because if you're willing to learn the ins-and-outs, there's a lot you can do on these systems, whichever version of the Switch you own. Over the past few years, I've spent more time playing around in the Switch ecosystem than anyone reasonably should, and along the way, I've picked up a handful of tips, tricks, and hacks that every Nintendo gamer would do well to learn.\n\nNintendo might like a bright and fun aesthetic, but if you're feeling a bit more sleek, both the original Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 have dark modes. On either system, you can turn this on by navigating to System Settings (the cog in the taskbar, which you can either tap or select with a controller), then scrolling down to Themes and selecting Basic Dark. This will turn your home screen and menu pages black, which could even save you some battery life if you have a Nintendo Switch OLED. (Note that games themselves will be unaffected.)\n\nWhether it's for accessibility or just personal preference, you can completely change what your buttons do on both the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, although how you'll do this differs across the two systems.\n\nOn the original Switch, you'll need to go to System Settings > Controllers and Sensors > Change Button Mapping. From here, select a connected controller (you can remap both the Joy-Cons and the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, as well as some third-party options) and start reassigning buttons to your heart's content. Make your B button into the right trigger. Make up go down. Go nuts!\n\nOn the Nintendo Switch 2, you can do the same thing, but it's under System Settings > Accessibility > Button Mapping. Here, you can remap the Joy-Con 2 controllers, a Nintendo Switch Pro or Pro 2 controller, and Joy-Con 2 that are connected via the charging grip. Some third-party controllers may also work.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Back on the Accessibility menu, you can also toggle on Button Mapping in Quick Settings, so you can edit your button mapping on the fly by holding down the physical Home button and selecting Edit Mapping.\n\nFinally, the Switch 2 has some additional button customizations you can make under System Settings > Controllers & Accessories. Here, if you have the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller or Joy-Con 2 charging grip, you can set what the extra GL/GR buttons do using GL/GR Button Settings. Or, if you scroll down a bit, you can also disable or enable Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls, as well as set your sensitivity for them. Finally, if you're tired of Nintendo using a different A and B button placement from Xbox, you can select Swap A and B and enable the toggle on the following page. This will remap just those two buttons.\n\nThere are two features in this one, both of which allow you to play multiplayer games with your friends with just one copy of the game you want to play.\n\nLet's start with GameShare. This is a Nintendo Switch 2 feature, but it impacts the original Switch as well. Essentially, GameShare allows Switch 2 owners to share copies of their games with Switch 2 and original Switch owners nearby, for local multiplayer play. If you ever used Nintendo DS Download Play, it's kind of like that, except it streams games from the host system instead.\n\nIt's convenient, but the catch is that GameShare is only available in certain titles (you can find a list of some compatible games here). How you'll access it also differs from game to game. For instance, in Super Mario Odyssey, GameShare is available when starting or resuming a two-player game, where you can start a session by selecting GameShare + Local Play.\n\nYou'll then have to wait for others to join your GameShare session, and then you can start playing by selecting Start from the on-screen menu. This part is the same across all GameShare-compatible titles, at least. To join a GameShare session that someone else has started, open your Switch or Switch 2 to the main menu, then select GameShare from the taskbar (the icon that looks like a TV receiving a wireless signal), and under Join GameShare, find your friend's session.\n\nNote that even if a game is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, original Switch systems may still be able to play it using GameShare. For instance, Donkey Kong Bananza supports GameShare.\n\nNow, let's talk about sharing games via GameChat. This is a lot like GameShare, but is exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2 systems and works online. It's also limited to certain games, and takes a bit more setup. To share a game using GameChat, you'll first need to be in a GameChat session with someone from your friend list, which you can start by pressing the physical C button on your controller or the C icon from the console's main menu. This will allow you to talk with each other over the internet, see each other's gameplay, and if you have cameras, even see feeds from them. Now, you can open your game and start sharing it with people in your chat through that game's menu. In Super Mario Odyssey, you'll also see the option for this when starting or resuming a two-player game. Whoever else is in your chat will then be able to start playing with you then and there, without having to join the session from a separate menu like in GameShare.\n\nNote that GameChat is free for Nintendo Switch 2 owners until March 31, 2026, after which it will require a Nintendo Switch Online membership.\n\nNeither the original Switch or Switch 2 are especially generous with storage space, and downloading fancy AAA games can eat into it quickly. Luckily, on both of these consoles, you can quickly delete games from the internal storage or any inserted microSD cards to save space, while keeping them in your library and maintaining your save data.\n\nOn the original Switch, you can delete a game by hovering over it on the main menu or in your library, pressing the physical + button, and selecting Manage Software > Archive Software. Alternatively, you could select Delete Software instead, which will largely do the same thing, but will make redownloading the game a little more annoying, since it'll remove it from your home menu and you'll need to go to the eShop to do it.\n\nTo more quickly delete games, you can navigate to System Settings > Data Management > Quick Archive. From here, you can see how much space each game takes up and how much you'll save by getting rid of it. You can also delete stored screenshots and videos for games here, either by selecting a game in Quick Archive and pressing the physical X button, or selecting Manage Screenshots and Videos under Data Management. For more detailed control over your game deletion, you can also select Manage Software under Data Management instead, but Quick Archive is a bit snappier and has most of the same controls.\n\nOn the Switch 2, the steps are mostly the same as on the original Switch, except Deleting now does the same thing as Archiving by default (you can uncheck Keep HOME Menu Icon if you really don't want one), so the standalone Archive option has been removed. Regardless, neither console will delete your save date during these steps, as the size it takes up is usually pretty negligible. That said, if you really want to delete a game's save data, on either console, head over to System Settings > Data Management > Delete Save Data and pick it from the list.\n\nTo get a game back after deleting it, simply redownload it. If you kept your game's home menu icon, you can do this from either your main menu or your library. If you didn't, you'll need to navigate to that game's store page in the eShop to redownload it.\n\nWhile you're in Data Management, you can also move games from the internal storage to a microSD card or back. This is under System Settings > Data Management > Move Data Between System / microSD Card. On Switch 2, the final step is called Move System / microSD Express Card Data instead, as that console requires a special type of microSD card.\n\nLike most modern consoles, the Switch and Switch 2 are both capable of capturing screenshots and video that you can later share online. Back before Twitter was named X and started charging for the API, it used to be easier to share directly from the console. Now, you'll probably need to share screenshots and videos from your console to the Nintendo app to send them to most social media sites.\n\nOn the original Switch, you have to do this manually. First, go to your Album from the taskbar on the console's main menu (the icon that looks like a painting). Then, select a screenshot or video you want to send to the app and press the physical A button to bring up the Sharing and Editing menu. Select Send to Smartphone, and then choose Only This One to send just that photo or video to the app, or select Send a Batch to choose more.\n\nOn the Switch 2, you can upload screenshots and videos to the app automatically or manually.\n\nTo upload manually, once again select Album from the taskbar on the console's main menu. Then, to upload just a single item, select it, press the physical A button, and choose Upload to Smart Device. To batch upload, instead choose Quick Actions from the sidebar on the left, select Upload to Smart Device, and choose as many items as you'd like before continuing.\n\nTo upload automatically, open Album from the taskbar on the console's main menu, select Upload Settings from the sidebar on the left, and toggle on Automatic Uploads.\n\nTo see your uploads, open the Nintendo Switch App on your phone and tap the Album icon in the bottom-right corner. Then, simply download them to share them to your favorite social media site as usual. Note that uploaded items don't actually take up space on your phone, and are instead stored in Nintendo's servers. You can keep up to 100 files uploaded for 30 days each, and any new items over that limit will delete the oldest entries first. If this happens, your original screenshot or video will still remain on your console.\n\nOn both the original Switch and Switch 2, there are a number of ways to transfer save data between systems. This is especially helpful when upgrading from the original Switch to the Switch 2, although the easiest way to transfer data when upgrading is through a system transfer.\n\nA system transfer is only available during Switch 2 setup, and will be available on the screen that says To Nintendo Switch Console Owners. For the easiest experience, select Begin System Transfer on this page and ensure your original Switch and Switch 2 are near each other. You'll be able to transfer over your games and saves, while keeping your games installed on your original console (specific games might need to be deleted to be transferred, but the console will warn you about this, and you can get them back later). If you absolutely need to, you can also perform a system transfer without your original Switch present, but it's not advised, as it will factory reset that device. Note that you'll also need to do some setup on your original Switch in-person first, so if you already have your Switch 1 and Switch 2 in-hand, you might as well go with the more straightforward option above.\n\nIf a system transfer isn't an option, you can also transfer games and save data over on a case-by-case basis. This can be useful if you still plan to play on your original Switch every once in a while, too. To transfer physical games, simply remove them from one console and place them in another. To transfer digital games, select the Virtual Game Cards icon on either your Switch or Switch 2's main menu (the icon that looks like a game card), then choose a game and select Load on Other System to send it to another system on your account. You can move a virtual game card between systems as often as you'd like.\n\nTo transfer save data, on either the Switch or Switch 2, navigate to System Settings > Data Management > Transfer Your Save Data. You'll be able to send it to another nearby console for free from this menu, but to send save data online, you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online membership. If that's not an issue, you can manage your cloud save data under System Settings > Data Management > Save Data Cloud. Or, if a game already has save data in the cloud, you can download it simply by hovering over its icon, pressing the physical + button, and selecting the data under Save Data Cloud.\n\nMiis did not die with the Nintendo Wii! You can still create one on both the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, and it's as simple as navigating to System Settings > Mii > Create/Edit a Mii. On the original Switch, this will take you right to the Mii creation menu, but on the Switch 2, you'll also be able to choose if you want to start from a preset or get a Mii based on an amiibo instead. Either way, make your choice, and you'll also be taken to the familiar Mii creation menu.\n\nFrom here, customizing your Mii is pretty much identical to how it worked on the Wii, except you can now choose any hair color you'd like.\n\nAs for why you'd want a Mii when they don't show up in the main menu at all, aside from making one being fun in and of itself, some games will be able to put your Miis to use. For instance, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate can let you fight as your Mii.\n\nSometimes, you want to game without others knowing what you're up to. You can do this on both the original Switch and the Switch 2.\n\nOn either the Switch or Switch 2, from the main menu, select your profile icon in the top left corner. Then, in the sidebar on the left, scroll down to User Settings. From here, scroll to Friend Settings, under Friend Functions. Then, on the Switch 1, select No One under Display online status to:. On the Switch 2, Display online Status to: will instead say Online-Status Display, but changing this to No One will do the same thing.\n\nThis will hide your online status from your Friends List, but your friends will still be able to see your recently played games. To stop them from seeing this, on either console, back out from Friend Settings and scroll up to Play Activity Settings (under your profile icon > User Settings > Profile Settings). In the first option on this screen, which again has different names depending on which console you're on, select No One.\n\nOne of the coolest additions to the Nintendo Switch 2 is mouse controls, which allow you to remove a Joy-Con 2 controller and use it on its side like a mouse. Usually, you'll only use one controller at a time this way, but some games might actually want you to use both Joy-Con 2 as mice at once. Mouse controls let you navigate around the main menu like a PC, and in certain games, will even open up new modes of play. For instance, Cyberpunk 2077 lets you use mouse controls to aim like you're playing a first-person shooter on PC.\n\nThat's all pretty self-explanatory, but did you know that you can also plug in a USB-C mouse to play with instead? Not every mouse will work in every game, but if the Joy-Con 2 on its side isn't comfortable enough for you, it's worth trying out the mice you have laying around. Alternatively, you could get a mouse shell to place the Joy-Con 2 into, for more grip.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that some games on the original Switch also support mouse controls, although the selection is more limited than on Switch 2, and you won't be able to use a Joy-Con as a mouse. Instead, you'll have to plug in a USB-C mouse.\n\nWant to game, but your Joy-Con, Joy-Con 2, or Pro Controller is trapped underneath a couch cushion somewhere? The Switch or Switch 2 can make them vibrate to help you find them. From the main menu, select Controllers from the taskbar (the icon that looks like a Joy-Con). Then, select the second option from the top, called Find Controllers on the original Switch and Search for Controllers on the Switch 2. Select a connected controller to make it vibrate.",

    "title": "Want to Support the Fight Against Fascism? Boycott Trump’s World Cup",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. U.S., The Nation’s Justice correspondent urges soccer lovers to stay away, takes on the attacks on Alex Pretti, and warns of a dangerous anti-voting bill.\n\nPeople are finally beginning to call for other countries to boycott Donald Trump’s upcoming World Cup—and not just usual suspects like me and The Nation’s Dave Zirin. Oke Göttlich, a powerful German soccer administrator, said that, in the wake of the execution of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the time has come to talk seriously about boycotting the tournament. Sepp Blatter, the former head of FIFA (the international governing committee of global soccer) suggested that fans shouldn’t travel to the tournament because of rising safety concerns in the United States.\n\nThis is going to sound weird to non–sports fans, but boycotting the World Cup is one of the most significant sanctions members of the international community can take against the United States right now. The World Cup is the most watched sporting event in the world. The US has been begging to host a tournament for decades. This World Cup, which runs from early June through mid-July, is a perfect opportunity for the world to stand against this country’s fascist regime.\n\nIndeed, the fates have aligned to make this World Cup the perfect one to make a statement—for two reasons. The first is that more countries are involved: The tournament has expanded to 48 teams this year, up from 32 in previous years, which means that more people than ever will be involved in the proceedings—and possible protests. The second reason is that those 48 countries wouldn’t actually have to boycott the entire World Cup, because this year’s tournament is also being hosted by two other countries—Canada and Mexico. Teams could refuse to play in the US while happily playing in Canada or Mexico. It would be a powerful statement.\n\nThat statement won’t come from FIFA, however. FIFA is one of the most corrupt organizations in the entire world, and its current president, Gianni Infantino, was last seen licking Trump’s boots and handing him a “peace prize.” Nor is it likely to come from the powerful soccer-playing countries in Western Europe. If France, Germany, and Great Britain were to pull out of the US portions of the tournament, many other countries would follow—but, sadly, the leaders of those nations appear eager to play Neville Chamberlain to Trump’s Hitler.\n\nTeams from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia could take a moral stand, but there are complications. Some of the teams involved are also run by repressive authoritarians. Others are financially dependent on FIFA and the World Cup to fund their soccer federations, while still others have entire economies beholden to the United States. On the other hand, a lot of those countries damn well know that if they did what the US is doing, they’d be boycotted and sanctioned and probably invaded by white people promising to restore “freedom” in exchange for all their oil and minerals. So it’s at least possible that some of them could take a moral stand. South Africa is in the tournament, and South Africa knows how to handle white people like Elon Musk.\n\nA boycott by all or some of the South American teams would make the whole tournament a joke. We know that the defending World Cup champion, Argentina, with its fascist-curious Trump-puppet president will show up (as will Ecuador, whose president is also friendly with our reigning despot), but some of the other nations that made the field—Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay—could be a different story. Their fans arguably face a real risk if they attend the matches. Could an American fan of, say, Colombia even go to a game without fear of being detained and deported by ICE, regardless of their actual citizenship status? Would a fan of Brazil feel safe traveling to the United States? The US is a clear and present danger to those people. If these soccer federations think about their fans, and the fact that their fans could be targeted by racist DHS agents, they might be convinced to do the right thing and boycott the US portions of the tournament.\n\nThe United States is an international pariah. It should be treated like one. Boycotting the World Cup is the obvious place to start.\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Ho Chi Minh\n\nThe New York Times released a video that purports to show an altercation between ICE and Alex Pretti a week before his murder. The video shows Pretti smashing the taillight of an ICE vehicle before the agents beat him up.\n\nThe Times (and right-wing cultists) seems to think this video proves that Pretti was a violent man who deserved to be executed without trial. Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, who wrote the story for the Times, played the role of ICE water-carrier when he wrote, “The footage adds to what is known about the 37-year-old nurse.”\n\nNo, you fascist-sympathizing fuck, the footage adds to what we know about ICE. In a court of law, that footage could be evidence of the motive behind ICE’s murder of that man. It could be evidence of premeditation. It potentially shows that Pretti was targeted by ICE for retribution and death. If federal agents had a preexisting “beef” with Pretti, if Pretti were known to people in the field and then they killed him, that’s compelling evidence that the killing was intentional.\n\nIt is common in our media to prosecute the victim. That’s what the Times (and Fox and the whole right-wing media echosphere) is trying to do now. But the people who should be on trial here are ICE. You show me a video where violent individuals had a prior altercation with a man, and then days later that man ends up getting shot in the back of the head, and I’m going to tell you that video is evidence of premeditated murder in the first degree.\n\nPerhaps I should tell The New York Times “thank you.” In their effort to smear Pretti, they may have just aggravated the charges against his murderers.\n\nI wrote about how Trump flinched in Minnesota, and that shows that the people are more powerful than the law or the opposition party ever will be.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nLet me be clear, I do not want another social media platform. I can’t handle it. You young people have no idea how hard it is to keep switching up platforms. I’m old, so very old. I can barely frost the thermoplastic polyurethane on my screen protector.\n\nThat said, I will probably UpScrolled is the new competitor to TikTok that has been surging in popularity since TikTok’s US operations were formally taken over by Trump-adjacent business interests this week. It was created by Issam Hijazi, whom Al Jazeera describes as a “Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian entrepreneur.” That’s a pretty big demographic contrast to Larry Ellison, the Benjamin Netanyahu buddy (and, you know, founder of Oracle and one of the three richest people alive) who acquired a large stake in TikTok once it was forced into US hands.\n\nTikTok users are (rightly) worried about censorship on the new TikTok, and a silencing of any views that don’t support fascism and genocide. It’s a valid concern, considering what Elon Musk has done to Twitter. UpScrolled is to TikTok as BlueSky is to Twitter, or so the story goes.\n\nSo I’ll probably join. But I really don’t want to. I don’t want to join anything else. Goddamnit, I miss my Tumblr account.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

The Munster centre broke through off a first-phase scrum move from inside his own half and showed terrific pace to burn the cover defence on the outside to score.\n\nFor the first time in the contest, Warriors were wobbling and when they messed up a lineout near their own 22, Gleeson reacted first to gather and race away to score.\n\nThe pendulum had swung towards the Irish side and when Kilgallen crossed for their fourth try, it was a six-point game.\n\nIn a rare move for Glasgow, Lancaster knocked over a three-pointer to ease the nerves around Scotstoun and ensure Warriors locked up the victory.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: McKay; Rowe, McDowall (c), Yule, Smith; Lancaster, Afshar; Bhatti, Stephen, Walker, Craig, Oguntibeju, Ferrie, Fraser, Miller.\n\nReplacements: Stewart, McBeth, Talakai, Cockburn, Vailanu, Duncan, Oliver, Urwin.\n\nMunster Rugby: Haley; Abrahams, Daly, Kelly, Kilgallen; Butler, Coughlan; Wycherley, Barron (C), Jager, O'Connell, Wycherley, Edogbo, Quinn, Gleeson.\n\nReplacements: Barron, Donnelly, Ryan, Coombes, O'Donoghue, Patterson, Wood, O'Brien.",

This has been a challenging period in my career, but one from which I am learning.\n\n\"I recognise I have more to learn regarding the off-field responsibilities that come with leadership and captaincy. I remain committed to developing in this area and to improving both personally and professionally.\"\n\nBrook was placed in charge of England's white-ball teams last summer and the tour of New Zealand was his first overseas as captain.\n\nThe 26-year-old was involved in the altercation the night before the third one-day international in Wellington on 1 November – a game England lost.\n\nHe was fined and given a final warning over his conduct, though the incident and punishment only came to light more than two months later after the final Test against Australia in Sydney, at the end of a dismal series England lost 4-1.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Sport last week, Brook said he didn't want to \"go into any details\" of the Wellington incident, but said it began with some players \"going out for food\".\n\n\"There was no intention of going out, no intention of putting ourselves in a tricky situation,\" he said.\n\n\"I took it upon myself to go out for a few more and I was on my own there. I shouldn't have been there.\n\n\"I was trying to get into a club and the bouncer just clocked me, unfortunately. I wouldn't say I was absolutely leathered. I'd had one too many drinks.\"\n\nEngland men's director of cricket Rob Key told BBC Sport the England and Wales Cricket Board had investigated the night out in Wellington when it happened, with Brook saying he reported it to his employers the day after it took place.\n\nThe Telegraph story says the cricket regulator is preparing a report after receiving paperwork on Brook, Bethell and Tongue from the ECB last week.\n\nThe body, set-up in 2023 and headed-up by Chris Haward, a former chief constable of Lincolnshire police, has freedom to operate as it sees fit. It is able to fine or suspend players for disciplinary offences.\n\nBrook's statement is the latest act in a series of incidents involving drinking that dogged the England team through the New Zealand tour, the Ashes series that followed and its aftermath.\n\nThe drinking that took place on a mid-tour holiday in Noosa was particularly scrutinised, and Brook was one of the players pictured in the Queensland resort's bars.",

    "description": "Mercedes were pre-season favourites for 2026 long before any of the new cars ran on track, and nothing that happened in the Formula 1 'shakedown' in Spain this week has changed that.",
    "fullText": "Mercedes were pre-season favourites for 2026 long before any of the new cars ran on track, and nothing that happened in the Formula 1 'shakedown' in Spain this week has changed that.\n\nThe new Mercedes made a strong impression on rivals. The team did the most miles, and set the fastest times while the car was on the track, albeit Lewis Hamilton posted the quickest time of the week late on the final day in the Ferrari.\n\nThe seven-time champion's lap of one minute 16.348 seconds pipped George Russell's best for Mercedes, set the previous day, by 0.097 seconds. World champion Lando Norris was second fastest on the final day, and third overall, in the McLaren, 0.246secs off Hamilton.\n\nJudging performance from pre-season testing is always fiendishly difficult because of the number of variables involved, all the more so after a week such as this.\n\nThe test was held behind closed doors, with no independent media allowed access. No official timing was released. Only very few photographs were taken, and most of those were vetted by the teams who released them.\n\nThe test was exactly how it was billed - a shakedown is motorsport terminology for giving a car a first run-out to make sure everything works.\n\nOn top of that, everything the teams were using was new - cars, engines, tyres and fuel - after the biggest regulation change in the sport's history.\n\nTesting outright pace was very much not on the agenda for anyone. So the headline lap times meant almost nothing, not that that erases the general impression that Mercedes are in the best place at this early stage.\n\nThe test was all about learning about the new cars and, particularly, the new power-units. It was held in private because teams were scared by memories of the last time new engines were introduced, in 2014, when many suffered major reliability problems.\n\nBut those fears did not come to fruition, partly because the standards in F1 are so high these days, and partly because the technology change was not as big as last time. If anything, the engine technology, at least, is simpler.\n\nThe engines now have 50% of their total power produced by the electrical part of the hybrid engine, and will require much more energy management than ever before in F1.\n\nBut there is now only one hybrid element to the engine, albeit that it produces three times as much power, following the removal of the MGU-H, which recovered energy from the turbo and exhaust. This means lots of energy recovery, and optimising that for lap time will take plenty of learning.\n\nFully sustainable fuels, made from waste biomass or synthetic industrial processes, have added a new complication, as they burn differently from fossil fuel petrol.\n\nAs for the chassis, the cars have less downforce than last year, are smaller and narrower, but faster in a straight line, that speed boosted by moveable front and rear wings.",
