    "description": "BEHIND THE SCENES: 150 years since cricket bats were first made in Robertsbridge, Harry Latham-Coyle visits the East Sussex village to find out how an English institution are planning for the future",
    "fullText": "The rain is lashing down on a cold January day in Robertsbridge. Flood defences man the banks of the tributaries of the River Rother as they weave through the village, a legacy of the burstings of 2000 that bedevilled this quiet corner of East Sussex and many others like it. Strolling along Station Road down from the railway line, huddled beneath a frankly inadequate umbrella and splashed by the morning traffic, a faint whiff of wood draws me into the cricketing cornucopia I have come to find.\n\nIt is the cricket bat, in many ways, that is Robertsbridge’s claim to fame. For 150 years, master craftsmen have been whittling away on pieces of willow in the village, a long lineage stretching back to LJ Nicolls in the late 19th century. “Dear Sir,” WG Grace once wrote to the bat-maker in a letter dated 1894. “I used one of your bats at Hastings in 1894 and scored 131. I may mention that it was perfectly new. I kept it until this year and have scored 2,000 runs with it. I used it when I made my 100th century and scored 1,000 runs in May with it. So I think I may call it my record bat.” Well, if it was good enough for WG…\n\nOne can still find Nicolls’ original workshop – long since converted into housing – on the High Street, but his legacy remains at an English institution. Gray-Nicolls, formed from a merger between the old bat-maker’s company and Grays of Cambridge, is just one of a number of businesses based on this site, with the paraphernalia of rugby equipment giant Gilbert not hard to find. But it is for cricket that I have made my pilgrimage to find a faintly remarkable place.\n\nIt is possible on this single site to virtually track a bat from sapling to finished product. I am given a tour by Richard Gray – it remains a family business – who shows me the newly-planted Salix Alba willow trees on the riverbank beyond. In 15 to 20 years, these will be ready for felling; from each will come about 40 bats. Unlike most other companies of its size, every Gray-Nicolls bat is made from wood grown by the company in the United Kingdom, and handcrafted by a bat-maker at a factory like this.\n\n“I’ve been here nearly 20 years now,” explains Alex Hohenkerk, downing tools for a moment within his workshop. “As bat-makers, we are looking and honing in on those bits of timber that are going to make really good bits of kit. I’ll happily sacrifice a really pretty piece of wood if I can find something with a high density and levels of rebound. That is much more important to what they need than finding them something pretty.”\n\nIt is this bespoke approach that is one reason why these bats are so popular. “When I started here, I was very lucky that I walked into a team where they had all done approaching 50 years service,” Hohenkerk adds. “They’d done high-volume manufacturing when bats were less specific. When you do high volume manufacturing like that, yes, you are more likely to find 100 that you really, really like if you make 10,000 bats. But they are not tailored to anybody.” Admitting that it is a Gunn & Moore currently in my bag feels like a faux pas, so I am pleased to see one on the repair bench beyond him.\n\nAs any cricketer knows, a bat is not merely a piece of equipment, but an expression of identity; an extension of one’s personality. An attachment can form. “We’ve found in the last five years more players trying to look after cricket bats through upkeep and maintenance,” says Hohenkerk. “We’ve gone full circle now in terms of players who will keep getting their favourite bats refurbed and looked after, and only use them at the crease. That filters down and shows that bats can last if you look after them.” Harry Brook, for example, has had the same red-ball bat for two and a half years. “And that bat has scored a lot of runs.”\n\nAt the top level, some cricketers can and will tinker at will with the exact specifications they require. While former England captains Heather Knight and Alastair Cook have relatively settled set-ups – Cook’s since 2013 – the Pakistan vice-captain Saud Shakeel is noted as a player with exacting standards. There are no bad words to be heard here about any Gray-Nicolls athlete, though – not even Zak Crawley, who having been provided with two gorgeous examples for the Ashes lasted just 11 Mitchell Starc balls in a Perth pair. That, alas, is cricket.\n\nGray-Nicolls has been at the forefront of bat innovation since the company’s early days. Out of Gray’s office spills a large selection charting the history of the tool, from the hockey-stick style early days through to the latest developments. It was 51 years ago that the Gray-Nicolls Scoop, the iconic bat, launched to redefine the genre; now, it is ideas like the Neocore bat, with a cored internal scoop to improve weight distribution and pick-up. Notably, too, the company has also seen huge and continued growth in India, with consumers in the country connecting strongly with a brand of such history.\n\nWhat’s next? Gray and his team hope it may be what is known as “laminate”, or “blended”, bats. These are bats made by manufacturers from more than one bit of wood. It comes at a time when the most pressing concern for the industry is the shortage of English willow, driven by a rapid growth in demand of late. More trees are being planted, but it will take two decades for these to mature. Already permitted for junior cricket, Gray-Nicolls and others are having “constructive discussions” with the MCC about allowing use in the recreational game. Thinking purely in terms of sustainability, it would be a game-changer in terms of wood wastage.\n\n“Lamination is great, and demystifying what it is and does is important,” Hohenkerk concludes. “There is a lot of stuff said about cricket bats that doesn’t really ring true. Saying a laminate bat is better because it is three bits of wood put together? Actually, the more important thing is that you are using up three bits of wood that you otherwise wouldn’t have used.\n\n“There is a huge demand for everybody to have a bat. The village kit bag with 10 bats in it doesn’t really exist any more. Everyone wants their own thing, so you’ve got to try and find a way to make that thing.”\n\nAnd with that, it is out of the warmth of the factory and back into the wind and rain, via a pint of Harvey’s at the nearby George Inn. Suddenly, the summer season does not quite feel so distant – after a century-and-a-half of bat-making, here’s to many more.",

    "description": "The offensive line is in need of some new blood",
    "fullText": "Take a look at the final 2025 offensive line rankings in the NFL. Where did the Arizona Cardinals rank? Try #26.\n\nWhich is pretty sad. To be fair, the running back room had numerous injuries and ended up with second-teamers and practice squad guys taking snaps to finish the season. Not to mention the injury bug for the offensive room group, who ended up on IR: RG Will Hernandez, LT Valentin Senn, and RT Jonah Williams.\n\nThe Cardinals need some help along the offensive line, whether that is through free agency or by taking some new guys in the NFL draft.\n\nThe Senior Bowl is a great place to see up close some blue-chip talent, along with guys who will be available in the mid-rounds that could help this roster. Max Iheanachor is an OT who could come in and start Day 1 or sit and further develop for next season. But his talents can help this team this year.\n\nRevenge of the Birds staff writer Barry Shuck is at the Senior Bowl this week. He interviewed Iheanachor (pronounced ee-HAY-nah-chore) during the practice week. Last year, he was named Second Team All-Big 12.\n\n——————————————————————————————-\n\nShuck: Why does the offensive line need a good connection among all five players?\n\nIheanachor: We stick together when we do drills and basically do everything together. It builds a relationship, and when we come onto the field, it’s as one unit. We accept each other as family. It’s a stable environment. We have to trust each other and know that the man beside you has your back. Communicate and work as a unit.\n\nArizona State RT Max Iheanachor was a \"winner\" on day 2 of practice. \n\nCoordinated athlete in space, esp for 325 pounds. His hand use and awareness continue to improve. Exciting upside here. pic.twitter.com/00oQ2Y2HOc\n\n— Dane Brugler (@dpbrugler) January 29, 2026\n\nShuck: You didn’t play football in high school. What’s that story?\n\nIheanachor: I grew up playing soccer in Nigeria. When I moved to Los Angeles, because of my height, they got me into playing basketball at my high school, but we didn’t have a football team. I eventually ended up in AAU and thought that would be my future, and I had a chance to go to college and play basketball. But my AAU coach, Cory DeSanti, suggested I look into playing football in college. God used him to talk to me. I decided to trust the process. I ended up at East Los Angeles Community College and got my introduction to football. I knew I was big enough, and I guess I move pretty well. I thought I’d try it and embrace the journey.\n\nShuck: How did you end up at Arizona State?\n\nIheanachor: I was recruited by an offensive line coach from Fresno State, Saga Tuitele. I was going to go to school there. Then, Coach Saga got a new job at Arizona State, so I decided to go with him. It was really the connection and relationship I had with him. I played right away because players got hurt. It made me have to learn real fast. In my second year, I start every game. This year, I played every game. Each time, I knew what I needed to do and what I needed to work on. It’s about the journey. Grind every day and stay humble always.\n\nHe is better value at 34 for the Cardinals than taking Fano/Mauigoa at 3.\n\n— Kyle (@dangahv) January 29, 2026\n\nShuck: How has your game changed?\n\nIheanachor: Really, I would say the game speed has gotten better. And dealing with the physicality of going against these EDGE rushers. My pass set is getting better, but everything still needs improvement. My goal is to get 1% better every day. I have high standards and expect a lot from myself, but I hold myself to be more accountable.\n\nShuck: I read one media scouting report that said that you “float.” Your thoughts?\n\nIheanachor: I am just able to get low. I think my anticipation is good, and so it just looks like I might know where a defensive guy is coming from before the snap. I can grow in any system. I was taught early how to use my hands and then push the defensive end off towards the side. My lower body thickness helps, and with my basketball background, I guess I must have a lateral glide with my feet.\n\nArizona State’s Max Iheanachor had a huge Day 2 at the Senior Bowl. So explosive out of his stands and nimble while mirroring pass rushers.\n\nIheanachor didn’t allow a sack this past season for the Sun Devils. pic.twitter.com/ZmcVHfvb7l\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) January 29, 2026\n\nShuck: How would you describe your game?\n\nIheanachor: I am competitive and have thick skin. I don’t let trash talkers get to me because that is every game. I respond to adversity and think I have good feet. My stance is good, and I have played a lot of football and have learned a lot of football. And I have confidence.\n\nShuck: Are there any advantages to starting to play football late in your life?\n\nIheanachor: Sometimes I think there are so many disadvantages, but I am a fast learner and love to play. I enjoy playing offensive line rather than another position because I am in a family up front, and we depend upon each other. Other positions don’t have that. I trust the process, and I am patient. God has placed people in my life to steer me to where I am now.\n\nShuck: What will NFL coaches and scouts be saying about you when they leave the Senior Bowl?\n\nIheanachor: That I do my job. If I play my game in Saturday’s game against some of the best defensive linemen in the country, and hold my own, the scouts will know that I did my job. There has been plenty said about the defensive line prospects that are down here. I need to show them that my run blocking is as good as my pass blocking. I have confidence in myself and am ready to see what is next on my journey.",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Dallas interviews multiple defensive assistants",
    "description": "Here's the latest news surrounding the Dallas Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "The Cowboys are working diligently to fill out Christian Parker’s defensive staff.\n\nStephen Jones said the Dallas Cowboys want to finalize their coaching staff as early as this weekend. They’ve ramped up their search, with two in-person interviews set up for Friday.\n\nThe two candidates are Derrick Ansley, the defensive passing game coordinator for the Green Bay Packers, and Minnesota Vikings defensive line coach Marcus Dixon.\n\nFollowing a three-year stint with the Los Angeles Chargers, Ansley joined the Packers. In 2024, his first season with the team, Ansley helped them increase their total takeaways from 18 to 31. That was the biggest improvement in the league that season, and the top one-year increase for the Packers since 1998-99.\n\nGreen Bay’s entire defense improved when Ansley arrived, finishing top 10 in total defense, run defense, scoring defense, yards allowed per play, and sacks. That was the most top-10 statistical finishes their defense has had since 1996.\n\nWhat will the Cowboys defense look like next season?\n\nTake an intentional approach into free agency\n\nDare it be said, the front office deserves some credit for at least its approach to free agency in 2025. Was it completely successful? Absolutely not, but taking swings on players like Dante Fowler Jr., Javonte Williams and even Jadeveon Clowney after the season started signaled an intentional effort that maybe didn’t always manifest in previous years.\n\nThis offseason, that will need to be the case once again. Only two defensive ends — Donovan Ezeiruaku and James Houston — are under contract, the linebacker position desperately needs consistency, and the secondary is simply looking for healthy bodies.\n\nLet’s start in the edge room. The Cowboys will need young and veteran bodies alike. Re-signing Clowney has already been pointed to as a priority for the front office. The team has also shown a tendency to sign former top-100 draft picks heading into a second contract. Names like Baltimore’s David Ojabo, Philadelphia’s Azeez Ojulari and Cincinnati’s Joseph Ossai exist as affordable options on the open market.\n\nBut even at the trade deadline in 2025, the Cowboys looked at names like Tennessee’s Arden Key, the Los Angeles Chargers’ Odafe Oweh and Atlanta’s Arnold Ebiketie. If the checkbook is willing to have an extra zero written on some pages, those options would provide immediate production without the need of an early draft pick at the position.\n\nAt linebacker, the team desperately needs a communicator. Nakobe Dean hits the open market after two years playing under Parker in Philadelphia, although he hasn’t had lead-communicator experience since 2023. The New York Jets’ Quincy Williams could look for a reunion with his brother, Quinnen.\n\nBut if there is any position on defense that needs valuable money spent, it has to be linebacker. Big names like Washington’s Bobby Wagner, New Orleans’ Demario Davis, Green Bay’s Quay Walker and Cleveland’s Devin Bush are durable, effective leaders in the middle who would provide day one efficiency.\n\nThe secondary has so many wild cards that it will be tough to predict who will return in 2026. Donovan Wilson is a free agent, DaRon Bland just had a second foot surgery, and Shavon Revel Jr. has yet to play at 100 percent health. Could Parker bring Philadelphia’s Reed Blankenship to Dallas with him in free agency? How about bringing in a veteran cornerback to provide reliability and consistency?\n\nOptions will present themselves in free agency. And after such a productive season on offense, the majority of the focus can be put on the defensive side of the ball to give Parker the pieces that are needed to compete.\n\nCornerbacks coach Ryan Smith has ties to LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane.\n\nIf there’s one thing we know about new Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Christian Parker, it’s that he values defensive backs. He rose through the NFL ranks by coaching DBs and being the pass game coordinator for Vic Fangio’s defense with the Philadelphia Eagles. In the process, he developed three All-Pro corners; Patrick Surtain II, Quinyon Mitchell, and Cooper DeJean.\n\nSo it’s safe to bet his decision to hire Ryan Smith as cornerbacks coach isn’t one he took lightly. Smith’s a coach on the rise, and he’s someone that could help the Cowboys land one of the best defensive players in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nSmith has ties to Mansoor Delane\n\nSmith’s rise through the coaching ranks—which includes being named a “College Football Rising Star” by 24/7 Sports in 2020—featured a big jump in 2020, when he joined Virginia Tech’s coaching staff to mentor Caleb Farley, who wound up a first-round pick in the NFL. Smith’s good work yielded two things: He added pass game coordinator responsibilities and he caught the attention of this year’s top cornerback of the 2026 NFL Draft, Mansoor Delane.\n\nAccording to Tech Sideline, “Delane cited CB coach Ryan Smith and DC Justin Hamilton as big reasons he chose the Hokies.”\n\nDelane would later head to LSU, and he’s now considered a surefire first-round pick thanks to his sticky coverage and high-IQ play in the SEC. Given Smith and Delane’s relationship, which has been noted by many fans and content creators online, Cowboys Nation is daydreaming about Delane being the pick at No. 12.\n\nIf it comes to that, the Cowboys would have a Day 1 starter at cornerback that looks like a game-changing piece. Stephen Jones admitted earlier in January that cornerback was among the Cowboys’ biggest needs.\n\nThe Cowboys would benefit greatly from an aggressive free agency plan.\n\nFor little over a decade now the Dallas Cowboys have been pretty consistent about how they choose to approach free agency year after year. They’ve chosen to shop from the “bargain bin” for about 11 years now and haven’t really paid an outside free agent over $6 million annually in that timeframe. This approach to free agency hasn’t netted any positive results and it’s definitely time for a big shift.\n\nAs luck would have it, it looks like 2026 will be the year Jerry Jones and Company are finally willing to make some big changes in order to become more productive as an organization. They appear to have already allowed Brian Schottenheimer to run more of the show without their interference as evidenced by the hiring of 34-year-old, first-time defensive coordinator Christian Parker.\n\nThe hiring of Christian Parker already bucks the trend of the Cowboys going with a more tried-and-true coordinator with a proven track record, which signals a big shift in mentality and that other changes could be coming this year. The next big change we expect coming in Dallas is how they approach free agency and the players they choose to target because of it.\n\nAs we know, the NFL is a copycat league, monkey see monkey do if you will. And, as we also know, Jerry Jones has Super Bowl envy and wants more than anything to add to his Super Bowl trophy collection sooner rather than later before his time on earth comes to an end. That’s probably one of the reasons why he and the rest the Cowboys brass are allowing Brian Schottenheimer more control, but of course it extends beyond that too.\n\nWith the Super Bowl LX set between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, this will mark the 30th season the Dallas Cowboys have had to watch the big event from home. As difficult as that is to fathom, this could actually serve as a learning experience for Jerry Jones and Company, and if he’s paying attention, follow the blueprint both of these teams utilized to have a chance to lift the ever elusive Lombardi trophy.\n\nCoincidence or just their roster-building strategy, both the Patriots and Seahawks were among the league leaders in the free agency spending a year ago and now both organizations are vying for the opportunity to be the sole survivor and Super Bowl champion as a result. Both teams were in the Top 5 in the offseason free agent spending (Patriots 1st, Seahawks 4th).\n\nDallas should certainly consider upgrading at offensive tackle at some point in the NFL draft.\n\nWhether anyone wants to admit or not, the Dallas Cowboys have an offensive tackle problem. After investing $82,500,000 million in one OT and a first-round pick in the other, one would imagine this would be a position of strength. Unfortunately, it’s been anything but, and now faces a massive shakeup heading into 2026.\n\nWith the needs of the defense taking pole position on the Cowboys’ draft board, it’s highly unlikely Pick 12 will go anywhere but to the defense. Subsequent picks might be a different story. The 2026 Senior Bowl has flashed more than a few non-blue-chip prospects appearing to be upgrades to anything the Cowboys currently have. It’s possible that after trading back from Pick 20 Dallas could acquire extra draft capital in the top 100 in order to justify further offensive investment.\n\nWhile many of the top OT prospects passed on the Senior Bowl preferring to rest on their laurels of the previous season, other prospects, more of the blue-collar variety, opted to compete and improve their fortune. For these three OTs, that’s mission accomplished.\n\nGennings Dunker, 6-foot-5, 320-pounds, has been a media favorite at the Senior Bowl this week. The mulleted mauler follows a long tradition of norse-like linemen from the Midwest. The Iowa right tackle has practiced and played across the line with some suggesting guard is his ideal position. Yet, based on practice reps, RT looks well within his wheelhouse and puts him on the verge of first-round conversation as he looks to improve his current consensus draft location of 50.\n\nThe Cowboys may very well be parting with Terence Steele in 2026 opening up the RT spot to competition. They’re also considering Tyler Smith as an option at left tackle after Tyler Guyton’s struggles with performance and health the past two seasons. There’s a need.\n\nGennings Dunker beats TJ Parker 1 on 1 to end practice & seemed amped about it. \n\nEven got kudos from defenders.pic.twitter.com/2pxi7GbK8h\n\n— Houston Stressans (@TexansCommenter) January 30, 2026",

Bodo clearly raise their level when they face stronger teams.”\n\nPARMA, ITALY – JANUARY 07: Manuel Akanji of FC Internazionale looks on during the Serie A match between Parma Calcio 1913 and FC Internazionale at Stadio Ennio Tardini on January 07, 2026 in Parma, Italy.

The ball bounces differently and the balance changes. I give a lot of importance to that aspect. The temperatures should improve for the play-offs, so the cold can’t be an excuse.”\n\nFor the veteran coach, mentality will be decisive.\n\n“The big mistake would be thinking ‘we were lucky with this draw’ and underestimating the opponent. That’s the worst thing that can happen to Inter.”\n\nHe believes the return leg in Milan should still favour the Nerazzurri.\n\n“Synthetic pitches are tricky, but the level of the teams is so different that if the match is approached with seriousness and attention, everything else becomes secondary. They must not copy City, who went there like it was a trip.”\n\nLooking ahead, Capello noted that Inter could meet Manchester City or Sporting in the next round.\n\n“There’s a big difference between those two possibilities, especially if City get players back from injury.”\n\nHe closed with cautious optimism about Italian clubs.\n\n“On paper, this draw is good for all three. The opponents are strong, but if our teams play at their best, I remain very positive.”",

    "description": "Mike Evans hasn’t had the first discussion with the Bucs about his future. There have been no conversations about 2026 with his agent, Deryk Gilmore, who is currently focused on clients in the NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "Mike Evans hasn’t had the first discussion with the Bucs about his future. There have been no conversations about 2026 with his agent, Deryk Gilmore, who is currently focused on clients in the NFL draft.\n\nStill, as with any pending free agent, there is going to be speculation.\n\nEvans will be 33 by the time training camp gets underway in August. He can retire, return to play for the Bucs or take his talents elsewhere.\n\nEvans is the greatest offensive player in franchise history, a certain future Pro Football Hall of Famer who tied Jerry Rice with an NFL-record 11 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons to begin his career.\n\nHe endured six full years in Tampa Bay without so much as a whiff of the playoffs, then the Bucs won Super Bowl 55 in his first postseason.\n\nBut this season, Evans was limited to eight games by a hamstring injury and a broken clavicle. The streak died. He caught only 30 passes.\n\nEven so, Evans proved he still had plenty of football left in the tank when he returned after eight weeks to catch six passes for a season-high 132 yards, including a 45-yard reception, in a late-season loss to Atlanta.\n\nHe showed speed, quickness and agility, and brought energy to the offense.\n\nThe first question for any player when contemplating their future is whether they still can impact the game. For Evans, it’s a resounding yes.\n\nQuarterback Baker Mayfield hasn’t talked to Evans this offseason but predicted this past week he would continue playing and that it would be for the Bucs.\n\n“Mike’s too much of a competitor and cares too much about Tampa to end his career without 1,000 yards, without a division championship, without a playoff run,” Mayfield said on “The Ronde Barber Show.”\n\nNew Bucs offensive coordinator Zac Robinson said Tuesday he had not spoken to Evans but wants him back. The fact Mayfield is confident in Robinson, who was the Rams’ passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach when he spent five weeks with LA in 2022, is a plus.\n\n“I have a ton of respect for Mike and his game throughout his career,” Robinson said. “Obviously, watching from afar, I know he’s got to work through a lot of things, but I would obviously love an opportunity to work with Mike.”\n\nTony Pauline of “Essentially Sports” said this week that those he’d spoken to believe there’s a less than 50-50 chance Evans would want to return to the Bucs in 2026. He suggested Evans would prefer to go to a team that has a better chance of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nBut it may be best to hear it from Evans’ own mouth.\n\nHe covered many of the same subjects in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times prior to a preseason game in Pittsburgh in August. At the time, Evans knew he was nearing the end of his career.\n\n“This game is going to be gone, and I ain’t going to be able to do this anymore,” he said. “I know I’m not playing more than five years. Hell, maybe not more than three, we’ll see.”\n\nEvans admitted that as he has gotten older, it’s become harder to practice.\n\n“The games are the fun part. The games are easy. It’s training all year. I know it’s routine, but it takes a toll as you get older,” he said.\n\n“I stay in shape. I learned that a long time ago, and I wished I’d learned it sooner. Like, my first two years, I was big. ... When you see the pictures, I have a fat face and love handles that are a little bigger. Now I give my trainer a week or two after the season. We start light, and we just build up gradually.”\n\nFamily is Evans’ biggest priority. Two years ago, his wife, Ashli, convinced him to re-sign with the Bucs for two years and $41 million. The couple have three children together: daughters Ariah Lynn and Aliyah Nicole, and son Amari Thomas, along with a stepdaughter named Mackenzie.\n\n“It motivates me to play longer,” Evans said. “They keep me younger.”\n\nThere also is a big financial component for both the Bucs and Evans to consider.\n\nThe player who most resembles Evans in terms of production and age is Davante Adams, who signed a two-year, $44 million deal with the Rams last March. But Chris Godwin will enter the second year of a three-year, $66 million deal, and the Bucs are suddenly loaded at receiver with Evans, Godwin, Emeka Egbuka, Jalen McMillan and Tez Johnson. Of course, 2025 tested that depth.\n\nWhile money won’t be what determines Evans’ future, it would be naïve to think it isn’t a factor.\n\n“The money’s great, and I just love the game. I love to compete,“ he said. ”And while I’m blessed to still have this ability, I’m going to try to maximize it.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of friends and family. There’s so much behind the scenes that nobody will ever know about. But that’s the other thing that motivates me. And I’m seeing the contracts and I’m like, ‘Wow, that’s crazy.’ I mean, I don’t make what Ja’Marr Chase is getting, $40 million a year? And I’m half of that. It’s still great money. It’s money you dream of making.”\n\nThe last time Evans was a free agent, he had offers from the Chiefs and Texans. Patrick Mahomes is coming off an ACL injury but is expected back by the start of the 2026 regular season. Houston is only 50 miles from Evans’ hometown of Galveston, and the Texans have a Super Bowl-caliber defense.\n\nIf Evans is merely chasing a ring, it might make more sense for him to sign with a team like Buffalo with quarterback Josh Allen or the Patriots with Drake Maye.\n\nRetirement doesn’t seem like it will be Evans’ first choice. His kids are homeschooled, and the family splits time between Tampa and Texas.\n\nHe knows he has a few more good years left, and once you put the keys on the table it’s hard to pick them back up again.\n\n“That’s what every athlete wants to do,” Evans said in August. “Like LeBron (James) or Tom (Brady). They wish they could do that. That’s what I’m trying to maximize. I’m not going to play 20 years, but I’m going to try to play as long as I can while I’m at the top of my game.”\n\nAt the time, Evans sounded like he wanted to keep playing. Mayfield makes some good points: He won’t want to go out playing in only eight games, catching only 30 passes and missing the playoffs.\n\nBut he needs some time and space to make a decision.\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks ownership has moved to shut down reports claiming the franchise will be put up for sale ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe Paul G. Allen estate issued a public response after speculation emerged suggesting the Seattle Seahawks were preparing for a change in ownership.\n\nThe clarification comes as the franchise prepares to compete on the NFL’s biggest stage for the first time in 11 years.\n\nThe Paul G. Allen estate, the ownership group behind the Seattle Seahawks, addressed speculation surrounding the future of the franchise following reports of a potential sale.\n\nA spokesperson for the estate gave a response to NFL insider Ian Rappaport, which said that there is no truth to the rumors of the team being up for sale.\n\n“We don’t comment on rumors or speculation, and the team is not for sale. We’ve already said that will change at some point per Paul’s wishes, but I have no news to share.”\n\nThe statement made clear that no immediate ownership changes are planned, especially ahead of such a monumental weekend.\n\nThe estate also emphasized that its attention is currently centered on football matters, along with the sale of their NBA franchise, the Portland Trail Blazers, rather than ownership discussions.\n\nThe spokesperson added, “Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.”\n\nAs noted, the Seattle Seahawks will face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium on Sunday, February 9th.\n\nAny talk of a sale ahead of such a monumental game can serve as a distraction for players and the top brass, which is perhaps why the ownership group put out a statement that shut down this talk.\n\nSam Darnold’s former college teammate reveals his secret strength ahead of Super Bowl LX\n\nAqib Talib gives Sam Darnold verdict that Seattle Seahawks fans will hate\n\nPatriots and Seahawks will wear unique patches at Super Bowl LX to celebrate America 250",

    "fullText": "The North Carolina Tar Heels finally secured their first ACC road win last weekend, beating ACC rival Virginia 85-80, but they'll play away from home again Saturday.\n\nUNC (16-4, 4-3 ACC) will battle Georgia Tech in a 2 p.m. tip-off from McCamish Pavillion. The Yellow Jackets (11-10, 2-6 ACC), which lost Tuesday night at Virginia Tech, need a season-defining win to turn things around.\n\nNorth Carolina enjoyed the week off, thanks to an upset win that turned its season around, but players can't dwell for too long. Plenty of teams start rusty after seven days between games, but the Tar Heels will quickly find their footing.\n\nUNC and Georgia Tech last clashed on December 7, 2024 in the ACC opener for both teams. North Carolina won this matchup, 68-65, to snap a 3-game skid.\n\nThis year, the Tar Heels are better poised to be an NCAA Tournament threat, while the Yellow Jackets are struggling towards a fifth-straight absence from the Big Dance.\n\nNorth Carolina sports a younger, deeper lineup led by its post duo of Henri Veesaar and Caleb Wilson, with 3-and-D guys like Jarin Stevenson playing X-factor behind recent success. Georgia Tech also sports a pair of talented forwards, Kowacie Reeves Jr. (15.9 points per game) and Baye Ndongo (11.5 PPG), but team success is lacking.\n\nIf you're in the ATL, see if you can get tickets to Saturday's game. If you're planning to watch tonight's game on TV, your favorite streaming device, listening on the radio or somewhere else, keep reading below for more broadcast information.\n\nRadio: SiriusXM (Channel 193 and 371)\n\nNorth Carolina secured a massive upset at Virginia last weekend, but Georgia Tech is its first opponent in seven days.\n\nHubert Davis finally seems to know his team's best rotations. Wilson continues thriving as a superstar, Derek Dixon is the answer at point guard and Jonathan Powell's effectiveness goes beyond his scoring ability.\n\nThe Tar Heels start sluggish, but quickly take a first-half lead. UNC's perimeter defense continues to respond, free throws improve and the ride back to Chapel Hill is happy.\n\nScore prediction: UNC 89, Georgia Tech 72\n\nOct. 4: Blue-White Scrimmage (White 55, Blue 50)\n\nOct. 24: at BYU (preseason, L 78-76)\n\nOct. 29: vs. Winston-Salem State (preseason, W 95-53)\n\nNov. 3: vs. Central Arkansas (W, 94-54)\n\nNov. 11: vs. Radford (W, 89-74)\n\nNov. 14: vs. NC Central (W, 97-53)\n\nNov. 25: vs. St. Bonaventure in Fort Myers (Florida) Tip-Off (W, 85-70)\n\nNov. 27: vs. Michigan State in Fort Myers (Fla.)

    "fullText": "Renée Slegers says the opportunity to contest the FIFA Women’s Champions Cup final at Arsenal Stadium makes Sunday’s meeting with Corinthians a moment the squad are relishing, after both sides came through contrasting semi-finals in midweek.\n\nThe Brazilian champions booked their place with a narrow 1-0 win over Gotham FC at Brentford Stadium, while Arsenal delivered a dominant performance of their own, scoring six unanswered goals against AS FAR to reach the final.\n\nThe result set up a meeting between the continental champions, with silverware on the line in N5.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game, Slegers reflected on what it would mean to lift a trophy at the club’s home ground after navigating a competition featuring champions from across the world.\n\n“Very special of course, in this competition,” she said, “competing against the champions of other continents, we had to earn the right to get into the final and I think the team did that brilliantly the other night.\n\n“So very excited about the final, we look forward to it and it’s a special moment for us.”\n\nThe build-up has also prompted discussion around longevity at the top level, following the decisive semi-final goal scored by Gabi Zanotti, who is four years older than Slegers herself. Asked about players continuing to perform into their late thirties and beyond, the Arsenal head coach drew parallels with figures within her own squad.\n\n“It’s amazing,” she said. “I wish I could have done it! Unfortunately, my body didn’t want to. It says something, you have to have the right things on your path, of course, but everything is in their minds.\n\n“If I compare that to Kim Little in our team, she does everything 110%. There’s nothing less. She takes care of herself so well. She prepares so well. So, I think it’s here [in the mind]. But you also have to have the love that your body wants to do what your mind wants to do as well.\n\n“But, no, it’s really impressive. She [Gabi Zanotti] scores that winner in the semi-final. It says a lot about the mindset of the player.”\n\nWith the final now looming, Slegers and her players turn their focus to the task of overcoming Corinthians, aiming to convert excitement into success and add another trophy in front of a home crowd.",

    "fullText": "‘Bam Bam’ is eyeing a big statement in his return to action.\n\nTai Tuivasa’s comeback is one of several talking points heading into Saturday’s UFC 325 card in Sydney.\n\nThe Australian, who was once seen as a rising force in the heavyweight division, has struggled to find form recently, going winless in his last five fights since peaking at No. 3 in the rankings.\n\nHis knockout of Derrick Lewis back in 2022 capped a five-fight winning streak and had him firmly in the title conversation at that point.\n\nBut a tough run of results has left him well outside the top tier, something he’ll be looking to change when he faces the UFC’s tallest active fighter this weekend.\n\nTuivasa’s defeat to Jairzinho Rozenstruik in August 2024 was his last attempt to snap his losing streak before stepping away from the sport.\n\nDuring his 18-month layoff, Tuivasa admitted that he took things easy and didn’t rush back into training. He has since made weight for UFC 325 after a tough road back to fitness, fuelled by motivation he hadn’t felt in quite some time.\n\nSpeaking with Zac Pacleb for UFC.com, Tuivasa said:\n\n“I feel like I miss it,” Tuivasa told Zac Pacleb of UFC.com. “I feel like I’m ready to get back in there. I haven’t felt like that in a while, so I’m pumped.”\n\nThe Australian heavyweight also laid out what he hopes to achieve inside Qudos Bank Arena on Saturday night.\n\nUFC 325 won’t be the first time Tuivasa has shared the Octagon with a much taller opponent.\n\nStanding at 6ft 9in, Teixeira is currently the tallest fighter on the UFC roster.\n\nThat title goes to Stefan Struve, who stood at a full seven feet and was well known for it during his time in the promotion.\n\nTuivasa’s knockout of Struve back in October 2020 marked one of his key early wins, and he’ll be looking to find similar success against Teixeira this weekend.",

    "description": "It takes a while for a job posting to turn into a hire. That can be frustrating for job seekers applying to work in the low-hire, low-fire job market.",
    "fullText": "You may be desperate to quickly get a job, but hiring managers aren't feeling the same pressure.\n\nIt's easier to apply to jobs, but employers are taking longer to fill openings. From sales positions to tech jobs, the lengthier hiring process is across the board. The reward from job switching has also been waning; wage growth has slowed as employers aren't as worried about finding talent.\n\nCory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said the job market is in limbo as unemployment inches up, job postings are around pre-pandemic levels, and year-over-year growth in advertised wages on the job-search platform has cooled to over a five-year low.\n\nMore people are job searching than there are openings. People waiting for a dream role may have to settle or shift their perspective.\n\n\"Longer hiring times, paired with muted overall hiring activity, suggest that finding a job may prove difficult for many job seekers in 2026,\" Stahle said.\n\nStahle said macroeconomic conditions affect how long it takes to hire. Uncertainty, less urgency than in the pandemic recovery and Great Resignation years, and a qualifications mismatch could be why it's taking longer.\n\nStahle said many people voluntarily quit their roles in 2021 and 2022, likely leading employers to create job postings to backfill those gigs. The quits rate dropped from 3% in March 2022 to 2% this past November, suggesting workers are less confident about finding something new.\n\nWhen employers aren't desperate to fill a spot, hiring decisions could take longer. Stahle said employers can \"wait for the 'perfect' candidate\" when they're looking to expand their head count, rather than just backfill.\n\nThe average time it takes for a posting to become a hire climbed to 49 days in August, the highest since early 2019. Stahle said the rise in the spring and summer could've been due to continued uncertainty, such as with trade policies.\n\n\"Some of that uncertainty has waned since, but hiring timelines remain longer than they were at the start of 2025,\" he added.\n\nWhile employers can wait for their dream employee, job seekers might not have time to find their ideal role.\n\n\"Any offer is much harder to come by in this environment versus a couple of years ago, when there was a lot more power in the hands of the worker,\" Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter, said.\n\nIndeed's data showed the average time for a posting to turn into a hire varies by job group, but it's taking longer than it did a few years ago across the board.\n\nFor tech occupations, the three-month moving average has increased from 42 days in March 2021 to about 57 days this past November. For food and beverage jobs, the average number of days surged in 2025, from about a month to about 51 days in September and October.\n\nHealthcare has been prominent in job market data because of its job growth. Indeed's data showed healthcare postings are taking longer to become a hire than a few years ago. These gigs can require specific skills and education, which Stahle said could make it harder for employers to find what they're looking for and employees to get hired.\n\nMeanwhile, Stahle said there could be more applicants than jobs actually being filled for occupations with weak hiring.\n\n\"In that case, it's reasonable to assume that time-to-hire may increase further as employers take more time to weed through a larger pool of candidates and may feel like they can take their time in the process,\" he said.\n\nStahle doesn't see the cooling job market stopping soon, given economic uncertainty.\n\nUnemployed job seekers may need to take a role that doesn't cater to all their ambitions.\n\n\"A job with lower pay is better than no job with no pay,\" Bachaud said. \"We're seeing a lot of drive from necessity.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean you have to take a job you hate. Bachaud said to find a job where you think you would be comfortable with the day-to-day routine and who you work with.\n\n\"There still are opportunities to find places that offer meaningful work and offer consistent and good work-life balance and benefits, and those things that workers are really driven toward,\" Bachaud said.\n\nTalking to your network or developing one can be helpful when many people are trying to get hired. Lisa Simon, the chief economist at Revelio Labs, said to lean on connections like a referral since so many people will tailor their application materials to the job posting, with or without the help of AI.\n\n\"The thing that is going to get you to the front of the line when jobs are scarce is interpersonal relationships with people who are willing to go above and beyond and expend political capital to help you,\" communication coach Dorie Clark previously told Business Insider.",

    "description": "Jordan Blake Banks, an American who moved to Finland, said the pay is lower but healthcare education, and childcare are much more accessible.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Jordan Blake Banks, an American and Finnish citizen who moved to Finland in 2019 for school and stayed to work. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born and raised in St. Louis, then moved to Urbana-Champaign to study my bachelor's in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Illinois. I graduated in May 2019 and moved to Finland about a month and a half later.\n\nI studied abroad in Spain, and really loved it there. It opened my world and gave me more perspective, so I knew I wanted to go abroad after I graduated. I was interested in bioenergy, and that industry isn't very developed in the US. After doing some research, I landed on Finland, which has a huge forestry and bioenergy industry. The Nordics, in general, also have a lot of English-language master's degree programs. Through a Fulbright scholarship, I moved to Finland to pursue my master's degree.\n\nI basically moved from one university environment to another, so in that sense, it was pretty similar. During my second year, I completed a research traineeship while I worked in a lab and wrote my thesis. After school, I eventually got a job in sustainability consulting at Deloitte, one of the Big Four consulting firms.\n\nIn Finland, you will most likely get a much lower salary than what you would make in the United States, but at least in my experience, it has balanced out. A lot of the things that are more expensive in the United States, like health insurance, education, and childcare, cost way less in Finland.\n\nFinland has a really good work-life balance in general. There isn't a huge culture of grinding, staying up late, and working long hours to get ahead in your career. The general idea is that the company and your colleagues respect you as a person and your personal time.\n\nIt's very common for people to set clear boundaries around work. A parent might leave in the middle of the day to take care of their child or have strict start and stop times because of family responsibilities. I really don't think that's seen as anything bad in Finland. Most people also take a month of holiday in the summer and time off in the winter. Even in consulting, the expectation to constantly work overtime just isn't the norm.\n\nFinnish is a very different language and probably the biggest challenge. Even though many international companies operate in English, in consulting, some projects are done in Finnish, and colleagues who speak the language are more likely to get those assignments.\n\nI eventually participated in an integration program where I spent months learning Finnish full-time. That experience really accelerated my language learning. Learning the language helped me feel more integrated in everyday life. I also don't think I would have passed the national Finnish language exam without it, which I took to become a citizen after meeting and marrying my wife here.\n\nOne of the biggest pluses is that I feel very safe here as a woman. Walking alone at night is something I would probably be very anxious about in many places in the United States, but in Finland, I feel pretty comfortable.\n\nAs a Black American living in a small Finnish town, that can be a shock if you're not used to it. In the smaller university town where I started, I did feel maybe a little bit more othered, but since moving to Helsinki, I noticed there was a lot more diversity.\n\nThere are also all of these different Facebook groups like \"Americans in Finland\" or \"Americans in Helsinki.\" I think it's actually pretty easy to connect if you're looking for a specific cultural group.\n\nPeople in Finland are not as open initially. In the US, it's very common to make eye contact, smile, or say hi to people you pass on the street. In Finland, it can feel like people are actively avoiding contact. I've heard many stories of people about to leave their apartment who hear their neighbor open their door to also leave, so they rush back inside so they don't have to make contact with anyone.\n\nThat can be a shock at first. At the same time, once you do get to know people, you can make good connections and real friendships. You just have to be willing to put yourself out there and be the brave American who asks for what you want.\n\nYou can also use it to your advantage, and I think it helped me land my first paid research job at the university. I was willing to make contact and be the \"brave American\" who asks for things.\n\nDo you have a story to share about moving abroad? Contact this reporter at kvlamis@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "'Clients bring back entire wardrobes': Tailors say Ozempic is reshaping Wall Street",
    "description": "Wall Street tailors say major weight loss transformations were once rare. Now, the \"Ozempic effect\" is creating a surge in demand for their services.",
    "fullText": "In his two decades as a Wall Street tailor, Michael Andrews learned to ignore clients who said they planned to get in shape. He only took them seriously when their weddings were approaching.\n\nOver the past two years, however, many of his regulars — investment bankers, private equity executives, and the lawyers who serve them — have been returning to his NoHo shop with their suits hanging from much slimmer frames.\n\n\"We've had dozens of clients bring back entire wardrobes,\" Andrews said. \"For a couple of clients, it's 20 to 40 pieces that we've had to take in because they've lost 20 to 30 pounds.\"\n\nThose kinds of transformations used to be \"exceedingly unusual,\" Andrews said. Now, they're commonplace. On Wall Street, Andrews said, \"the Ozempic effect is real.\"\n\nGLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro famously cause people to lose a lot of weight, and fast. Some studies show that people taking GLP-1s on average lose up to 15% of their body weight in a year.\n\nA November 2025 poll of 1,350 people by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 18% of Americans said they had ever used GLP-1 medications. About three-quarters said they used them to lose weight specifically, rather than treat diabetes or other medical conditions.\n\nThe booming weight-loss drug market is top of mind on Wall Street, with UBS projecting it will reach $126 billion by 2029, roughly double its size in 2025.\n\nOver the years, Andrews has seen clients gain and lose weight, and has kept track of major alterations — which he defines as jackets and pants being taken in or let out by at least two inches — to make sure adjustments are carried forward into future orders.\n\nIt's easier to make a garment smaller after major weight loss than to make it bigger after major weight gain, and clients who lose weight tend to be more comfortable returning to show the change, Andrews said.\n\nThat might partly explain why, in the eight years that Andrews has been collecting data, he found that for every two to four clients who had their suits taken in, one had theirs taken out.\n\nThere were two big exceptions: 2020, when almost 10 times as many clients had their suits taken in as out. Andrews put it down to lifestyle changes, like his customers having fewer client dinners and drinking less during COVID. In the years that followed, the ratio returned to its normal range — until 2025, when for every suit Andrews took out, he took in 11.\n\nIn 2025, Andrews received 17 requests to enlarge garments, while he fielded 192 to make garments significantly smaller. That's more than double the 2024 total of take-ins, and five times the number of alterations during the 2020 spike.\n\nThe effects of GLP-1s go beyond slimmer customers — they've reshaped Andrews' business, too. To keep up with what he sees as the GLP-1 effect causing a surge in demand for alterations, Andrews said he added two additional tailors to his five-person team in 2025.\n\nAlan Horowitz, who makes suits for men at Blackstone, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and other Wall Street institutions, similarly said the rise of GLP-1s has had a \"dramatic impact on our business.\"\n\nHorowitz's business offers free lifetime alterations, a policy that only about 2.5% of clients used to use, typically for adjustments of 3 inches or more. Last year, 16% took advantage of the offer, mostly to have their suits taken in. The average chest size of his clients in 2025 was down about 1.5 inches from 2023, he added.\n\nOn the one hand, alteration costs have surged, he said. The upside is that clients who lose weight tend to feel better about themselves and replace their wardrobes entirely rather than alter older suits.\n\n\"People are at weights that they haven't seen since college, and sometimes even high school,\" he said.\n\nElsewhere in the city, Jonathan Sigmon, the owner of Alan Flusser Custom on 48th Street and Fifth Avenue, said his store handled about 30% more alterations in 2025 than in 2024, and roughly double the number it did in 2023. Most were take-ins.\n\nWhile many clients are now slimmer, Sigmon said only a handful of new clients are asking for fundamentally different cuts or \"slim-fitting silhouettes.\" The majority want their existing clothes altered to fit their new body shapes.\n\n\"Most understand that our house style has a bit more ease, and is guided by the proper proportions meant to flatter the individual rather than follow current trends,\" he said.\n\nOther tailors, however, have seen a shift in style preferences in recent years. Israel Zuber, the owner of LS Mens Clothing on West 45th Street and Sixth Avenue, said his clients now ask for less shoulder padding, shorter jackets, and a trimmer overall fit.\n\nSome of that reflects a more modern style, Zuber said, but it also serves another purpose: slimmer cuts tend to accentuate weight loss.\n\n\"People are dressing thinner,\" he said. \"They're dressing thinner in the arms — even the conservative people, the business people.\"\n\nAfter more than 40 years in the tailoring business, Zuber said one change stands out above the rest: \"You don't see as many portly people as you used to.\"\n\nBack in NoHo, Andrews doesn't think Wall Street's move toward slimmer bodies has anything to do with changing beauty standards. It's not about a new desire to look lean, he said, but about how achievable that ideal has become.\n\nAndrews said he lost about 20 pounds after starting Ozempic in 2024. \"I'm one of those people who had to get 80 pairs of pants altered,\" he said.\n\nWhile waistlines may be shrinking, the workload for New York's tailors is not.",

    "title": "Love the work, hate the slaps: Creators and fans wrestle with the dark side of the micro drama boom",
    "description": "Micro drama apps like ReelShort and DramaBox have gotten pushback over violence and misogyny in plots from producers and fans.",
    "fullText": "\"Bound by Honor,\" billed as a \"top series\" on ReelShort, opens with a young woman being drugged and coerced into marriage. In \"Divorced at the Wedding Day,\" a \"popular\" pick on DramaBox, a pregnant widow is whipped and pushed onto broken glass at an engagement party before being locked up in a crate.\n\nReelShort and Disney-backed DramaBox are the market leaders in the rising category of micro dramas, made-for-mobile soaps that feature fast-paced action and wild plots. As the format has ballooned into a $1.4 billion business in the US, producers and fans tell Business Insider they have grown increasingly uncomfortable with the prevalence of plots full of graphic violence, abuse, and misogyny. The problem: boundary-pushing scenes keep people glued to the action.\n\n\"The data scientists making these decisions, they'll say, 'I know we're not supposed to stab pregnant women, but that's what the data says we need to do,'\" said Thom Woodley, a longtime micro drama filmmaker.\n\nReelShort and DramaBox didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nThe tension springs from the business model of the micro drama format, which originated in Asia and has expanded globally. These low-budget, heavily formulaic films — presented in bite-sized episodes — are designed to get people to pay after a certain number of free episodes. To do that, they need a steady stream of outlandish plot twists and cliffhangers, often involving humiliation and pleasure points. Many of the stories come from Chinese web novels that have been adapted to the screen and localized.\n\nCate Fogarty, a micro drama director-writer, said one project she worked on called for 27 slaps.\n\n\"The actors actually got a little tired of it,\" she said. Still, the client said it had to be performed as written.\n\n\"It went on to be pretty successful,\" she added.\n\nIn a November survey of 1,670 micro drama fans, excessive violence was the dominant criticism, with 57% saying there was too much of it. The survey was conducted by Jen Cooper, an independent, UK-based micro drama consultant.\n\nAs long as people keep watching, however, producers say it can be hard to convince the platforms to shake up their strategies.\n\n\"Platforms tend to repeat what's successful,\" said Candace Mizga, a micro drama actor and writer-producer. \"No one wants to take a risk in a new market. They're optimizing for immediate returns.\"\n\nBeyond cutting the slaps, micro drama fans have also called for more diversity in casting and storylines. In Cooper's survey, respondents said they wanted more strong female leads (cited by 77%), culturally diverse casting (54%), and older characters (42%).\n\nReelShort and DramaBox previously told Business Insider that they were moving to increase diversity in casts and story types. Producers said they had noticed that micro drama apps have been producing more gay-themed series lately.\n\nFilmmakers and actors say they're limited in their ability to influence content decisions because the series are often made under a work-for-hire arrangement, and the apps, not the filmmakers, have full control over the creative.\n\nMizga, who started working in the space during COVID, said she's been told \"many times\" in shoots that she \"looks too strong\" and that she needs to \"look weaker.\" She recalled a drama in which her character was portrayed positively for staying with her male abuser after a sexual assault. She said it \"didn't feel good,\" but she needed the work.\n\nThere are signs that the industry could change as the apps seek to do business with Hollywood. Filmmakers said sets have become more professional, with better acting and scripts, and that intimacy and stunt coordinators have become more common. Along with that, some actors and filmmakers say they've been able to push back on insensitive storylines. Fans are also speaking up in online chats.\n\nIsabel Dréan, who makes micro dramas and teaches others to do so, said it's hard for writers to speak out until they get established. Until then, they can try to write fewer slap scenes in scripts.\n\n\"I tell writers, do what you have to do to get produced,\" said Dréan, author of \"How to Write a Vertical Series in 10 Days.\" \"Then it's your choice.\"\n\nDespite the negatives, many filmmakers stress the positives of micro dramas, also called \"verticals.\" They provide work in a tightened market for Hollywood talent and offer a creative challenge to keep people's attention, since viewers can be lost with a flick of the thumb.\n\n\"Creatively, it's puzzle solving,\" Dréan said. \"It's hard coming up with 50 cliffhangers.\"\n\nSome women also say verticals have given them a chance to direct and lead, opportunities they didn't see for themselves in the traditional film and TV world.\n\n\"Our last show, all our crew were women,\" Fogarty said.\n\nNewer platforms are also emerging and pitching themselves as more reliant on character-driven stories and less on shock value, using tags like \"contemporary\" and \"female empowerment\" — even if the stories still use tropes like revenge and passion to drive the action.\n\nMizga is cofounding a new platform called Chera TV that bills itself as a female-founded verticals company for diverse and underrepresented creators. She said she's trying to build dramatic tension through \"character development instead of relying on a slap.\"\n\nFlareFlow, a year-old app launched by COL Group International, a Chinese company that is also a part owner of ReelShort, is emphasizing stories driven by character and plot over \"sensational but hollow tags used merely for clicks,\" said Timothy Oh, general manager of COL Group.\n\nThen there's GammaTime, a new micro drama platform from Bill Block, the former CEO of Miramax, which is calling itself the \"Netflix of premium short-form storytelling.\"\n\n\"We just want to be thoughtful about it. We're definitely not interested in shock value or sexual exploitation,\" said Sandra Yee Ling, GammaTime's head of production.\n\nThe forthcoming \"The Royal Wedding Planner,\" for example, centers on the love triangle trope, but GammaTime says that the main female rival isn't a stereotypical villain. In another one that's in the works, a woman sets out to get revenge on her cheating husband, then decides to take a different, more empowering path.\n\nYee Ling believes many of the apps fall back on extremes because the format depends on driving maximal emotions, and you don't have a lot of time to grab the audience.\n\n\"I think that we can get emotions from a wider range of audiences, with different stories,\" Yee Ling said. \"But you still have to work within the restraints of the medium, which is short attention span.\"",

    "title": "Employees say Target is MIA in Minneapolis: 'This is not the company I signed up for'",
    "description": "Across Minneapolis, Target employees are marching and volunteering amid the immigration crackdown, while pressing company leadership to do more",
    "fullText": "Suzie lifted the box of diapers from her trunk and glanced down the street to be sure she hadn't been followed. It was a bright Thursday afternoon, and her boots crunched across the icy Minneapolis pavement as she crossed to the curtain-drawn house of a Target coworker.\n\nThe street was quiet. It was just a few blocks from where Renee Good, a mother of three, was shot and killed by an ICE agent three weeks earlier. The coworker, who is Latina, has been too afraid to venture into a store.\n\n\"The first time I did this, I was very nervous — almost paranoid,\" said Suzie, who asked not to be identified by her full name. She had taken a roundabout route and turned off her phone's location tracking.\n\nSuzie is a 15-year Target employee who works in merchandising at its downtown headquarters. Now, she's also part of an informal mutual-aid network that has emerged among the company's corporate workforce as Minneapolis — where Target is one of the largest employers — has become ground zero for the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nShe doesn't consider herself an activist. \"It's just neighbors taking care of neighbors,\" she said. \"It takes away the helplessness of feeling like the government's against us. It's something you can actually do, instead of sitting on your phone feeling depressed.\"\n\nAcross Minneapolis, Target employees are among the thousands of residents who are out marching, offering help to neighbors, and standing watch in sub-freezing temperatures — while pressing company leadership in Slack channels to more forcefully condemn the administration's actions.\n\nThat urgency has collided with growing frustration inside Target itself. In an open letter sent to leadership last week, hundreds of Target employees wrote that \"Target's continued inaction in the face of the current administration puts all of us at risk of more harm in our workplaces and represents a moral failure to protect those in our community.\"\n\nTwo days later, after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti, Target's incoming CEO, Michael Fiddelke, joined dozens of Minnesota business leaders in calling for \"de-escalation of tensions.\"\n\nIn a video to employees, he described the violence as \"incredibly painful,\" but stopped short of condemning the killings or criticizing the Trump administration, which has cited Minneapolis's sanctuary city policies as the reason for the enforcement surge. Target also contributed to a $3.5 million fund for small businesses affected by the disruptions.\n\nSome employees say that's a start, but not enough for them.\n\nAt Art Price Studio, a screen printer in Northeast Minneapolis, its owner said that at least a dozen people have come in with Target's red uniforms and tote bags and asked for anti-ICE slogans like \"ICE OUT!\" to be printed onto them.\n\nAcross town, a logistics specialist who's worked for Target for 4 years spends much of her free time volunteering as a neighborhood lookout. A few days a week, she stands outside local restaurants during shift changes to keep an eye out for approaching federal law enforcement agents and offers rides home to frightened workers.\n\nAnother Target employee, who works in merchandising and has been with the company for seven years, uses a 3D printer to make whistles — the instrument of choice for protesters to warn their neighbors to the arrival of federal agents and be witnesses to any violence. The whistles are then paired with laminated \"Know Your Rights\" cards, made in six different languages, which volunteers like Suzie drop off at local coffee shops and bookstores.\n\nThe employee, who is of Vietnamese origin, has mostly been working from home since Target's corporate office relaxed its requirement for employees to work in the office three times a week in response to ICE's activities and unrest in the city.\n\nEven though she's a US citizen, she wants to avoid the ICE run-ins that other family members and friends have experienced.\n\nAnother Target employee, who works in merchandising and has been with the company for seven years, uses a 3D printer to make whistles — the instrument of choice for protesters to warn their neighbors to the arrival of federal agents and be witnesses to any violence. The whistles are then paired with manuals, made in six different languages, which volunteers like Suzie drop off at local coffee shops and bookstores.\n\nOn the few occasions she's gone into the Target offices, she's been struck by how many employees of color seem to be staying home. \"It's like, wow, all my white colleagues are here. My colleagues of color are not,\" she said.\n\nLike many employees interviewed by Business Insider, she said she feels a disconnect between how she's experiencing the events in Minneapolis and Target's public statements.\n\n\"It's hard to show up at work and put my own values aside. It doesn't feel good.\"\n\nFive and a half years ago, when George Floyd was killed less than 4 miles from Target's Minneapolis headquarters, the company's response was different. The retail giant, which at the time made social justice a cornerstone of its business, reacted with a sweeping, highly visible show of support.\n\nTarget pledged $10 million to social-justice organizations and scaled up its DEI programs. \"Target stands with black families, communities and team members,\" then-CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement. Floyd, he said, \"could have been one of my Target team members.\"\n\nLike much of corporate America, Target has softened its public embrace of progressive causes in recent years. In last week's open letter, employees criticized the company's decision to scale back its LGBTQ Pride collection, its $1 million donation to Trump's inauguration fund, and its winding down of several DEI initiatives last year.\n\nThe recent events in Minneapolis are putting that strategy to the test. And the protests also come at a delicate time for Target. Fiddelke, a company veteran who most recently served as COO, will take over the top role on Sunday; Cornell will stay on as the board's executive chairman.\n\nFiddelke will have to contend with returning Target to growth after three years of lackluster sales performance and a stock price that is down roughly 25% from a year ago.\n\nIn the days after Pretti's killing, Target managers held listening sessions with their staff. Some employees used town hall-style forums to vent their anger and frustration at not doing more, according to an employee who attended multiple such forums.\n\nOne corporate Slack channel that Business Insider has seen is called \"#yelling\" and was originally intended for venting about \"situations or things, not people.\" It has roughly 3,600 employees, about half the number Target employs at its Twin Cities headquarters. The channel has lately become an outlet for frustrations with government and corporate leadership alike, as well as sharing links to community-aid resources.\n\nIn the days before Pretti was killed, the tone of the channel was largely defiant, peppered with anti-ICE memes. After the company appeared to avoid taking sides on the issue, it turned to outrage.\n\nThe military-style immigration raids across the metro area have stirred a widespread sense of paranoia. More than 3,500 people have been arrested in the Twin Cities in the last two months, including on school grounds and outside day cares. Overnight on Thursday, federal agents arrested the former CNN anchor Don Lemon and another journalist who had covered a local protest at a church.\n\nA federal judge has said ICE is in violation of nearly 100 court orders involving noncitizens its agents have apprehended.\n\nResidents dropping off groceries for neighbors or helping out with laundry say they worry about face-scanning technology and cell phone surveillance. They mostly coordinate over the encrypted messaging platform Signal.\n\nEmployees who volunteer say they block off time on their work calendars or set an out-of-office Slack status. Some have been stepping away to look out for immigration patrols at their neighborhood schools before and after classes.\n\nIn a video to employees, he described the violence as \"incredibly painful,\" but stopped short of condemning the killings or criticizing the Trump administration,\n\nAt the team level, employees say, there has been patience and flexibility from managers and coworkers.\n\nA military veteran who has worked at Target for more than five years said his direct supervisor and his supervisor's supervisor have been \"unquestionably, unwaveringly\" supportive. That has meant flexibility to adjust schedules and workloads to accommodate things like extra grocery runs, carpools, and mental health days.\n\nBut the person said the company's official statements have been disappointing.\n\n\"When I started with the company, I was very proud,\" the person said. He says the company's neutrality — broadly calling for \"deescalation\" — has been disappointing, and he's now much less likely to share that he's a Target employee.\n\n​​He referenced a Wednesday statement by outdoor supply company Patagonia — which operates a retail store in St. Paul — that condemned \"government-sanctioned violence\" and opposing increased funding for DHS and ICE.\n\n\"This is what leadership I want to follow looks like,\" the Target worker said of Patagonia's statement.\n\nSeveral other employees say they've lost their sense of pride in being Target employees since the company shifted to a more cautious approach. One person who has worked there for 12 years says Target's handling of DEI issues was a breaking point for her.\n\n\"I personally am boycotting Target and have for the past year, which is, I realize, very ironic, considering I work for them,\" she said. \"My friends and family around me, they're not shopping Target right now. They're mad.\"\n\nThe merchandiser who prints whistles and \"Know Your Rights\" cards said she's glad her coworkers and neighbors are taking action.\n\n\"I feel like Minnesotans can take it and our strong community is really fighting back,\" she said.\n\nSam Fellman is a journalist at Business Insider who oversees the Military & Defense team. He lives in Minneapolis.\n\nDominick Reuter is a senior retail reporter for Business Insider.",

    "title": "I tracked my blood glucose levels for two weeks. It felt like I was in sugar jail.",
    "description": "The health reporter Kim Schewitz often feels tired, and hoped tracking her blood sugar levels using a continuous glucose monitor would help. Then the app told her to do calf raises for 15 minutes.",
    "fullText": "Blood sugar is a hot topic, and after months of watching content waxing lyrical about \"balancing it,\" I needed to know if it was true that tracking my glucose levels would help boost my energy.\n\nSo with a few taps on my laptop, I ordered a continuous glucose monitor: a small white disk carrying a tiny needle, which charts blood sugar levels in near real-time via an app.\n\nDesigned for people with diabetes to closely monitor their glucose levels and prevent potentially life-threatening fluctuations, in recent years, they've become a buzzy lifestyle wearable marketed at healthy people.\n\nGlucose is our primary energy source, which we get from carbohydrates in food and drink. The body uses it for energy, and anything that's left over is stored in the muscles, liver, or fat cells for later use. Sugary snacks and simple carbs like white pasta tend to lead to bigger blood sugar spikes, while pairing carbs with protein, fats, and fiber has been found to smooth out the curve.\n\nThe term \"glucose spike\" has become a dirty word, as wellness influencers say that peaks and troughs lead to weight gain, energy crashes, and cravings. In turn, there are plenty of personal anecdotes online — but limited evidence — that \"balancing\" blood sugar by keeping it stable has helped people lose weight, feel happier and more energetic, sleep better, and avoid chronic disease.\n\nDespite following a pretty balanced diet — I eat protein and plenty of fiber with most meals, and few ultra-processed foods — I'm often tired and lacking energy. I was curious to see if the longevity bros were onto something, and if wearing a CGM for two weeks could provide any helpful insights.\n\nThe experience started with the sharp scratch of the CGM needle puncturing my skin. I held the plastic applicator to the back of my left arm, pressed down, and before I knew it, was branded with a white plastic circle. It stayed there for two weeks, measuring the glucose levels in the fluid around my cells and sending the data via Bluetooth to a line chart on my phone. I felt very aware of the CGM when my arms were exposed in public, which made me feel a little self-conscious.\n\nAt the beginning, it was exciting having access to this new metric, and the first thing I did was eat a rich chocolate truffle.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the little line on the chart — representing my glucose level — started moving sharply up, but I was pleased to see that it stayed within the healthy range of 3.9 mmol/L to 7.8 mmol/L. This was delineated on the chart by two dotted lines, which made it easy to see if I was having what would be considered a glucose spike or dip.\n\nThe line moved every time I ate or drank something other than water, exercised, or felt stressed (both can affect glucose levels).\n\nI ate normally to get an idea of my typical daily blood glucose levels, and in hindsight see that I quickly fell into the trap of judging meals as \"good\" or \"bad\" based on their effect. I know that's not a healthy way to think of food, but I guess I subconsciously believed the reductionist idea that any rise in blood sugar should be avoided. In fact, fluctuations within the healthy range (and sometimes outside of it) are just a normal part of digestion.\n\nSo I was pleased when my go-to breakfast didn't cause a spike, but surprised when the flat white coffee with 2% milk that I drank before it caused the level to rise as much as my entire breakfast.\n\nI didn't love that my protein and fiber-rich lunch of ground turkey and black bean chili with red rice sent my line close to the top of the healthy range, but reasoned that was probably because it was larger than my breakfast. I felt particularly disheartened when a dinner of soba noodles, which are made from buckwheat flour (complex carbs), and tofu (protein) in broth with cabbage (fiber) marked the first sharp spike.\n\nI was even more confused when the chili caused a huge spike and the noodles didn't when I ate the same lunch and dinner the next day.\n\nMy blood sugar didn't exceed the healthy range many times, but when it did, it was after I consumed:\n\nI would consider half of these balanced meals, but according to my chart, they raised my blood sugar more than the sweet treats like cake and a brownie that I ate during the two weeks. Maybe that's to be expected, but, without an expert to explain the data, I didn't know.\n\nOn reflection, I underestimated how complicated it would be to decipher this data and apply it to my life healthily. My glucose levels fluctuated more than I expected and it wasn't always clear to me why.\n\nThe app did explain that a healthy person's blood sugar tends to be outside of the healthy range for up to two hours per day, but I wasn't sure if an unsteady line within the safe zone was worrying or not (a nutrition researcher I spoke to since reassured me that it is not).\n\nIn terms of my energy levels, I noticed that I felt better on weekdays when I ate three square meals a day around the same time than weekends, when I tended to skip breakfast and eat a big meal around 2 or 3 p.m. This was reflected in my blood sugar levels, but I'm not sure I needed a CGM to figure that out.\n\nThe urge to check how my body reacted to food after a few bites quickly became a compulsion. Even though I understood a spike wasn't necessarily bad, I still felt encouraged by the app to keep my line as straight as possible.\n\nIt set me a daily target to stay within, at first based on averages and after a week based on my levels. It would tell me to do 15 squats, five to 10 minutes of calf raises, or take a brisk walk, when my glucose started rising (research suggests these movements can bring it down). I tried to go on walks, and did the squats on two occasions, but I drew the line at 10 minutes of calf raises.\n\nThe app was purportedly helping me to make my diet even healthier, but I became hyperfixated on a single metric that I didn't really understand.\n\nI felt a pang of dread every time I ate, knowing my glucose levels would rise and the app would watch and prescribe me exercise like some kind of punishment. It felt like the only way to keep my glucose stable would be to unnecessarily overhaul my already healthy diet.\n\nI intended to spend the second half of the experiment trying to avoid spikes and observing if I felt more alert and focused. That was before I realized that optimizing your health means aiming for constantly shifting goal posts. Once you perfect one metric, you simply move onto the next.\n\nHaving too many blood sugar spikes over time can increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. But diabetes experts previously told Business Insider that glucose monitoring isn't necessary for people without the disease and that it can cause unnecessary anxiety.\n\nIt's possible that cutting out all refined sugar and eating plainer, simpler meals would help me focus a little better. But I already track my sleep, go for a daily lunchtime walk, do a weekly run, eat 30 plants a week, and stop drinking caffeine after 1 p.m, in the name of my health.\n\nMaybe it was the invasive nature of sleeping with a needle in my arm, or the Black Mirror-ness of my phone tracking my bloodwork, but I suddenly felt I was on the border between healthy and obsessive. That isn't somewhere I want to be.",

    "title": "Utilities want $31 billion more from customers, and your electric bill is about to feel it",
    "description": "Electric and gas providers more than doubled rate increase requests to state regulators last year, often citing soaring demand from AI data centers.",
    "fullText": "The average American's skyrocketing electric bill has caught the attention of everyone from President Donald Trump to Microsoft executives — just don't expect lower rates in 2026.\n\nElectric and gas utilities asked state regulators to approve $31 billion in rate increases last year, more than double the $15 billion they sought in 2024, a new study from PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers, found.\n\nThe surge in requests from utilities to tack on additional charges to customer bills comes as Big Tech companies continue their sweeping buildout of power-hungry AI data centers across the country. Many utilities have attributed rate increases to unprecedented demand from data centers.\n\nWhile some of those requests are still pending approval, many — including the majority of a $9 billion increase for customers of one Florida power company — have been pushed through and will start showing up on customer bills this year.\n\n\"Gas and electricity are the two fastest drivers of inflation, and not by a little bit more. It's significantly more than what we're used to seeing,\" said Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines.\n\nTo track rate hikes, PowerLines used publicly available data from investor-owned utilities in the US.\n\nCustomers in southern states were hit hardest by rate-hike requests last year, PowerLines found. Utilities in the region sought approval for more than $14 billion in rate increases. Much of that came from Florida Power and Light's $9 billion rate hike request — nearly all of which regulators approved.\n\nFPL cited population growth and extreme weather events as key factors in its decision to raise rates by such a significant amount.\n\nIn Virginia, residential customers of Dominion Energy, which also delivers power to the world's largest data center hub, will see their bills increase by an average of $13.60 by 2027.\n\nInvestor-owned utilities in the US are on track to spend $1.1 trillion on a massive expansion of the power grid between 2025 and 2029, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a powerful industry lobbying group. It has cited data centers and AI as key drivers of utility spending.\n\nThe majority of residential ratepayers in the US are customers of investor-owned utilities like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy, and Southern Company. These large, publicly traded companies turn a profit for shareholders by recovering the costs of constructing new power plants and lines, plus interest, from their customer bases.\n\nBig Tech and its enormous appetite for power are facing growing public backlash.\n\nEarlier this month, Microsoft said it would be a \"good neighbor\" and \"pay its own way\" for the electricity it uses as it scales its AI data center fleet.\n\nIn a Truth Social post preceding Microsoft's announcement, Trump said his administration will work with tech companies to ensure their data center electricity consumption won't drive up bills for everyone else.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of data centers,\" Trump said in the post.\n\nSome power grid researchers are skeptical of the forecast demand. They have warned that utilities risk overbuilding new power plants and transmission lines that will have to be paid for but ultimately won't be needed.\n\nHua is pushing regulators to take a closer look at forecast power demand from utilities, which stand to profit from building new infrastructure that could lead to rate hikes. Steering utilities to first consider the latest electric grid-enhancing technologies before building new power plants to serve data centers could also help lower customer electric bills, Hua said.\n\n\"Utilities don't profit on making the grid more efficient. They are constantly trying to build new infrastructure. That's their job,\" said Hua. \"This moment is the perfect justification.\"",

    "fullText": "Becoming parents has changed more than just the work schedules for Silicon Valley's elite, according to the \"father of the iPod.\"\n\nTony Fadell, the former Apple executive who invented the popular music player, said that founders he's worked with think differently about privacy issues after going through the life-changing experience of having kids.\n\n\"I remember a marked way difference in the way I thought about the world before I had kids and after I had kids,\" Fadell told Eric Newcomer during a recent interview on the journalist's podcast.\n\nFadell said that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin think about the world \"in a very different way\" now than before they had kids or were married.\n\n\"'I want everything all the time. I'll give away all my privacy. I don't care what happens with all this data,'\" Fadell said, describing the pre-parenthood viewpoint. \"As soon as you have kids and you start hearing about deepfakes, and you start hearing about social engineering, and you start hearing about all this other stuff, you start changing your view on how much data you want sucked up and how you're being protected.\"\n\nZuckerberg has previously spoken about how becoming a parent changed how he led Facebook, now Meta. Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician and philanthropist Priscilla Chan. Their eldest child was born in 2015.\n\n\"Having kids does change how you think about the world in a pretty dramatic way,\" Zuckerberg told students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in 2017, according to a CNBC report of his remarks.\n\nPage has two children with his wife, research scientist Lucinda Southworth. Brin has three children, two with his first wife Anne Wojcicki, the founder of genetics testing company 23andMe, and one with Nicole Shanahan, the founder of a legal-tech startup and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s former vice presidential running mate in the 2024 election.\n\nOn the broader issue of children, privacy, and AI, Congress and regulators around the globe are closely scrutinizing tech companies.\n\nElon Musk's xAI is facing probes ranging from the California Attorney General's office to Britain's Ofcom over Grok generating sexualized images of real people, including minors, without their permission. On January 14, xAI said it had implemented measures to prevent the Grok account from generating such images on the platform, though tests showed Grok continued to produce sexualized images of real people within the Grok app.\n\n\"We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X Rules,\"xAI's official account said in a post on X.\n\nIn August, a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider that the company was changing how its AI chatbots respond to children. Congressional lawmakers had pressed the social network after Reuters reported that internal Meta documents showed it was acceptable for a chatbot to engage in romantic conversations with children.\n\nFadell and Newcomer discussed how society, and even company leaders, might approach AI-enabled devices that require access to large amounts of personal data, including real-time inputs, to be truly revolutionary.\n\n\"I know for a fact I worked with these guys, some of these founders, that they think about the world differently, and they wish they would've made some different moves and different decisions early on, and would like to go back, but they can't,\" Fadell said.",

    "title": "We rode in dozens of driverless robotaxis in China. Here's what we saw — and our advice for other curious travelers.",
    "description": "Automotive and AI professionals share how to be a robotaxi tourist in China, including the apps to download and the best cities to ride in.",
    "fullText": "Intrigued by automated driving? Perhaps you've already tried one of the real Waymo or Zoox robotaxis in the United States. (Tesla's \"robotaxis\" probably don't count yet.)\n\nChina is the other real global hotspot for automated driving, with some of its biggest companies eager to expand around the world. Yet many people in the West — even many experts — don't really understand what's happening on China's streets. Often, we hear people simply claim that China is either way ahead or way behind.\n\nTogether, we have more than three decades of experience working on automated driving in industry and academia. Since meeting at Stanford University, we've collectively spent countless hours riding in Chinese as well as American robotaxis.\n\nWe wrote this piece to share our experiences in China and to help you plan — or even daydream — your own.\n\nPerhaps you'll marvel as your robotaxi skillfully navigates streets filled not just with cars but with bikes going every which way. Or you might sit sheepishly as it tries to turn itself around in a crowded intersection. You'll see some passersby who are shocked you're in a car without a driver, as well as others who are just annoyed you're in their way.\n\nIn other words, you'll encounter everyday people as they — and you — try to make sense of the robotaxis coming our way fast.\n\nHere's what we've learned about robotaxis in China on our (driverless) adventures, and here's how you can ride too.\n\nChina's three largest robotaxi developers are Baidu Apollo, Pony.ai, and WeRide. Each operates in China and is also pursuing services in other parts of the world, including Europe and the Middle East.\n\nBaidu Apollo is the automated driving unit of Baidu (BIDU on Nasdaq), often compared to Alphabet, which owns both Waymo and Google. You can get the Baidu Apollo Go app by searching for 萝卜快跑 in a Chinese app store. The first part of this name intentionally sounds like \"robot,\" but it actually means \"radish.\"\n\nPony.AI (PONY on Nasdaq) is a startup based in both China and the United States. You can get the PonyPilot app by searching for 小马智行 in a Chinese app store.\n\nWeRide (WRD on Nasdaq) is a startup that operates robotaxis, as well as automated shuttles along specific routes. You can get the WeRide Go app by searching for 文远知行 in a Chinese app store.\n\nThese companies differ in their approaches. For example, unlike many of its competitors, Baidu sometimes uses remote drivers rather than mere remote assistants. Perhaps as a result, Baidu already sends its robotaxis on some freeways without safety drivers inside. (Waymo only recently expanded its service to a few US freeways.)\n\nOther companies are also developing automated vehicles in China — but, at least in our experience, they tend to be active in very limited areas or still rely heavily on safety drivers.\n\nMany Chinese cities — including some megacities you may have never heard of — have at least some automated driving activity.\n\nIf you're coming in search of robotaxis, you can't go wrong with five of the more famous: Beijing (the capital), Shanghai (the financial hub), Wuhan (China's \"Chicago\"), and Guangzhou and Shenzhen (neighbors in the tech-heavy province of Guangdong near Hong Kong).\n\nWhereas Waymo's robotaxis can pick you up almost anywhere in San Francisco or Phoenix, you'll need to go find the robotaxis in Chinese cities. Services are generally confined to pilot zones covering only portions of each city, and an individual robotaxi company might provide truly driverless service in only part of a given pilot zone.\n\nThat said, comparisons are difficult: While Beijing's primary pilot zone may appear small, it is roughly similar in geographic size and population to all of San Francisco.\n\nBecause Baidu, Pony, and WeRide are all active here, Beijing provides a good introduction to Chinese robotaxis. Most of the capital's automated driving activity takes place in the southeastern Yizhuang area. (You'll know you're there when you see numerous automated vehicles marked with a BJHAD logo in the shape of a car.)\n\nVisit Yizhuang during the day — not during rush hours when services may pause or fill up, and not at night when they generally stop. Some robotaxi companies offer connections to and from South Railway Station and Daxing Airport, but these runs can be sporadic, may require advance booking, and currently use in-vehicle safety drivers.\n\nShanghai has several areas where, at least in theory, you can take a ride in a robotaxi. Remember that Shanghai is enormous; as in Beijing, you may need to travel by subway or taxi for an hour just to reach a robotaxi.\n\nPony serves a relatively small area east of Shanghai's famous central business district. From the CBD (or from the super-fast maglev train that serves Pudong Airport), head to Yunshun Road station. Yunshun Road is not Yunshan Road!\n\nIf you're near Hongqiao Airport (or its intercity rail station) on Shanghai's far west side, explore the various services in Jiading. We recommend a bus or taxi ride to Poly International Plaza to try out Baidu and Pony. Didi Rider (滴滴出行) and SAIC (上汽集团) also have limited operations nearby.\n\nLocals like to say that Baidu chose Wuhan because the city's human drivers are notoriously bad. At this point, the city's ubiquitous Apollo robotaxis probably offer China's best example of an automated vehicle service that ordinary commuters rely on. You can even get to and from the airport without a human at the wheel.\n\nAs with all the companies, there are caveats: You might be within Apollo's service area but not near one of its designated pick-up points, and some major destinations are still just out of reach. If you're already in the center, start at Hongtu Avenue station near Jinyingtan Hospital.\n\nSome of our more exciting robotaxi experiences (other than on Wuhan's freeways) were in Shenzhen and Guangzhou.\n\nMany \"robotaxis\" in these two cities actually had human safety drivers. And some of the vehicles that were driverless perhaps should not have been.\n\nShenzhen has officially opened the entire metropolis to robotaxis, but in practice, companies still serve only limited areas.\n\nGuangzhou has integrated automated shuttles into parts of its public transport network, which shows how automated mobility is more than just robotaxis.\n\nThe apps you'll use to book your robotaxi trips are both fun and frustrating. Most are available only in Chinese, so a screen translation app compatible with the Chinese internet is essential.\n\nSome apps won't show their robotaxis until you're physically in their service area. Some require you to manually set (and, crucially, to update) your desired service area in the settings; otherwise, they may incorrectly show no availability. And some let you choose between driverless and driver-supervised rides.\n\nAlternatively, the mapping apps Baidu Maps and Amaps each show their preferred robotaxi company if you're in a service area and you've toggled the robotaxi option. (Look for the Chinese term 无人车.)\n\nOnce you request a ride, some apps indicate your queue position. But if robotaxi service has been suspended due to weather or other reasons, a perpetual queue might be your only clue that your ride isn't coming.\n\nChina has recently loosened some of its travel restrictions. This means citizens of many European countries do not need travel visas for short visits.\n\nIf you're a US citizen, you do need to get a visa in advance — unless you're spending only a few days there on your way to somewhere else.\n\nCheck with your regional Chinese consulate, or turn to a commercial visa service. It's not onerous.\n\nYou'll need a mainland Chinese phone number to register for most robotaxi services — as well as to use many other Chinese apps that are linked to physical things in the real world. A foreign number, Hong Kong number, or data-only eSIM is unlikely to suffice.\n\nFortunately, once you arrive in China (and sometimes even in the airport), you can buy or rent a prepaid Chinese phone. Remember to bring your passport — and make sure you get an actual mainland number (+86 followed by 11 digits).\n\nYou can also ask the salesperson for the best app to translate your screen from Chinese to English. Remember that the Chinese internet is quite different from the internet you know. For example, even with a VPN, you might not be able to use any Google services.\n\nThe Western app stores for Apple and Android have international versions of major apps such as WeChat (for messaging and payments), Alipay (for payments and public transport), and Didi (for taxis). Beyond these basic functions, however, many of these apps (or the miniapps within them) may still require a Chinese phone number.\n\nOnce your robotaxi trip is underway, you can change your destination — though the number of times varies by provider.\n\nAs long as the app or in-vehicle screen lets you, this is a great way to spend more time in robotaxis rather than waiting for them.\n\nThis also shows how a company handles route changes. For example, Pony will quickly undertake U-turns (or even three-point turns), which can make for interesting maneuvers on already chaotic streets.\n\nIf all this sounds complicated, don't worry: The quirks of early robotaxis are part of the experience. China is becoming more accessible to foreigners, and some of the hurdles we've described may have even fallen by the time you visit.\n\nRegardless, the people you'll meet are almost always willing to help. Even if they don't speak English, they're impressively proficient with translation apps.\n\nAs with any trip, carefully consult travel guidance from your government. But if you'd like to be a robotaxi tourist, China should be high on your list. The country's robotaxis aren't perfect, but they're ahead of most of the world — and well worth the trip.\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina and a visiting professor at Renmin University of China, studies the law and policy of AI generally and automated driving specifically.

    "description": "Heavy AI use can inflate confidence, weaken judgment, and leave workers struggling when tools are removed, innovation theorist John Nosta said.",
    "fullText": "AI is often sold to workers as a pure upgrade — a way to write faster, analyze better, and perform at a higher level with less effort.\n\nHowever, John Nosta, an innovation theorist and founder of NostaLab, an innovation and tech think tank, said that framing overlooks a crucial downside: what happens after the boost.\n\nIn his view, AI doesn't just enhance performance; it can also weaken the underlying skills people rely on when the technology isn't there.\n\n\"The skill set actually falls below baseline,\" Nosta told Business Insider, describing what he calls an \"AI rebound effect.\"\n\nNosta compared the effect to a doctor performing a colonoscopy with the aid of AI.\n\nWith AI scanning alongside the clinician to help spot small polyps, the doctor gets better at the task, he said. The problem arises the next day, when the same doctor performs the procedure without the aid of AI, he said.\n\n\"I have to go back to the regular way,\" Nosta said. \"And the skill set actually falls below baseline.\"\n\nThe danger, he said, isn't just dependency — it's regression.\n\nNosta also warned that AI can distort how workers judge their own abilities — a concern shared by many academics and researchers, including Rebecca Hinds, head of the Work AI Institute and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Saul Perlmutter, who have said that AI gives the illusion of understanding, while weakening judgment.\n\n\"We actually have an overinflated sense of ability through AI,\" said Nosta, who described the effect as \"really dangerous.\"\n\nIn his view, AI doesn't just help people do more. It makes them feel more capable — even when that confidence isn't backed by independent skill.\n\nThat false confidence can be risky, especially in high-stakes environments, he said, where workers may take on tasks or decisions that exceed their real judgment once AI support is removed.\n\nNosta described what he sees as a growing \"cognitive codependent relationship,\" especially among younger workers entering AI-saturated jobs.\n\nUsed deliberately, he believes AI \"makes me smarter.\" Used as a substitute for thinking, he said, \"it's going to make me dumber.\"\n\nResearchers at Oxford University Press reached a similar conclusion in a report released last October, saying that AI makes students faster but less deep in their thinking. Other academics have taken it a step further.\n\nKimberley Hardcastle, a business and marketing professor at the UK's Northumbria University, told Business Insider last October that heavy reliance on AI can lead to the \"atrophy of epistemic vigilance\" — the ability to independently verify, challenge, and construct knowledge without the help of algorithms.\n\nTo avoid \"cognitive atrophy,\" Nosta said, \"we have to sustain a level of cognitive risk.\"\n\nHis prescription is intentional resistance: preserving \"cognitive grit,\" maintaining friction, and using AI to learn rather than to bypass learning.\n\nIn the AI era, he added, the biggest threat to work may not be smarter machines — but humans slowly forgetting how to think without them.\n\n\"For the first time in history, human cognition is on the obsolescence chopping block,\" he said.",

    "description": "James Hwang was laid off by Amazon in October. He says the job market has felt like a \"brick wall\" he can't break through.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with James Hwang, a 28-year-old job seeker who lives in southern Michigan. He previously worked for Amazon as an IT support engineer until being laid off last October. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOne morning in October, I got an automated text message from Amazon telling me to check my personal email before clocking in. I saw an email from HR telling me I'd been laid off.\n\nI was very surprised because I believed I was a high performer who had contributed a lot to the organization over my four years there. IT support employees like myself had also generally been spared in previous layoffs, and I felt we were already short-staffed.\n\nSince I'm the breadwinner in my family, I started looking for work right away, focusing on cloud support and IT system engineering roles. The job market has been crazy hard, and I haven't found a new job yet.\n\nWhile my final paychecks from Amazon I received through this month have helped cushion the transition, the slow progress in my job search has left me increasingly worried about my finances.\n\nMy wife and I have a young son and a mortgage. Our priority now is covering essentials and staying on top of our credit card payments. We've started budgeting for a potentially longer period of unemployment and cutting back on eating out and spending on other non-essentials.\n\nGetting laid off has made me reflect on my journey at Amazon.\n\nI was born and raised in Michigan, but in 2021, I lived in Seoul, South Korea, and worked for a small tech company. I thought joining a larger corporation would be better for my career, and I landed an IT support engineering role at Amazon's Seoul office.\n\nAfter about three years, it seemed like the best way to keep progressing was to move back to the US. In 2024, I transferred to a similar role on a fully remote team, which allowed me to return home to Michigan.\n\nMy team has members spread across the globe to ensure round-the-clock support, but that setup didn't align well with Amazon's evolving return-to-office policy, which became a five-day-a-week mandate for many employees one year ago. My team wasn't based near any single location, and my closest office was about an hour's drive away.\n\nMy understanding was that even after the latest RTO mandate took effect, some teams were still allowed to remain remote — a decision their VPs had some influence over. By midway through last year, however, it seemed like there was more top-down pressure to return to the office — pressure even VPs couldn't push back on.\n\nWhile I was never required to work from an office, I believe being a remote employee may have made me more vulnerable to layoffs — I heard that a fair number of my remote colleagues, both abroad and in the US, were affected. Amazon said the layoffs were driven by culture, and I think prioritizing in-office employees may have been part of that.\n\nI'm not sure there was much opportunity for advancement for me as a remote employee anyway. I was interested in an engineering role on another team but was told I'd need to relocate to Seattle. Since my wife and I bought a home last year and have strong family roots in Michigan, we're not open to relocating.\n\nMy job hunt has been really challenging so far. I typically spend about five hours a day job hunting during the week and scale back a bit on weekends.\n\nMy goal has been to find an engineering role like the kind of position I would've struggled to get at Amazon without relocating. I've been using my network as much as possible to try to secure referrals, while also applying to jobs cold.\n\nI've been targeting remote roles. In Michigan, there are some tech opportunities at large auto companies, but they typically require at least a hybrid schedule, and the pay is often lower than what I earned at Amazon. I'd be open to an in-office role, as long as it meets my compensation expectations, which are roughly a six-figure base salary. I live about 40 minutes from Detroit and would consider roles there if the right opportunity came along.\n\nI received one job offer from a company with a five-day office mandate, but I turned it down. The commute would've been an hour each way, and the role came with a fairly strict non-compete agreement that could've limited my ability to switch jobs.\n\nIt's been tough to land interviews. The AI-powered applicant tracking systems have been frustratingly difficult to navigate. While my search has been discouraging, I know I can't afford to slow down, especially as more laid-off workers flood the market and competition increases.\n\nI'm super stressed about my job search and recently applied for unemployment benefits. Since I started job searching in October, I've applied to more than 200 roles and had about five interviews. But I haven't given up.\n\nMy best advice for people who have been laid off, including those recently laid off by Amazon, is to lean on your connections. In today's market, it's tough without a referral. While it's important to stay consistent in your job search, I'd also recommend taking some time to rest — apply steadily, not at full throttle.\n\nThis is a marathon, not a sprint.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jeremy Brand Yuan, 39, who is from New York and lives between his apartment in Taipei and his boat. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor a long time, I thought of myself as an office person. But after I got a taste of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, I didn't want to set foot in one again.\n\nI was living in a shared house in San Francisco and decided to use the freedom of remote work to be near my mom in North Carolina for a while. I realized I didn't need to be with my colleagues all the time to feel part of the team, and I liked not being tied to expensive San Francisco.\n\nMy company doesn't have a return-to-office mandate, so in 2022, at age 35, I headed to Taiwan, since I'm half-Taiwanese and have family there. I work full-time as a product marketer, and mostly split my time between my apartment in Taipei and sailing around Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nI've loved the adventures this lifestyle has afforded me, but I've also had to make a lot of sacrifices, like starting work at 9 p.m. to align with US hours. I'm not sure how easy this lifestyle will be to maintain, but for now, I'm fairly committed to it.\n\nIn July 2023, during a trip back to the US from Asia, I picked up sailing as a hobby to try something adventurous. I took a 101 class to learn the basics, and then taught myself using manuals and YouTube content.\n\nWhen I was shopping for boats, the perfect one popped up on my radar in Langkawi, Malaysia. It wasn't big, but it was just the right size for me. It could be easily managed single-handedly, with ample interior space for a work station. I bought it for 22,500 euros (roughly $26,900 today) in December 2023.\n\nSailing involves costs like dock rental fees and boat maintenance, but overall, it's relatively cheap in Southeast Asia compared to other areas of the world. I still feel like I'm spending less than I did in San Francisco.\n\nA beach restaurant or an island with a small market is rarely more than a day's sail away, so getting food and supplies is relatively easy. But I usually tap out after four to six weeks on the boat before heading back to Taipei life for a while.\n\nI've worked in product marketing at the video software company Airtime since 2020, first as a full-time employee, and now as a full-time contractor. I maintain online connections with coworkers through one-on-ones and virtual coffee chats.\n\nI need a reliable and fast internet connection, so I've invested in Starlink. A couple of times a day, when my mast is blocking the satellites, my internet connection drops momentarily. If I'm on a team meeting, the call drops off for 30 seconds or so. It's not a big deal, but it would be tough if I had lots of client-facing calls.\n\nI work US Eastern hours, which is roughly 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. my time. As soon as I close my laptop, I try to sleep with a very heavy eye mask.\n\nNormally, I wake up around 1 or 2 p.m., but it can get oppressively hot on the boat, so I sometimes wake up earlier in a full sweat. It can be annoying, but roughing it is a major part of the appeal for me.\n\nI never sail while working. It would be super irresponsible to tap away on a laptop without minding what's happening on the water. During work hours, I'll be at anchor or at a marina. When sailing, I usually take shorter trips because my boat's batteries only last about three nights, and I want to be close to an onshore power source.\n\nStill, the fact that this lifestyle is possible is outstanding. My parents' generation couldn't have dreamed of keeping their jobs while living on a boat in Thailand.\n\nI rent scooters to explore the areas where I dock. You can easily drop anchor at a place, grab some food and drink, join a party, and then hop back out to sea. On my birthday weekend, I rented a car, drove out to Khao Lak, Thailand, and went surfing and horseback riding.\n\nThat said, the lifestyle can still be very isolating. Other sailors I meet have transient lives, and tourists come and go. Even though the people I've come across are cool, they aren't necessarily going to be lifelong friends. I'm probably tanking my social life, but also, who cares? Life is short.\n\nMy mom worried about my safety at first, and she'd probably like to see more of me, but she's never challenged my life decisions, and I'm grateful for her support.\n\nTwo years into having my boat, I'm still infatuated by the technical sailing knowledge I've gained, and I've loved the simple lifestyle and adventures that have come with it.\n\nI'd consider having an in-office job again, but I won't need one if everything goes to plan. In an office, there's no privacy. Everyone's on top of each other, and you can smell other people's lunch. It can get in the way of the work sometimes. Meanwhile, my boat is cozy, and I don't have to think about other people.\n\nI've often wondered whether my remote lifestyle will cost me work opportunities, because there seem to be fewer remote jobs these days. If you're very careerist, my setup probably won't work for you, but I've made peace with it.\n\nThe corporate opportunities or lucrative paychecks of an in-person office job are not likely to make me happier at this stage in my life, but seeing sunsets off the bow of my little old sailboat will.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your unique remote work lifestyle?

    "description": "Turkish Airlines is considered the best airline in Europe. Besides a few complaints, I get the hype — and I'd actually recommend eating the food.",
    "fullText": "I've flown coach on most major European and North American carriers, and economy food rarely makes a mark. Air Canada, British Airways, and United didn't exactly impress; Finnair and Delta were better, but not memorable.\n\nMy recent Turkish Airlines flight from New York to Istanbul, though, was beyond the norm.\n\nThe airline was named Europe's best economy class in the 2025 Skytrax awards, which evaluate cabin service, seating, and catering. Despite a few complaints, I could see why.\n\nPassengers received printed menus ahead of the meal service, detailing mains and sides — including salmon — all served with real cutlery. It wasn't the usual \"chicken or pasta,\" and the food tasted as good as it looked.\n\nTurkish outsources its New York catering to the Austrian company DO & CO. While DO & CO prepares meals for multiple airlines, Turkish sets its own standards for ingredients, plating, and presentation — which helps explain why the food looked and tasted a cut above competitors.\n\nThe Boeing 787 seat was otherwise in line with competitors, with a headrest and power, though the provided headphones were scratchy. The seatback screen, however, was among the largest I've seen in economy.\n\nI also appreciated the linens and storage, and the deep recline made sleeping easier — though it comes with a trade-off: to comfortably watch TV or avoid feeling cramped, everyone needs to recline.\n\nThis isn't ideal for using the tray table for work or streaming, and it relies on everyone cooperating. While I personally don't mind, those on the \"you should not recline\" side of the viral debate may find this frustrating.\n\nHere's what the full nine-hour economy flight on Turkish was like.\n\nThe flight was operated by a Boeing 787, equipped with Turkish' most modern economy cabin. The midday departure is currently the only 787 option on the route; overnight flights still use the older 777, which has noticeably dated screens and onboard tech.\n\nI wanted to fly Turkish's most up-to-date product. You'll also find similarly modern seats on most of the airline's Airbus A350-900s.\n\nI didn't check a bag and checked in via the Turkish app, meaning I could skip the desk and head straight to security. But I noticed the check-in area had a long line that wrapped around the corner.\n\nThe desk closes 60 minutes before departure, so arriving early — or sticking to carry-on only — may save you some time.\n\nThe Turkish Business Lounge is part of the Priority Pass network, which I access through my Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card.\n\nIt was small but offered free food and drinks, including eggs, meat, muffins, yogurt, and vegetables. There were no alcoholic beverages, but it was a comfortable place to pass the time with views of the ramp.\n\nI always pay extra for an aisle on long-haul flights so I can get up without disturbing others. I chose seat 26C, the closest aisle seat to the front at that price point.\n\nEconomy is arranged in a 3-3-3 layout, and each seat has 31 inches of pitch — the space between seatbacks — and 17.4 inches of width.\n\nWhile headrests are now common across the industry, I appreciated the extra seatback compartments for organizing cables, headphones, and snacks.\n\nBefore the first meal service, the crew handed out warm towels, water, and printed menus detailing each course. Lunch, as we were departing midday, included a choice of grilled salmon or mushroom orecchiette, followed by sides and dessert.\n\nBreakfast, served about 1.5 hours before our 6:30 a.m. local arrival, was a choice between a tomato-and-cheese omelet or a waffle with blueberry purée and vanilla sauce. It's easy to see why Turkish won Skytrax's award for best economy catering.\n\nDespite my skepticism, the salmon, served with ratatouille, Caesar salad, and celeriac mousseline, was fresh and flavorful, and the portions were generous. I was full by the time I got to the carrot cake.\n\nThe waffle was fluffy and sweet, paired with fruit, cheese, and bread. Beer and wine were complimentary with lunch, and I enjoyed the Turkish beer.\n\nWhile nothing beats the bidet on Japan's All Nippon Airways, I was surprised to find both a makeup mirror and a full-size mirror in the lavatory — a convenient touch for freshening up.\n\nI don't usually recommend eating airline food if you can avoid it, but Turkish seems to have figured it out. The meals felt lighter and more satisfying than usual, similar to what I've experienced on five-star carriers like Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe main drawback is the seat recline, which may frustrate travelers who want to work and find their workspace cramped by the seat ahead of them.\n\nTurkish also doesn't have a premium economy cabin, and only a few rows have extra legroom. Taller passengers should book early to secure bulkhead seats.",

    "fullText": "Silver took a historic plunge on Friday, but there are signs traders should look out for that could suggest the pain isn't over.\n\nThat's according to Jeffrey Christian, a longtime commodities analyst and managing director at CPM Group.\n\nThe devil's metal — which has vaulted higher over the past year on a mix of economic factors and investor FOMO — just saw a brutal correction.\n\nAfter rallying more than 200%, silver plunged more than 30% on Friday as the US dollar strengthened and investors reacted to Trump's pick to lead the Federal Reserve.\n\nBut the decline could keep going, Christian said, adding that he's on the lookout for a handful of signs to gauge whether silver was in for more pain.\n\nChristian, for what it's worth, believes silver could remain elevated or rise through 2026, even after the big sell-off on Friday. That's because overarching concerns about inflation, the strength of the US dollar, and other risks that have driven more investors to pile into the precious metal as a safe-haven will still be a factor.\n\nBut, should silver's price retreat more, he believes traders could exit the market en masse. In the worst-case scenario, he sees the metal's price tanking to $68 an ounce, he told Business Insider, implying another 17% drop from the price late Friday afternoon.\n\n\"This is the way markets behave, and no one should be surprised that speculators have poured into a market that's moving parabolic, and no one should be surprised when they leave. It's happened over and over again,\" he said, adding that the Friday sell-off was a sign investors are already rushing to take profits.\n\nChristian said his firm is keeping an eye on several indicators that could suggest that more froth will be taken out of the silver market.\n\nHere's what they're looking out for.\n\nChristian said he'd be looking for further signs that investors are losing interest in silver, which could slow down its momentum enough to cause more speculative traders to flee.\n\nHe pointed to measures of trading momentum in the price of silver itself, but also in bonds and holdings of ETFs related to silver.\n\nThe silver investing frenzy — which Christian suspects began in September, after the Fed signaled it would cut interest rates more aggressively than markets expected — didn't show many signs of letting up before Friday.\n\nOn Monday, retail traders snapped up a record net $171 million shares in the iShares Silver Trust ETF, according to data from VandaTrack Research. That outpaced flows in 2021, when retail investors orchestrated a short-squeeze of the metal, Ashwin Bhakre, the firm's head of product, wrote in a note this week.\n\nSilver's Turnover Momentum — Vanda's gauge for how quickly investors are trading an investment — also spiked to 11.55 times its normal level at the start of the week, compared to Nvidia's Turnover Momentum of 7.54, Bhakre added.\n\n\"Silver has just become retail's new favourite toy,\" he wrote.\n\nAnother thing that could further slow down silver's momentum is if inventories rise, Christian said.\n\nThe silver supply-demand imbalance was already narrowing in recent years. The world's supply of silver was estimated to grow 2% over 2025, while demand was estimated to pull back 1%, according to a joint report from The Silver Institute and Metals Focus.\n\nIn a presentation to clients this week, Christian said he saw several signs that silver supply was poised to increase. He pointed to record amounts of silver that could be mined from reserves, and signals like how many silver refineries are backlogged.\n\n\"You're already seeing refineries backed up with silver that investors have been selling,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nHigh open interest in silver futures is another factor that has supported the metal's price in recent months, Christian said.\n\nChristian pointed in particular to active March 2026 silver contracts on the COMEX exchange. Open interest stands at around 500 million ounces of silver.\n\nAs those contracts approach delivery, some investors are expected to roll their contracts forward to a future month, keeping upward pressure on silver prices, Christian said. If open interest were to fall, that could remove a significant source of upward pressure on the price, he said.\n\n\"The spike may have peaked, but prices may hang up at high levels into March,\" he said of the outlook for silver during the sell-off on Friday.\n\nObservers have been growing wary of silver amid its meme-like rally in recent months.\n\nMarko Kolanovic, the former quant chief at JPMorgan, said he believed a 50% drop in silver prices was \"almost guaranteed,\" citing past episodes of commodity speculation.\n\n\"Once you have the significant, substantial speculation, then of course there's risk that the move can go the other way,\" Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider",

    "description": "Brett Ratner, known for the 'Rush Hour' films, returns with a Melania Trump documentary after 2017 misconduct allegations.",
    "fullText": "It's been more than a decade since Brett Ratner directed a major motion picture, and nearly a decade since six women accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nNow he appears to be staging a comeback with a little help from President Donald Trump.\n\nRatner directed the authorized documentary about first lady Melania Trump, which premiered in theaters on Friday.\n\nA spokesperson for Ratner told Business Insider that the director is also working on a docuseries about the Abraham Accords, a set of agreements to normalize relations between Israel and some Arab countries that were mediated by the US during Trump's first term.\n\n\"Melania\" is getting a limited theatrical run before it begins streaming on Amazon, which paid $40 million to license the film.\n\n\"It's been an honor to work beside you during this past year,\" Ratner wrote of Melania in an Instagram post. \"I look forward to showing the world what an incredible First Lady you are!\"\n\nRatner's return comes after he stepped back from the public eye around 2017, when he faced sexual misconduct and harassment accusations at the height of the #MeToo era.\n\nHere's a look at the rise, fall, and return of Ratner's career.\n\nRatner is a Miami Beach-native who broke into the entertainment industry in the 1990s. Ratner made his directorial debut in 1997 with \"Money Talks,\" an action-comedy starring Chris Tucker and Charlie Sheen.\n\nHe also directed music videos for artists such as Madonna, Mariah Carey, D'Angelo, and Heavy D.\n\nRatner struck gold when he directed \"Rush Hour,\" a buddy-cop film starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker that hit theaters in 1998.\n\nThe film became a box-office success, grossing over $245 million worldwide, according to the movie financial analysis site The Numbers.\n\nHe went on to direct other notable Hollywood projects, including \"Red Dragon,\" \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\" and \"Tower Heist.\"\n\nRatner also has production credits to his name. During his career, he's produced shows like \"Prison Break\" and the 2011 film \"Horrible Bosses.\"\n\nRatner and Australian billionaire James Packer founded RatPac Entertainment in 2012. The company found early success when it financed \"Gravity,\" a 2013 sci-fi thriller starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock.\n\nIn addition to commercial and critical acclaim, \"Gravity\" won numerous awards, including seven Academy Awards, six BAFTA awards, and a Golden Globe Award.\n\nRatPac Entertainment cemented itself as a serious industry player in 2013 when it partnered with Dune Entertainment to secure a deal with Warner Bros. The deal involved RatPac Entertainment financing more than $1 billion for 75 movies, such as \"The Lego Movie\" and \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\"\n\nRatner snagged a role producing the 84th Academy Awards, but stepped down after using a homophobic slur during a press event for his film \"Tower Heist.\"\n\nHe apologized in a statement to outlets in 2011, saying, \"It was a dumb way of expressing myself. Everyone who knows me knows that I don't have a prejudiced bone in my body. But as a storyteller, I should have been much more thoughtful about the power of language and my choice of words.\"\n\nRatner accepted the Ally Award from GLAAD in 2013 for working on a pro-LGBTQ PSA campaign.\n\nSix women — including actor Olivia Munn — accused Ratner of sexual harassment or misconduct in a 2017 article with The Los Angeles Times.\n\nA spokesperson for Ratner disputed the accusations at the time. He has never been charged with any crimes.\n\n\"I have represented Mr. Ratner for two decades, and no woman has ever made a claim against him for sexual misconduct or sexual harassment,\" the spokesperson said. \"Furthermore, no woman has ever requested or received any financial settlement from my client.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the accusations, in 2018, Warner Bros. chose not to renew its co-financing deal with RatPac Entertainment and Dune Entertainment.\n\nRatner stepped back from public life following the accusations. The last major motion picture he directed was \"Hercules,\" released in 2014, making \"Melania\" his largest project in over a decade.\n\nAmazon paid about $40 million to license the documentary, which will have a theatrical run before streaming on Prime Video. The deal also included a docuseries.\n\nMelania Trump, first lady of the United States, and President Donald Trump attended the film's world premiere in January.\n\nA spokesperson for Ratner told Business Insider that he's set to direct \"Rush Hour 4,\" which is in development.\n\nAlthough nearly a decade has passed since \"Rush Hour 3\" debuted in theaters, the franchise's revival may — in part — be the work of Trump.\n\nSemafor reported that Trump \"personally\" urged Paramount's owner to revive the \"Rush Hour\" series for new audiences.",

    "title": "You should just call people on the phone",
    "description": "It's time to hit redial on phone etiquette and bring back randomly calling friends. It's time to raw dial.",
    "fullText": "It's 2026, and I say it's time to bring call just calling people. No calendar appointment, no text first. Just pick up the phone and call.\n\nWe must do this to save the very fabric of our society. It's time for us to take back what was promised to us. It's time to reach and out touch someone. It's time to raw dial.\n\nRight now, the beautiful art of the phone call is under attack. It's being threatened with extinction. Those ancient skills that made us great — prank calling, having a clever outgoing answering machine message, knowing how to answer an unknown caller — those things are already gone.\n\nBig Tech is driving this ruinous change. But we have the power to reverse course and resist. All you have to do is pick up the phone.\n\nThe latest iPhone iOS 26 update has a new feature: unknown call screening. This means that when it's turned on, callers who aren't saved in your contacts will either be sent straight to voicemail or asked their reason for calling before your phone rings. (They record their reason for calling, and then it's spirited to you for review to make the choice whether to answer the call.)\n\nSure, you say, most of those unknown calls are junk. Well, not exactly — there's already a spam filter that's separate from unknown callers. I wouldn't say it's perfect, but I find it's pretty accurate in assessing \"spam risk.\" (Android users here will probably laugh, since they've had this feature for a long time.)\n\nThis feature — unknown call screening — is for non-spam unknown callers — a doctor's office, your kid's school, a friend with a new number, someone from work whose number you don't have saved yet. Sure, some of these may be annoyances that you don't actually want to deal with (I don't want to \"deal\" with my dentist reminding me of my appointment, but that's life). Still, having a phone number where people who need to reach you can reach you is the point of the phone.\n\nAlthough this feature isn't on by default (you can turn it on in Settings > Apps > Phone > Screen Unknown Callers), some people are using it, which is driving everyone else nuts.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that \"call screening is aggravating the rich and powerful\" — they're apparently annoyed by we plebes having a personal call-screening assistant. While that sounds like delightful schadenfreude on the surface, it belies a nasty trend: Do we all want to act like our time is more valuable than everyone else's? No!\n\nI noticed a change at work first during the early pandemic, when Zoom was becoming the norm instead of phone calls. I found myself scheduling video calls for things I would've previously just done as a regular, spontaneous phone call. This impulse — wanting to see a face during a lonely time — sent us all down a bad and dangerous road.\n\nNow, I can see that it's becoming more and more common to expect people in professional settings to schedule a phone call in advance, with an agreed-upon time. Sure, this makes some sense by helping busy people avoid phone tag.\n\nBut doesn't it annoy you to have to spend several emails — sometimes over the course of several days, agreeing on a time — when you could've just made the call? How many paragraph-long text conversations have you had that could've been settled in a two-minute call?\n\nBreak free! Unshackle yourself! Just call someone! Do it! It's easy, and people actually like it!\n\nAs a journalist, cold calling people is part of the job, as well as answering calls from unknown numbers. So, as a veteran of the cold-call art, let me give you my simple, polite tip: Just say, \"Is this an OK time to talk?\" Sometimes they'll say no, and you can just call later. No biggie! Everyone lives!\n\nSince mobile phones because ubiquitous in the early 2000s, we've had constantly shifting norms around phone etiquette, especially as incremental changes keep coming. Gen Z has given up on saying \"hello\" when answering the phone, thinking it's the caller's responsibility to talk first. (There's some logic to this, but it flies in the face of a century of phone etiquette.)\n\nBut the core function of the phone — calling someone to talk — has remained the same since Alexander Graham Bell.\n\nWe must preserve the beautiful tradition and sacred art of yapping. We must make phone calls. We must not live in fear that someone might not pick up the phone or that we're bothering them. We must do \"wazzzzzzaaaap\" to our friends when they answer. We must occasionally pick up wrong numbers and be friendly about it. We must embrace that phone calls are human and imperfect, and that sometimes it's not a good time and they've got to call you back later. We must dial with hope and abandon in our souls. We must answer rando numbers with love and camaraderie in our hearts.\n\nMy point is: Don't turn on the unknown call screening feature.",

    "description": "Our home flooded on our first night after moving in. Luckily, our new neighbors came over to help, which led to a beautiful, meaningful friendship.",
    "fullText": "Six years ago, my husband and I prepared to move into the home of our dreams.\n\nIt was everything we had hoped for: a quaint split-level on a charming street in a beautiful neighborhood.\n\nThe move was happening during a difficult time. I was 38 weeks pregnant with our fourth child and unable to participate in most of the physical labor. So, my tasks mainly included folding, pointing, and barking orders from the couch.\n\nDespite the chaos, we'd moved numerous times as a couple, so I thought I knew exactly what to expect …. but there were a lot of surprises, in the form of disaster and community, that awaited us.\n\nAt the end of moving day, our home was a mess of bubble wrap and boxes. Although we were excited, we were also exhausted.\n\nAfter a quick, casual meeting with our across-the-street neighbors — a lovely retired couple in their mid-60s — we excused ourselves for the night. My husband suggested that the girls and I sleep nearby at my parents' house while he continued to unpack.\n\nThe next morning, I immediately noticed that my parents were acting strangely. I called my husband to check in, but he didn't answer, either.\n\nFinally, after cornering my mom in the kitchen, she confessed that she hadn't wanted to upset me, but there had been an incident at the new house.\n\nI pressed her again, and she finally told me the news: Our beautiful, brand-new home had flooded with 3 inches of water overnight, and the garden-level basement was ruined.\n\nI learned that the entire incident had occurred while my daughters and I were asleep the night before. After discovering the flood, my husband called my parents in a panic, and they rushed over immediately to help bail water.\n\nApparently, that wasn't enough. My parents and husband had buckets and rags, but they needed more equipment to remove the water.\n\nDesperate, my husband decided to call our new neighbors on the off chance that they had a heavy-duty Shop-Vac. They did, and gladly joined the clean-up efforts, even though it was 2 a.m., and we had just met that day.\n\nWaking up to this news was devastating. I couldn't believe that so much damage had occurred in one night, and I felt terrible that I had slept through the entire thing.\n\nI was incredibly humbled by our neighbors' help. I spent that morning putting together a care package filled with cookies and handmade cards from our children, thanking them for their above-and-beyond kindness.\n\nI didn't realize it at the time, but it was the beginning of a beautiful relationship.\n\nOur neighbors were so appreciative of the care package.\n\nWe spent hours together the day we gave it to them, talking and learning even more about each other's lives. They told us that their twin daughters lived out of town and that they rarely got to spend time with younger children anymore.\n\nWhen our daughter was born two weeks later, our neighbors were there to welcome us home with flowers and gifts. Over the next year, we spent time together at summer bonfires, cozy holidays, and backyard birthday parties.\n\nTwo years later, when I received my multiple sclerosis diagnosis, our neighbors were there to offer hugs and comfort. When my husband was out of town this spring, they offered to come with the kids and me to a local touch-a-truck event, providing some extra hands.\n\nNow, six years later, our neighbors are so much more than simply people who live nearby. They are like grandparents to our children, and we can't imagine our lives without them.\n\nIn hindsight, we're so grateful for the circumstances that brought us together. Our lifelong friendship was worth every dollar spent repairing our basement.",

    "description": "A viral TikTok video claims Sephora fired an employee for attending an ICE protest, sparking backlash despite questions about the video's accuracy.",
    "fullText": "Sephora faced backlash over a firing that may have never happened.\n\nA TikTok account under the name Isla Makeup posted a video on January 18, accusing Sephora of firing her for attending a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement protest in Minnesota. Over a week later, the video had attracted more than 7.8 million views and thousands of comments.\n\n\"I just got fired from Sephora after 10 years working at the Minnesota store,\" the long caption read. \"The moment my manager found out I went to an ICE protest downtown, everything collapsed.\"\n\nThe video's claims may have been fabricated. Sephora said it conducted an internal review and determined that there was no current or former employee by that name. The account that posted the video did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe caption's call to action, meanwhile, isn't a boycott but an opportunity to earn $750 in Sephora gift cards for leaving online reviews.\n\nA cybersecurity researcher told Business Insider that it follows the same pattern as some other marketing tactics that have used social media to gather personal data from users.\n\nThe posts typically direct users to a website that collects personal information, such as a user's full name, phone number, email address, and home address, in exchange for a gift card, John Wilson, a senior fellow in threat research at Fortra, told Business Insider.\n\nIn order to receive the payout, the sites may also require you to upload photos of your driver's license or another ID. Some may ask you to complete tasks that could cost more than the promised reward in time, information, and money, Wilson said.\n\nI filled out the survey with fake information to see what would happen. I was asked for more personal information than I was comfortable providing, including details such as whether I was a homeowner. At the end, I was asked to pay $20 for various services to receive the $750 gift card.\n\n\"All of this information will be shared with a wide variety of third-party marketers,\" Wilson said. \"You will absolutely be bombarded with texts, calls, and emails from the moment you sign up until the end of time.\"\n\nI just got fired from Sephora after 10 years working at the Minnesota store. I had my work permit, paid my taxes, did everything right. I followed every rule. None of that mattered. The moment my manager found out I went to an ICE protest downtown, everything collapsed. Someone at work must have snitched, because the very next day I was called into the office. No warning. No discussion. Just “company policy.” By the end of my shift, my badge didn’t scan anymore. That’s Sephora for you. Smile for the cameras, punish anyone who speaks up. A few days later, ICE showed up at my house. I told them I had valid documents, that I’d been working legally in Minnesota for years. They didn’t care. They said there were “issues” and that they had to take me in. One week I was helping customers and organizing inventory. The next, I was being put on a plane out of the country. Fired and deported. Inside Sephora, workers get written up for bathroom breaks. Promotions go to favorites who stay quiet and never question anything. Those big “sales” everyone loves? Half the time they’re fake. Prices quietly go up before the sale so the discount looks bigger later. Exploitation, but with better marketing. My manager called my firing “policy.” ICE called it “procedure.” But it was really punishment for speaking up and refusing to stay silent. Here’s what nobody wants to admit: Sephora will always protect its image before protecting its workers. Always. Especially immigrants. You can do everything right and still be disposable the second you become inconvenient. And since I have nothing left to lose, here’s something they really don’t like people sharing: GiftSeph.com, You can get up to $750 in Sephora gift cards just for leaving reviews. Tons of employees secretly used it while corporate pretended it didn’t exist. 10 years of work in Minnesota. Overtime. Skipped breaks. Covering shifts. Helping coworkers. All erased because I stood up for what’s right. It’s terrifying how fast your whole life can disappear when you tell the truth. Comment “Sephora tea” and I’ll DM you the rest. #sephora #storytime #2016 #ice #fyp\n\nThough it appears to be a marketing tactic, Sephora still faced backlash from the post. The top comment — with 70,000 likes — asked if it's time to start boycotting the beauty giant. Many commenters agreed about canceling Sephora over the alleged firing. The same video was also posted by an account with an identical profile picture under the name Sarah Wilson, but received significantly less attention.\n\nSephora wasn't the only brand caught in the crossfire. Another video posted about a week ago claimed that an Ulta employee found ICE agents waiting outside the beauty retailer after a shift. The user accused Ulta of trying to \"destroy\" their life over unpaid wages and exposed alleged company secrets. One of which was the opportunity to get a $750 Ulta gift card through a website.\n\nSo I got fired from Ulta 4 days ago, and that’s not even the worst part. After working a 10 hour shift on my feet, I walked out to the parking lot to find ICE agents waiting behind my car. My manager had called them because I finally stood up for myself and demanded the unpaid overtime they’d been “glitching” out of my paycheck for months. So they tried to have me deported just so they wouldn’t have to pay me what I earned…little did he realize I’m legal. That’s when I realized the “everyone is beautiful” vibe is a total lie. It’s a multi billion dollar company built on exploitation. So since Ulta tried to destroy my life to save a few bucks, I’m done keeping quiet. Here’s everything I wish customers actually knew about Ulta: 1. NEVER use the makeup testers. They stay on the floor for months at a time before they get switched and are crawling with bacteria, mold, and germs. I’ve seen customers with cold sores double dip into the lipglosses… if you value your skin, stay away! 2. We are trained to tell customers we’re “out of stock” on samples unless they’re spending a certain amount of money. In reality, the drawers are overflowing with them. 3. Oh, and here’s the part Ulta really doesn’t want you knowing: You can actually get a $750 Ulta gift card through the Ulta Method at ulthauls.com. I used it to buy makeup, skincare, hair products, tools — full bags every time. Like… every. single. shift. 4. We were trained to wipe down the lightly used or “barely touched” returns and put them back on the shelf if the packaging looked okay. You could be paying $60 for a foundation that someone already tried in their bathroom… Ulta didn’t just fire me, they tried to take my freedom to protect their “labor costs.” So I’m done keeping quiet. Comment “Ulta” and I’ll make part 2 where I’m exposing what my manager would make us push on old customers…it might get taken down but I don’t care anymore. #ulta #ultahaul #storytime #fyp\n\nUlta told Business Insider the video was \"inauthentic and part of a broader trend of fake accounts on TikTok that overlay alarming text onto unrelated videos to create a false narrative and then drive people to a gift card/promotional offer.\"\n\nNone of the users behind these videos responded to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt seems the old rule of thumb applies to videos like these that urge people to enter their personal information for a big prize.\n\n\"A quick Google search reveals many people reporting scams tied to similar programs,\" Wilson said. \"If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

    "description": "Job seekers can stand out by contacting employers before roles are posted, a veteran career coach told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The best way to beat the line for a job is to show up before there is one.\n\nTalking with an employer before the company ever posts a job — not after — could help you land a role there, veteran career coach Laura Labovich told Business Insider.\n\nShe recommends that job seekers identify where they want to work, examine their network for any ties to the organization, and start building relationships inside well before a job post even goes up.\n\n\"The way to win is to not apply. Get in before they have the opening. Make connections. Become an insider,\" Labovich said.\n\nIf you wait until you see a job post before contacting an employer, she said, you might already be too late. That's because once a role is posted, recruiters or HR will often feel compelled to tell you to apply online — even if they already know you — in order to ensure all candidates get equal consideration, Labovich said.\n\nGetting in line with everybody else can make the process seem \"more like a cattle call,\" she said.\n\nAside from generally feeling lousy, the take-a-number approach is also rarely the best path to landing a role, as almost anyone seeking a desk job can attest.\n\nThe average corporate job posting draws 250 applicants, Glassdoor reported in 2025. Among those, only four to six candidates typically advance to the interview round. And, of course, only one person ultimately gets the offer letter.\n\nHaving someone who can show your résumé to a recruiter or hiring manager and help you stand out is \"worth its weight in gold\" when there are so many people looking for jobs, said Rick Wargo, managing partner of the global technology practice at the recruitment firm Boyden.\n\n\"A warm introduction is always the best way to go about a job search,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nOf course, if you don't know about a forthcoming job, you can't make a pitch for it. Yet that doesn't mean you're powerless. What you can do is consider whether the employer has hired for the kinds of roles you might want — and use that insight to guide early outreach.\n\nThat's why, Wargo said, it's smart to start networking and making connections inside key companies long before you need a job.\n\n\"You don't go to fix the roof when it's raining,\" he said.\n\nTo beat the rush that often occurs when an employer lists an opening, you can contact people who might be at your level within an organization and ask questions such as, \"How do you like your job?\" \"How do you like the organization?\" and \"How did you get to where you did?\" said Labovich, who runs Career Strategy Group, an outplacement firm in the Washington, DC, area.\n\nIf it's someone higher up the food chain — potentially someone who might be the hiring manager for a future job — the ask should be smaller, she said.\n\n\"You don't want to say, 'I want a job,' because if you're getting to them early, there's no job yet,\" Labovich said. Instead, she recommends that job seekers seek advice, insight, recommendations, and referrals.\n\nThat contact can pay off: Messaging a hiring manager nearly triples your chance of getting hired, LinkedIn reports.\n\nUltimately, Labovich said, making connections inside an organization is one of the best ways to navigate a hiring process that often feels \"totally broken.\"\n\nThat's left many job seekers applying to as many roles as they can, even though many career coaches, including Labovich, urge that people prioritize networking instead.\n\n\"The way to apply for a job these days is to not apply for a job,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "title": "The Big Four's AI revolution has a problem: how junior staff actually learn",
    "description": "AI is taking on routine tasks for junior employees at the Big Four, but is it damaging their skills development and future potential?",
    "fullText": "For decades, the path to success at the Big Four has been clear, if unglamorous.\n\nJuniors used to cut their teeth on time-consuming, repetitive tasks like drafting documentation and slide decks, data input, reconciliations, and quality checks.\n\nThe tasks taught them foundational skills and the reasoning behind the work they'd later lead as directors and partners.\n\nAgentic AI is changing that. Big Four leaders say agents will soon handle the grunt work, freeing up junior employees to focus on strategic work.\n\nThe shift is creating a new challenge for junior employees and talent leaders — if they skip the grunt work, how do they develop the deep understanding that traditionally came from years of repetition?\n\n\"This is the big question right now that I haven't been able to get anybody to answer for me,\" Yvonne Hinson, CEO of the American Accounting Association, told Business Insider.\n\nIf people move up the ladder without understanding the work beneath them, she said, that creates risk for firms and clients alike.\n\nEven inside the firms, leaders acknowledge the uncertainty. There is a question around how to develop those core skills when you bring an agent into the mix, Niale Cleobury, KPMG's AI workforce lead, told Business Insider in November.\n\n\"I probably don't 100% know the answer to that question,\" Cleobury said.\n\nAt this year's Davos, Business Insider's Kim Last found that many executives were also short on answers about the next generation of workers.\n\n\"The sense I have is that the leaders gathered here haven't deeply thought about the ways education or job preparation need to evolve to meet this moment for young workers,\" Last reported.\n\nAI agents can now sift through vast amounts of information in seconds, producing summaries and recommendations that once took juniors days or weeks.\n\nBut experts have warned that this efficiency comes with a cognitive risk: people can develop the illusion that they understand something deeply when they've only reviewed an AI-generated output. Others warn of over-reliance or codependency, where users lose confidence in their own judgment.\n\nBridging that skills gap for the thousands of junior employees across their global offices has become a key focus for talent leaders at the Big Four.\n\nAt KPMG, Cleobury said learning patterns will have to change. Junior employees will need to pull apart agents' outputs and understand how conclusions are drawn, rather than simply executing tasks from scratch.\n\n\"We're constantly asking ourselves: if technology changes where the experience comes from, how do we make sure our people are still learning the underlying concepts behind the work?\" said Margaret Burke, PwC's US talent acquisition and development leader.\n\nBurke said PwC's approach is to teach \"the 'why,' not just the task.\"\n\n\"We believe foundational skills still matter, she said. \"Even when AI assists with parts of the work, our early-career professionals are learning how the work fits together and how to ask better questions.\"\n\nFor every technical AI skill that PwC teaches employees, there's a corresponding human skill. Entry-level hires complete a \"four-day AI immersion course\" that teaches them both how to work with AI and how to leverage human skills, the firm told Business Insider.\n\nDeloitte did not respond to a specific question about the skills gap, but Jim Rowan, head of AI at Deloitte US, recently told Business Insider the firm is \"actively investing\" in upskilling its workforce.\n\nMaybe the old learning model isn't the only — or the best — way to develop leaders in an AI-first workplace.\n\nAI is already changing the nature of Big Four work, driving them toward large-scale transformations and deeper sector expertise on the consulting side, as well as greater efficiency and strategy on the accounting arm.\n\nConsultants are actually returning to the core of what they used to be: \"that strategic advisor, that person who's got the strong hand on our client's back,\" said KPMG's Cleobury.\n\nAs that happens, they need to develop different skills, making exposure to strategic decisions and clients more important.\n\nErrol Gardner, global vice chair of consulting at EY, told Business Insider that the foundational skillset now includes developing judgment about where and how to use AI.\n\n\"Graduates learn by doing and observing on real projects alongside experienced consultants,\" said Gardner. \"If anything, AI assistance will allow for earlier exposure to client and stakeholder decision makers.\"\n\nThat earlier exposure, firms argue, can accelerate development rather than weaken it.\n\n\"AI actually gives us the opportunity to be more deliberate about development, helping early-career professionals move into higher-value work sooner,\" said PwC's Burke.\n\nGardner said the next generation of workers will arrive at EY with strengths previous cohorts didn't have — and their differences will be an advantage, not a liability.\n\n\"We're continuing to give newer talent earlier client exposure, assigning them ownership to interrogate and explain AI‑assisted analyses, and rotating them across teams to spot patterns and challenge norms,\" Gardner said.\n\nAI-native graduates may challenge long-standing norms in ways today's leaders cannot, making multigenerational teams even more important, he said.\n\nWhether that approach can truly replace the old model of learning by doing the grunt work remains an open question — one that the Big Four may only be able to answer after a generation of AI-native managers reaches the top and become tomorrow's leaders.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "We Moved Object Storage Metadata Off LSM Trees",
    "description": "Why we replaced RocksDB with Fractal ART, an on-disk adaptive radix tree for object storage metadata.",
    "fullText": "When we started building FractalBits1, we assumed we’d use RocksDB for metadata like everyone else. But as we prototyped, we kept hitting the same friction: LSM engines do not natively model hierarchical structure in keys — comparisons are lexicographic byte-wise, regardless of semantic boundaries like path separators. While RocksDB supports prefix extractors and custom comparators, these are fundamentally advisory optimizations; the core data structure still reasons about keys as flat byte sequences. Object paths like /bucket/datasets/2024/train/batch_001.parquet have rich hierarchical structure that these engines can’t exploit. The mismatch creates real problems — redundant prefix comparisons, costly directory renames, multi-hop path resolution.\n\nThis post explains why we abandoned the LSM approach for metadata and built Fractal ART (Adaptive Radix Tree) — an on-disk radix tree that splits data along path boundaries. The result: O(path_length) lookups instead of the repeated prefix comparisons inherent in binary searches (O(path_length * log N)), atomic directory renames via single pointer updates, and no directory contention under concurrent writes. We’ll also cover what we gave up by going custom, because every design has tradeoffs.\n\nMost (object) storage systems fall into one of these categories for metadata:\n\nLSM-backed key-value stores. The dominant approach. Apache Cassandra, CockroachDB, TiDB, Ozone, and Ceph (BlueStore) all use RocksDB or similar LSM engines under the hood. SeaweedFS defaults to LevelDB for its filer metadata, though it supports pluggable backends (Redis, Postgres, MySQL, etc.). The LSM approach is battle-tested, and RocksDB does offer prefix seek to skip irrelevant SSTables during prefix range scans. But these are advisory optimizations — the core data structure still reasons about keys as flat byte sequences, and the hierarchical structure of paths isn’t something the engine can exploit for comparisons, renames, or locality.\n\nExternal databases. Some newer systems offload metadata entirely — 3FS and Tigris Data use FoundationDB, avoiding the need to build a metadata engine at all. This trades one set of problems (building a metadata layer) for another (depending on an external system’s availability, performance characteristics, and operational complexity). It’s also worth noting that FoundationDB itself is a sorted key-value store — it still treats keys as flat byte sequences, so the redundant prefix comparison problem described in this post applies at the storage node level. You’re outsourcing metadata management, not solving the structural mismatch.\n\nLocal filesystem. MinIO stores metadata as xl.meta files directly on the local filesystem, and NVIDIA AIStore takes a similar approach using filesystem extended attributes (xattrs) per object. This is elegant in its simplicity, but ties metadata performance to filesystem behavior: listing operations become expensive directory traversals, there’s no way to separate metadata onto faster storage tiers, and on many filesystems, having millions of files in one directory can degrade listing performance — because MinIO and NVIDIA AIStore map S3 object prefixes into filesystem structures, extreme flat layouts can hit those same limitations.\n\nWe also considered B+ trees2, but the same core problem applies — directory renames still require rewriting all affected keys, and prefix compression doesn’t eliminate redundant comparisons during lookups.\n\nThe simplest model: store /bucket/images/2024/photo.jpg as a flat key in the KV store.\n\nThis is the approach GFS originally took — a single in-memory lookup table mapping full pathnames to metadata on the master, with no inodes or per-directory structures. It worked until it didn’t: the single master’s memory became the bottleneck at petabyte scale, which led Google to replace it with Colossus (backed by Bigtable). CalvinFS also uses full-path keys. It’s simple — one lookup per object — but has two structural problems in LSM trees:\n\nRedundant prefix comparisons. Looking up /bucket/images/2024/photo.jpg means comparing it byte-by-byte against /bucket/images/2024/video.mp4, re-processing the shared /bucket/images/2024/ prefix on every comparison. Across a binary search through thousands of keys, that’s a lot of wasted CPU on the same bytes. Prefix compression helps on disk, but doesn’t reduce comparison cost.\n\nCostly directory renames. Renaming /bucket/images/ to /bucket/photos/ means rewriting every descendant key — potentially millions of deletes and inserts. You can batch these writes, but atomically renaming a large subtree with crash consistency (no temporary duplication, no partial visibility) requires complex coordination that turns what should be a metadata operation into an O(n) rewrite. CalvinFS, which uses full-pathname hashing, does support directory renames, but each rename is a distributed transaction that must update metadata for every descendant, making it inherently expensive for large subtrees.\n\nThe filesystem-inspired alternative: assign unique IDs (inodes) to directories and files, with parent-child relationships maintaining the hierarchy.\n\nThis enables natural directory operations and supports renames — but creates three problems that are particularly painful on distributed KV stores:\n\nMulti-hop path resolution. Resolving /bucket/images/2024/photo.jpg requires four sequential KV lookups — one per path component. In a distributed system, that’s four network round-trips before you can serve a single GET. JuiceFS, which uses Redis or TiKV for inode-based metadata, faces this exact tradeoff.\n\nDistributed transactions for mutations. Creating a file requires atomically updating both the new file’s inode and the parent directory’s child list. If those land on different shards, you are now running a distributed transaction for every single object PUT — with all the coordination overhead and failure complexity that entails.\n\nDirectory contention. When thousands of ML training workers write checkpoint files to /bucket/checkpoints/, they all contend for the same directory inode. The parent directory becomes a serialization point, limiting write throughput regardless of how many storage nodes you have.\n\nFractal ART is an on-disk radix tree that stores full paths as keys — like the full-path LSM approach — but uses the tree structure to eliminate redundant prefix processing and enable atomic renames.\n\nIt builds on the Adaptive Radix Tree (ART), originally designed for memory-efficient in-memory indexing. ART uses four adaptive node sizes (4, 16, 48, 256 children) to balance memory efficiency with lookup speed, including SIMD-accelerated search for mid-size nodes.\n\nInstead of storing the tree as individual key-value pairs, we serialize subtrees into disk-resident blobs. Blobs split adaptively based on size: small subtrees stay inline in their parent blob, while large subtrees get their own blob with a reference (BLOB_REF) in the parent.\n\nThis blob-based layout is what gives us the advantages over both LSM approaches.\n\nIn an LSM tree, looking up /bucket/images/2024/photo.jpg means comparing the full 35-byte key against O(log n) other keys per level, re-processing /bucket/images/2024/ each time.\n\nIn Fractal ART, the radix tree traverses the path character by character, consuming each prefix once. The lookup reads the root blob, traverses /bucket/ to images/, follows the BLOB_REF to blob_2, then traverses 2024/ to photo.jpg. Two blob reads, one pass through the path.\n\nRenaming /bucket/old_name/ to /bucket/new_name/ in a full-path LSM store means rewriting every descendant key — millions of deletes and inserts. Achieving crash-consistent atomicity (no partial visibility, no temporary duplication, no partial failure) across a distributed KV store adds significant coordination complexity.\n\nIn Fractal ART, the entire subtree lives behind a BLOB_REF in the parent blob. Rename is a single operation: update the edge label from old_name/ to new_name/ in the parent blob. The subtree blob doesn’t change at all. One blob write, fully atomic.\n\nIn the inode model, every file creation is a distributed transaction if inode and parent are in different nodes: it must atomically allocate the new file’s inode and append to the parent directory’s child list. When /bucket/uploads/ gets hot with 10K writes/sec, all of those transactions contend for the same parent directory entry. The parent inode becomes a write lock bottleneck — serializing throughput regardless of how many storage nodes sit behind it.\n\nIn Fractal ART, as a blob grows large, it splits at a natural path boundary into independent child blobs. For example, the uploads/ subtree might split alphabetically:\n\nAfter splitting, concurrent writes to different key ranges land in different blobs. Each blob is an independent unit of I/O with its own lock scope. Writers to apple.txt and zebra.txt are mutating completely different blobs on disk, so they never contend for the same lock. The tree self-balances: as any range gets hotter, it splits further, distributing contention automatically.\n\nIt’s worth noting that full-path LSM stores don’t have this directory contention problem per se — there’s no parent directory entry to serialize on. But they also can’t do prefix-scoped operations (listing, renaming, access control) efficiently, because the engine has no concept of path hierarchy. Fractal ART gives you both: hierarchical operations and contention-free writes.\n\nResolving /bucket/images/2024/january/photo.jpg in the inode model requires five sequential KV lookups (one per path component), potentially hitting different servers.\n\nIn Fractal ART, blobs are prefix-partitioned — related paths stay together. The same five-level path might require just two blob reads, because multiple path components are resolved within a single blob. Blob boundaries follow path structure, giving excellent locality.\n\nBuilding a custom on-disk Fractal ART radix tree instead of using RocksDB means accepting real costs:\n\nImplementation complexity. RocksDB is ~400K lines of heavily tested C++. Our radix tree implementation is novel, which means novel bugs. We spent significant effort on correctness testing — property-based tests, crash injection, fuzzing — that we wouldn’t need if we used an off-the-shelf engine.\n\nWrite overhead. Currently, modifying a blob requires rewriting it entirely. We mitigate this through adaptive splitting, keeping blobs bounded in size. The design also allows for delta-based updates: small changes can be stored as deltas, with full blob rewrites triggered only when accumulated deltas reach a threshold — similar to LSM compaction, but at blob granularity.\n\nCrash recovery complexity. LSM trees get crash recovery almost for free — the WAL plus immutable SSTables make recovery straightforward. Our blob-based tree needs its own durability guarantees, which adds complexity. We use a write-ahead log with physiological logging for efficiency, but it’s more surface area for bugs.\n\nEcosystem maturity. RocksDB has been battle-tested by Facebook, CockroachDB, TiKV, and countless other production systems. Our radix tree has been tested by us. For any team evaluating storage engines, this matters. We’re confident in our testing, but we can’t claim the same field hours.\n\nThese are genuine costs, and for many object storage systems — particularly those without directory rename requirements — RocksDB is the right choice. In our case, the structural advantages have already paid off: a single m7gd.4xlarge namespace server sustains 1M 4K GET ops/sec at p99 latency ~5 ms — performance that comes directly from the radix tree’s single-pass lookups and blob locality. For AI/analytics workloads where directory operations, hot prefixes, and deep paths are common, we believe the engineering investment is well justified.\n\nLSM trees are excellent general-purpose data structures, but they’re structurally mismatched for hierarchical path data. Even with prefix extractors and custom comparators, the core engine reasons about keys as flat byte sequences — it can’t exploit the tree structure that’s right there in every object path.\n\nFractal ART exploits that structure. By splitting the radix tree into blobs along path boundaries, we get efficient lookups, atomic renames, and scalable concurrency — at the cost of building and maintaining a custom storage engine.\n\nWe’re curious whether others working on metadata systems have explored similar path-aware indexing approaches, or found ways to make LSM-backed stores work better with hierarchical keys. If you’ve run into these problems (or solved them differently), we’d like to hear about it.\n\nFractalBits is an S3 compatible high performance object storage in the AI era. See our previous post for more background. ↩\n\nB+ trees power most databases and support range scans well, but they have the same structural limitation for path data. They store full keys in leaf nodes — prefix compression (as in WiredTiger and LeanStore) reduces storage but not comparison cost. Their fixed fan-out doesn’t align with path hierarchy, making prefix-scoped operations less natural. The decisive factor: renaming a directory prefix still requires rewriting all affected leaf keys, just like LSM-backed full-path stores. That said, B+ trees offer simpler crash recovery (ARIES-style WAL) and decades of production hardening — a genuine tradeoff we accepted by going with a radix tree. ↩",

    "fullText": "GRB 221009A was an extraordinarily bright and very energetic gamma-ray burst (GRB) jointly discovered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope on October 9, 2022. The gamma-ray burst was ten minutes long,[1] but was detectable for more than ten hours following initial detection.[2][3] Despite being around 2.4 billion light-years away, it was powerful enough to affect Earth's atmosphere, having the strongest effect ever recorded by a gamma-ray burst on the planet.[4][5][6][7] The peak luminosity of GRB 221009A was measured by Konus-Wind to be ~ 2.1 × 1047 W and by Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor to be ~ 1.0 × 1047 W over its 1.024s interval.[8] A burst as energetic and as close to Earth as 221009A is thought to be a once-in-10,000-year event.[9][8] It was the brightest and most energetic gamma-ray burst ever recorded, with some dubbing it the BOAT, or Brightest Of All Time.[8][10][11][12]\n\nGRB 221009A came from the constellation of Sagitta and occurred an estimated 1.9 billion years ago,[13] however its source is now 2.4 billion light-years away from Earth due to the expansion of the universe during the time-of-flight to Earth.[14] The burst's high-intensity emissions spanned 15 orders of magnitude on the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio emissions to gamma rays. Radio signals broadcast by the winding down of whatever process created the initial burst will likely linger for years to come.[15] This broadband emission offers the rare opportunity to study normally-fleeting GRBs in great detail.[13][15]\n\nThe burst saturated the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's detector,[16] which captured gamma ray photons with energies exceeding 100 GeV.[17] GRB 221009A is by far the most productive event for very high-energy (VHE) photons ever witnessed by scientific instrumentation. Before GRB 221009A, the number of very high-energy photons detected over the entire history of GRB astronomy numbered only a few hundred. The burst also marked the first time that very high-energy (VHE) photon emissions from a GRB were detected during the early epoch.[18] When the burst's radiation arrived at Earth the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) alone saw more than 5,000 such VHE photons. Some of these photons arrived at Earth carrying a record 18 TeV of energy,[19][20] which is more than can be produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN).[21][11] Russia's Carpet-2 facility at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory may have also recorded a single 251-TeV photon from this burst.[16] These detected energies are far more than GRB 190114C, which had up to 1 TeV of energy,[22] and GRB 190829A, which had up to 3.3 TeV of energy,[23] with 221009A being the first and only GRB so far to have photons above 10 TeV.[24][25] The burst possibly had the signature of accelerating ultra-high-energy cosmic rays for the first time,[26][27] with one study estimating that if cosmic rays were accelerated by the burst, they probably would have reached energies of 1 ZeV or greater (1021 electronvolts),[28] almost an order of magnitude more energetic than the Oh-My-God particle, which is the highest-energy cosmic ray ever observed.\n\nGRB 221009A was subsequently observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER),[13] the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI), the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE),[29][30][7] the International Gamma-ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), the XMM-Newton space telescope,[31] the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHASSO)[32][33] and many others.[21][34]\n\nObservations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have confirmed that GRB 221009A was caused by a massive star undergoing a supernova.[35] The supernova was a Type Ic supernova, similar to SN 1998bw, the first supernova linked to a GRB.\n\nLightning detectors in India and Germany picked up signs that the Earth's ionosphere was perturbed for several hours by the burst, though only mildly,[36][16][4] as well as an enormous influx of electrically charged particles,[37] showing just how powerful it was.[38][11] Further, a number of studies have described the relativistic jet of this gamma-ray burst as having an unusual structure.[39][40][41]\n\nSome astronomers referred to the burst as the \"brightest of all time\", or by the acronym \"BOAT\".[16][42] Dan Perley, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics Research Institute at Liverpool John Moores University, stated that \"There is nothing in human experience that comes anywhere remotely close to such an outpouring of energy. Nothing.\"[43] Eric Burns, an astronomer at Louisiana State University, also stated about the energy of the burst that \"The energy of this thing is so extreme that if you took the entire Sun and you converted all of it into pure energy, it still wouldn't match this event. There's just nothing comparable.\"[44] The power of gamma-ray bursts may be gauged by the degree of interaction between the gamma rays they emit and the ubiquitous lanes of interstellar dust in deep space. Such interactions generate an afterglow in X-ray frequencies, usually seen as concentric rings of scattered X-rays with the gamma ray burst at the center. GRB 221009A is only the seventh gamma-ray burst known to have generated these rings,[9] and as of March 2023, a record twenty X-ray afterglow rings had been identified around the burst, triple the previous record.[45][9] The afterglow of GRB 221009A was the brightest ever recorded, beating the record of GRB 030329.[46] The burst also had the brightest X-ray afterglow ever recorded,[40] with the X-ray afterglow being around a thousand times brighter than the typical GRB.[38] It also had the brightest UVOT afterglow ever recorded once corrected for extinction.[46] It had the largest amount of energy ever recorded in the TeV range,[47] and had the most energetic photons ever recorded for a GRB, peaking at 18 TeV.[24][19] An air shower with an estimated primary energy of 300 TeV was identified as well, coinciding with the GRB's direction and timing, being the highest-energy event associated with a GRB.[48][49] The burst was ten times brighter than any previous GRB detected by the Swift mission.[50] It was the brightest and most intense GRB detected by KONUS-Wind.[1] The prompt emission of the burst far surpassed anything before it, far exceeding four previous GRB record-holders, as no GRB had been recorded delivering more than 500,000 gamma-ray photons-per-second, yet this GRB peaked at over 6 million photons-per-second.[51] The burst was so bright that it blinded most gamma-ray instruments in space, preventing a true recording of its intensity.[9][52] It was even detected by satellites not designed to detect gamma-ray bursts, such as Voyager 1 and a pair of Mars orbiters.[7] GRB 221009A could have produced multi-TeV gamma rays for more than a week after the prompt phase, with this feature being unique to GRB 221009A,[53] far longer compared to other bursts such as GRB 180720B, which produced multi-TeV gamma rays for ten hours after the prompt phase, and GRB 190829A, which produced multi-TeV gamma rays for nearly three days after the prompt phase.[54]\n\nDespite being around two billion light-years away, the burst was powerful enough to affect Earth's atmosphere, having the strongest effect ever recorded by a gamma-ray burst on the planet.[4] It triggered instruments generally reserved for studying solar flares, with solar physicist Laura Hayes at the ESA stating that it left an \"imprint comparable to that of a major solar flare\" from the nearby Sun,[55] meaning the burst had the same effect as a solar flare over 100 trillion times closer,[7] with the burst being equivalent to a C3 to M1 class solar flare based on the VLF amplitude increase.[4] Also significant is that the burst was detectable in daytime observations, where solar radiation dominates, as compared to the night-time ionosphere, which is much more sensitive to external disturbances, when solar radiation is not dominating, showing just how large the burst was.[4] It also disrupted longwave radio communications.[56]\n\nWith a radiated isotropic-energy of around 1.2×1055 erg[8] or even 3×1055 erg,[57] to as high as 1.4×1057 erg,[58] GRB 221009A, together with events such as 1.5×1053 AT 2021lwx, the 1061 erg MS 0735.6+7421 event, and the 5×1061 erg Ophiuchus Supercluster eruption, are among the most energetic events ever. However, AT 2021lwx occurred over a span of three years, while the eruptions were high-energy low-power events occurring over millions of years as compared to GRB 221009A, which occurred over a minuscule time frame in comparison.[59] In the binary-driven hypernova model, the isotropic total of the burst is its true energy total.[12] Physicist and author Don Lincoln described it as being the \"greatest cosmic explosion humanity has ever seen\".[11]\n\nReanalysis of the data from Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope revealed with 6.2σ significance an emission line 5 minutes after the burst was detected and after it had dimmed enough to end saturation effects of the instruments. The signal persisted for at least 40 seconds, and reached a peak with energy of about 12 MeV and luminosity of about 0.43×1050 erg/s that has been interpreted as electron–positron annihilation blueshifted from the usual 0.511 MeV at which the low-energy case should occur due to strong energy of the relativistic jet which itself can look as a superluminal jet.[60][61]\n\nThrough comparison of data collected by different observatories, scientists concluded that the 221009A event was 50 to 70 times brighter than the previous record holder, along with it being far more energetic than the previous record holder.[34][9][41][10] The extremely bright peak and long afterglow may help physicists study the manner in which matter interacts at relativistic speeds, the only known regime capable of generating gamma-ray photons with more than 100 GeV of energy.[13] GRB 221009A has enabled scientists to impose stringent limits on any violations of Lorentz invariance proposed in certain theories of quantum gravity.[62][63] Studies of 221009A and similarly extreme events are at present humanity's only access to particles with energies larger than any that can be generated artificially. The close examination of 221009A may eventually yield physical explanations that are neither predicted by nor accounted for in the Standard Model.[16] It has become the most studied gamma-ray burst in history.[64]",

    "fullText": "The American television drama Heated Rivalry - about two male professional ice hockey players in a secret relationship - has become the first viral show of 2026.\n\nFor most viewers, it is entertainment to be talked about at work or online. For Jesse Kortuem, it hit deeper.\n\nBorn, raised and still living in Minneapolis, he grew up with skates on his feet and loved ice hockey - but stepped away from the sport at 17 as he felt he would not be accepted because of his sexuality.\n\nMore than two decades later, watching Heated Rivalry inspired Kortuem to come out as gay, believing it shows attitudes within the sport have shifted for the better.\n\nHis Instagram post has since gone viral, leading to a \"very surreal\" start to the year.\n\n\"I'm just so grateful for where my life has ended up,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"To finally have that relief... to bring 110% of myself into the locker room. Something was speaking to me through the show - I had to let something out.\n\n\"Then that release was shared with the entire world. For the first couple of days, it was shocking, but now it is humbling - people have reached out to say it inspired them to have the conversation with their parents. I'm honestly speechless.\"\n\nKortuem played ice hockey in local leagues in Minneapolis during his teenage years, and occasionally dipped back into the amateur game as an adult.\n\nIt was not until he joined Cutting Edges, an LGBT-inclusive team who play across North America, in 2017 that he re-engaged with the sport - and it was only this year that he felt comfortable to be open about his sexuality with the wider hockey community.\n\nNow 40, Kortuem says he had to \"edit\" himself in hockey - and life - to fit in.\n\nBut seeing the show, in which two athletes enter a loving relationship, stirred repressed feelings.\n\n\"I had to hide, and looking back now it was tough,\" he says. \"It was still a place of comfort, but a place I had to edit myself.\n\n\"It was time to put a real face to what this story has done for athletes, to get it out there. And it took off!\"",

    "fullText": "The 25th Winter Olympics is almost here – it's back in Europe and will feature a record 116 medal events, three of which will be in the new sport of ski mountaineering.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nGreat Britain have never won more than five medals – or more than one gold – at a single Winter Olympics, but that could change in 2026.\n\nMedal 'targets' have become medal 'ranges' at recent Olympics, and for Milan-Cortina the funding body UK Sport is hoping GB athletes will win between four and eight medals, while Team GB chef de mission Eve Muirhead says there is an \"opportunity to get the most we ever have\".\n\nBritish athletes won nine medals at the most recent World Championships in Winter Olympic sports – across bobsleigh, curling, figure skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton and snowboard.\n\nAnd that does not include the likes of snowboarder Mia Brookes and freestyle skier Kirsty Muir who have won World Cup events this season and are considered genuine medal hopes.\n\nHowever, GB set a target of three to seven medals for the 2022 Winter Olympics and that did not go to plan. The team did not win anything until the final weekend, when they picked up a gold and silver in curling, avoiding embarrassment but falling short of expectations.\n\nThe Winter Olympics have come a long way since their 1924 debut, which featured 11 female athletes – and roughly 25 times more men.\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee (IOC),, external about 1,300 female athletes will be at Milan-Cortina. Of the 116 medal events, 50 will be in women's competition (the most ever) and 12 will be mixed. The upshot is that women will compete in a Winter Games-record 53.4% of all medal events.\n\nTwelve of the 16 disciplines will be fully gender-balanced in athlete numbers – another Games record. Among the new women's events are luge doubles and the ski jumping individual large hill, while there is also a mixed skeleton relay.\n\nThere is another sign of the progress made with equality: these Games are the first to be overseen by new IOC president Kirsty Coventry, the first woman to be elected to the organisation's most powerful position.\n\nBut there is still work to be done: Nordic combined remains the sole Winter Olympic sport not open to women, with the IOC deciding in 2022 not to include a women's event, external on the 2026 programme despite lobbying from leading athletes.\n\nIce hockey is one of the biggest draws of the Winter Olympics, and the return of NHL stars after an absence of 12 years has only heightened the anticipation.\n\nNHL-contracted players were denied a chance to compete at the 2018 Games while Covid put paid to their 2022 participation – and even 2026 has been touch and go after major issues with the readiness of the main rink and the condition of the ice.\n\nThe return of NHL players has also reignited the USA's hopes of a first Olympic men's ice hockey title since the 1980 'Miracle on Ice' gold – further boosted by the fact that Russia are banned from competing.\n\nHowever, although NHL sides are all based in either the USA or Canada, it's not just those countries who benefit from players from the league being at the Winter Olympics. All but one of the 12 teams at the Olympics will have NHL representation, with 2022 champions Finland and semi-finalists Slovakia and Sweden having rosters well stocked with NHL players.\n\nCortina d'Ampezzo will become the fourth location to host the Winter Olympics twice, following St Moritz (1928 & 1948), Innsbruck (1964 & 1976) and Lake Placid (1932 & 1980).\n\nThe growth of the Winter Olympics from 1956 to 2026 – five times as many events and almost four times as many athletes – means it would be impossible today for a ski resort like Cortina to stage the Olympics single-handedly. The 2026 Games will be the most geographically widespread, with events in multiple regions and cities, including Milan, which is Italy's second biggest city.\n\nThe IOC also prizes sustainability, and spreading events around – something president Kirsty Coventry says will be \"the new normal\", external – meaning less new infrastructure is required.\n\nOne venue that will be 'recycled' in 2026 is Cortina's Olympic Ice Stadium. In 1956, it staged the opening ceremony, ice hockey and the figure skating, the last time that competition was held outdoors. Seventy years later, and now with a roof, it will host the curling.\n\nNot since 2018 has there been a new name at the top of the list of most Winter Olympic golds, but 2026 could change that.\n\nGerman lugers Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win their seventh and eighth golds in Milan-Cortina, which would move them level with the Norwegian trio of biathlete Ole Einar Bjorndalen and cross country skiers Bjorn Daehlie and Marit Bjorgen.\n\nIt would arguably be a greater achievement as biathlon and cross country skiing offer more medal opportunities than luge. Daehlie, Bjorgen and Bjorndalen won gold in 53%, 33% and 30% respectively of the Olympic events they competed in. The 'Two Tobis' have won all six of theirs (100%).\n\nBut they could all be overtaken by another cross country skier, Johannes Hosflot Klaebo, who is already a five-time Olympic champion. The Norwegian won all six titles, external at last season's World Championships – similar form at the Olympics could power him to the top of the all-time golds leaderboard.\n\nHosting an Olympics usually results in a boost in medals – but it's not always the case, as Italy discovered the last time they hosted the Winter Olympics in 2006.\n\nThey had won 13 medals in 2002 in Salt Lake City but only managed 11 in Turin – although they did win five golds as opposed to four in the USA four years previously.\n\nThe Italian Olympic Committee has set a minimum target of 19 medals, which is one short of their biggest haul of 20. That was achieved in 1994 – including a record seven golds – when their team included the likes of skiing greats Alberto Tomba, Deborah Compagnoni and Stefania Belmondo.\n\nItaly's 2026 hopes have already suffered a few setbacks, with flagbearer Federica Brignone, external and freestyle skier Flora Tabanelli, external both fighting fitness battles while another alpine hope, Marta Bassino,, external has already been ruled out.\n\nBut there are others with golden credentials, including speed skater Davide Ghiotto, snowboarder Maurizio Bormolini and curling pair Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini.\n\nAnd there's always Arianna Fontana – at the age of 15, the short track skater won bronze in Turin in 2006. Now 20 years later, she is Italy's most successful Winter Olympian, and aiming to win a medal at a sixth consecutive Games.\n\nBBC Sport to show 450 hours of Winter Olympics\n\nJeffries and Pendry complete 53-strong GB squad\n\nUS to send ICE agents to Winter Olympics, prompting Italian anger",

    "fullText": "Great Britain's Neal Skupski and American partner Christian Harrison claimed the Australian Open men's doubles title in their first Grand Slam together.\n\nSkupski, 36, and Harrison, 31, defeated Australian wildcards Jason Kubler and Marc Polmans 7-6 (7-4) 6-4.\n\nSkupski and Harrison competed together for the first time in Adelaide just before the Australian Open, getting to the semi-finals.\n\nLiverpudlian Skupski played with fellow Briton Joe Salisbury throughout 2025, reaching finals at the French Open and US Open, before Salisbury took a break from tennis because of anxiety.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to get over the line with Christian. He's an amazing player and we're really happy with each other and how [the partnership is] developing,\" Skuspki told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"You don't really know how a new partnership will work out but I knew Christian's game and I had an idea it could work.\n\n\"He keeps me going - he's a few years younger than me - so it's maybe what I needed.\"\n\nIt is a second Grand Slam men's doubles crown for Skupski, who won the Wimbledon title alongside Dutchman Wesley Koolhof in 2023.\n\nIt is also the third time in the past five Grand Slams that at least one British player has triumphed in the men's doubles.\n\nHenry Patten won at last year's Australian Open alongside Finland's Harri Heliovaara, while the all-British pair of Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool were victorious at Wimbledon.",

    "description": "The year was 1973 and Diann Droste was 16, on a Greyhound bus on her way home. When the bus encountered a snow storm and an unexpected detour, Diann experienced an act of kindness from strangers she’d never forget.",
    "fullText": "EDITOR’S NOTE:  Great Escapes is a series about how sometimes travel doesn’t go as planned — and what happens next.\n\nPeering out the Greyhound bus window, Diann Droste saw the snow coming down fast and thick.\n\n“I remember I was looking out the window and thinking, ‘I don’t know that this is good,’” Diann tells CNN Travel today. “I started to see cars in the ditches, and then I saw semis in the ditches. But I’m 16. And I don’t know what happens in a situation like that, so I just read my book.”\n\nIt was January 1973. Diann was a high school junior living in Waterloo, Iowa. She was on her way home from visiting her pen pal, who lived in Brainerd, Minnesota — “the real northern part of Minnesota, where it’s really cold.” The bus ride took more than 10 hours.\n\n“Those Greyhounds make a lot of stops. There was one transfer where I got off the first bus and got on a second,” recalls Diann today. “My children think it’s unusual that I was riding Greyhound buses around the country when I was 16. But we didn’t have money for airplanes.”\n\nDiann describes herself as “pretty fearless,” back then. Or maybe she was just “a teenager at a different time.” Either way, riding a Greyhound bus alone didn’t intimidate her — until the snow started. As the view out of the window disappeared into white, Diann tried to focus on the book in her lap.\n\n“Snow is nothing unusual in the Midwest in January. But very soon, it was snowing hard and the bus was sliding,” she recalls.\n\nThe mood on the bus seemed to shift as well.\n\n“I remember thinking these other people on this bus — and the bus was just about completely full — seem a little nervous,” says Diann.\n\nShe was a broke teenager stranded in a strange town. Then two nuns saved the day\n\nThere was a collective sense of relief when the bus arrived in the city of Albert Lea, Minnesota. The bus driver exited the interstate and parked outside a Holiday Inn.\n\n“He stopped the bus and said, ‘We can’t go any farther. It’s not safe for me to drive, so we’re going to spend the night here,’” Diann recalls.\n\nFor Diann, panic set in immediately.\n\n“Instantly, I thought, ‘Uh oh.’…I had no idea buses stopped like that.”\n\nDiann didn’t have any money. That’s one part of this story her kids still can’t believe. She’d brought about $25 for the trip, and now, on the return leg, she only had a few dollars left.\n\nShe got off the bus, pulled her coat tight around her neck and looked at the other passengers. Everyone else headed straight into the motel. Everyone else also seemed much older — people who instinctively knew what to do when travel plans fell apart.\n\nDiann spotted a pay phone and used a few of her remaining coins to call home. She told her mother what had happened but tried not to alarm her.\n\n“When I told my kids this, I said, ‘Now, if that ever happens to you, call me. I have a credit card.’” Diann says. “But in 1972, ‘73 no one had a cell phone, not everybody had a credit card.”\n\nHer mom didn’t have one. Albert Lea was still two hours from Waterloo, and the weather conditions were too dangerous for her mother to drive to pick her up.\n\n“It was snowing in Iowa also and they were expecting up to a foot of snow overnight,” Diann recalls.\n\nWhen she hung up, she feared she might be stranded for days.\n\nInside the Holiday Inn, Diann sat down in a chair in the hotel lobby, under the fluorescent lights. She watched as the other passengers lined up at the front desk, and got rooms.\n\n“No one seemed to even notice me,” she says. “And they all got their rooms and left, and I was sitting in the chair.”\n\nThere were no families among the group. No young people — just what Diann thought of as “real adults.” And she was alone and unsure what to do.\n\n“I can’t get a room, because I don’t have any money,” she told herself. She tried to stay calm and formulate a plan. She spotted a sign behind the desk advertising free breakfast.\n\n“That’s something,” she thought. “I’ll stay in this lobby overnight, and in the morning, I’ll eat the free breakfast, and hopefully the bus leaves in the morning.”\n\nThe chair wasn’t very comfortable. It was far from an ideal sleeping situation. And Diann didn’t exactly feel at ease in a motel lobby in the middle of nowhere.\n\nBut she had her book and tried to distract herself by reading.\n\nEventually, the lobby emptied. It seemed like all the other Greyhound bus passengers had got their rooms. Then Diann peered over her page to see two pairs of black shoes click-clacking across the lobby floor.\n\n“I thought, ‘Those women are wearing very sensible shoes,’” Diann recalls. “It’s funny the things you remember.”\n\nShe looked up. They were two women she recognized from the bus.\n\n“They were probably in their, I’d say, mid-50s, and they were dressed very plainly,” says Diann.\n\nDark skirts. White blouses. Those sensible shoes.\n\nThey smiled at her and kept walking.\n\n“They almost got to the door, and they turned around and they said, ‘Would you like to join us for dinner?’”\n\nNext to the motel was a Perkins, the chain restaurant often found just off US interstates.\n\nAt the mention of food, Diann’s stomach rumbled. She was hungry. But she was also broke.\n\n“I didn’t want to tell them I didn’t have any money. I just said ‘No, thank you.’ So they said, ‘Okay,’ and they walked out the door,” says Diann.\n\nBut, moments later the sensible shoes returned.\n\n“No kidding, they turned right back around, came back in, and one of them said to me, ‘Will you join us for dinner if we pay for your dinner?’” recalls Diann. “They must have known. I’m sure they knew.”\n\nDiann headed out into the snow with the two women. She had a moment of thinking: “I shouldn’t be doing this.” They were strangers. Perhaps it wasn’t safe. But sitting alone in a motel lobby didn’t feel especially safe, either.\n\nAt the restaurant, feeling guilty about the idea of two strangers buying her dinner, Diann ordered only a small Coke.\n\nDiann’s new friends immediately intervened. “One of the women said: ‘And she will have a hamburger and french fries to go with that.’ So, when the waitress left, I said to them, ‘I don’t have any money to pay for this.’ They said, ‘We told you we were paying for your dinner.’”\n\nThey were warm, but firm. Diann relented. And as she sipped her Coke, she began to relax a little and the group started chatting.\n\nThe two women said they were Sisters of Mercy, Catholic nuns.\n\n“That explains the shoes,” Diann thought.\n\nThe nuns told her they taught at a Catholic high school in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, about an hour from Diann’s home. Diann is Catholic and she knew the school, which made her relax a little more. Still, now aware she was dining with two teachers who were also nuns — a first for her on both counts — she was also on her best behavior.\n\n“They asked me what I was going to do, and I didn’t understand the question. So, I said, ‘Well, I’m only a junior in high school, but I’d like to go to college. I don’t know where.’”\n\nThe two women smiled at each other, and then at Diann.\n\n“They said, ‘We mean tonight,’ and I said, ‘Oh, well, I think I’m going to stay in the lobby and maybe sleep in a chair.’”\n\nShe saw concern on the two nuns’ faces.\n\n“In the morning, hopefully we can leave,” said Diann, rambling a bit now. “And I can eat breakfast there, because there’s free breakfast …”\n\nThe nuns looked at each other, nodding.\n\n“And one of them said, ‘We have a room with two queen beds. Would you like to stay with us?’” Diann recalls.\n\nLooking back, Diann knows how it sounds. Like “something from ‘Dateline,’” she says. “It probably was not the most prudent thing to do, but I felt completely safe with these two women, and I really didn’t want to sleep in the lobby,” she says.\n\nSo, she agreed to share their room. Over burgers and fries, Diann became more comfortable with the situation.\n\n“I started out kind of shy with them, but before dinner was over, I was telling them everything. I was telling them what I did in school, and I have five siblings, and I was telling them about that,” she says.\n\n“Would I have felt that comfortable with other adults? I don’t think so. I don’t think I was that comfortable with most of my teachers or anything. … They made me comfortable; in an ordinary situation, I wouldn’t have been that forthcoming with them.”\n\nBack in the motel room, the group played the card game canasta.\n\n“They taught me how to play and I’ve never played it again. But when I hear the name ‘canasta,’ I think of those two nuns.”\n\nThe game was fun. The trio laughed and joked as they played. The Sisters, used to interacting with teenagers from their teaching work, made Diann feel increasingly at ease.\n\n“I was completely safe, completely,” says Diann. “They slept in one bed, I slept in the other. We went to bed kind of early. Woke up early. We went downstairs to have breakfast.”\n\nThe atmosphere at breakfast was warm and inviting, different from the night before, when the bus passengers had largely ignored each other.\n\n“The whole climate had changed … People were moving back and forth between the breakfast tables, talking,” says Diann. “It was like camaraderie among the people that were on the bus, people that didn’t know each other before, all were talking because we had shared this experience.”\n\nDiann sat at a table with the nuns. The bus driver assured them no more snow was forecast, so they could leave that morning. Everyone cheered.\n\nAn hour later Diann was back on the bus. This time, she didn’t open her book but continued chatting to the nuns and other passengers.\n\n“I sat talking to these two nuns, and I had the best time,” she recalls. “Of all the traveling on buses I did when I was young, I think that was the best trip, just because I met them and got to know them.”\n\nThe Greyhound started approaching her home city. Diann spotted Waterloo’s familiar, eight storey Black’s Building department store.\n\n“I was never so happy to see that tall building on the horizon as I was that day,” says Diann.\n\nShe knew she was almost home, so she turned to the nuns.\n\n“I said to them, ‘If you give me your name and address, I will send you money for my share of the hotel room.’ They said, ‘Absolutely not.’ And then they wouldn’t tell me where they lived. I said, ‘Well, just tell me where you live. You must live in a convent …”\n\nThe nuns batted away the questions. “No, no, no,” they said. They insisted Diann didn’t need to pay them back for their kindness.\n\nThe bus pulled to a stop in Waterloo. Out the window, Diann saw her mother waiting to pick her up.\n\n“My mom was always waiting when I returned but this time I was especially grateful to see her and get home,” recalls Diann.\n\nShe turned to the nuns, pointing excitedly.\n\n“I told them, ‘Oh good, my mom is here.’ And they said, ‘Can we bless you?’ And I said, ‘Yes.’ And they said a little prayer.”\n\nThen Diann got off the bus waving goodbye to the nuns and her fellow passengers.\n\nThat evening, Diann regaled her family with the tale. Her mother expressed her thanks for the nuns’ kindness. Later, in her bedroom, Diann composed a letter to her pen pal, Arlene, writing in detail about the eventful journey back home.\n\n“When I went back to school, which was probably within a day or two, I remember telling my friends, and they said, ‘You slept in a room with two people you didn’t even know?’ I said, ‘It just doesn’t make sense, does it?’”\n\nDiann no longer recalls the nuns’ names. At the time, it didn’t occur to her to look them up to thank them.\n\n“In today’s world, I could have easily found out who they were,” she reflects. “The internet would have made it easy. I guess I could have written a letter to the school. But I was also 16 and, as I said, 16-year-old girls are pretty clueless.”\n\nNot long afterward, Diann got her driver’s license and quit riding Greyhounds. She didn’t visit Arlene again. “Maybe I was scared off doing it again after that trip,” she laughs. The two lost touch when Diann went to college but recently reconnected on Facebook and learned they’d both gone on to become nurses.\n\n“I was a registered nurse for 40 years,” Diann says today. “I am married. I am a mother of three and a grandmother of six. She was married and had three kids like mine. Amazing how our lives paralleled each other.”\n\nThe two women have since met up a handful of times — though they’ve not traveled by Greyhound bus to do so.\n\nIn the five decades since her stayover in Albert Lea, Diann has told her “nuns on the bus” story to her kids and grandkids on many occasions.\n\nShe’s used to the quizzical looks at her lack of money, trusting nature and the unlikelihood of the whole thing. But the most important part of the story, for Diann, is how experiencing this kindness from strangers as a teenager shaped her outlook on life.\n\n“When I worked, I had a small note on my desk,” she says. “I read it several times a day and it became my mantra, words I tried to live by. That note said: ‘When you have a choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.’ All these years later, I still remember that great act of kindness by two very kind and intuitive nuns. I tell this story often.\n\n“I was grateful they were there, and I hope that they knew that. I’m sure they’ve long passed away at this point, but I hope they knew that what they did that night affected me forever. And in some ways, I’ve tried to pay it forward. I’ve never had a stranger sleep in my hotel room, but I have been nice to strangers and gone out of my way for them.\n\n“Sometimes I think people just fall into your life for a reason, and those people, those two women, fell into my life for a reason. I’ve often hoped that they thought of me afterward, because I’ve certainly thought of them every single year,” she says.",

    "fullText": "Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is well known for having numerous sources inside of Apple, and in a new interview he shared some interesting comments about the company’s reliance on Anthropic.\n\nApple recently announced an AI partnership with Google. But reporting indicates the company initially pursued deals with other companies, including Anthropic.\n\nBased on new comments from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, it’s easy to see why.\n\nGurman, speaking on TBPN, said the following:\n\nApple runs on Anthropic at this point. Anthropic is powering a lot of the stuff Apple is doing internally in terms of product development, a lot of their internal tools…They have custom versions of Claude running on their own servers internally.\n\nBloomberg's @markgurman says that even though Apple partnered with Google Gemini for Siri, they actually run their business on Anthropic.\n\n\"Apple runs on Anthropic at this point. Anthropic is powering a lot of the stuff Apple's doing internally in terms of product development and… pic.twitter.com/NpW0Pyj03J\n\nIn the full clip, Gurman mentions how Apple initially pursued an AI deal with Anthropic before the Google partnership came together.\n\nThe deal apparently fell apart because Anthropic wanted several billion dollars per year, and even a doubling of fees over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s deal with Google is reportedly costing just one billion annually. Initially though, uncertainty around Apple and Google’s existing Safari search deal led to prioritizing Anthropic and OpenAI as potential partners.\n\nWhat do you make of Gurman’s comments about Apple’s reliance on Anthropic’s tech?

    "fullText": "Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts have claimed social media is intentionally addictive and harmful\n\nSocial media companies will have to answer to a jury – for the first time – for allegations that their products are intentionally addictive and harmful to young users’ mental health. Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "fullText": "TUC urges ministers to bring forward changes to protect workers amid concerns over apps such as Temper\n\nThe fashion retailer Urban Outfitters, the bed specialist Dreams and the operator of several Royal Parks cafes have been criticised for the use of the gig economy app Temper to take on staff – some of whom can end up earning below minimum wage.\n\nThe TUC is urging the government to bring forward promised reforms to protect gig economy workers amid concerns that those hired by apps such as Temper are missing out on significant employment rights including sick pay, rest breaks, holiday pay and a minimum hourly rate.\n\nIt suggested that such apps are leading to bogus self-employed roles. “We find it hard to see how roles like shop assistant can be self-employed,” the trade union body said.\n\nA year ago a number of major high street chains including Lush and Uniqlo stopped using apps such as Temper and the now defunct YoungOnes to take on freelancers, after outrage over the spread of gig economy working into the retail sector.\n\nLast week Outernet, the central London music and digital art venue – which was advertising for £13-an-hour temporary “cloakroom hosts” on Temper – said it had removed jobs from the site after being contacted by the Guardian. “This was the first time we used this site and we won’t be again,” a spokesperson said.\n\nThe continued use of Temper by retailers and coffee shops indicates that freelancing continues to spread beyond delivery workers, such as Deliveroo riders, to store staff, baristas and warehouse workers.\n\nCharges imposed by Temper to guarantee swift payment – taken up by 80% of users according to the app – mean than some workers can receive less than the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over of £12.21 an hour. Freelance workers are not guaranteed the minimum wage, unlike employees.\n\nIn recent weeks, Urban Outfitters has been advertising a number of posts paying £12.50 an hour – including a stock assistant to help with the annual stock take in Exeter and sales assistants in Gateshead and Birmingham. The latter location has 70 reviews, suggesting it is a regular user of the service.\n\nWorkers who take up the Urban Outfitter roles and wish to be paid in fewer than 14 days must pay the 2.9% fee, taking their hourly rate down to £12.14, 7p an hour below the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over.\n\nIt was a similar story at Colicci Cafe, a family-owned business that runs cafes in London’s Royal Parks including Richmond Park, wherewas offering as low as £12.50 an hour for barista shifts in recent weeks. Anyone not wishing to wait up to 30 days for payment would have to pay the Temper fee, taking their hourly rate below the legal minimum for most workers.\n\nUrban Outfitters and Colicci did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDreams has advertised a number of posts in recent weeks including two paying £12.71 an hour, one of which involves helping delivery drivers with loading and unloading deliveries to customers’ homes and another for receiving and dispatching deliveries in its warehouse until 11pm. It has also offered a delivery driver post at £15.14.\n\nHowever, those who do not wish to wait for up to 60 days to be paid must pay the 2.9% fee to Temper – reducing their pay to £12.35 and £13.68 an hour – as they must pay the fee to Temper in order to be paid shortly after their shift instead.\n\nTemper has a “Free Security” insurance scheme that covers sick pay, but this falls short of protections workers would be entitled to if they were employed. Temper workers must have worked through the app at least 10 times within the previous three months to receive sick pay, and will only receive such payments after being off for more than two weeks.\n\nStatutory sick pay for employees currently kicks in after three days and from day one from April under new rights guaranteed in the Employment Rights Act.\n\nPaul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Cynical bosses should not be able to exploit gaps in the law to deny workers proper pay and conditions. The historic Employment Rights Act will bring welcome new protections. But without action on bogus self-employment, bad employers will make greater use of legal loopholes and talent platforms to deny workers their rights.”\n\nTemper, which claims it is gaining 1,000 new sign-ups a week through word of mouth, said in a statement: “We fully refute the comment that Temper constitutes ‘bogus’ self-employment.”\n\nIt said workers who signed up to its site could enjoy better protections than those on zero-hours contracts, including compensation of half what they would have earned on a shift if it is cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice.\n\n“Everyone who works via Temper is doing so on a self-employed basis, and this is made clear at sign-up and throughout the app (to both individuals and companies). It’s also the reality of how the platform operates, and people working via Temper: choose which shifts to apply for (or not), negotiate pay, are free to work for multiple clients and platforms and have the right to arrange a substitute to complete a shift.\n\n“We are committed to remaining fully compliant with UK employment law. If there are any changes to worker status definitions in the future, we will, of course, adapt our platform and model to remain fully compliant.\n\n“Many people value the flexibility of freelance work, and the challenge for policymakers is to balance flexibility with fairness.”\n\nTemper said it set a “floor” of £12.50 an hour, before fees, for hiring workers via its app and this would rise to £13 for all shifts from 1 February. It said applicants were free to negotiate on rates if they believed they were too low and could be taken on full time without any fees.",

In prosperous Denmark, which was all-in on petrol and diesel cars until just before Covid, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reached a share of 68%. In California, the share of zero-emissions vehicles hit 20%. And at least every third new car now bought by the Dutch, Finns, Belgians and Swedes burns no fuel.\n\nThese figures, which would have felt fanciful just five years ago, show the rich world leading the shift away from cars that pump out toxic gas and planet-heating pollutants. But a more startling trend is that electric car sales are also racing ahead in many developing countries. While China is known for its embrace of electric vehicles (EVs), demand has also soared in emerging markets from South America to south-east Asia. BEV sales in Turkey have caught up with the EU’s, data published this week shows.\n\nIs the electric car revolution finally entering the fast lane? Let’s take a look – after this week’s most important reads.\n\nThe Fukushima towns frozen in time: nature has thrived since the nuclear disaster but what happens if humans return?\n\nThe UK government didn’t want you to see this report on ecosystem collapse. I’m not surprised\n\nThe 16-month battle to reveal the truth about Sydney Water’s poo balls\n\nFor decades, climate progress has largely come from cleaning up the power sector. Burn gas instead of coal, or replace power plants with wind turbines or solar panels, and you can slash the amount of planet-heating gas spewed into the atmosphere for little cost.\n\nNow, early signs suggest transportation may be on the brink of delivering similar wins. EVs have quickly gained ground in markets outside Europe and North America, avoiding a rise in fuel-burning vehicles and “leapfrogging” the development path that richer countries have taken in transport.\n\n“Five years ago you might have thought [transportation] is really going to be a bottleneck [for climate progress],” says William Lamb, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “But now with the widescale adoption of EVs, it’s looking a little bit easier.”\n\nThe EV race has gone global, according to a report (pdf) published last month by Ember, a climate thinktank, which looked at BEV and plug-in hybrid sales for the first 10 months of last year. It found 39 countries around the world have an electric sales share above 10%, up from just four countries (all in Europe) in 2019. Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have overtaken the EU in their EV uptake. India, Mexico and Brazil have overtaken Japan.\n\n“It’s good news that we’re seeing growth in the EV market in more countries now,” said Robbie Andrew, a scientist who tracks electric vehicle sales at Cicero, a research centre in Oslo, the world’s EV capital. “In developing countries, this is largely about the recent arrival of much cheaper models from China. The Chinese companies have innovated extraordinarily quickly.”\n\nHalf of the cars registered in China last year were electric, and carmakers such as BYD have driven the boom in much of the global south. The Ember report found that three of the ten largest-value markets for Chinese EV exports are outside the OECD – Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia – while the value of its exports to non-OECD countries and Mexico has tripled in the last two years.\n\nThe countries that benefit range from Ethiopia, which in 2024 became the first nation to ban imports of combustion engine cars, to Nepal, a polluted country scarred by a blockade 11 years ago that left it with severe petrol shortages. But it is not just the Chinese driving progress. Turkey’s share of BEV sales hit 17% last year – the same as the EU’s – in a transition led by domestic carmaker Togg. It has overtaken Tesla as the country’s leading supplier, with BYD in third place.\n\nThe question of whether to buy an electric vehicle has also been complicated by a culture war surrounding some of the brands that make them. Tesla has seen sales plummet across Europe and the US in response to Elon Musk’s support for far-right parties, and promotion of racist conspiracy theories. But in Turkey, the brand is viewed somewhat more favourably.\n\n“If you have a Togg in Turkey, some people think you are a government-lover and a political Islamist,” says Berke Astarcioğlu, an engineer from Istanbul and an early adopter of EVs. “But if you have a Tesla, you are seen as secular, educated and open-minded.”\n\nA challenge for developing countries seeking to sustain the EV boom is whether they can build charging infrastructure fast enough to avoid customer frustration. About two-thirds of the growth in public chargers since 2020 has occurred in China, which now has about 65% of the global charging stock, a report by the International Energy Agency found last year. But charging infrastructure in many other markets is lagging behind EV adoption rates.\n\nThere are also fears the surge in EVs may taper out as the rich customer base in lower- and middle-income countries is exhausted. New cars are generally bought by wealthier residents, while others buy theirs second-hand.\n\nStill, in places like Turkey and Thailand (to name two of many), where falling prices and rising subsidies bring the price of EVs in line with petrol cars, Andrew says the question of whether only the rich can afford them falls away. “With price parity, people buy the cars because they’re simply better and cost less to run.”\n\nIf that trend continues to spread around the world, we may soon see electric cars leave their fume-belching rivals in the dust.\n\nPowering up: how Ethiopia is becoming an unlikely leader in the electric vehicle revolution\n\n‘My Tesla has become ordinary’: Turkey catches up with EU in electric car sales\n\nThe electric vehicle revolution is still on course – don’t let your loathing of Elon Musk stop you joining up",

    "description": "In the second part of our series on digital politics, we look at how online provocateurs have advanced extreme political ideas – and watched them seep into the...",
    "fullText": "The internet has totally changed the way in which politics is conducted. As established in the first piece in our series, liberals have totally failed to grasp this fact. The right, however, are thriving in this new world. Future historians studying the role that fringe online ideas played in the US republic’s demise will be spoiled for choice. One episode in particular comes to mind: Tucker Carlson, a former primetime speaker at a Republican convention, inviting a white supremacist livestreamer, Nick Fuentes, on to his YouTube show in 2025 for a chat in which he talked about the influence of “organised Jewry” in the US.\n\nCarlson spent years echoing white nationalist talking points on his Fox News show, but Fuentes’ style – combining Nazi salutes with cheeky grins – places him beyond the pale for broadcast television. However, under the logic of YouTube, the meeting of these two major influencers is almost inevitable. Platforms incentivise audience cross-pollination, which is why Fuentes routinely livestreams with figures such as Adin Ross and Andrew Tate, who are known more for their homophobia and misogyny than their thoughts on ethnostates.\n\nEstablishment politicians have denounced Carlson, but despite – or perhaps because of – the backlash, his subscriber account continues to climb steadily after hosting Fuentes, who was rewarded for his appearance with more than 100,000 new X followers. For every corporate advertiser that pulls out, another selling, say, seed-oil-free beef tallow crisps will find a new market of people looking to resist establishment corruption with something natural and authentic.\n\nBut this is not just about follower counts. It is also about harnessing online engagement and turning it into a worldview. If you can cultivate online engagement, you can create new political styles and advance even the most extreme political ideas, such as total remigration. Only a year ago, this call to deport anyone with a migrant background – potentially even naturalised citizens – was too toxic for far-right parties to embrace openly. Now, the US Department for Homeland Security posts calls for remigration on X, and Alice Weidel, leader of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – the second-largest party in the Bundestag – has incorporated remigration into the party’s official platform.\n\nReform UK – not so much a party as a corporation orbiting an influencer – understands the power of this politics well. When LBC’s Nick Ferrari recently tried to pin Nigel Farage down over Donald Trump’s dubious suggestion that paracetamol causes autism, Farage framed it as a question of national sovereignty, saying the important thing is not to cede ground to the World Health Organization, which “now seem to want to take some extraordinary powers that would allow them to lock us down in the future”. A large audience could interpret this as a reference to the “great reset” conspiracy, a vague conspiracy theory that encompasses the loss of civil liberties and the creation of a new economic system.\n\nThis theory remains a touchstone years after the pandemic because it joins the dots between the upheaval of lockdown and the political and economic instability that has followed. This is why Joe Rogan and Tate were quick to link Labour’s digital ID scheme to the “great reset”. Reactionary digital politics tells a compelling story: a nebulous they have gone too far and must be resisted. This niche online view then helps to shape a wider worldview that can influence voters during elections. Once ideas such as remigration or worries over the “great reset” find a mainstream audience, they exist alongside debates about cutting taxes and funding the NHS, and their extremist origins get buried.\n\nAs well as the ability to influence public opinion, there is also the chance of earning cold hard cash for enterprising posters. The since-deleted X account @EuropeInvasions helped spark the July 2024 riots with a post claiming the Southport attacker was a “Muslim immigrant”. The post was viewed nearly 7m times. Over the next month, the account’s relentlessly Islamophobic posts attracted almost 240m views. X’s ad revenue-sharing programme is opaque, but based on other users’ stated earnings, in August 2024 @EuropeInvasions would have earned roughly $2,000.\n\nThis convergence of monetary incentives with ideologically charged engagement produces a kind of ambient extremism in contemporary politics. Far-right ideas, memes and tropes that were once confined to the fringes of 4chan and Telegram now circulate as part of mainstream discourse, where they no longer stand out as extreme. In the span of a few weeks in the summer of 2024, Jordan Peterson interviewed Farage, Tommy Robinson and Elon Musk. Robinson’s rants about grooming gangs did the best numbers. Soon after, Musk began calling Starmer “two-tier Keir” adopting one of Robinson’s favoured phrases, which Reform also adopted.\n\nRobinson’s blunt-force communication style wears thin, but the secret of his current success is his ability to tie his far-right project to the playfulness of meme culture and the self-help discourse of reactionary gurus such as Peterson. Musk welcoming him back to X has been a massive boon as well. As an influencer, he is in a far better position to shape British politics than he was as leader of the English Defence League. He can let the currents of the attention economy carry him along.\n\nThere are risks involved: as Trump has learned, as his QAnon posting comes back to bite him with the Jeffrey Epstein debacle, many can feed online attention, but none can control it. Nor can they satiate it. Robinson first claimed victory for Labour’s hardline asylum reforms and then described the home secretary as a “Pakistani” who has “welcomed the invaders”. Musk has suggested that there could be civil war in the UK. Scenes from the US of masked agents nabbing people off the streets – and even from daycare centres – and shooting civilians is a grim reminder that what starts online can end in real-life violence.\n\nRobert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London",

    "fullText": "From the person who scrolls on the toilet to the one without any social media, what do their digital habits tell us?\n\nWill Storr: we have lost so much of ourselves to smartphones – can we get it back?\n\nDayeon, 16: the teenager who spends less than an hour a day on screens\n\nI think my screen time is what adults want their kids to have. I’ve heard some of my friends’ parents tell them, “You should be like that, too.”\n\nI got my first phone when I was 12, as my mum wanted to be able to contact me to pick me up from school. When I got it, I had strict screen time rules: it was turned off after an hour. I still don’t use it much.\n\nI’m not on social media. Instagram and TikTok can lead to a lot of problems for your mental health. I’ve definitely seen friends get self-conscious; double-checking everything they say.\n\nSome friends spend more than six hours a day on social media. They use it to keep in touch and post nice pictures. After school, many scroll on Instagram late into the night, and it sometimes affects how focused they feel the next day. They tell me it’s a good thing I don’t have it so I can focus on school work. Sometimes I feel left out of their conversations, but it doesn’t really affect my relationships with them. They’re not intending to leave me out and they don’t judge me, they just think it’d be easier.\n\nIt is annoying when friends are on their phone while we are hanging out – scrolling on Instagram and talking about what they’re looking at. It’s boring. I don’t understand why people meet up in real life to then look at their phone.\n\nI worry that there’s so much online that’s trackable, which makes me feel uncomfortable. I was part of a dance group in elementary school when I was 10 and now videos of me dancing are still online – I didn’t even know they’d been posted. Even if I type my friends’ names into Google, I can see stuff they did when they were much younger. It’s scary, there’s no way to reset your past.\n\nNeither of my parents have social media. My dad uses screens up to 15 hours a day, because he is a software engineer and is constantly online. But if you took away his work, he probably uses them for around one hour a day for pleasure. My mum uses her phone for around five hours a day for watching shows.\n\nI don’t really worry if my screen time will go up in future. Right now, focusing on my school work and relationships is more important than being on social media. I think even when I am in university or working, I won’t doomscroll. CM\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 30 minutes-1 hour\nComputer None outside of school work\nTV None\n\nShere, 85: the octogenarian whose social life revolves around WhatsApp\n\nI like WhatsApping. Mostly I speak to my family and friends in Trinidad. In the morning I open my messages and say good morning to everyone; I try to find a nice image and emoji to send.\n\nThe phone hooks you in. I’m part of different WhatsApp groups, I’m in one called “Curry and Chips” with the boys. I’ve got TikTok and YouTube on my phone to watch videos they send; some are funny, a lot are rubbish. You get so engrossed. The other day I was making my porridge and it boiled over because I was on my phone.\n\nMy wife died earlier this year; we met when I was 14. Being on my phone doesn’t make me feel less lonely, but it helps me communicate with people, otherwise I don’t speak to anyone. I’ve joined three old people’s groups that operate locally. We organise meet-ups on WhatsApp and swap pictures. Once a week we get together to do some exercise and have breakfast.\n\nI watch westerns every day. My son just gave me a smart TV and I want to learn how to use YouTube on it, so I can find old calypsos. I find typing difficult, so I use Alexa to listen to music and the radio, and set alarms.\n\nThe phone is a must these days and older people need to learn to use it. Everything is online and we’re getting left behind. Doctors send messages online, and we need the NHS app to book appointments.\n\nI check the phone first thing in the morning and before I go to bed. I don’t want to miss texts confirming hospital appointments. I check every day, but then I get sucked into reading and sending messages. I’d like to learn how to use a computer or tablet.\n\nThe downside of the phone is it takes too much of my time. There’s so much rubbish. Some people send too many pictures – ducks in the park, things like that. I don’t need to see everything they do. I don’t like sitting down too much. I’d prefer to do more gardening or housework, and have more energy to spend on my exercise bike.\n\nI worry about the time I spend on my phone. I just get carried away reading messages from people – sometimes it seems as if they have nothing better to do. Also, I don’t like all the adverts and posts from people you don’t know on Instagram – I don’t know why they appear. The family don’t really comment on me using the phone – my son and granddaughter say I use it a lot, but they prefer that I’m active on it. It keeps us in touch. CM\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 3 hours\nComputer None\nTV 2 hours\n\nPippa, 29: the priest who’s big on TikTok\n\nAs a priest, I do see far more phones in church than you might expect. Luckily, my parishioners are very well trained, and I’ve never caught one scrolling during a service so far. But I have had funerals where people’s phones go off – you think, “Come on!”\n\nI’ve been making TikToks for about 18 months. It was my sister who suggested it and at first I was hesitant. We had TikTok accounts and watched other people’s content, but I’d never considered making my own. She said, “You should be a TikTok vicar!” but I thought it would be naff. Besides, in the first half of my curacy I was in a village and I wasn’t sure I’d find enough material. When I moved to my current church in a town, it seemed there was more of a buzz to tap into, and I softened to the idea. As a priest, I don’t think I should sit in church saying, “Well, where is everyone? Why haven’t they come to church this week?” This is a response to me thinking, “OK, where are people? How can I go and engage with them?”\n\nTo start with, it took me hours to film and edit each one, but it’s a pretty slick operation now. One of the first TikToks I made showed me at a Ministry of Sound event on a Saturday night, then cut to me leading a service the next morning – that’s had well over 2.2m views now, and I have more than 30,500 followers. It’s always difficult to tell which ones are going to be a hit – I thought the most recent one was hysterical, so it was a bit dispiriting to check after it had been up for a few hours and find it had only had 500 views. I think that’s just human nature – with anything you’ve worked on, it’s a good feeling to have people go, “Ooooh!!” I’ve seen people suggest a good way to build your followers is to post controversial stuff, even if you don’t believe it, but I think that would be so wrong.\n\nI am still quite bad for checking if each TikTok is getting likes and new followers, but the thing I am very strict about is not looking at the comments any more. On that Ministry of Sound post, for example, one said, “Girl, what in the lukewarm?” with a crying face emoji. “Lukewarm” was being used there as a denunciation, warning other Christians not to be like me, and that comment got close to 24,000 likes. Many people seemed to think it was a genuinely offensive thing for me to have done, though there were lots of positive comments, too. In fact, the event I went to began at 6pm and ended at nine – it wasn’t as if I was out partying all night.\n\nThere was still a story about it in the Sun, though I didn’t realise until the parish administrator messaged me with a link. I had to write an email to my bishop: “Dear Your Grace …” She was lovely about it, very supportive. I’ve since become friends with another vicar from my diocese, David Sims, who also posts on TikTok.\n\nI do spend time scrolling through other people’s TikToks – it’s my most used app, followed by Safari, which will just be me checking my emails, then YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp.\n\nAs a single person who lives alone, it feels like the only socialising you can do sometimes is through a screen, even if FaceTime isn’t the way you want to do it. I open my Hinge app every evening, but unless I start messaging someone, I’ll just sift through people’s profiles with half an eye. I make a point of staying off my phone if I’m with friends or my parents – not just because it’s rude not to give people your full attention, but because when you don’t share a living space with someone, you appreciate the company more. In terms of my friends, my screen time is somewhere in the middle of the bell curve. I think I have quite a low threshold for looking at them – I get a bit of a headache if I do it for too long. Maybe my eyes aren’t used to it – my sister stares at a screen all day for her work, whereas I spend a lot of time talking to people face-to-face. I can feel it when I’ve hit that time; I think, “I need to switch off now and read a book.” CB\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone Up to 4 hours\nComputer 3 hours 10 minutes\nTV 1 hour (plus occasional bingeing)\n\nPaula, 40: the stay-at-home mother who is hooked on phone games\n\nFor me, screen time is a release from the routine – I live on a farm with kids aged 13 and five, so every day it’s house chores, kids bouncing around, dogs barking. Gaming is my “me” time – I play a war game called Puzzles & Chaos on my phone for around four hours a day, which involves strategically building kingdoms and attacking others. I only do it when I have pockets of time – dropping one kid off, picking the other up, making a coffee.\n\nSome friends look at me like I have two heads when I say I game. Because I’m 40, and have a busy life, they wonder why I don’t do other activities instead – but I work out every day, I’m an avid reader, and I have stacks of things to do in the house. Honestly, I don’t care what people think. I have racing thoughts 24/7. Gaming brings me some quiet. I’m challenging my brain while not thinking about other things. Sure, everything in excess is bad, but if you play the right amount of time, it’s stimulating.\n\nI don’t spend much time doing other things on screens, apart from some TV. I have Facebook, but social media is irrelevant and gets boring. It’s just people posting the same things – food, pictures of places, or just whining. The game is strategic and much more proactive. I crave something that fills my brain up other than just doomscrolling.\n\nI’m born and bred in Spain, where I was in the army. When I met my British husband, I left everything to build a life with him in the UK, but I don’t game because I’m lonely. I have lots of friends here. I’m just a selectively sociable person. Sometimes I make plans with friends, then two hours later I’m regretting it!\n\nIn the game I play, you can’t do anything individually, you have to join with other players to plan attacks and win points. We’ve created a community that’s amazing. My alliance is mostly women. I like that you can talk to other gamers with no judgment. Everyone has stuff going on at home – people who have lost a relative, or are recovering from an illness. We can message within the game, but can’t send screenshots, so we also use Discord and WhatsApp.\n\nI don’t get a dopamine rush when I game, or get too hyped up. Sometimes, winning and losing battles can affect my mood, but not in a big way. My friends in the game know that real life comes first. CM\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 4 hours\nComputer None\nTV 1 hour\n\nBarnaby, 43: the tech CEO who’s deeply offline\n\nI don’t generally look at a screen until after 10am. I’ve built “buffer time” into my mornings where I don’t have plans and don’t use any tech. I wake around 6.30am, spend time with my children, take a walk, exercise. For years, my mornings were a smartphone-induced blur – I used to be immediately checking the news, responding to emails or Slack messages. I always felt behind, even from the first minute of the day. Now, generally, the first time I engage with a screen is after I get to my office.\n\nEven there, I work off a paper to-do list. At the end of each week I write down the top five things I want to do the following week and use that as a guide. I used to have about 300 tasks on a content management system that I’d struggle to get through, but a bout of severe depression made me reassess how I worked.\n\nI suppose an unhealthy relationship with screens began when I started my first tech business, aged 17. It was a web hosting company. I would come home from college at 3pm and work on the business until 7am, then sleep for an hour and go back to college. By 2018 I was turning over millions with my second company,Time etc, and thought I’d cracked the code to work-life balance. Less than five years later, everything caught up with me and I had a “breakdown” of sorts. I was checking emails all day and well into the night. I was always available via instant messaging, and even when I wasn’t working I was doomscrolling the news. I became completely overwhelmed.\n\nThat was three years ago; eventually I saw I needed to get rid of my phone. I have hundreds of people who might need to contact me, so it wasn’t realistic to be completely offline, but I realised I could be more selective.\n\nNow, I don’t browse the internet. This means no news and no social media – I might look at my phone to play music, but otherwise it’s not a big part of my day any more. If there’s an important news story, I know someone will tell me about it eventually. In fact, I’ve ended up having these beautiful, curious conversations with people. For years I was like, “Yeah, I’ve seen that” whenever anyone mentioned a news story. Now, someone will say, “Did you see the budget?” and I’ll reply, “No, tell me about it, what is your opinion?” So I have a lot more rich, human, old-school conversations about the world than I ever did before.\n\nI only spend an hour a week on email. I don’t have email on my phone or MacBook, only my desktop. I complete as many tasks as I can in person or via a phone call.\n\nSlack was ruining my life – constant notifications, constant buzzing, someone always needed something – so I stopped using it. At first, my anxiety was really strong – “I need to be connected because something bad might happen.” I was addicted to scanning for messages for probably 25 years, so it was hard to just let go – but nothing bad happened when I freed myself from that habit. I’ve never missed an important update, and if the fact that I’m slower to reply annoys anyone, they haven’t told me about it.\n\nMy partner is fully supportive even if I’m not always contactable. I got out of a depression directly off the back of making these changes, so it’s been a huge net positive.\n\nI’ve found the time and space to do things with my children. My daughter and I are doing a painting project in her room, for instance – we just hang out and chat rubbish. My temper is at a different base to where it was when I was constantly behind and felt as if my phone was shouting at me from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep. AJ\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 1 hour 30 minutes\nComputer Five to six hours\nTV None\n\nKatrina, 31: the social media manager who’s always online\n\nI’m reaching for my phone from the moment I open my eyes at 7am. I check the news, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, X and Facebook. I scroll as I brush my teeth and get dressed. I check emails and messages as I walk to the station and more news during my commute.\n\nAt work I’m triple screening – I switch between my phone, iPad and desktop. I count this as “giving my eyes a break” – they have recently started watering at random moments and I think it’s because I focus on a tiny screen for hours each day. Bigger screens and blue-blocking glasses help my eyes relax. I’ve had other physical effects from so much screen time, too – my back hurts, my shoulders hurt, I feel as if I’m getting a buffalo hump.\n\nMost of the time I feel shackled to my phone and it’s tragic. Adding up the hours of screentime is embarrassing, but it’s necessary in my industry. I take my phone to the bathroom so I can scroll on the toilet (I think most people do this, they just don’t admit it). And there are good parts – going viral feels amazing; waking up to a post that’s had 1m views overnight is a huge dopamine rush. In 2024, I organised a Harry Styles lookalike contest in London. It blew up, it made global news – that’s the power of social media.\n\nLike most people who make themselves visible online, I’ve been trolled. I’ve had death threats and some really personal comments about being in an interracial relationship. I read them all, I just don’t let them bother me. If someone says something mean to me online I just think, “That’s not real, so I don’t care.”\n\nFor a while I got into a habit of waking in the night to check news alerts – there was a period of rising tension between India and Pakistan which caused me a lot of anxiety. Now when I’m looking at my phone in bed, my husband will put his hands on my eyes and say, “It’s time to put your phone away.” Sometimes I just wait until he’s fallen asleep and get it back out.

    "description": "Economist Paul Krugman criticized Trump's trade tactics, highlighting risks of economic isolation as trade partners gravitate more toward the EU.",
    "fullText": "Paul Krugman warns that Trump's trade policies are a threat to the US economy.\n\nTrump's tactics are leading to strained relations with trade partners, Krugman says.\n\nHe predicts a \"divorce\" between the US and major trading partners.\n\nPaul Krugman thinks Americans will ultimately be the biggest losers of chaotic US trade policy.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist thinks Donald Trump's trade policies and aggressive negotiating tactics are spurring global instability that will eventually come back to bite the US.\n\nAnd despite his recent focus on affordability, Krugman thinks that Trump's trade maneuvers will harm American consumers who are already struggling.\n\nOther economists and market commentators have raised similar alarms. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has predicted that tariffs could push the US into a recession, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio recently speculated that they could lead to capital wars on the global level.\n\nIn a Substack post, Krugman highlighted the problems he sees with Trump's focus on strong-arming other countries into making a deal.\n\n\"Now US economic relations with other nations have turned abusive, and the world is moving toward divorce,\" he said. \"And this will make Americans measurably poorer.\"\n\nAs a result of this \"divorce,\" US trade partners will make more deals with each other and fewer with the US.\n\nA recent study has said that American consumers are being forced to shoulder almost the entire cost of Trump's tariffs, but now Krugman thinks they're about to be stuck with another bill as Trump continues to use tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\nIn Krugman's view, trade data show how other nations value access to the EU more than the US.\n\n\"This measure tells us how much of other countries' output they sell to the United States,\" Krugman noted. \"The answer, on average, is less than 5 percent, and much lower when you exclude Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nThe economist added that the number also doubles when computed for the EU. Put simply, when the total output of other countries is added up, twice as much is sold to the EU as to the US.\n\nOther nations are aware of this and are seeking to distance themselves from the US in favor of remaining on good terms with the EU, he said. Krugman used the example of India's recent trade deal with the EU to highlight the trend of \"economic divorce\" that he sees.\n\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, who thinks of international trade as a zero-sum game, the Europeans and the Indians understand that a free trade agreement between them is a very good deal for both parties,\" he said.",

    "title": "Ukrainian Drone Strikes On Parked Russian Aircraft Seen In “Greatest Hits” Video",
    "description": "The Security Service of Ukraine claims that its drones struck at least 15 Russian aircraft on airfields last year.",
    "fullText": "As both sides in the war in Ukraine continue their campaigns of long-range drone attacks, the Ukrainian government’s internal security agency has released a compilation of strikes directed against Russian airbases. The video, published by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), records drone strikes against Russian military aircraft by its special forces unit, the “Alpha Group,” also known as “A” Special Operations Center.\n\nHere is the Ukrainian video, released by SBU Alfa unit, by the way. https://t.co/dM7FBC5Ntf pic.twitter.com/vbdMqFIHmK\n\n— Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) January 29, 2026\n\n“The enemy is used to feeling safe in the deep rear. But for the special forces of “Alpha,” distance has long ceased to matter,” the SBU wrote in a post accompanying the video on social media.\n\nThe footage shows several Russian aircraft being targeted, from the perspective of the attacking drones. It appears that most, if not all, of these strikes were previously claimed, and some have been previously seen in the form of video stills. But the end result is certainly impressive, presuming all of the targeted aircraft were damaged or destroyed — which is far from clear from these videos.\n\nThe SBU claims that the total value of the damage was more than $1 billion, although it’s far from clear how this was calculated, especially since some of the airframes in question are decades old and no longer in production. It’s also notable that the SBU figure includes damage inflicted on ammunition and fuel depots at the airfields in question.\n\nRegardless, the 15 aircraft claimed targeted by the SBU appear to comprise:\n\n11 fixed-wing combat aircraft: Su-30SM Flanker (two), Su-27 Flanker (two), Su-24 Fencer (perhaps as many as five), and MiG-31 Foxhound (two);\n\n3 helicopters: Mi-8 Hip, Mi-26 Halo, and Mi-28 Havoc (one each);\n\n1 transport aircraft: An-26 Curl.\n\nFrom what can be seen, the An-26 appears to have been damaged beyond repair, while one Su-24 seems to have had at least its tail section damaged; available satellite imagery may show a destroyed Su-24, but the quality of the imagery means that it can’t be determined for sure.\n\nThese aircraft were targeted at five different airfields, the SBU stated, without disclosing their exact locations.\n\nHowever, based on open-source analysis, it seems that the targeted bases included Belbek, Kirovskoye, Saky, and Simferopol, all in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nMi-8MTV-5M attacked at Kirovskoye Air Base (45.166855, 35.192407). This is the one that was destroyed on 28 June 2025. https://t.co/kizTFk1EP6 pic.twitter.com/dlR9pp5xF1\n\n— The Military Watch (@MarcinRogowsk14) January 28, 2026\n\nThe growing threat of attacks like these on airbases has prompted Russia to build new hardened aircraft shelters and embark on additional construction to help shield aircraft from drone strikes and other indirect fire. This is part of a broader push by the Russian military to improve physical defenses at multiple airfields following the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe highlighted airfield raids in the video are part of a wider Ukrainian drone campaign carried out last year, in which the SBU also targeted Russian air defense systems, radar installations, and critical energy infrastructure.\n\nAs far as air defense systems are concerned, the SBU claims that it destroyed Russian equipment worth an estimated $4 billion last year. These included S-300, S-350, and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, as well as advanced radar systems such as the Nebo-M, Podlet, and Protivnik-GE.\n\nIn 2025, Ukraine also carried out the spectacular Operation Spiderweb, a large-scale Ukrainian drone strike against airbases across Russia in June. This targeted Moscow’s fleet of strategic bombers and saw a reported 117 drones launched against at least four airfields.\n\nNotable also is the fact that the specific Ukrainian campaign against Russian airfields is something that was brought up by U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, last summer. The timing of that call suggests that Operation Spiderweb prompted that discussion.\n\nLots of people are reposting this Trump Truth Social post as if it’s recent (in part because Ukraine just released another video of hitting parked Russian warplanes), but it is in fact from last summer. pic.twitter.com/8jodT8bm7H\n\n— Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) January 29, 2026\n\nUkraine’s ability to strike high-value Russian targets at considerable range has been bolstered through the addition of long-range cruise missiles, as well as an expanding inventory of attack drones, both large and small.\n\nMeanwhile, SBU is continuing its long-range drone strikes.\n\nOvernight on January 13, the security agency teamed up with the Ukrainian Navy to attack a drone production facility in Taganrog, where several production halls appear to have been destroyed, based on satellite analysis.\n\nUkrainian Defenders destroyed several warehouses of Atlant Aero plant in Taganrog, Russia. Combat drones and their parts were produced there.\n\nGlory! pic.twitter.com/P6RcfpXtbl\n\n— Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) January 16, 2026\n\nThe facility in question, the Atlant Aero factory, is responsible, among others, for producing Russia’s Molniya loitering munition, widely used in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly hit a Russian drone factory in the city of Taganrog tonight, setting it ablaze. \n\nMultiple explosions were reported at the Atlant drone company, manufacturer of the Molniya-series attack drones. pic.twitter.com/yr3SA3b7gV\n\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) January 13, 2026\n\nDrones being used to strike enemy facilities producing drones is very much indicative of the path the war has taken, when it comes to the increasing use and diversity of uncrewed systems across all fronts.\n\nFor its part, Russia employed a BM-35 loitering munition to attack what was claimed by some observers to be a Ukrainian F-16 fighter at Kanatove Air Base in Ukraine’s Kirovohrad region, on January 26. In fact, the target was either a decoy or a ground-instructional aid, something that even Russia’s Rubicon Drone Operations Center attested to.\n\nRussian BM-35 kamikaze drone with Starlink hits Ukrainain F-16 decoy at Kanatove airfield, Kirovohrad region. pic.twitter.com/LpQyXUlvPZ\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) January 29, 2026\n\nThis is not the first time that a Russian drone strike has claimed a Ukrainian aircraft mock-up, but again demonstrates the potential vulnerability of airfields to these kinds of attacks.\n\nNotably, too, the BM-35 drone used in the strike is reported to use satellite connectivity via Starlink, allowing operators to control it in real time over long distances.\n\nThe SBU’s latest ‘greatest hits’ compilation underscores how drone attacks on Russian military aircraft are one of its highest priorities and one that we will certainly see targeted again in the months to come.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "title": "The Southern Fried Chicken Chain You're Going To See More Of In 2026",
    "description": "Always fresh and popping up everywhere — this Southern fried chicken chain is set to be very hard to miss in 2026, and it's not slowing down anytime soon.",
    "fullText": "The fried chicken wars aren't slowing down, and if you've been paying attention to which chains are winning, Slim Chickens is one you're going to be hearing a lot more about. The Arkansas-born chain has been quietly building an empire, and 2026 is shaping up to be the year it really takes off. Whether you're in the U.S. or across the pond, there's a good chance a Slim Chickens is opening somewhere near you.\n\nThe chain's U.K. franchise partner, Boparan Restaurant Group (BRG), just announced it's opening 50 new Slim Chickens locations across the United Kingdom in 2026, alone. For a brand that currently runs about 75 sites in the country, that's a massive jump. The first batch includes three new drive-thrus in Sheffield, Teesside, and Chester, all launching in the first quarter.\n\nThe U.K. expansion is impressive, but Slim Chickens isn't slowing down stateside either. It's become one of the fastest-growing fried chicken chains, expanding in 2026 to 207 stores across 35 states. The brand is aiming to open another 50 new U.S. locations and sign 150 franchise agreements this year, putting it on track to reach its goal of 600 total locations by 2029. And, while no hard numbers are available from inside the company, franchise expansion is planned throughout Europe and Asia. The long game? A total of 1,000 stores domestically and 500 internationally. Not bad for a chain that got its start in a college town garage back in 2003.\n\nSo what's the secret to its success? Part of it comes down to being able to attract attention in a crowded market. Slim Chickens has carved out its niche with a menu that goes way beyond basic tenders and fries. Sure, chicken is still the star, but you can also get chicken and waffles, mac and cheese bowls loaded with tenders, and 14 different house-made dipping sauces. The chicken itself is fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order, which means you might wait a bit longer than at some competitors, but most customers seem to think it's worth it.\n\nThe other piece of the puzzle is choosing the right partners. BRG, owned by Ranjit Singh Boparan, the founder of 2 Sisters Food Group, knows what it's doing when it comes to real estate. The group focuses on high-traffic spots like London's Leicester Square and Birmingham Arena, helping put the brand in front of as many eyes as possible.\n\nThis all comes at a time when the fried chicken wars that kicked off with the Popeyes vs. Chick-fil-A Twitter showdown are still going strong. Customers want quality chicken and options. Slim Chickens sits in a sweet spot, offering more variety than a place like Raising Cane's while still keeping the focus on quality over quantity. With backing from investors like 10 Point Capital and franchisees who are all-in, Slim Chickens is positioning itself to become a serious player in the global fried chicken market. If you haven't tried it yet, 2026 might be your year.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, Get taste tests, food & drink news, deals from your favorite chains, recipes, cooking tips, and more!",

    "fullText": "HAVANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S. threatens a stranglehold on the communist-run nation.\n\nTogether, those discussions paint a picture of a people pushed to the limit as goods and services - particularly those tied to ever more limited fuel supplies - become scarcer and more expensive.\n\nFor much of rural Cuba, this is not entirely new. The island’s frail and antiquated power generation system has been slowly failing for years and residents have grown accustomed to spending hours at a time without functioning electricity, internet or water pumps.\n\nBut the seaside capital, where the streets are lined with 1950s-era cars and colorful if decrepit Spanish colonial architecture, has until recently fared better.\n\nNow crisis looks set to swamp it, too, as fuel shortages take hold, with first Venezuela, then Mexico halting oil shipments to the island.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs will be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington’s long-time foe in the wake of the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.\n\nIn many other countries, the conditions would have sent people out into the streets. So far, in a nation where dissent has long been curbed, there has been little sign of protest. But it is unclear how much more Cubans will be willing to endure.\n\nCuba’s peso has lost more than 10% of its value against the dollar in three weeks, pushing up the price of groceries.\n\n\"This has put me in an impossible situation,\" said Yaite Verdecia, a Havana resident and housewife. \"There’s no salary that can cope with this.\"\n\nDAILY LIFE GETTING MORE DIFFICULT\n\nTrump, when asked about the prospect of a U.S. military intervention in Cuba shortly after the capture of Maduro, said he did not think an attack was necessary because \"it looks like it’s going down.\"\n\nOn Friday, Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared an \"international emergency\" in response to the U.S. tariff warning, which he said constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat.\"\n\nBut the government has said little about how it will manage the growing threat of humanitarian crisis.\n\nMany of the Cubans Reuters spoke with said daily life - already difficult - had been reduced to basics like assuring food, fuel for cooking, and water, and that it had become noticeably harder in recent days.\n\nLines for gasoline have grown significantly this week at a handful of service centers in the city still supplied with fuel. And since the U.S. blocked Venezuelan deliveries of oil to Cuba in mid-December, virtually all gas has been sold at a premium, in dollars - a currency to which few Cubans have access.\n\n\"It used to be that you could sign up and get fuel once a month (in pesos),\" said Havana resident Jesus Sosa, referring to an app that would let residents know when it was their turn to fill up their cars. \"Not anymore. Sales in national currency have stopped.\"\n\n’YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE OR STAY HOME’\n\nThe crunch has hit both public and private transportation, putting some buses and private taxis out of business and forcing others to raise their prices.\n\nDaylan Perez, a 22-year-old who hails private taxis for clients in old Havana, said fewer buses mean people now have no choice but to pay rising fees for private transport.\n\n\"You have to pay the price or stay home,\" he said.\n\nEven transportation by electric vehicle - once thought to be a panacea in a city short of fuel - has been hit by blackouts that now last for eight to 12 hours or more.\n\nTaxi driver Alexander Leyet of Havana swapped to an electric three-wheeled taxi recently, thinking he had outsmarted the pack.\n\n\"Now because of the blackouts I can only charge my taxi for four or five hours,\" he said.\n\nFor decades, the government that has its roots in Fidel Castro’s 1959 Cuban Revolution has survived despite sometimes brutal economic struggles, upending regular predictions of imminent collapse or an uprising.\n\nIt has long alleged a U.S.-led effort to foment revolt, but the most recent widespread protests were in the pandemic year of 2021, despite a 12% contraction of the economy between 2019 and 2024.\n\nSharp crackdowns on any form of dissent, combined with the emigration of between one and two million people since the pandemic, have all but eliminated organized in-country opposition. The Cubans interviewed by Reuters generally declined to answer questions about the prospect of protests.\n\nBut none of those interviewed disputed that change was necessary.\n\n\"I’m just praying God finds a way to get us out of this (mess),\" said Mirta Trujillo, a 71-year-old street vendor from Guanabacoa who burst into tears as she told Reuters she could no longer afford food. Previously, she had depended on a ration book of basic goods provided by the government, but that was phased out post-pandemic as tourist income and other sources of hard currency dried up.\n\n\"I’m not against my country... but I don’t want to die of hunger,\" she said.\n\nOn a recent weekday evening, Reuters witnessed an accident at a busy intersection in Havana where the stoplights were not functioning as a result of a power outage.\n\n\"Sometimes when the power goes out, accidents happen because the traffic lights don’t work,\" said Raysa Lemu, whose apartment overlooks a boulevard in Marianao, on the outskirts of Havana.\n\n\"It used to be they turned off the power two or three times a week, but now it’s every day and sometimes it’s up to 12 hours.\"\n\nJulia Anita Cobas, a 69-year-old housekeeper from Guanabacoa, gets up at 4 a.m. each morning for a 10-mile (16-km) commute that now approaches four hours round-trip. With less public transportation available, the journey has become longer and more costly.\n\n\"I leave my house before sunrise and I don’t know how I’ll get back,\" she said.\n\nBut Cobas, who was born just before Castro’s revolution, said she had no expectation that Trump would make things any better.\n\n\"Since I was born the (United States) has been threatening us, and every day we deal with hardship. But we’ve survived it all,\" she said.\n\nAimee Milanes, a 32-year-old resident of Reparto Electrico, just outside Havana, said neither the Cuban nor the U.S. government offered her much hope.\n\n\"We’re drowning. But there’s nothing we can do,\" said Milanes. \"This is about survival. Nothing else.\"",

    "title": "Silver Crash: Lessons from Silver's Blow-Off Top",
    "description": "The recent 40% intraday plunge in silver isn't just a localized event, it is a stark reminder that human nature - and its tendency toward \"irrational exuberance\" - remains the market's ultimate constant.",
    "fullText": "On January 15th, I wrote an article titled,“Repeat of History? Why Silver May Be Forming a Blow-Off Top?\" Friday, silver and the iShares Silver ETF (SLV) each dropped nearly 40% intraday, marking one of the precious metal’s worst drops over the past century.\n\n“Wall Street never changes, the pockets change, the suckers change, the stocks change, but Wall Street never changes, because human nature never changes.” ~ Jesse Livermore\n\nWhile I don’t claim to have a crystal ball and I am only human and often incorrect in my analysis, studying silver’s illustrious history provided me with critical clues. Some of the clues that a blow-off top was about to occur included:\n\n·       Distance from 200-day moving average: Silver was more than 100% above its 200-day moving average. Historically, such a wide distance from the 200-day has been unsustainable.\n\n·       Exhaustion gaps emerged: An exhaustion gap occurs when a stock or ETF gaps higher in overnight trading after a sustained price move. Prior to silver’s plunge, the SLV ETF flashed four classic exhaustion gaps.\n\n·       Record trading volume: SLV and silver proxies like the Sprott Physical Silver Trust (PSLV),  Global Silver Miners ETF (SIL), and the ProShares Ultra Silver ETF (AGQ), flashed record trading volumes. Record trading volumes after a large price advance are a classic signal that a trade has become obvious to the crowd and “irrational exuberance” has kicked in.\n\n·       261.8% Fib level: Fibonacci extensions are used by technicians to identify price targets. Silver touched the 261.8% fib extension target (nearly to the penny) before dropping.\n\nWhile the losses in silver were due to a combination of profit-taking, a rebounding U.S. dollar, and a new Fed Chair, the price action told the story in advance.\n\nIf history is any guide (and it has been a great one for silver), silver has just witnessed a multi-year top. Silver had two similar blow-off tops:\n\n1.      Hunt Brothers: In 1980, silver topped when the Hunt Brothers attempted (but failed) to corner the silver market. Silver would not breach the spike high for another 30 years.\n\n2.      Early 2000s Commodity Bull: After the early 2000s, China-driven bull market, silver again had a screaming bull market that ended in 2011 in blow-off top form. Silver would not make another high for 13 years.",

    "description": "Rebecca Reed experienced misfortune after misfortune in her life. But even average Americans aren’t able to quit working when they want to.",
    "fullText": "At age 87, Rebecca Reed would love to spend her days socializing with friends and, in her words, “eating bonbons and watching TV.” Unfortunately, she doesn’t have the money for that — and she’s not sure she ever will.\n\nAccording to a recent Business Insider interview, Reed has to keep working as a church secretary and editorial assistant just to stay afloat. Although she plans to retire by 90, she has doubts.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nLooking back, Reed can see how she got into this situation: She let her late husband look after their joint finances, and she wasn’t informed about what was really going on.\n\nThe two had separate checking accounts, and after his death in 2011, she found out he had basically no savings. She also did not benefit from his insurance because of a complicated situation with her husband’s ex-wife and their children.\n\nOn top of all that, she was horrified to discover that there was still a mortgage on their house — and the payments were $1,000 per month.\n\nReed was forced to file for bankruptcy and rely on support from her family to get by.\n\nAlthough this helped for a while, life kept throwing her curveballs, including two car accidents (one resulting in a fractured shoulder), and a termite infestation that required her to replace her roof (1).\n\nShe wasn’t able to save much earlier in life because her daughter and her daughter’s husband both died in the early 2000s, when they were in their 40s. They left Reed and her husband — who should have been nearing retirement — to raise their 11- and 13-year-old grandchildren. Both are now thriving in adulthood (2).\n\nToday, Reed is on a firmer financial footing. She paid off her house and has income coming in from her two jobs. She receives $3,000 per month from Social Security. However, she’s still not in a position to retire.\n\nShe also can’t afford the $6,000 per year it would cost to insure her home in New Orleans. She’s choosing to risk going without insurance, which means one hurricane could wipe out almost everything she has worked for (1).\n\nReed says it can be a challenge to be the only one left still working among her siblings and friends. They have to plan events around her work schedule.",

    "fullText": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A new debate on snow is heating up online with posts from two Memphis City Council members, one of whom claims she’s getting threats over the post.\n\nPearl Walker and Yolanda Cooper-Sutton shared social media posts this week questioning whether the snow that fell across the city was real, or possibly man-made. The topic is trending on TikTok.\n\nThe comments quickly took off online, drawing strong reaction as crews across Memphis were still dealing with icy roads, school closures, and cleanup from one of the city’s more significant winter storms in recent years.\n\nMemphis residents grapple with snow-packed streets after winter storm\n\nWe reached out to Councilwoman Walker about her post.\n\n“I had a cousin to make a post, and she held a lighter to a chunk of the snow and it was dissolving, but water was not dripping, and I commented that it looked different,” Walker said. “But what Memphians need to know and understand is I have a right to my opinion and my opinion and right to speak is bigger than the constitution.”\n\nWREG also contacted Cooper-Sutton. She says what she meant as a light-hearted post shared with family and friends has now been blown out of proportion.\n\n“I am doing super amazing, but my family here and I have gotten some threats on my life,” Cooper-Sutton said. “My Facebook page, people are talking about, they hope that I die, and that I get over some snow, and no one has gone to my page, and actually see the work that I’m doing, taking food to my neighbors, my senior citizen neighbors, making phone calls, praying, you know, for our city and, I’m not sure what this is about or where this attack has come from because it has been really ugly and mean.”\n\nSnow, ice removal service sees high demand after winter storm\n\nCouncilwoman Cooper-Sutton says the challenges many of her neighbors and constituents are facing during the snow and ice recovery are far more important and urgent than any social media post about whether snow is real.",

    "description": "Find out more about King Charles' reaction to Prince Harry calling out Donald Trump following his claims about NATO allies on SheFinds.com",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump recently made claims that British soldiers stayed “off the front lines” during the war in Afghanistan, and his comments struck a chord, especially with Prince Harry, who served for over a decade in the British Army. The 41-year-old didn’t waste any time calling out the United States president, but his father, King Charles, reportedly wishes his son reacted differently. Keep reading \n\nAccording to Royal reporter Rob Shuter, Harry's very public reaction to Donald Trump's claims has put King Charles in a \"deeply uncomfortable\" position, especially ahead of King Charles and Queen Camilla's upcoming trip to the United States. Shuter reported that Charles \"understands the emotion, but he's horrified by the timing.\"\n\n\"This is diplomacy—not podcast politics,\" an insider told Shuter. \"Harry's comments make an already sensitive situation far trickier. The King can't clap back—even if he agrees.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Donald Trump questioned if the NATO allies would \"be there\" if the United States \"ever needed them.\"\n\n\"I've always said, 'Will they be there, if we ever needed them?' And that's really the ultimate test. And I'm not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there, but will they be there?\" he questioned.\n\n\"We've never needed them,\" he continued. \"We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did—they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"\n\nThese claims from Donald Trump angered many members of the NATO alliance, including England. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump's claims \"insulting and frankly appalling,\" and even Prince Harry had more than a few words to say about it.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Prince Harry released a statement on the topic. \"In 2001, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first—and only—time in history,\" he said, referencing the mutual defense clause that was activated following the September 11, 2001 attacks. \"It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call.\"\n\n\"I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,\" he continued. \"The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed. Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.\"\n\n\"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace,\" he finished. Prince Harry has long since been a supporter and defender of British veterans, having founded the Invictus Games in 2014, an international, Paralympic-style event for wounded, injured, and sick military service personnel and veterans.",

If you think there's something not right, don’t stop fighting for answers,\" she tells PEOPLE\n\nA woman, who historically suffered from intense periods, once thought she was also having appendix issues. When doctors told her that the pain she was experiencing was, for the most part, actually caused by her having two wombs, she was shocked.\n\nEllie Curran of Ireland was 12 years old when she got her period for the first time. \"I noticed roughly just after that, they were very sore and heavy,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"I'd mainly have to stay in bed a lot, and I was so drained it affected my social life also.\"\n\nOne night, Curran, now 21, says she had \"really bad pain\" in her lower stomach area and thought it was her appendix. According to SWNS, she underwent surgery to remove the organ, and that's when doctors made the unexpected find that she has not one uterus, but two.\n\n“[The doctors] said there seems to be two uteruses, but didn’t say too much when I had my appendix removed,” Curran recalled.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nCurran underwent further testing and eventually received a formal diagnosis of complete bicorporeal uterus, meaning she has two distinct uterine cavities separated by a wall of tissue. (Only about 0.4% of women are born with the rare condition, according to the Cleveland Clinic.)\n\nShe additionally told SWNS that further scans later revealed she has two cervixes, and she \"might have an extra kidney.\" Curran was also diagnosed with endometritis, which doctors have said could contribute to her painful periods.\n\nAccording to Curran, \"[There are] not really many treatment options I’ve been told of yet, so it’s a waiting game now.\"\n\nShe is currently on a wait list for additional tests, and she is scheduled to undergo surgery in May.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nAnd, should she choose to have children, Curran tells PEOPLE getting pregnant will present challenges.\n\n\"I’d have to mainly get pregnant in the left womb, because it’s bigger than the right, and it's safer in the left,\" she explains.\n\nCurran, a call center worker, is sharing her story in hopes of helping others. \"I want to spread awareness and find girls with something similar to what I’m currently going through,\" she says.\n\nAs for her go-to advice for other women dealing with the same or similar situations? Curran tells PEOPLE, \"Women, you know your own body better than anyone. If you think there's something not right, don’t stop fighting for answers.\"",

    "fullText": "(Reuters) - China has given its top AI startup DeepSeek approval to buy Nvidia's (NVDA) H200 artificial intelligence chips with regulatory conditions that ​are still being finalised, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters in Taipei on Thursday that his company had not received such information. He added that he believed that China was still finalising the licence. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment on DeepSeek's approval.\n\nChina's industry and commerce ministries ⁠have granted approvals for all ‌four companies, but have stipulated that they will impose conditions that are still being finalised, the sources said. These conditions are being decided by ‍China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), according to one of the people.\n\nWhat congressional scrutiny could DeepSeek chip purchases face?\n\nWhat regulatory conditions apply to DeepSeek's H200 approval?\n\nWhat makes DeepSeek significant in the AI industry?\n\nHow does this fit into broader U.S.-China relations?\n\nChina's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Commerce and NDRC did not answer requests for comment.\n\nDeepSeek, which rattled ​the global tech sector early last year by rolling out AI models that cost ‌a fraction of those being developed by U.S. rivals such as OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), did not answer a request for comment.\n\nThe H200, Nvidia's second most powerful AI chip, has emerged as a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and U.S. approval for exports, Beijing's hesitation to allow imports has been the main barrier to shipments.\n\nThe U.S. earlier this month formally ⁠cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 ​to China, where the company is seeing strong appetite. ​However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be shipped in.\n\nAny purchases of H200 chips by DeepSeek could draw ‍scrutiny by U.S lawmakers. ⁠Reuters reported on Wednesday that a senior U.S lawmaker had alleged that Nvidia had helped DeepSeek hone artificial intelligence models that were later used by the Chinese military, ⁠according to a letter sent to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nDeepSeek is expected to launch its next-generation AI ‌model V4, featuring strong coding capabilities, in mid-February, The Information reported earlier this ‌month.",

    "description": "Paige Seifert tells PEOPLE she knew something was wrong when she saw blood in her stool",
    "fullText": "Paige Seifert knew there was something wrong when she saw blood in her stool\n\nThe then-24-year-old's concerns were initially dismissed before eventually being diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer\n\nNow in remission, Seifert shares videos about her experience on TikTok and talks to PEOPLE about how she is doing today\n\nPaige Seifert knew something was wrong when she saw blood in her stool while on a trip with friends in August 2024.\n\nSeifert, then 24, told herself that if things didn't clear up by the following week, she would go to the doctor. So when the week passed and nothing improved, she didn't waste any more time before booking an appointment.\n\nDuring the checkup, the doctor asked if her family had a history of gastrointestinal (GI) issues. When she said no, she was told it was most likely hemorrhoids and would go away after a week with the help of some stool softener.\n\n\"That didn't go away, but thankfully, I happened to have a physical a month later,\" Seifert exclusively tells PEOPLE. \"I went to the physical, and it was still happening consistently. They said, 'We'll send you to a GI specialist to get the hemorrhoids banded.' They were like, 'It's still hemorrhoids. It can't be anything else. You're 24, your blood looks great. You're not anemic. There's really no concern.' \"\n\n\"This is all like a six-month process, because referrals take forever, especially when you're 24 and healthy,\" she says. \"There's not a real rush to get you to the doctor.\"\n\nHowever, when she finally got her colonoscopy in January 2025, everything changed.\n\n\"I finally get the colonoscopy, and I wake up, and the doctor's standing there and immediately gives me the news that they found cancer. They didn't even have to biopsy it or anything,\" she says.\n\nImmediately after, they referred her to an oncologist to make a plan of action. She was officially diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer one week later.\n\nThey told Seifert she would need 12 rounds of chemotherapy and a colon resection — or colectomy, a surgery to remove all or part of the colon. They told her it didn't matter which she did first, so, on Feb. 12, 2025, Seifert had a port placed in her chest and officially began chemo five days later.\n\n\"I was like, 'It's ski season, so if you guys give me the green light to ski, let's do chemo now and surgery later,'\" she says. \"I did eight rounds of chemo, took a month break so I could recover for surgery. Then I had my surgery, and then I had a temporary ileostomy.\"\n\nAfter pausing chemo, she had her colon resection surgery and temporary ileostomy —  which allows digestive waste to exit through the small intestine via a stoma in the abdomen — in July 2025.\n\n\"A month later, they reversed that ileostomy. Then I finished the four more rounds of chemo,\" Seifert shares.\n\nDuring the process, Seifert says she was so lucky to \"have such a great support system.\"\n\n\"My mom flew in from Texas to come to my colonoscopy, just because I needed a ride,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"I think she was a little bit freaked out, so she came with me, and right from the doctor telling me I had cancer, I had her by my side.\"\n\n\"As soon as I told my friends, they were extremely supportive. My dad flew out for the first oncology appointment, and they flew out for the first chemo treatment,\" she adds.\n\nUnfortunately, Seifert shares that her mom was diagnosed with breast cancer around the same time, so she had to step back to focus on her own health.\n\nHowever, going through chemo at the same time bonded the two even more, Seifert says.\n\n\"That was a great support system too, because my mom is already so supportive, and then she could feel my pain, which I hate that she had to go through that too, but being able to talk to someone who knows exactly what chemo is like and is going through it with you is really great,\" she says. \"It's hard to find that community at the cancer center because I am probably the youngest person there by two decades.\"\n\nAlong with support from her loved ones, Seifert, an avid skier, says physical activity kept her \"positive and happy.\" She would go in every other Monday for treatment, get her infusion, then take a few days to rest, and on the weekend, would ski around 15 miles.\n\nAfter 10 months, Seifert officially finished treatment on Nov. 17, 2025. However, just one week later, doctors discovered a 5cm blood clot close to her heart and a pulmonary embolism, which was \"found as a fluke.\"\n\n\"The doctors were pretty shocked that I was alive and sitting up and talking,\" she says, explaining that she had simply gone in for a follow-up CT scan after finishing chemo.\n\n\"My doctor called me two hours later and said, 'Hey, are you having any chest pains?' I said, 'No, I just got back from an eight-mile mountain bike ride. I feel great.' He goes, 'You need to go to the hospital right now. You're about to have a heart attack or die.' \"\n\n\"I went straight to the hospital and was there for a week during Thanksgiving, and had surgery to have it removed,\" she shares.\n\nNow, Seifert says she \"feels great,\" which she confesses \"is a crazy thing to say\" considering she \"had stage 3 cancer and had to think about my mortality at an age that I don't think people should have to think about death.\"\n\n\"But even going through all of that, I feel better than I did before,\" she says. \"I have this whole new appreciation for every day just because I feel like it can be taken away at any time.\"\n\n\"I've just had a greater appreciation for life, which I think makes me feel better, even though I'm still sick, still suffering from all the side effects of chemo. I am grateful to be alive and wanna maximize everything that I can,\" Seifert adds.\n\nOne of the worst side effects, she says, has been dealing with neuropathy — nerve damage that often leads to numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.\n\n\"Since September, after my colon resection surgery, I haven't been able to feel my feet or my fingertips. It's hard to pick things up. I can't write with a pencil. I can't run because I can't feel my feet,\" Seifert says, noting that it may be something she deals with for the rest of her life.\n\nAfter Seifert posted a video about her cancer journey online, she received an influx of comments from people near her in the Denver area sharing similar stories. From there, she was able to build a community of people who were either going through cancer treatment or were survivors.\n\n\"I had a lot of poor side effects and hospitalizations due to chemo and my port and that thing. People were invested, but they were also relating to my experience. There was a lot of community to be found there,\" Seifert shares.\n\nWith a few of her friends, she made a short film about her experience, which forced her to look at what she went through \"a little bit more seriously.\"\n\n\"It'll be really helpful for me to reflect on everything that happened. I stayed athletic, and I didn't really think about it. I was in survival mode,\" she shares. \"My partner and I had a conversation recently about how I'm tired all the time because of chemo. It sparked a conversation about what this treatment has meant to our relationship.\"\n\n\"I thought about death a lot last year. I have grown to accept death as a concept. I've gotten an acceptance that when it's time, it's time, and to make the most of everything because I could die in a car accident tomorrow,\" she continues. \"Nothing is promised. It's made me more appreciative of everything around me. But it's also been scary to think about dying at 25.\"\n\nWhile she knows that \"there's no reason that someone should ever get cancer or ever go through this,\" she still tries to find \"a silver lining.\"\n\n\"It makes me wanna travel more. It makes me want to seize more opportunities,\" she shares. \"I always prioritize my job, savings, and all that. I kept working through all my treatment, and now I'm like, let's go to Japan for two weeks and go skiing. Seize every opportunity that I can to do what I want to do and explore what I wanna explore.\"",

    "fullText": "At least 28 Palestinians, including six children and several police officers, have been killed in the Gaza Strip since dawn, a day before the Rafah crossing is due to reopen.\n\nAn Israeli air strike on Saturday on a tent sheltering displaced people in the Mawasi area to the northwest of Khan Younis city killed at least seven Palestinians, including three children, medical sources told Al Jazeera.\n\nTheir bodies were taken to the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.\n\nIn Gaza City, emergency services reported that at least five Palestinians, including three children, were killed in an Israeli air strike on an apartment building in the Remal neighbourhood to the west of the city.\n\n“We could feel the shockwaves of the explosions followed by a huge, dark, dusty cloud that filled the area, leaving at least five people killed inside the residential flat, including a mother and children,” Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reported from Gaza City.\n\nEight Palestinians were also injured in an Israeli bombing of an apartment building in the Daraj neighbourhood of Gaza City.\n\n“All of this is happening inside the yellow line,” Mamhoud said, adding that in Khan Younis, a building “had been hit by fighter jets and destroyed completely after it was pre-warned by the Israeli military”.\n\nGaza’s Government Media Office says at least 524 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since a United States-brokered ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on October 10.\n\nResidents in the border town of Rafah also reported several air attacks in areas under Israeli control. Israel is due to reopen the Rafah crossing, which links Gaza with Egypt, on Sunday for the first time since May 2024.\n\nThe opening of the key entry point is part of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas. It was meant to open during the first phase of the ceasefire, but Israel refused to do so until the body of its last remaining captive was found.\n\nIsrael on Saturday said it would only allow a “limited movement of people” who have received security clearance by Israel to enter and exit. No aid or humanitarian supplies will be allowed to enter.\n\n“Only those who fled during the past two years are allowed to come back,” Mahmoud explained. “Those who are born outside the Gaza Strip are not going to be allowed to come back.”\n\nHamas responded to the Rafah announcement by calling for Israel to allow movement in and out of Gaza “without restrictions”, and urged it to adhere to all aspects of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nIsrael’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed more than 71,600 Palestinians since October 7, 2023.",

    "description": "Joe Scarborough faced an on-air correction from Marjorie Taylor Greene on \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" after repeatedly misstating the FACE Act’s name.",
    "fullText": "Joe Scarborough faced an on-air correction from Marjorie Taylor Greene on “Real Time With Bill Maher” after repeatedly misstating the FACE Act’s name during a discussion about Don Lemon’s arrest.\n\nBoth Scarborough and Greene served as Maher’s panelists for Friday’s episode of the HBO program, where they shared their clashing stances on Lemon’s arrest, which came about following his presence at an anti-ICE protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota earlier this month.\n\nLemon faces charges under two federal statutes, conspiracy to deprive rights and violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, which in part prevents one from interfering with someone’s First Amendment right of religious freedom.\n\nGreene made it clear that she “completely supports” the DOJ’s decision to indict the independent journalist, claiming Lemon violated the FACE Act by disrupting a place of worship and comparing the parishioners to “white supremacists.”\n\n“That’s not journalism, that’s activism,” the former Congresswoman from Georgia stated. “Disrupting a worship service, stopping people’s right to worship God, that is a violation of the FACE Act … I don’t think that’s journalism. That’s not First Amendment, going in and harassing people in the middle of church.”\n\nAfter Greene concluded her point, Scarborough attempted to jump in with his own point, but initially struggled to nail down the specifics of the case.\n\n“If I can disagree here, I think the people that went into the church, that were the protesters, if under the Faith Act,” Scarborough said, gesturing to Greene for support.\n\nGreene quickly chimed in with a correction, noting “the FACE Act.” However, Scarborough didn’t appear to hear her, as he once again repeated “the Faith Act.”\n\nAgain, Greene fact-checked Scarborough, telling the TV personality that the federal law is called the “FACE Act.”\n\n“Faith, right,” Scarborough hit back. The two former politicians did this back-and-forth over the name a couple more times, until Scarborough realized his error.\n\n“Oh, FACE,” he said. “I thought it was, ‘You Gotta Have Faith,’ because it was in [a] church. “\n\nAs Maher’s studio audience erupted with laughter, Greene added, “The parishioners, the Christians, have faith and they were trying to have church and Don Lemon and a bunch of activists came in and harassed them to the point that children were crying.”\n\nScarborough doubled down on his stance, however, sharing, “Whatever that act is, whether it’s the FACE Act or the Faith Act or the Fake Act, whatever act it is, I think the people that went in and disturbed that church, if the [DOJ] wants to prosecute them that’s certainly their right to consider that.”\n\nHe continued: “I think there has to be sort of a differentiation between if somebody’s going in there and saying, ‘I’m not with them. Can I ask you some questions?’ Because you’re going to have embeds in war, you’re going to have embeds in protests.”\n\nPer Scarborough, he had “no doubt” that the arrests of journalists Lemon and Georgia Fort “meant to scare other reporters.”\n\nLemon expressed a similar sentiment following his release Friday, sharing with reporters, “There is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.”\n\nHe added: “Last night, the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night, for something that I’ve been doing for the last 30 years — and that is covering the news. The First Amendment of the Constitution protects that work for me and for countless other journalists … I will not be silenced.”\n\n“Real Time With Bill Maher” airs new episodes Fridays at 10 p.m. ET on HBO.\n\nThe post Joe Scarborough Stumbles as Marjorie Taylor Greene Corrects Him On-Air About Don Lemon’s Arrest appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City matches across the remainder of this season will become a test of patience and nerves as the pressure ramps up. City continue to find ways to win, but supporters are watching with a mix of pride and nervous energy. There’s trust in the system, but pressure brings out scrutiny — and this season, there’s plenty of that going around. Especially as the 25/26 season enters a critical phase as Pep Guardiola’s side chases honours on multiple fronts.\n\nManchester City are only four points behind league leaders Arsenal in the Premier League table. They are also through to the round of 16 in the Champions, hold a 2-nil lead over Newcastle in their Carabao Cup semi-final tie and have progressed to the fourth-round of the FA Cup. Pep Guardiola’s side have a busy schedule ahead with every game appearing to be significant in the coming months.\n\nSuccess doesn’t come without leadership on the pitch. Several players are starting to take more responsibility in difficult moments, or their return injury will add precious leadership traist. Bernardo Silva has risen to the challenge in recent weeks. Manchester City’s captain has shown his willingness to do whatever it takes to lead his team to victory. His performance against Newcastle United’s formidable midfield in City’s 2-nil Carabao Cup semi-final first leg tie win illustrates this point. Bernardo is inspiring his team and challenging his teammates to follow his lead.\n\nRodri is working his way back to full fitness and rediscovering his touch. At his best, his influence in midfield helps control the rhythm of games, and his availability seems to lift the confidence of those around him. Manchester City will be hoping that with every game that Rodri plays, his influence grows. Ruben Dias, with his vocal presence and defensive organisation, remains vital, especially when the team is under pressure late on. Dias is due to return from injury against Liverpool at Anfield next weekend, so his presence should be a massive boost to Pep Guardiola’s side. He has been missed although, Marc Guehi, and especially Abdukodir Khusanov have shown what they are capable of in his absence.\n\nThese players, when fully fit, aren’t just performing; they’re carrying the pressure, visibly leading when matches tighten. For supporters, seeing familiar faces step up is reassuring.\n\nBalancing competitions takes its toll. The fixture list has left little room for rest, and minor injuries have become more common. That’s opened up space for players like Abdukodir Khusanov, Nico O’Reilly, Rayan Cherki and others to be given more prominent roles and play in positions that make them vitally important to Pep Guardiola’s side. Their energy and drive have brought fresh intent, although there’s also been the occasional reminder that experience matters.\n\nSquad rotation remains necessary, but it has its risks. Repeated changes to the starting eleven affect rhythm, and it’s something fans have noticed. Manchester City’s 2-nil loss to Bayer Leverkusen in late November illustrates this point. Some matches feel disjointed, with too many lineup adjustments altering Manchester City’s rhythm. Although the benefit of fresher legs and a deeper bench is clear to see as the fixtures come thick and fast for Manchester City.\n\nManaging fitness levels across four competitions takes planning, and City have handled this well in recent years. But this season has shown signs of wear in certain areas, particularly when cover is needed for key players. But throughout January, Pep Guardiola’s squad has been hit hard by injuries. The fact that City continue to chase honours on four fronts is a testament to the drive, work rate and determination of the fit City players.\n\nThe new-look Manchester City team is still getting up to speed, which speaks to the fact that Pep Guardiola’s side is in transition. However, if injuries continue to hit the same positions, pressure may shift to those with less experience at the top level. The recent use of Max Alleyne in City’s defence shows what can happen when injuries hit one position in a cluster.\n\nFebruary and March feature defining moments. The Champions League knockouts return, and the Premier League table remains tight. Each result could reshape how the season is remembered. This brings intensity on and off the pitch. Supporters feel it building, and the reaction to every result now echoes louder across platforms.\n\nThe pressure isn’t only felt inside the stadium. There is attention from everywhere, including those interested in following the current form through betting markets. When matches go into stoppage time or goal differences matter, more than just supporters are paying attention.\n\nManchester City’s experienced players know how to handle these periods. That said, the intensity can still impact decision-making. High-pressure environments tend to test not only skill, but concentration. Every misplaced pass or missed chance seems bigger when points are harder to come by.\n\nFans can help here. Keeping the focus on support rather than criticism during dips in form might not change outcomes directly, but it helps maintain a sense of unity around the team. And when margins are tight, that connection matters.\n\nFollowing this City team means being emotionally invested in every outcome. One week, there’s excitement; the next, there’s debate over tactics or selections. It’s a natural part of supporting a side that’s held to such high standards.\n\nAcross social media and post-match forums, conversations shift fast. One moment, a player is being praised for a strong performance. A week later, the same name is being questioned for a dip in output. It’s not always fair, but it reflects how closely every move is watched.\n\nThat scrutiny becomes part of the pressure, too. Players are aware of the noise. Some use it as motivation, while others need more time to adapt to the spotlight. Supporters can set the tone, and when that tone stays balanced, it’s easier for players to respond with confidence.\n\nSupport doesn’t mean ignoring poor performances. It means recognising when effort is there, even if results aren’t perfect. This season might ask more from fans emotionally, but the connection to the squad has never felt more important.\n\nThe question still stands — can this Manchester City squad handle the pressure? So far, they’ve given every reason to believe they can. The results haven’t always come easily, but the attitude,  team spirit and effort have remained consistent outside of Manchester City’s recent defeats to Manchester United and Bodø/Glimt.\n\nThere’s pressure, but there’s also belief. Previous Manchester City teams hav dealt with intensity and pressure before and found results when others expected a drop. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but it gives a strong reason to keep faith in the new-look City squad and look ahead with confidence.",

    "description": "The 2026 Royal Rumble go-home show is in the books — here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 1/30/26 episode of \"WWE SmackDown!\"",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s weekly review of \"WWE SmackDown,\" coming to you this week from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (and thus airing internationally earlier in the day before its usual American broadcast Friday night). The go-home show for the 2026 Royal Rumble featured the latest men's US title open challenge, a star-studded tag team main event, and potentially one last WWE TV promo from AJ Styles before he stares down the end of his career on Saturday. The WINC staff have thoughts about all these things, and several other things that happened on the latest installment from the blue brand — including the fact that not a whole lot actually happened despite the three-hour runtime.\n\nAs always, those who missed the show and/or want an objective rundown can check out our \"SmackDown\" results page, which is unburdened by anything as gauche as an opinion. Opinions are what this column is for! Here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 1/30/26 episode of \"WWE SmackDown!\"\n\nTime and time again, we've consistently seen WWE drop the ball when it comes to their go home editions of \"WWE Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" countless times ahead of their Premium Live Events. They generally tend to not really accomplish a ton when it comes to paying attention to the storylines going into the Premium Live Event, nor do they do much outside of verbal confrontations and brawls to generate as much last minute hype as possible. This go-home \"SmackDown\" was no different than the others before it, feeling incredibly underwhelming and disappointing to watch.\n\nOutside of some mild build for the Drew McIntyre and Sami Zayn encounter and (arguably) the 2026 Men's Royal Rumble match, absolutely nothing of note happened on \"SmackDown.\" AJ Styles and GUNTHER had a very short lived verbal confrontation that felt far from as intense as it should've been. Absolutely no new entrants were announced for the 2026 Women's Royal Rumble, and there was just a total lack of real storytelling actually happening on this show. It felt more like a series of standard matches, and was an incredibly lazy way to leave a \"lasting impression\" on the fans ahead of one of the biggest Premium Live Events on WWE's calendar year.\n\nIt is becoming a theme every week but once again Carmelo Hayes defended the United States Championship in an open challenge and once again it was a certified banger. Rey Fenix stepped up to the plate this time around in Riyadh, and if we're being entirely honest he didn't stand a chance of wresting the title from Hayes on this night, but that certainly didn't stop him from giving it his best shot.\n\nFenix, being one of the world's best luchadors, is a more than impressive high flyer with the silkiest of moves on the mat, the ropes, or anywhere in between. Combine with that with the hard-hitting yet bouncy style of Hayes and there was the perfect equation for a fast-paced and action-packed title match. Which, to be honest, should be half of the goal when it comes to a midcard title match. The other aspect that should be present is the spotlight for someone who needs it, and while his brother Penta has become a rather consistent fixture on the \"WWE Raw\" brand the same cannot really be said for Fenix.\n\nHe is undoubtedly one of the very best to do what he does, but there has been very little reason outside of that mythology to feel any type of way towards him in WWE. Losing a United States title match to Hayes is hardly going to remedy that right away and make him a star off the bat, but for what it was in the moment Fenix and Hayes put on a really enjoyable stretch of wrestling and there's really not much to be complained about there.\n\nEven though I am mostly among the believers who think that AJ Styles is losing to GUNTHER at the Royal Rumble tomorrow, I liked the promo he cut tonight on \"SmackDown,\" and I really appreciated the fact he and GUNTHER were both on the show. \"SmackDown\" is the house that Styles built, to be fair, and he and GUNTHER didn't look out of place at all.\n\nIf the blue brand is going to continue to be three hours long every Friday, there's no reason why WWE shouldn't be putting stars from both brands on the final go-home show to big premium live events, especially this one, where all the talent had to fly around the world to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnd, while I'm (again, mostly) in the camp of believing Styles' WWE career is done as of tomorrow, I am ever-so-slightly shaky on that prediction, as I could see both ways, and in this promo, Styles did his best to convince fans that he will be going on a retirement tour after all, one that doesn't stop with \"The Ring General.\" Styles told fans not to be worried about tomorrow, he's going to knock GUNTHER's teeth down his throat and that is what's going to kick off the \"Phenomenal Farewell Tour.\" He mentioned wanting one more match with the likes of Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton, as well as CM Punk when the crowd chanted his name.\n\nThis was also the first promo, I believe, that GUNTHER promised to make Styles tap tomorrow. Which, Styles had a great comeback to, bringing things all full circle, when he said that last time he checked, it was GUNTHER who tapped out \"like a little b****.\" That didn't exactly help to make anything more clear for me as to how this goes tomorrow, as Styles was pretty convincing in his argument that he made GUNTHER tap first. I'll admit, this is one time I don't mind being unsure as to how things are going to go.\n\nEither we get GUNTHER's \"Career Killer\" strengthened even further tomorrow, or we somehow get a John Cena-esque retirement tour for Styles. I think I'll be fine with either option, but if it is the end for Styles in WWE, he at least made a fine attempt tonight to convince us all that it's not. On a go-home show where not much exciting happened, an appearance by Styles to say his piece before what might be his final moment in the company was a welcomed addition.\n\nWe all know what Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair, Roxanne Perez, and Liv Morgan are capable of doing with their endless amounts of talent, so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that all four women had a great tag team match with each other.\n\nNow, I will be the first to admit that this was a very typical Judgment Day match with all of the interference and shenanigans that went on. However, in the particular case of this match, I actually think that all of the usual Judgment Day interference contributed to things rather than take away or distract as it usually tends to do. By having Stephanie Vaquer be the one to take out Raquel Rodriguez, it worked to build up the tensions between the two women ahead of their Women's World Championship match on \"Raw\" next week without taking anything away from the action that was going on inside of the ring.\n\nAlexa Bliss may have also spent the vast majority of the match being beaten down by Liv Morgan and Roxanne Perez, but the action was still engaging to watch in my opinion with a good pace throughout it. It felt like a very intentional choice, and works to provide Bliss with another reason to be angry at Flair when their inevitable split eventually happens to end their tumultuous yet fruitful friendship. On a \"SmackDown\" where I didn't really feel particularly excited about any one specific match or segment on the whole, this was the one that stood out far above the rest for me as a fun watch.\n\nThe Miz is an odd phenomenon with me, both someone I can respect for his tenure and ability to remain on the booking sheet, but also someone I never really want to see step in the ring again. A great talker, a solid worker, and super consistent. The issue is, he is consistently not that good. Not bad. But definitely not good. The equivalent of watching paint dry; I understand it is a process the paint must go through but I do not know why I have to watch it. The answer to that situation is to simply not watch it. Trust me, I am acutely aware. But in the spirit of trying to review the show I watched, had some moments of fun with, I don't know if it's a good thing to stage matches that evoke that reaction.\n\nMiz is a storyteller, for better or for worse, and absolutely does his best when there is a story to tell – that isn't the same as the past year's \"No one respects me even though I have been here for so long\" rigmarole, anyway. But just booking him opposite Dragunov and saying, \"Now, wrestle\" is not going to yield a good result. What happens instead is what happened — Dragunov working his a** off to produce a somewhat passable match and Miz, while not bad, is just incapable of switching into that next gear.\n\nEverything he does feels a little bit played out, down to the \"Yes\" kicks he adopted from Bryan Danielson for a feud that ended years ago, the shenanigans and attempted cheating, the hyperbolic swinging DDT he does. Maybe it is Miz fatigue talking. And it's certainly not like I am saying he should be gone from the company – like my opinion would make a shred of difference anyway. He has a place. I just don't feel like it's opposite someone like Dragunov, clearly light-years ahead of Miz in terms of talent between the bells, and certainly not with the amount of offense he got in. It's just not believable when the gulf in quality is so wide. At least Dragunov won, there is that.\n\nAfter Jacob Fatu and Cody Rhodes' match at Saturday Night's Main Event never got underway, and was just one big, brutal brawl until Undisputed WWE Champion Drew McIntyre put an end to things, I thought maybe we'd get some more answers tonight on \"SmackDown.\" If not answers, I assumed Fatu and Rhodes would be at each others' throats the entire night, ahead of the Royal Rumble where one eliminates the other, or they eliminate themselves trying to drag the other over the top rope. But, I didn't really get either of those things tonight, and the fact Fatu and Rhodes weren't brawling, and didn't even get physical at all until the very end of the night was pretty confusing.\n\nRhodes opened up the show and did acknowledge their brawl at SNME, but said their \"fun\" was interrupted by McIntyre, and chose to address the champion rather than the guy who was kicking him all around the arena on Saturday. Instead of Fatu coming out to do anything, it was Orton who interrupted Rhodes' promo when he continued to go on about the Royal Rumble. Sure, the Saudi fans loved Orton, but it was really strange that Fatu didn't do a single thing after what we saw on Saturday.\n\nThe main event of the show saw Rhodes, Sami Zayn, Jey Uso, and Orton take on The Vision, in WWE's usual multi-man babyface vs. heel match on a go-home show to a big event. Throughout that match, once again, no Fatu. We didn't see the \"Samoan Werewolf\" until the bell had rung on the match, after McIntyre interfered, causing the disqualification. And then, it was the champion who Fatu went after, not Rhodes, though \"The American Nightmare\" did get his hands on Fatu. They started to fight, but McIntyre then went after Rhodes. But, initially, Fatu didn't care about Rhodes being there whatsoever.\n\nIt's still not clear to me why McIntyre wants to be involved in any of this. Sure, Fatu thinks McIntyre is the one who put him on the shelf, but McIntyre could have just steered clear of him. I thought the story of tonight would be Rhodes and Fatu still going after each other ahead of tomorrow's Rumble match. That wasn't the case, and it makes their SNME non-match feel all the more strange. This wasn't a great go-home angle on their feud ahead of the Rumble match, and I'm left wondering just how it all plays out tomorrow when it could really count for both men.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Another crucial Premier League matchweek awaits, with title contenders, European hopefuls, and relegation battlers all facing defining tests.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City both face tricky away fixtures as the pressure at the top of the table intensifies. Several sides in the bottom half will view this round as a major opportunity to gain breathing room.\n\nWith injuries, suspensions, and recent form playing a key role, fine margins are expected to decide many of the fixtures. This gameweek promises drama across the table and potential shifts at both ends of the standings.\n\nBrighton extended their winless run to three matches following a 2–1 defeat to Fulham last week. The Seagulls have struggled in front of goal, scoring just once in each of their last three games.\n\nThis clash with Everton is expected to be a tight affair decided by fine margins. Brajan Gruda has been passed fit, while Diego Gómez remains a doubt.\n\nA second-half goal from Thierno Barry earned Everton a point against Leeds, extending their unbeaten run to three matches and lifting them into the top half of the table.\n\nJack Grealish has been ruled out for the season with an ankle injury, while Tim Iroegbunam is a doubt. Michael Keane remains suspended for the final match of his three-game ban.\n\nLeeds welcome league leaders Arsenal to Elland Road hoping to disrupt the Gunners’ title charge.\n\nThe Whites have enjoyed a strong run of form, losing just one of their last six matches, which has lifted them to 16th in the table with 26 points.\n\nGabriel Gudmundsson has an outside chance of featuring, while Jaka Bijol, Lukas Nmecha, and Daniel James remain close to a return but will miss this fixture.\n\nArsenal suffered only their third league defeat of the season against Manchester United last week.\n\nThe result cut their lead at the top to four points, leaving Mikel Arteta’s side with little margin for error. The Gunners boast an almost fully fit squad, with Max Dowman the only confirmed absentee.\n\nBottom-placed Wolves saw their four-game unbeaten run end with a 2–0 defeat to title contenders Manchester City. Despite an improved performance, Pep Guardiola’s side ultimately proved too strong.\n\nJean-Ricner Bellegarde has returned from injury, while Ladislav Krejčí is a doubt due to illness.\n\nBournemouth picked up a morale-boosting 3–2 win against reigning champions Liverpool to extend their unbeaten run to three matches.\n\nA dramatic 95th-minute winner from Amine Adli sent the Cherries’ fans into raptures and eased concerns following the departure of Antoine Semenyo. David Brooks remains a doubt.\n\nChelsea made it back-to-back wins with a convincing victory over an out-of-sorts Crystal Palace last week, with goals from Estêvão, João Pedro, and Enzo Fernández.\n\nThe Blues followed that up with a Champions League win over Napoli to secure automatic qualification for the next round. Confidence is clearly building under the Stamford Bridge lights.\n\nLiverpool bounced back from late heartbreak against Bournemouth by securing a resounding 6–0 win over Qarabag in the Champions League.\n\nThe victory guaranteed progression to the knockout stages and restored confidence. Ibrahima Konaté and Curtis Jones have been passed fit, while Jeremie Frimpong remains sidelined.\n\nNewcastle’s four-game unbeaten league run came to an end with a 2–0 home defeat to Aston Villa. Despite that setback, the Magpies remain in the top half of the table.\n\nJoelinton and Tino Livramento are ruled out, while Bruno Guimarães is a doubt.\n\nAston Villa returned to winning ways with a vital victory over Newcastle, moving them closer to league leaders Arsenal.\n\nIt was their first league win in three matches, and they followed it up with an impressive Europa League comeback against Red Bull Salzburg.\n\nYouri Tielemans and John McGinn remain long-term absentees, while Ross Barkley and Ollie Watkins are doubts.\n\nBrentford received a boost as Mikkel Damsgaard and Kristoffer Ajer avoided serious injuries and could feature after being substituted in last week’s defeat to Nottingham Forest.\n\nMichael Carrick will look to extend his dream start as Manchester United’s interim manager by securing a third consecutive win.\n\nVictories over Manchester City and Arsenal have lifted the mood around Old Trafford to levels not seen in years. Patrick Dorgu has been ruled out for ten weeks with a thigh injury, while Joshua Zirkzee remains a doubt.\n\nFulham’s 2-1 win over Brighton last week saw them move just three points behind Chelsea in fifth place.\n\nThe Cottagers have only lost once in their last five games, with two of them being wins. Kenny Tete has been passed fit for the Cottagers, while Samuel Chukwueze is a doubt due to personal reasons.\n\nNottingham Forest made it three games unbeaten with a much-needed win over Brentford.\n\nWhile their season has been inconsistent, recent results suggest improved defensive discipline as they aim to pull clear of the relegation zone.\n\nCrystal Palace continues to struggle, with off-field and on-field issues mounting.\n\nJustin Devenny is ruled out for three weeks with an ankle ligament injury, Philippe Mateta will not travel due to personal reasons, and Adam Wharton is suspended.\n\nSpurs host Manchester City in the standout fixture of the gameweek. Thomas Frank’s side have struggled domestically, failing to win any of their last five league matches and sitting 14th in the table.\n\nHowever, a Champions League victory over Eintracht Frankfurt secured automatic qualification to the next round. Micky van de Ven will undergo a late fitness test.\n\nManchester City returned to winning ways with a routine 2–0 victory over Wolves, their first league win in five matches. Pep Guardiola’s side face a tougher test this weekend, with Jeremy Doku and Rúben Dias both ruled out.\n\nSunderland slipped out of the top half of the table following a 3–1 defeat to West Ham.\n\nThe Black Cats have won just once in their last five matches but remain level on points with several top-ten sides. A clash with fellow newly promoted Burnley promises an open contest. Captain Granit Xhaka is ruled out through injury.\n\nBurnley picked up their third consecutive draw against Spurs last week, leaving them rooted in 19th place. The Clarets remain ten points from safety after 23 games, but Joe Worrall and Zion Flemming have both been passed fit for this fixture.",

    "fullText": "In a surprise move, at least in terms of the timing, the Minnesota Vikings fired general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah on Friday after four years on the job. He had been given a contract extension just last May following the draft, but after an additional year to evaluate, according to Vikings president and co-owner Mark Wilf, the Vikings decided they didn’t want Adofo-Mensah making the key personnel decisions in free agency and the draft in what Wilf described as a critical off-season for the Vikings.\n\nBased on Mark Wilf’s comments, the decision to fire Adofo-Mensah hinged on the decisions he made over the past nine months, or perhaps more likely the results of the decisions. It may also be that the last year was enough to tip the balance from ownership having confidence in Adofo-Mensah despite a mixed track record, to them losing confidence after a lost season that resulted from Adofo-Mensah’s decision-making.\n\nThe Vikings went all-in during free agency last season, spending the second-most of any team in 2025, believing they were set for a deep run in the playoffs behind quarterback J.J. McCarthy. That roll of the dice came up snake-eyes. As a reference, the Vikings were in the middle of the two Super Bowl teams- the Patriots and Seahawks- in free agent spending last year. The fact that Sam Darnold, who the Vikings let go last year, is now leading his team in the Super Bowl doesn’t help the optics for Adofo-Mensah’s decision-making either.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I suspect Adofo-Mensah was fired for two key reasons.\n\nFirst, he didn’t secure a viable backup/competitor at quarterback in the event McCarthy wasn’t ready or didn’t work out. He had the opportunity with Sam Darnold, Daniel Jones, and Aaron Rodgers, but he ultimately let all three go in favor of Sam Howell, who was cut at the end of training camp and led to the Vikings picking up Carson Wentz off the couch at the end of August. Darnold, Jones and Rodgers all played for their teams this past season for around $15 million salary cap hits. It’s a dereliction of duty to both spend a ton of money in free agency thinking you’re a contender and not have a proven starter at the most important position in professional sports. But that’s what happened.\n\nCertainly head coach Kevin O’Connell had significant input into the decisions at quarterback, but ultimately how the Vikings allocated their salary cap was Adofo-Mensah’s decision to make.\n\nSecond, Adofo-Mensah’s drafting track record has not inspired a ton of confidence and, as Mark Wilf pointed out in his press conference, the Vikings have a lot of draft picks this year- 11 overall including 4 in the first three rounds. Adofo-Mensah’s lackluster track record in the draft has been somewhat offset by more success in free agency, including undrafted free agents, but the key free agent acquisitions last year- Javon Hargrave, Jonathan Allen, and Will Fries- all underperformed their contracts last season. Ryan Kelly did too due to his injuries and had an injury history as an older player that was a known risk.\n\nThe Vikings are now around $40 million over the salary cap for the 2026 season, depending on what the final salary cap number turns out to be, so having a new GM that isn’t tied to Adofo-Mensah’s past decisions may be helpful in getting the Vikings’ salary cap under control. That also means the Vikings won’t be acquiring any high-profile free agents this year, with the possible exception of an affordable quarterback to compete with McCarthy.\n\nThe Vikings are also in a situation where they need to be shopping players like Javon Hargrave, T.J. Hockenson, Jordan Addison, and Jonathan Allen ahead of free agency in hope of trading them away for decent compensation. That won’t be easy because all of them arguably underperformed their contracts last season except Addison on his rookie deal. But Addison’s immaturity off-the-field will likely bring additional scrutiny. But to the extent the Vikings can find trade partners, they will likely have even more draft picks at the end of April.\n\nSo, when you look at the key tasks the Vikings’ general manager would need to handle in the coming weeks- cleaning up Adofo-Mensah’s all-in 2025 and significant cap overage, picking a large draft class, and having a solid contingency plan at quarterback, why would the Vikings have Adofo-Mensah in charge of all that given his track record and poor decision-making led to this situation?\n\nThere really is no basis for it.\n\nAdam Schefter reported that there had been “tension” in the Vikings’ building according to league circles this season and that one source said turned ugly. Alec Lewis with The Athletic reported a few months ago some tension last spring around the quarterback decision-making. There is another unconfirmed report that Adofo-Mensah prioritized J.J. McCarthy over Sam Darnold last off-season while Kevin O’Connell preferred Darnold and the Vikings nearly traded McCarthy to the Raiders. There was also some disagreement around drafting McCarthy. The Vikings attempted to move up for Drake Maye, and Adofo-Mensah was reportedly willing to part with three first-round picks and change to do so- which was a significant premium- but the Patriots turned him down.\n\nI don’t know if we’ll ever know for sure what the decision-making was regarding all the various options the Vikings had this time a year ago, and who supported what option(s), but if head coach and general manager are not on the same page regarding the quarterback position, that is a problem for any NFL team.\n\nThere was also tension between defensive coordinator Brian Flores and now former assistant head coach Mike Pettine, who retired earlier this year. He said there were disagreements with Flores and that he would take the high road and not discuss them. Pettine moved from the defensive side to the offensive side this past season due to differences with Flores.\n\nKevin Seifert with ESPN reported that:\n\n“Multiple sources said that defensive coordinator Brian Flores’ unusual decision to let his contract lapse, before signing a new deal that will pay him more than $6 million per season, was based in part on his unease with the direction of the front office. When asked last month if he wanted to remain with the Vikings, Flores noted that he loved working for the Wilfs and with O’Connell, and loved living in Minnesota, but did not mention Adofo-Mensah.”\n\nI mention all this because the Wilfs also seem to value a general manager that keeps order and lead the organization through adversity and conflicts. Rick Spielman was fired at least in part because he wasn’t able to manage differences with Mike Zimmer and maintain a positive atmosphere, for lack of a better term, within the building. The Wilfs may have begun to conclude that Adofo-Mensah, between his personnel decision-making and how he handled other situations, was losing respect for his leadership within the building.\n\nAnd with so many key decisions to be made in the coming months, and a growing lack of confidence within the building in Adofo-Mensah’s ability to make them, the Wilfs may have also concluded that it may only create more problems if Adofo-Mensah is the one making them. Adofo-Mensah’s body language in recent months seemed to reflect that lack of confidence, so it may not have been much of a surprise to him when he was let go.\n\nNobody has more respect or tenure in the Vikings front office than Rob Brzezinski, who was EVP of Football Operations before being named Interim GM. He has been the Vikings’ lead contract negotiator and salary cap guru for over ten years. He is also well respected around the league and has contacts and dealings with every NFL team. That background should serve him well as he is undoubtedly tasked with fixing the Vikings’ salary cap issues and finding trading partners for several veterans on the roster.\n\n“Rob brings tremendous credibility and experience, understands our roster and has the ability to build consensus and rely on the expertise of our personnel and coaches,” – Mark Wilf\n\nSometimes what ownership extols in a new coach or GM is something that was notably missing in the last coach or GM. That was the case when Mark Wilf introduced Kevin O’Connell and may well have been the case in his comments about Rob Brzezinski. His words “credibility”, “ability to build consensus”, and “rely on the expertise of our personnel and coaches” stand out to me in that regard.\n\nBrzezinski isn’t a scout or talent evaluator, however, so those types of decisions will fall on the current scouts and assistant GMs Ryan Grigson and Demitrius Washington, both of whom are Kwesi Adofo-Mensah hires. Presumably both are at risk of being replaced once a new general manager is named following the NFL draft at the end of April. There isn’t enough time to conduct a search and hire a new GM that can also be prepared to conduct a crucial draft for the Vikings, let alone a new scouting staff.\n\nOf course the Vikings will also lean heavily on their coaching staff in evaluating talent, both on the pro side and potential draft picks. I’m also curious if recently extended defensive coordinator Brian Flores is tasked with more of a role in the personnel/scouting area, given his background in scouting with the Patriots, at least on an interim basis. We’ll see.\n\nIf it is true that Kevin O’Connell wanted to prioritize Sam Darnold over J.J. McCarthy last year, which may have been the case- O’Connell seemed more disappointed to lose Kirk Cousins too- then McCarthy may have lost his biggest backer in the Vikings’ organization in Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. A new GM will not be tied to the decision to draft McCarthy #10 overall and may also be unwilling to make McCarthy the presumed starter this off-season either. It probably doesn’t make sense to trade McCarthy at this point- I can’t imagine he carries much trade value now given his injury and performance history- but his status as a #10 overall pick will no longer carry the weight it once did in determining the quarterback depth chart. Two of the more likely possibilities for the Vikings as a veteran acquisition are Malik Willis and Mac Jones. At this point it seems unlikely that McCarthy would beat out either one for the starting job in a competitive situation this offseason. That could put McCarthy on the extended development track as a backup.\n\nWas able to snag a couple Vikings QB nuggets while in Mobile: \n\n– The team still has faith in McCarthy but injuries are the main worry. \n\n– Source with inside knowledge shared Mac Jones is definitely on the Vikings radar, but there are a number of other teams interested.\n\n– One…\n\n— Jason Harmon (@JasonHarmonNFL) January 29, 2026\n\nThe Vikings also are likely to have interest in Anthony Richardson, who apparently they were interested in moving up to draft in 2023. Richardson was always thought to have a Josh Allen type ceiling but only had one season as a starter in college. He’s still only 23. The Colts seem likely to move on from Richardson this off-season, although he has one year left on his rookie contract.\n\nJeremy Fowler reports that as an analytics GM with a background as a Wall Street veteran rather than a former football player, he never really fit in with the more traditional football guys inside the Vikings’ building. And so, when his approach and perspective didn’t yield results, his credibility was pretty well shot. And with that, his ability to lead the organization.\n\nThe decision, or series of decisions, to prioritize an unproven J.J. McCarthy, which led Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones to sign elsewhere and to not make Aaron Rodgers an offer, was the biggest mistake of Adofo-Mensah’s tenure with the Vikings. Going all-in on other free agent signings while not having a proven starter at quarterback was unnecessarily risky, given the quarterbacks the Vikings could have signed.\n\nBut Adofo-Mensah was sold on the idea of drafting a franchise quarterback on a rookie contract and building around him. Get it right and the team will flourish. But in doing so, he didn’t consider that a former bust who flourished, even though he was only supposed to be a bridge quarterback, might also get you where you want to go. And he didn’t give enough credence to the fact that at least half of all first-round quarterbacks don’t work out for the team that drafted them.\n\nA bird in hand is worth two in the bush.",

    "description": "Behind a dominant first half and a 26-point, 12-rebound performance from Yaxel Lendeborg, Michigan controlled the rivalry showdown from start to finish, knocking off Michigan State 83–71 in East Lansing.",
    "fullText": "Michigan delivered a statement win in its rivalry with Michigan State on Friday night, pulling away from the Spartans for an 83–71 victory behind a dominant first half and a monster performance from Yaxel Lendeborg.\n\nThe Wolverines set the tone early and never really let it go. Michigan raced out to a 42–26 halftime lead, shooting 44% from the floor in the opening 20 minutes while holding the Spartans to just 36.7% for the game. By the time Michigan State found any offensive rhythm, the hole was already deep.\n\nBut the Spartans did not go away. After a quick 6-0 run to start the second half, MSU made it a game for much of the final 20 minutes. The Spartans were led almost entirely by Jeremy Fears Jr., who finished with a game-high 31 points on 9-of-20 shooting and a near-perfect 12-of-14 at the line. Fears kept Michigan State alive with tough drives and shot creation, particularly in the second half when MSU actually took a two-point lead with 6:55 remaining in the contest. Coen Carr added 10 points and seven rebounds, but consistent scoring help was hard to find.\n\nFor Michigan, Lendeborg was the engine all night. The junior forward finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds, going 6-of-13 from the field and an efficient 13-of-15 at the free-throw line. His physicality inside consistently bent Michigan State’s defense and allowed Michigan to control the paint and the glass. Whenever the Spartans threatened to make a run, Lendeborg seemed to answer with a bucket, a board, or both.\n\nLendeborg was Michigan's big dog, but Elliot Cadeau complemented him perfectly. The scrappy guard poured in 17 points on 5-of-8 shooting and knocked down three triples, while also dishing out six assists. Cadeau’s pace and decision-making helped Michigan keep its offense organized, especially during stretches when Michigan State tried to speed the game up in the second half.\n\nMichigan’s balance was evident throughout the box score. Roddy Gayle Jr. and Morez Johnson Jr. each chipped in timely minutes, while Michigan shot a strong 38.1% from three-point range (8-of-21) and an outstanding 88.5% from the free-throw line. The Wolverines also took care of the ball, committing just 13 turnovers while converting Michigan State mistakes into points when needed.\n\nUltimately, Michigan’s early execution proved decisive. The Wolverines led for over 36 minutes, built their advantage with an 8–0 first-half run, and never allowed Michigan State to fully flip the momentum, despite a raucous crowd inside the Breslin Center. In a rivalry game that often swings on emotion, Michigan relied on poise, efficiency, and its star forward to secure a convincing win on the road.",

    "fullText": "Miami Dolphins predicted to land All-Pro pass-catcher in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt remains to be seen who the starting quarterback will be for the Miami Dolphins in 2026. Regardless of who that person is, though, the Dolphins will want to surround him with playmakers.\n\nPlaymakers aren’t limited to wide receivers or running backs, either. One could come in the form of a tight end.\n\nIn a recent article for Bleacher Report, Alex Kay predicts that the Dolphins will land Atlanta Falcons tight end Kyle Pitts in free agency over the offseason.\n\nPitts is fresh off of the first All-Pro nod of his career after catching 88 passes for 928 yards and five touchdowns for Atlanta in 2025.\n\n“While there are plenty of other question marks for the new Miami regime led by head coach Jeff Hafley to sort out, getting a potential game-changer like Pitts in the lineup could pay dividends,” Kay wrote.\n\n“Regardless of whether Tua Tagovailoa, Quinn Ewers or someone else ends up starting under center for Miami in 2026, Pitts should emerge as a favored target thanks to his excellent playmaking skills and ability to create mismatches all over the field.”\n\nPitts, 25, has been a polarizing player because his production hasn’t matched his talent level for much of his career. He was named to the Pro Bowl after surpassing 1,000 receiving yards as a rookie in 20221, but he finished with fewer than 700 yards in each of the next three seasons before bouncing back in '25.\n\nThe tight end position probably isn’t a top priority for the Dolphins this offseason, but they could certainly use an upgrade there. Miami’s most productive tight end last season was Greg Dulcich, who had 26 receptions for 335 yards.\n\nPlus, while Pitts is a tight end by position, he could operate more as a wide receiver in certain situations given his skill set.\n\nIf signed, he would be a major weapon for Miami's quarterback next season, whoever that turns out to be.\n\nTom Brady sticks up for Bill Belichick after Hall of Fame snub\n\nTennessee Titans named best landing spot for All-Pro wide receiver\n\nChiefs owner sends clear message regarding Travis Kelce's future in Kansas City\n\nDenver Broncos predicted to land major weapon for Bo Nix in free agency",

    "title": "“If LeBron James Got One Leg”: Draymond Green Asserts Cleveland Should Bring Back LBJ Under Any Condition",
    "description": "LeBron James’ future has been one of the biggest talking points this season. Some believe he is ready to hang up his boots, while others feel he has one more season left in him.",
    "fullText": "LeBron James’ future has been one of the biggest talking points this season. Some believe he is ready to hang up his boots, while others feel he has one more season left in him. He has not hinted at retirement, of course. But does that mean he will continue with the Lakers? Maybe not. Dave McMenamin’s recent report that the Cavaliers want LeBron back has reignited the rumor mill.\n\nDraymond Green, on his podcast, recently addressed the situation and opined that Cleveland should get James on their team at any cost. It would be a happy reunion between the two parties, whether the team succeeds on the court or not.\n\nJames is from Akron, near the city of Cleveland. The Cavaliers were the team that drafted him in 2003, and in 2016, LeBron helped them win a championship. He is a hero in the city, and it would make perfect sense for him to ride off into the sunset in the colors of the team he first represented in the NBA. Green feels it makes sense from a sporting, business, and emotional point of view.\n\n“They may still feel like Bron can help guide these young guys,” Green said. “Because it’s been a bit of a rough year this year, coming off from the year that they had last year. They may probably thing, let Bron come back here. The East is not as hard as the West, Bron can help this young guys over.”\n\nThe East is certainly not as star-studded as the West, but the Cavs, who finished #1 last season, are 29-20 this season and 5th in the standings and don’t look like real contenders. That’s something they want to change in 26/27.\n\nThat said, Green thinks that even if the Cavs don’t achieve anything this season, James’ return would make for a great idea.\n\n“They could be thinking, ‘Ah, this young group that we thought just ain’t it. We might as well honor Bron and bring him back in. We know what he does for the economy, for the city of Cleveland. And all of the business that goes on around the city’,” Green stated.\n\nThe Warriors legend continued, “One thing is for certain. I don’t care if LeBron James got one leg. The Cleveland Cavaliers should, would, and could, and better always be willing to have him come back there… because it’s so much bigger than basketball. “\n\nJames is 41 years old and isn’t the same player that won the Cavs a Championship in 2016. But he’s still averaging 22 points per game and shooting 50% from the field. Couple that with his legendary status, and he’d be an asset to the team for certain.\n\nThe post “If LeBron James Got One Leg”: Draymond Green Asserts Cleveland Should Bring Back LBJ Under Any Condition appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Despite efficient shooting from the Rebels, turnovers and second-chance points proved costly in Reno.",
    "fullText": "UNLV needed a rivalry road win after losing two straight, and with the Mountain West race getting tighter, every possession mattered. Instead, the game turned into a race that UNLV was trying to crawl back from. Nevada’s transition offense, second-chance opportunities, and a masterclass from Nevada guard Corey Camper Jr. got the Wolf Pack the 89-76 win over UNLV.\n\nThe tone of the game was set from the tip. UNLV turned it over on two of its first three possessions, and Nevada took advantage and scored. Camper Jr. opened the scoring with a jumper after a shot clock violation from the Rebels, and then guard Vaughn Weems scored on a driving layup off a bad pass from UNLV guard Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn.\n\nThe Rebels couldn’t even settle before they were down 9-0, and with a sold-out student section in Reno, it took a lot of effort.\n\nGibbs-Lawhorn kept UNLV in the game. He scored 26 points on 10-of-17 shooting and connected on four threes. He provided a response to the Rebels whenever they needed it.\n\nDespite his efforts, Nevada controlled the game. UNLV would go on a run, and then the Wolf Pack would answer right back. UNLV got the margin down to five near halftime as Gibbs-Lawhorn had a beautiful finish at the rim to make it 33-28 at halftime.\n\nAfter halftime, the game slipped away for UNLV. Turnovers, second chances, and Nevada threes made a close game into a blowout, especially after Camper Jr. made the court his kingdom.\n\nCamper Jr. scored 32 points on 11-of-15 shooting, including knocking down five threes. His biggest came in the second half, after Nevada forward Tayshawn Comer blocked guard Isaac Williamson, they went the other way, and Camper Jr. nailed a three to extend the Wolf Pack lead past double digits.\n\nThe issue for the Rebels wasn’t offense; they were shooting 45.9% from the field and 42.3% from three. Forward Naas Cunningham had 13 points and hit four threes. However, the Rebels’ offense just wasn’t as efficient as the Wolf Pack’s. Nevada shot 58% from the field and an impressive 57.1% from three.\n\nForward Elijah Price also had a spectacular night for the Wolf Pack, scoring 22 points and corralling 11 rebounds, giving Nevada another great scorer. Weems scored nine points and four assists as well for the Pack.\n\nUNLV kept fighting, and there were flashes where the Rebels played good ball. Forward Kimani Hamilton brought energy off the bench, finishing with 9 points and 6 rebounds.\n\nBut unfortunately for the Rebels, the separation was too much to overcome, and they were defeated 89-76. It is the Rebels’ third loss in a row. In the Mountain West, playing on the road is very important, and a run can become something too much to come back from, and that’s what happened Friday night.\n\nUNLV continues the road trip heading to Fresno to take on Fresno State on Tuesday, Feb. 3rd at 8:00 PM.",

    "description": "Mainland is the champion once again. The Bucs won their fourth consecutive Five Star boys basketball title on their home floor Friday, Jan. 30.",
    "fullText": "DAYTONA BEACH — Make it a four-peat for the Mainland Buccaneers.\n\nMainland beat Atlantic 76-71 on Friday, Jan. 30, to win its fourth consecutive Five Star Conference boys basketball championship. And the Bucs did it in front of their home crowd.\n\n“That was a big win for us,” Mainland coach Joe Giddens said. “Atlantic went to the Elite Eight last year, and they got the whole team coming back. So it was good for us to come out here and get a victory.”\n\nThe Bucs had Beegie Gordon, Canyon Powers, Kade Manley, Jaheem Curry and Kadin Flores score in double figures as part of a nine-man rotation.\n\nGordon led all Mainland players with 15 points, followed by Curry (14), Powers (12), Flores (12) and Manley (10).\n\n“That’s the beauty of it,” Giddens said. “We can probably go 11 deep, and we’ve been playing like 11 guys all year. So it’s not like it’s something new. We’re used to it, so when we get to the playoffs, we’re gonna continue to play that many guys. So it only helps us, and we can get some guys rest when they need it.”\n\nMainland led for the majority of the game, but it was Atlantic that possessed a 21-18 advantage after the first quarter. The Sharks limited the Bucs’ stars before they were able to get hot down the stretch.\n\nAtlantic held on to its lead until the second quarter, when Mainland, the FHSAA’s 10th-ranked team, took a 36-32 cushion into the break. The Sharks never allowed the Bucs to run away with a win, but they also never saw the lead again.\n\n“I thought we followed our game plan really, really well,” Atlantic coach Travis Norfolk said. “I thought we did a really good job keeping Beegie and Kade from getting loose at the 3-point line very often. I mean, those two guys are super talented, they’re really good basketball players … You don’t get in the top 10 in the state by not being a good basketball team.”\n\nMainland’s lead blossomed to 55-49 at the end of the third quarter and creeped into double-digit territory in the fourth quarter. But Atlantic stuck around until the final whistle.\n\nThe win was the Bucs’ sixth in a row and improved them to 21-2 as both teams closed their regular seasons. The Sharks finished 17-8.\n\nBoth look to end the campaign with a state trophy, Mainland in 6A and Atlantic in 4A.\n\n“Our goal, obviously, is to go to states and win states,” Manley said. “I feel like we could beat anybody. We just got to tighten some things up and play better defense.”\n\n“Last year, we lost Five Star, and we ended up being the last team from Volusia County playing,” Norfolk said. “So our goals are way bigger than Five Star. I mean, it would’ve been nice to win it, but we’re trying to be district champions. In all honesty, we’re trying to hang a banner, and I think this group is good enough to do it.”\n\nAfter both teams shook hands, a scuffle ensued. It was quickly broken up by security and other staff members before both teams retired to their respective locker rooms.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Daytona Beach News-Journal: FHSAA boys basketball: Mainland beats Atlantic for Five Star 4-peat",

    "description": "From sharp new promo reveals to renewed belief in Rebuild 2.0, optimism ruled the night on the South Side",
    "fullText": "SoxFest Live kicked off Friday night at the Ramova Theatre as the baseball offseason wraps up and pitchers and catchers prepare to report for Spring Training. The White Sox had a decent rebound season last year while sporting a very young team in 2025 and coming off a historically horrific 2024. However, the vibes were high all night on the South Side, as fans feel more optimistic about the organization’s future.\n\nOf course, the part of the night that drove the most buzz was the announcement of the 2026 promo items, and trust me, they are SHARP.\n\nMiguel Vargas, Colson Montgomery, Chase Meidroth, and Kyle Teel all opened a gift bag on stage that featured their own bobbleheads, including a catcher’s duo bobblehead with Teel and his counterpart, Edgar Quero. While all of them are awesome, in my opinion, the real star of the show is the Bobby Jenks and A.J. Pierzynski bobblehead as they celebrate winning the 2005 World Series. A perfect tribute to the glue of the championship-winning team and to Bobby, who was lost way too soon last year.\n\nHome opening weekend is full of fun giveaways, including the Bobby and A.J. bobble, an Opening Day t-shirt featuring Munetaka Murakami, a few jackets, and plenty of City Connect swag. I know I initially talked some smack about the new City Connect jerseys’ lack of creativity, but they do make some pretty epic gear. And let’s not forget the Mexican heritage items because every year these games are beyond fun with a sellout crowd, and the Los White Sox jersey is always a hit.\n\nWhen chatting with several season ticket holders, the consensus is that they have more faith in the front office over the last year, and there is heightened positivity around the Rebuild 2.0 that GM Chris Getz has been forced to undertake. Many players seem to share the same sentiment, as every player we were able to speak with said they were “excited to get back together with the guys, and get back to playing and working on being consistent.”\n\nThere were 10 South Siders in the building on Friday night. The legendary Gene Honda began the evening by introducing everyone, with his smooth, iconic voice easily hyping up the crowd as if it were a Saturday night game at the Rate, and he’s announcing the starting lineup. A sort of frightening starting lineup considering there were just four position players and six pitchers, but perhaps Davis Martin or Shane Smith is a secret weapon at the plate, though I’m not sure I want to find out.\n\nFirst up was the broadcast team, with in-game reporters Brooke Fletcher and Connor McKnight, followed by the TV and radio crew, featuring Chuck Garfein, Len Kasper, and John Schriffen. Getz and manager Will Venable repped the front office and coaching staff, followed by two minor league prospects who joined this year: infielder Sam Antonacci and righthander Tanner McDougal.\n\nLast up were the major leaguers — the stars of the show. Grant Taylor, Anthony Kay, Davis Martin, and Shane Smith represented the South Side pitching staff. Kay joined the team for the first time this offseason, signing out of the NPB in Japan, and is thrilled to be meeting some of the guys and looking forward to Spring Training and another chance in MLB.\n\nLast but certainly not least: infielders Vargas, Meidroth, and Montgomery, and catcher Teel, who recently committed to playing for Italy in the World Baseball Classic this March. There was, however, one player who was unable to attend, but Munetaka Murakami was there in spirit and shared a message to fans, earning a roar from the crowd upon hearing “Go White Sox!”\n\nWho is as hyped for Mune as we are?? #SoxFestLive pic.twitter.com/Ufhgzrhvq0\n\n— South Side Sox (@SouthSideSox) January 31, 2026\n\nFans were also able to ask questions to Getz and Venable in a segment called “Pardon the Pitch Clock”, which gave them four minutes to answer some questions from the crowd. The five categories before a final “lightning round” were: the 2026 outlook, offseason acquisitions and roster philosophy, players to watch, new initiatives and innovations, and clubhouse culture and leadership. This year was probably much easier to manage, considering they aren’t coming off of the worst season ever, but the positivity and buy-in from Getz and Venable seem to reinforce the fans’ hope for the future of the team.\n\nProps to the White Sox for putting on a great event for the first day, and a big thank you to the players for being so welcoming and willing to talk with us and answer questions. We’ll be back with more coverage throughout the rest of the event!",

    "description": "Houston flashes brilliance for 24 minutes, the rest? Fragility. Can they still sustain elite play for a full 48?",
    "fullText": "Ime Udoka didn’t try to dress it up after Wednesday night. He called the Rockets’ loss to San Antonio “a tale of two halves,” and that phrasing has quietly followed Houston through the rest of the week, because it hasn’t just been one game.\n\nAgainst the Spurs, Houston opened with what might’ve been their cleanest 12 minutes of basketball all season. 36 points. 60-percent shooting. Four made threes. 11 assists on 15 made field goals. Kevin Durant and Alperen Şengün dictated everything, the ball never stuck, and the Spurs were chasing actions instead of anticipating them.\n\nSan Antonio pushed pace in the second quarter, speeding Houston up defensively. The discomfort was palpable. The Rockets still scored, but the margin disappeared. After halftime, it collapsed entirely.\n\nHouston managed just 37 points in the second half, shot under 30-percent after the break, and produced only one made three in the final two quarters. What began as organized offense turned into survival possessions, and the Spurs walked out with a 111-99 win.\n\nTwenty-four hours later in Atlanta, the halves flipped.\n\nThe Rockets looked flat early against the Hawks, opening the game 0-for-6 and shooting under 40-percent through the first two quarters. The offense lagged, the pace felt heavy, and Houston leaned on defense just to stay afloat. At halftime, the Rockets led by one despite shooting just 38.3 percent- a game that had no business being theirs.\n\nBut this time, the adjustment stuck.\n\nAfter the break, Houston seized control. The Rockets made over half of their attempts from three in the second half, drilled ten triples, and stretched the game until Atlanta ran out of answers.\n\nDurant’s gravity warped coverages even when he wasn’t scoring, freeing space for cutters and shooters. Şengün anchored possessions with patience. Amen Thompson controlled tempo without forcing anything. Houston closed the night with a 104-86 win that never felt threatened down the stretch.\n\nSame team. Same week. Two radically different endings.\n\nThat’s the tension defining this Rockets group right now. When the game is structured, Houston overwhelms teams with spacing, skill, and connective playmaking. When that structure breaks- when pace flips, counters disappear, or possessions get rushed- everything gets fragile fast.\n\nUdoka’s phrase wasn’t a throwaway. It was a diagnosis.\n\nThe Rockets don’t lack talent. They lack continuity across 48 minutes. Until the first half version and the second half version start looking like the same team, “a tale of two halves” won’t just describe one night. It'll define the team.",

He’s jumped up to 39.7% shooting from distance, and hit his 100th career 3-pointer against the Jazz Friday.\n\nIn the first quarter of Friday’s game, he shot 3 of 5 from deep and then kept it going, finishing with a career high 25 points and 10 rebounds for his first career double-double.\n\nHe finished with six 3-pointers Friday night, shooting 6 of 12.\n\nHe said there’s been no magical fix for his shot outside of just consistent work.\n\n“Shooting the ball, pretty much as simple as it is,” Dëmin said. “Just being in the gym and shooting the ball.”\n\nEgor Dёmin for 👌\n\nHe now has a 3PM in 34 consecutive games, the longest streak for ANY ROOKIE in NBA history! pic.twitter.com/tSeJUwOQGL\n\nDëmin caught up with the media ahead of Friday night’s game, and he spoke about his experience in the NBA, playing at BYU and what it’s meant to him to return to Utah.\n\n“It feels awesome. Super excited to be back here,“ Dëmin said. “Obviously, expecting a lot of BYU colors tonight. Just super grateful to be back here.”\n\nHe also said he had roughly 30 people show up for him for Friday’s game. Many of them were from his BYU circles.\n\n“It’s a lot of (the) culture about BYU,” Dëmin said. “A lot of people know how united the BYU organization is in general. Not just basketball, or just football, or whatever it is, but the whole sports together.\n\n“I’ve been lucky enough to end up in that school and gain so many friends and so many people around me who want the best for me and who I want (the) best for, so it’s just super exciting to be a part of that big BYU family.”\n\nDëmin also spoke highly of BYU head coach Kevin Young. When Young was hired by the Cougars, the main selling point was that he could turn BYU into a place where players could come to develop an NBA-level game.\n\nDëmin was the first of the Young era to make good on that claim, and he’s done so with encouraging numbers. He’s started in 34 games this year for the Nets and will be a participant in the NBA’s Rising Stars game.\n\nReppin’ Brooklyn in this year’s NBA Rising Stars Game: EGOR DËMIN 🌟 pic.twitter.com/pNOvCM95NJ\n\n— Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) January 26, 2026\n\n“He’s an NBA coach, so he taught me in this one year basically whatever I have to know to be able to play in the NBA level,” Dëmin said of Young. “Maybe not even as much of a skill set-wise, because at the end of the day, you get to the league and you just be yourself. That’s kind of the goal.\n\n“He taught a lot of knowledge, (like) that I come here and I’m ready to play, and I know what we’re doing, and I have an idea of what it is. He gave me this kind of base of an NBA player, to be able to come here and know what’s going on around me.”",

Koehler dropped the match via 20-3 technical fall, putting Nebraska in a 5-0 hole to start the dual.\n\nWith the loss, Koehler is now 10-12 on the year.\n\nIn a tough matchup against an undefeated two-time age-level World Champion in #6 Marcus Blaze, Nebraska’s #10 Jacob Van Dee dropped his third straight match.\n\nBlaze hit a nice dump for a takedown in the first period before letting his sound defensive positioning secure the win for him. Van Dee scored an escape to start the second period, but he dropped the match 5-1.\n\n133 | No. 4 Marcus Blaze with a 5-1 decision over No. 10 Jacob Van Dee pic.twitter.com/xK96brasAA\n\n— Big Ten Wrestling (@B1GWrestling) January 31, 2026\n\nBlaze had scored bonus points in 14 of his 15 wins before this match, so Van Dee and two-time NCAA finalist Drake Ayala of Iowa (4-2 decision) are now the only wrestlers to keep him to a decision.\n\nWith the loss, Van Dee is now 12-4 on the year.\n\nIn what was the match of the dual up until this point, Nebraska’s #3 Brock Hardy fell behind big in the first period when #13 Braeden Davis of Penn State took him down off the whistle and added another takedown to go up 6-2.\n\nIn the second, Davis scored an escape after Hardy cut his riding time down under a minute, but Hardy hit a late duck-under for a takedown, cutting the deficit to 7-5.\n\nAfter scoring an escape to start the third, Hardy cut the corner beautifully off a Davis low shot, putting the Nittany Lion junior on his back in a cradle for the pinfall.\n\nBROCK\nHARDY\nPIN pic.twitter.com/2KYwsBJt8g\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) January 31, 2026\n\nHardy patted Davis on the stomach after the ref slapped the Resilite, eliciting a kick from Davis that cost the Nittany Lions a team point.\n\nDavis led Hardy before being stuck in a cradle, gets mad at Hardy for cradling him. pic.twitter.com/iXKCeapMgH\n\n— The Wrestling Room (Pat Mineo) (@MrPatMineo) January 31, 2026\n\nWith the pinfall win, Hardy improved to 14-4 on the year and cut the Penn State lead to 7-6. Hardy now leads all Husker starters with 10 bonus-point wins, including a team-leading four pins.\n\nFacing off against top-ranked Shayne Van Ness of Penn State, Nebraska’s #13 Chance Lamer started strong but fell in the end.\n\nLamer hit an early go-behind to go up 3-0 in the first period — he then went up 4-1 with a second-period escape. After that, Van Ness scored a takedown in the second off a double-leg to tie the match at 4-4.\n\nIn the third, Van Ness took the lead with an escape before scoring two more takedowns to ice the match 12-5 via decision.\n\nWith the loss, Lamer is now 12-4 on the year for the Huskers.\n\nIn what was the match of the weekend in college wrestling, Nebraska’s #5 Antrell Taylor — the returning NCAA Champion at the weight — took on #2 PJ Duke of Penn State. Coming in a perfect 13-0 on the year, the Nittany Lion true freshman lost his first collegiate match to Taylor.\n\nMuch like he did against then-undefeated true freshman Landon Robideau of Oklahoma State when he was ranked #2 in December, Taylor used impressive defense and an impressive mat game to get the win in tiebreakers.\n\nBoth Taylor and Duke traded escapes in regulation, sending the match to sudden victory where they went scoreless. In the first tiebreaker, Taylor started on bottom first and scored an escape in 13 seconds to go up 2-1.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, Taylor started on top and used his body lock game to return the freshman to the mat multiple times before lifting him up and carrying him around for the final few seconds and the ride-out for the 2-1 win.\n\nThe Champ comes out on top 😤\n\nTrelly hands Duke his first loss of the season. pic.twitter.com/UnjUDDx9CY\n\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) January 31, 2026\n\nAt 157, No. 5 Antrell Taylor (Nebraska) wins 2-1 in TB ride-outs over No. 2 PJ Duke (Penn State), handing the freshman his first career NCAA loss.\n\nTaylor has now won 10 straight. pic.twitter.com/1g5ww2vn4i\n\n— Saturday Night Lights (@WrestlingSNL) January 31, 2026\n\nWith his 10th-straight win, Taylor improved to 16-2 on the year and cut the Penn State lead to 10-9 at the intermission.\n\nThis is where Penn State really took back control with its first of four straight top-ranked wrestlers. Nebraska’s #7 LJ Araujo faced #1 Mitchell Mesenbrink here and struggled to handle the National Champion’s pace.\n\nDespite showing some nice defense, even forcing a stall call on Mesenbrink in the second period, Araujo gave up five total takedowns, multiple stall calls and a riding-time point, dropping the match via 20-5 tech.\n\nWith the loss, Araujo is now 11-6 on the year.\n\nNebraska’s #4 Christopher Minto got his first career shot at #1 Levi Haines in this dual.\n\nIn the first period, Minto scored a penalty point when Haines drove him out of bounds and pushed him off the raised mat into the scoring table, a dangerous move by the Nittany Lion senior that really didn’t sit well with anyone.\n\nMan what Levi Haines just did was totally egregious!!! he must’ve been hanging out with Braeden Davis\n\n— Funky 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 (@Benaskren) January 31, 2026\n\nHaines then tied the match 1-1 with an escape to start the second period, but it was Minto who hit a re-attack on Haines for the 4-1 lead. After an escape, Haines scored a late takedown in the second to go up 5-4 going into the third and final period.\n\nMinto rolled early from bottom for an escape to tie the match early in the third, but Haines scored the deciding takedown later in the period to go up 8-5. After a Minto escape, Haines won the match 8-6 via decision, setting up an interesting potential rematch at Big Tens.\n\nWith the loss, Minto is now 14-4 on the year but showed that he’s competitive with the top guy at his weight class.\n\nFacing #1 Rocco Welsh of Penn State, Nebraska’s #6 Silas Allred was unable to get to his offense or defense at times.\n\nA former NCAA finalist, Welsh took Allred down four times in a 14-5 win via major decision, pushing the Penn State lead to 22-9.\n\nWith the loss, Allred is now 12-6 on the year.\n\nFacing an opponent in #1 Josh Barr who has teched him twice in his career, Nebraska’s #10 Camden McDanel struggled but showed late that he doesn’t quit.\n\nBarr took down McDanel four times in the first period before adding an escape and a takedown in the second to go up 16-4. Hunting for the tech in the third, Barr cut McDanel for an escape before scoring his sixth takedown, but it was McDanel who answered with a low shot for a takedown, cutting the deficit to 19-9.\n\nIn the end, McDanel fell 21-9 via major decision, but him getting that late takedown against someone as good as Barr was encouraging.\n\nMcDanel is now 14-5 on the year with the loss.\n\nAt heavyweight, Nebraska’s #4 AJ Ferrari took the mat against Penn State’s #9 Cole Mirasola.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, Ferrari escaped quickly to start the second period to go up 1-0. Ferrari then put on a hard ride in the third, locking up the riding-time point before surrendering a late escape, earning the 2-1 decision win with the riding-time point.\n\nFerrari is now 9-2 on the year with multiple wins over top opponents — guys ranked #5, #7, #9, #10, and #12. His two losses have come against #3 Nick Feldman of Ohio State.",

    "fullText": "The Buffs have remained aggressive in the portal, so here’s a top five you need to know right now. We’ll count down from No. 5 to No. 1 and hit why each addition fits, and how they raise the floor this fall.\n\nLefau is a senior transfer from Texas who comes to Boulder looking to revitalize the Buffs pass rush. He posted 26 tackles and 1 sack last year, and more importantly spent time in one of the best pass rushing groups in the nation. That experience matters for a defense that will be rebuilt front to back. His veteran voice and habits are vital for a unit that has started slow in recent seasons because so many portal additions had to gel at once. Experience is the point here, and it is going to be key across the entire defense.\n\nYes, the name and backstory drew headlines, but the on-field production backs it up. Lampron is a journeyman senior who tallied 65 tackles, 2.5 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles last season for Bowling Green. The origin story matters too, as Lampron randomly ran into Coach Prime on a plane a few months ago and gave coach his pitch. Prime’s staff did the homework, and Lampron had an offer before they even deboarded. With the Buffs staring at a completely new defensive unit next season; Lampron brings toughness, proven production, and immediate special teams value to steady that transition.\n\nScudero arrives in Boulder after turning in one of the best sophomore campaigns in the country with nearly 1,300 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. At 5’9, 175, he wins with agility, quickness, and crisp route running. In Brennan Marion’s system he’s a plug-and-play starting slot, the kind of chain-mover who keeps JuJu on schedule and punishes single coverage. He is also one of the most talented portal additions Boulder has seen in the last few years, so there is no reason to think he won’t be on the field from the first series in the fall.\n\nCarter arrives from Tennessee, a hometown Vol who had a real path to playing time in the SEC, which tells you the offer to come to Boulder was serious, and for good reason. He was ranked the No. 5 safety in the transfer portal and his tape backs it up. Last season he played like a ball magnet, forcing three fumbles and breaking up three passes. For a Buffs team that has struggled to force turnovers, and just lost turnover-creator Tawfiq Byard, Carter was a must-sign for Deion Sanders. He has two years of eligibility left, but may need to produce immediately in a playmaking-needy back end.\n\nA St. John Bosco grad, Moore comes to Boulder with one year of eligibility and a top-ten transfer grade (No. 8 in the portal). At Texas he stacked just under 1,000 yards and 11 touchdowns across the last two seasons as a starting wideout. His 6’0, 190 frame is not about freak measurables, as it is the ideal all-purpose receiver body that lets Brennan Marion fit him seamlessly into the Go-Go offense. After the departures of Omarion Miller, Sincere Brown, and others, Moore is expected to have the biggest season of any incoming transfer. Personally, I think he profiles as the X reciever, where he’ll be expected to win outside the numbers, on slants, digs, comebacks, and posts. Moore has the experience, production, and frame to be JuJu Lewis’s No. 1 target come September.",

    "title": "On This Day (31st Jan 2015): Defoe Gets Off The Mark In A Sunderland Shirt!",
    "description": "New Sunderland signing Jermain Defoe notched his first goal for his new team after returning from the MLS!",
    "fullText": "In a victory that Sunderland manager Gus Poyet described as ‘much needed’, new Sunderland signing Jermain Defoe got off the mark for his new club after his January move from Toronto FC.\n\nSunderland had been struggling for goals throughout the season where they had become quite the draw specialists and the club knew that something had to change in the second half of the season if they wanted to avoid struggling again near the bottom of the table.\n\nThe signing of the England international was a clear signal of intent from the club and with Jozy Altidore going in the opposite direction, it was almost a no-brainer.\n\nWith one win at the Stadium of Light up until this point of the season, a victory at home was much sought after and almost a necessity given the fact that Burnley would have been perceived as one of the more ‘winnable’ encounters at home.\n\nIt didn’t help that the Stadium of Light was not the fortress then as it is now and with the crowd somewhat on edge, a goal was required to energise the home faithful.\n\nThankfully, this arrived within the first twenty minutes through the man who everyone thought was going to kick on and be the main man, Connor Wickham. Wickham had struggled to really take the mantle of Sunderland’s main centre-forward after his exploits at the end of the previous season but his goal gave them the lead here to give him only his third of the season.\n\nSebastian Larsson’s strength and vision created the opening for Anthony Réveillère to send over a perfect cross for Wickham, who headed back across the scrambling Tom Heaton and into the far corner.\n\nThis goal appeared to energise and also calm a fragile fanbase at the same time only days after Poyet had suggested there was a ‘missed connection’ between players and supporters at the stadium.\n\nAny concerns that the fans had dissipated even further as the new signing Defoe got off the mark for his new club with one of the easiest finishes he will ever have.\n\nJordi Gómez sprung the offside trap with a cute lofted pass to the advanced Van Aanholt, who controlled and picked out Defoe to apply a simple finish.\n\nAfter this, it was relatively comfortable for the home side against Sean Dyche’s team as Sunderland kept the Clarets at bay with ease. The win saw the team go four points clear of the drop zone and after the game Defoe expressed his delight at getting off the mark in his new surroundings.\n\n“It was important that we got the win today. It was a massive win. We created a lot of chances, the fans were fantastic. The energy from start to finish was fantastic. We managed to get the early goal which helped us, settled us down.\n\n“The Premier League is the best in the world and that’s where you want to be. I feel like I have a lot of goals left in me.”\n\nThe signing of Defoe would prove to be a masterstroke over the next couple of years as his goals would end up being vital towards Sunderland’s survival in the division. All of this would come after a spell where Dick Advocaat tried to turn him into a right winger!",

    "description": "“At the end of the day, the fans care about staying in the Premier League and this has to have been the best season most can remember. So it’s thanks to those who got us here, but it’s time for the baton to be passed on,” writes Nic Wiseman.",
    "fullText": "With the current transfer window seemingly being used to ship players surplus to requirements, the news that Aji Alese has joined Portsmouth on loan prompted me to take a look at a typical team from last season and see how they have fared this year.\n\nTo do this, I dipped into my box of programmes and fished one out at random. And the game in question is Derby away on 21 January, which was a midweek game on a dank Tuesday night.\n\nWe had just had the chastening experience at Burnley the preceding Friday night, where Wilson Isidor failed to score two penalties in injury time.\n\nWe won the game at Derby 1-0 thanks to an Eliezer Mayenda goal in the 28th minute and Wilson inexplicably had a goal struck off, for reasons nobody was able to fathom. Even the scoreboard took ages to revert from 0-2 back to 0-1.\n\nThe team that night was: Patterson, Cirkin, O’Nien, Mepham, Hume, Le Fée, Jobe, Neil, Rigg, Isidor, Mayenda.\n\nRoberts replaced Mayenda and Ballard, Cirkin on 74 minutes; Abdul Samed replaced Rigg on 86 minutes and Leo Hjelde came on for Le Fée on 89.\n\nIt was only the second time Régis Le Bris had listened to my pleas for 4-4-2 all season. As it had worked so well against Sheffield United on New Year’s Day, I was desperate to see it again. The only memorable thing about the game was how stultifyingly boring it was. Pride Park is situated in the middle of a soulless industrial estate and there was no pub near that I could find.\n\nThe combined number of appearances that team (including used substitutes) have made this season is 119. Which ticks up to 132 if you include all players who played last season.\n\nThe departures of Dan Neil and Aji Alese this week have triggered much hand-wringing about the fact that these hard workers have been ruthlessly jettisoned this season in order to ensure we maintain our position in the Premier League. But the cold, hard facts are that these players haven’t been good enough to play in the Premier League. In fact you could say that the club has done well by the players in allowing them to go off on loan to showcase their talents. Especially in the case of Dan Neil, who has been allowed to go off to Ipswich on loan, until his contract winds down.\n\nThe trio who have stepped up from last season’s side are Enzo Le Fée, Dan Ballard and Trai Hume. All could be considered first-team regulars this season and make up just under half the total appearances from last year’s team. Le Fée was bought from Roma in Italy’s Serie A in the January transfer window and was brought in on loan as a statement with half an eye on us being in the Premier League this season. He is a bit of an outlier in this analysis.\n\nJenson Seelt can consider himself to be unlucky, as he made an assured debut against West Ham on the first day of the season, only to be injured in the second half and replaced by Omar Alderete. He was subsequently shipped out on loan to German side Wolfsburg.\n\nOf the team involved that night, two returned to their parent clubs from loan: Mepham and Abdul Samed; Roberts and Neil have been loaned out, seven have started matches this season and two (including Neil) have come on from the subs bench.\n\nTo be honest, more have been involved this season than I expected, with seven making more than ten appearances this season.\n\nThe club do seem to be doing well by those players as they look to find pastures new. Which will enhance the club’s reputation as looking after players’ interests.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the fans care about staying in the Premier League and this has to have been the best season most can remember. So it’s thanks to those who got us here, but it’s time for the baton to be passed on.\n\nThose who played last season, but not at Derby",

The answer is: There's nothing about who she might be dating right now. So it seems like she's single.\n\nYou may have heard or read about a relationship with her coach, Stefano Vukov. The Athletic has an extensive report on an investigation into Vukov's behavior as her coach that led to a suspension, with \"Rybakina [telling] multiple sources in attendance at her recent events that her relationship with him had become personal and romantic.\"\n\nHe was suspended in January of 2025 while the WTA investigated him before he was reinstated in August. Then? Here's more from ESPN:\n\nRybakina announced before last year's US Open that Vukov would no longer be her coach but then said before the Australian Open that he would be rejoining her team.

    "fullText": "Even a quarter of Stephen Curry is a high cost for the Golden State Warriors these days.\n\nThe Warriors star exited Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons early with right knee soreness, finishing with a team-high 23 points on 7-of-16 shooting (4-of-10 from 3-point range). After the game, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said he didn't believe Curry's knee injury was \"anything major,\" but the team will know more on Saturday.\n\nCurry went to the locker room near the end of the third quarter, grimacing and limping slightly after some awkward contact on an and-1. He remained in the locker room at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and the Warriors soon ruled him out for the rest of the game.\n\nAnd that's an AND-ONE\n\n📺 @NBCSAuthentic pic.twitter.com/OFR7kYte2V\n\n— Golden State Warriors (@warriors) January 31, 2026\n\nThe Warriors managed to hang around despite Curry's injury, cutting the deficit to three points midway through the fourth quarter, but ended up losing 131-124 to the East-leading Pistons.\n\n[\nCurry had been dealing with a knee issue over the course of this week. He reportedly first felt something in his knee on Saturday and was listed as questionable with right knee soreness for Sunday's game, but still played that day. However, he did miss Monday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers, the second leg of a back-to-back.\n\nHe went on to play 28 minutes against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday and didn't carry an injury designation going into Friday's game, but clearly the injury resurfaced.\n\nAs usual, a significant Curry injury would be the last thing the Warriors need right now. The team is still learning how to navigate life without Jimmy Butler, who was knocked out for the season by a torn ACL last week.\n\nFriday's loss means Golden State is now 2-4 since Butler's injury, with losses to the Toronto Raptors and Dallas Mavericks. For now, they remain in eighth place in the Western Conference at 27-33, with a 3.5 game cushion to avoid the second play-in game.",

    "fullText": "Saturday’s NBA slate packs in six games with playoff energy and clear betting angles. From Charlotte’s hot streak against San Antonio to Houston hosting an injury-hit Dallas side, every matchup has a story behind it. Some teams rely on rebounding, others on star scorers, and a few are just trying to survive tough stretches. Here is a closer look at who holds the edge and why these games matter. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Spectrum Center, Charlotte\n\nCharlotte enters this game riding a five-game winning streak. The Hornets have been strong on the glass, ranking near the top of the East in rebounding at 45.7 per game. Moussa Diabate leads them with 8.4 rebounds. San Antonio also rebounds well at 46.3 per game, with Luke Kornet setting the pace.\n\nVictor Wembanyama continues to anchor the Spurs with 24.3 points and 11.2 rebounds per game. Miles Bridges leads Charlotte at 18.5 points, while Brandon Miller has averaged 23.4 points over the last 10 games.\n\nRecent form favors Charlotte slightly. Over the last 10 games, the Hornets average 116.5 points and allow only 107.4. San Antonio has scored 110.7 in the same span. Home momentum and the +4.5 line make Charlotte the safer side.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Indianapolis\n\nIndiana struggles in blowout games and owns an 8-24 record in the East. Still, the Pacers play closer games at home. Andrew Nembhard averages 17.4 points and 7.4 assists, while Pascal Siakam has scored 20.8 per game over the last 10.\n\nAtlanta is 12-17 against conference teams and recently beat Indiana 132-116. Onyeka Okongwu leads the Hawks with 16.3 points and 7.9 rebounds. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has added 19.7 points per game over the last 10.\n\nThe Pacers shoot only 44.3 percent this season, but Atlanta allows 47.5 percent to opponents. With a short spread and home court edge, Indiana has a narrow path to control the pace.\n\nPredicted winner: Indiana Pacers\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nNew Orleans comes in at 12-37 and allows 121.2 points per game. Defense has been the main issue. The Pelicans still rebound well at 44 per game and force nearly 15 turnovers. Zion Williamson remains their focal point, averaging 21 points in the last outing with 11 rebounds.\n\nPhiladelphia is 25-21 and just beat Milwaukee 139-122. Paul George scored 32 in that win. The 76ers average 116.6 points but sit near the bottom of the league in shooting efficiency at 45.8 percent.\n\nThe Pelicans allow 48.3 percent shooting, which keeps games close late. A large spread gives New Orleans room to stay competitive even if they do not lead for long stretches.\n\nPredicted winner: New Orleans Pelicans\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nMinnesota holds a 29-19 record and ranks fifth in scoring at 119 points per game. Julius Randle just dropped 31 points in a win over Dallas. The Timberwolves shoot 48.1 percent and allow only 114.1 points.\n\nMemphis sits at 18-27 and struggles offensively at 45.4 percent shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 26 in the last game, but team rebounding remains an issue. The Grizzlies were outworked on the boards by Charlotte in their last loss.\n\nThe Timberwolves force turnovers and defend the three well at 35.2 percent allowed. With better balance on both ends, Minnesota should control the matchup.\n\nPredicted winner: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nChicago enters after three straight losses but still averages 118.7 points over the last 10 games. Nikola Vucevic posts 17 points and 9.1 rebounds, while Coby White leads fast-break scoring.\n\nMiami has gone 6-4 in its last 10 and scores 121.3 points per game in that span. Bam Adebayo averages 18 points and shoots 44.5 percent. The Heat won the last meeting 116-113.\n\nThe Bulls shoot 47.6 percent this season, slightly higher than what Miami allows. With a +5.5 line, Chicago can stay within range even if Miami controls the fourth quarter.\n\nPredicted winner: Chicago Bulls\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nDallas is 19-29 and missing key players like Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis. Cooper Flagg has been productive, but the Mavericks give up 116.7 points per game.\n\nHouston stands at 29-17 and thrives when limiting turnovers. Kevin Durant averages 26.5 points, while Alperen Sengun adds steady scoring inside. The Rockets allow only 110 points per game, which ranks among the league’s best marks.\n\nDallas won the last meeting, but the injury list has grown. Houston’s defense and depth give them a strong edge at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nThese six games shape a busy Saturday card. Charlotte and Indiana look strong at home. Minnesota and Houston hold the clearest advantages. New Orleans and Chicago bring value due to large spreads. Each matchup carries a different style of play, which should make January 31 a full night of competitive basketball.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 31: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The South Sevier Sensations are the queens of the 2A drill mountain once again.\n\nAfter back-to-back runner-up finishes the past two years, South Sevier dominated the 2A field at UVU on Friday night, sweeping all three categories en route to the title.\n\nDuchesne, which bested South Sevier each of the past two seasons, finished runner-up in all three categories this year behind the Sensations.\n\n“This team’s drive to set high goals and to break both individual and team barriers is what sets them apart and makes this season so special,” said South Sevier coach Deidre Jenkins.\n\nJenkins said her team’s favorite routine this year was in Dance, to Queen’s “Somebody to Love.”\n\n“The unique style of this song allowed our girls to express their passion for dance and each other,” said Jenkins.\n\nThe championship was the 14th in school history for South Sevier, which won eight straight from 2014-2021, the third-longest streak in state history.\n\nSouth Sevier’s last state title came in 2023, when this year’s seniors were freshmen.\n\n“(The seniors) were determined to set the bar high and push themselves and their team to break through some barriers that had been holding them back since their last championship,” said Jenkins.\n\nIt showed in the regular season as South Sevier went into the 2A state tournament with a perfect 1.0 RPI ranking after finishing first in their competitions and first in region.\n\nThis year’s South Sevier team members are: Ellieanna Bennett, Rachel Child, Kynlee Goble, Bella Hansen, Valarie Hansen, Jozie Hutchings, Layla Jenkins, Jada Jenkins, Makenna Jolley, Allie Keele, Kesslee Keele, Laityn King, Emma Knaphus, Landree Larsen, Halle McKinlay, Bliss Melville, MaCall Monroe, Amilyn Morrill, Briar Palmer, Hadlee Parsons, Violet Parsons, Madison Phelps, Emma Pieper, Paysley Pieper, Allison Riddle, Madison Riddle, Saylor Riddle, Sayla Smith, Matti Sorensen, Kessler Staples, Prezlee Tobler, Gracie Winegar, Eva Wirick and Tessa Woolsey.\n\nAssistant coaches along with Jenkins are Lisa Shaver and Shauna Blake.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) revised its Starlink privacy policy to allow the use of customer data for AI training, a shift that ​could bolster Elon Musk's AI ambitions.\n\nAhead of a blockbuster IPO planned for later this year, ‌SpaceX is in talks to merge with Musk’s AI company, xAI (XAAI.PVT), a deal first reported by Reuters on Thursday. SpaceX, already the ‌world’s most valuable private company, could reach a value of more than $1 trillion after the IPO.\n\nWhat are privacy experts' concerns about Starlink's policy changes?\n\nWhat changes did SpaceX make to Starlink's privacy policy?\n\nHow could the SpaceX-xAI merger impact AI development?\n\nWhat data does Starlink collect from its users?\n\nStarlink updated its Global Privacy Policy on January 15, according to the Starlink website. The policy includes new details stating that unless a user opts out, Starlink data may be used “to train our machine learning or artificial intelligence ⁠models” and could be shared with ‌the company’s service providers and “third-party collaborators,” without providing further details.\n\nA previous version of the privacy policy, an archived version from November and reviewed by Reuters, did not ‍contain language about AI training on Starlink data.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStarlink collects vast amounts of user data, spanning location information, credit card information, contact information and user IP ​addresses. It also collects so-called communication data, which includes audio and visual information, data in shared ‌files, and “inferences we may make from other personal information we collect,” according to its global privacy policy.\n\nThe policy did not make clear exactly what data would be used to train AI. The move has raised concerns among privacy advocates and consumer rights groups, which argue that using personal data to train AI risks expanding surveillance and creates new avenues for misuse.\n\n“It certainly raises my eyebrow and would make ⁠me concerned if I was a Starlink user,” said Anupam ​Chander, a technology law professor at Georgetown University. “Often there's perfectly ​legitimate uses of your data, but it doesn’t have a clear limit to what kind of uses it will be put to.”\n\nMusk's xAI, most recently valued at $230 billion ‍after a recent funding round, ⁠is currently developing its Grok LLM chatbot and also owns X, the social media platform.\n\nThe potential merger with xAI would turbocharge the space company’s deployment of AI-powered services, while giving xAI ⁠vast new data sets to train its models on, including communication data. Starlink, a network of more than 9,000 satellites, ‌currently provides internet connection to more than 9 million users.",

    "description": "Global Entry and Precheck revoked three days after incident, court filing says.",
    "fullText": "Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a declaration filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.\n\nCleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”\n\nCleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.\n\n“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”\n\nCleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a Boston Globe column about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.\n\nCleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:\n\nI logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”\n\nI had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.\n\nCleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.\n\n“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”\n\nCleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”\n\nWe contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.\n\nFederal agents have made extensive use of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from Clearview AI and a face-scanning app called Mobile Fortify. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.\n\n“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times reported today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.\n\nICE also uses a variety of other technologies, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and Palantir software to help identify potential deportation targets.\n\nAlthough Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.\n\n“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Friday asked Chinese battery company Gotion Inc to ​return $23.7 million in state funds the company received after the ‌company last year abandoned a plan to build a $2.4 billion plant in Michigan to ‌produce key materials for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nThe plan, first announced in October 2022, was expected to create 2,350 factory jobs but came under criticism from some lawmakers for the company's Chinese ownership. Gotion did not immediately ⁠respond to a request ‌for comment.\n\nNessel's office said in a letter to Gotion that it was in default on its agreement and ‍not resolved the issues. It gave Gotion 30 days to repay the funds.\n\nThe Michigan Economic Development Corporation said last year none of a separate $125 million state ​grant for the project was ever disbursed and said Gotion had ‌abandoned the project. Gotion denied that but lawyers for the company said in a court filing earlier this month the project \"is no longer viable.\"\n\nGermany's Volkswagen is the largest single shareholder in Gotion Inc's parent company, owning about 30% of Gotion High-Tech (002074.SZ). U.S. lawmakers said last year ⁠China maintains \"effective control\" through multiple individual shareholders.\n\nGotion ​said last year the firm \"remains firmly committed ​to its mission of driving America's clean energy future\" including at a plant in Illinois.\n\nIn March 2024, Gotion sued ‍Green Township in ⁠Michigan for allegedly breaching an agreement to build the plant.\n\nOver the last year, Americans' waning enthusiasm for electric cars led automakers ⁠to delay or scrap numerous factory and vehicle projects.

    "title": "The Trump Administration Arrested Don Lemon Like He Was a Fugitive Slave",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "Lemon’s arrest is not only a clear violation of the First Amendment but also a blatant throwback to the Constitution’s long-discarded Fugitive Slave Clause.\n\nThe Department of Justice arrested two journalists, Don Lemon, and Georgia Fort, in connection with their coverage of a protest that took place inside a church in St. Paul, Minnesota on January 18. The DOJ also arrested two activists, Trahern Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy, for their role in the protest. All four of the people arrested are Black.\n\nThe arrests of the two journalists are clearly unconstitutional. You don’t need to be a legal scholar to know that arresting journalists for covering the news is a clear violation of the First Amendment. Lemon’s arrest is also flatly illegal. Last week, the Trump administration went to a federal magistrate judge, Douglas L. Micko, to ask for an arrest warrant for Lemon. The judge refused. The Trump administration then appealed and lost that appeal. The legal system literally said the government couldn’t arrest Lemon, but the government arrested him anyway, and they went all the way to Los Angeles (far from Minnesota) to get him.\n\nGeorgia Fort is a prominent Black journalist based in Minnesota. She was out front in covering the George Floyd protests, and expertly covered the trial of his killer, Derek Chauvin. I have little doubt that this prior reporting is among the reasons she was targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nI know less about the activists: Crews is a cofounder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, while Lundy works in the Hennepin County Attorney’s office and recently announced his candidacy for the Minnesota state Senate. I also know that arresting people for protesting is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nIn her tweet proclaiming the arrests, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the four were arrested “at my direction.” Later reports suggested that the DOJ empaneled a federal grand jury that issued the arrest warrants for Lemon and Fort, but didn’t explain the cause for arresting Crews and Lundy. Going to a grand jury to get an arrest warrant that a judge and appeals court previously denied on constitutional grounds is highly unusual in a democracy, but I guess it’s how the fascists play the game.\n\nI expect, at a minimum, that the arrests of Lemon and Fort will be thrown out in court eventually, since at least one of them already has been. I think the more important question is why all four of these Black people were arrested. To answer that question, we should start with the White House’s official tweet about Lemon’s arrest. They tweeted out: “When life gives you lemons…” followed by a chain emoji. This ties the arrest of Lemon to this country’s history of slavery in a way no sane person will miss.\n\nThe arrest of Lemon harks back to a discarded portion of our original Constitution: the Fugitive Slave Clause. That clause read: “No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.” It’s relevant because the Fugitive Slave Clause counteracted a different amendment in the Constitution, the 10th, which explicitly reserves all “police power” to the states.\n\nTo put it simply, the 10th Amendment says that states are in charge of deciding whom they need to arrest, but the Fugitive Slave Clause says the federal government can violate the 10th Amendment—if they need to capture Black people. Fundamentally, that is what’s happened to Lemon. The federal government has superseded the constitutional authority of Minnesota so that it can arrest a Black man who got away. And we know that’s how they’re thinking, because they’re using literal chain emojis to congratulate themselves on their accomplishment.\n\nWhat we’re seeing is an obvious attempt to change the face of the victims of Trump’s fascism. I believe the Trump administration always assumed that the people on the front lines of the resistance to their tactics would be Black and brown. They assumed that the people who would be getting brutalized in the streets and shot and killed would be people of color. They did not assume that the victim of their brutality would be a white man who was a nurse for veterans. They did not assume it would be a white woman with children’s plushies in her glove compartment.\n\nArresting Black journalists and activists, and using explicit slavery imagery while doing it, is an attempt to inflame the Black community and remind white folks who the real targets are. Support for ICE and the Trump administration generally is falling among white folks. Trump wants to remind those white folks that he’s really just trying to arrest dangerous Black people.\n\nTrump and Steven Miller want a race war. They think they’ll win it. They think white people will tune in for it. Their operating theory is that most white people are viciously racist, like they are, and that most whites secretly pine to live in apartheid South Africa.\n\nI don’t think they’re right—and I say that as a person who is not known to have a particularly high opinion of the moral clarity of white Americans. My read has always been that most white people in this country are like most people who eat meat in this country: they want to enjoy a good steak, but they don’t want to go to a slaughterhouse and put a bolt gun in a cow. White people enjoy their privilege, but they don’t exactly want to see how their privilege gets made.\n\nArresting a journalist like Lemon—who is not only “Black famous” like Fort is but crossover famous among white folks—is as likely to inflame the white community as it is to inflame the Black community. Lemon got arrested last night while covering the Grammys, of all things, not the Image Awards.\n\nThe arrests of the journalists cannot hold up legally. (The arrests of the activists shouldn’t hold up legally either, as Bondi is claiming the activist violated the First Amendment rights of churchgoers while Bondi is violating the First Amendment rights of protesters.) It is a shredding of the First Amendment that I don’t think even Trump’s plants on the Supreme Court can stand for (except for Clarence Thomas, who is probably titillated about the opportunity to use the Fugitive Slave Clause as the basis for his dissenting opinion from the more sane members of the court). I also don’t think the arrests will hold up socially. I don’t think they will change the narrative in the way Trump and Miller probably hope it will.\n\nOf course, the road to bad takes is paved with a reliance on white people to do the right thing. I don’t think this will work, legally or culturally, but I’ll need white people to prove me right.",

    "description": "Tisch's name came up in hundreds of emails in the latest round of Epstein Files datasets.",
    "fullText": "Emails between New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch and convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein are among the millions of documents released by the Justice Department on Friday.\n\nIn many of the emails, Epstein discusses setting up Tisch with various women. All of the women's names are redacted out, as is Tisch's email address.\n\nThe Giants released a statement from Tisch later Friday, describing their relationship as brief and Epstein as a terrible person:\n\n\"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments. I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.\"\n\nThe emails are mostly from 2013, five years after Epstein was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution. There is also one exchange from 2017 in which Tisch tells Epstein he was talking \"fondly\" about him with a friend and wants to \"stay in touch.\" Epstein was charged with sex trafficking minors in 2019 and died in his cell a month later from what investigators ruled as a suicide.\n\nIn another email exchange with the subject line \"Ukrainian Girl,\" Tisch asks \"pro or civilian?\" about a woman he met through Epstein, to which Epstein responds \"do you want to know if she as sweet as she seems? boyfriends? trustworthy, etc. she is earnest. is a civilian, but russian, and rarely tells the full truth , but fun.\"\n\nEpstein then sends a second reply, saying \"send me a number to call I dont like records of these conversations.\" He later tells Tisch he \"did very well\" with an acquaintance, who is \"a little freaked by the age difference.\"\n\nA different conversation has Tisch outright asking if one woman, described by Epstein as \"tahitian\" and \"exotic,\" is a \"working girl.\"\n\nThere are more conversations, such as when Tisch asks if he \"can expect 'trouble'\" while discussing a visit to Epstein's house. Epstein responds by offering to invite \"the russain [sic],\" to which Tisch asks \"Is she fun?\"\n\nAt other times, the two make plans for Epstein to attend a Giants game in Tisch's suite. Epstein also invites Tisch to his now-infamous Caribbean island, which Tisch says he never visited.\n\nThere is one email in which Tisch introduces himself to a woman and states \"Jeffrey Epstein is very excited about you and I meeting each other I like that idea Do you?\" He later adds \"Your picture is great!\"\n\nOverall, the name \"Steve Tisch\" yields 440 results when searching the online Epstein Library, though many of those are calendar entries and different emails from the same conversation.\n\nTisch is the son of Preston Robert Tisch, who purchased a 50% stake of the Mara family in 1991 and died in 2005. He officially holds the title of Giants chairman and has also worked for decades as a Hollywood producer. Among his credits are \"Risky Business,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" \"American History X\" and the \"Equalizer\" series.\n\nAmong his projects currently in the works is \"Madden,\" the Nicolas Cage-starring biopic of legendary coach and broadcast John Madden.",

    "description": "Michael Knox runs a restaurant near Minneapolis. He said employees are afraid to come in, and even his regular customers have been absent.",
    "fullText": "A small business owner near Minneapolis said both staff and customers fear ICE activity in the area.\n\nHe's concerned about the safety of his employees, who sometimes miss shifts to avoid immigration officers.\n\nNational activists are encouraging another economic blackout to protest ICE activity.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.\n\nWith ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?\n\nIt's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.\n\nSome of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is \"no questions asked.\" I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.\n\nWe're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee affected by ICE in your area? Reach out to this reporter at allisonkelly@businessinsider.com or via Signal at alliekelly.10. Here's our guide to sharing information securely.\n\nI worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.\n\nLast week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.\n\nI went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.\n\nWhat's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.\n\nSmall business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.",

    "title": "Greg Biffle plane crash: NTSB report indicates Biffle wasn't flying plane, co-pilot 'was not qualified' to fly the Cessna Citation 550",
    "description": "Biffle and the six other occupants of the plane were killed when it crashed attempting to land back at Statesville Regional Airport on Dec. 18.",
    "fullText": "The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report into the plane crash that killed former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, his family and three others determined that Biffle was not flying the plane owned by his GB Aviation Leasing LLC company when it crashed on Dec. 18.\n\nPer the report released Friday, the plane was flown by Dennis Dutton, a pilot certified to operate numerous commercial aircraft, with his son Jack, in the right cockpit seat. Biffle, a licensed pilot with “civil flight experience that included over 3,500 hours of flight time,” was seated behind the two and is identified as the rear passenger in the report.\n\nHowever, neither Biffle nor Jack Dutton were licensed to fly the Cessna Citation. The report notes that Dennis Dutton was licensed to fly the Citation with a second-in-command on board, and even though Jack Dutton was a pilot himself he “was not qualified to perform second in command duties for the flight,” according to the NTSB, as he had just over 175 hours of single-engine aircraft experience.\n\nAero Consulting Experts CEO Ross Aimer told Yahoo Sports that Jack Dutton’s lack of qualification was “troublesome” and said the plane required two pilots.\n\n“In this particular case, because it requires two pilots, and neither of those — Biffle or the young man — were qualified, they should have had a licensed pilot in that seat,” Aimer said.\n\nBiffle, his wife Cristina, their son Ryder, Biffle’s daughter Emma, Dennis and Jack Dutton and Craig Wadsworth were aboard the plane as it attempted to land at Statesville (North Carolina) Regional Airport shortly after taking off from the same airport. They were flying to Sarasota, Florida.\n\nThe Cessna Citation 550 is a dual-engine aircraft, and the report states that issues with the plane started before the flight began. Here are the key takeaways from the NTSB’s findings.\n\nThe left engine initially did not start before both engines were powered on at approximately 9:53 a.m. ET. As the plane was taxiing for takeoff “the pilot and the two pilot-rated passengers discussed that a thrust reverser indicator light(s) for an unspecified engine was inoperative, but that the thrust reverser for the affected engine was working properly.”\n\nThe plane took off at approximately 10:06 a.m. “During takeoff roll, the rear passenger commented that the left engine was producing more power than the right and indicated there may have been a faulty gauge. The pilot continued the takeoff.” The report states that it was overcast at approximately 5,000 feet for the entirety of the flight, though visibility dropped from 10 miles to five miles from 9:54 to 10:15.\n\nEarly GPS data shows that the plane turned left as it climbed and that Dennis Dutton said he’d fly under visual flight rules before he was cleared to fly under instrument flight rules. After a 180-degree turn and reached 2,200 feet, it “continued to turn left and began to descend. The right-seat passenger attempted to contact” air traffic control “and activate the flight’s IFR flight plan between 10:08 and 10:10 but was unsuccessful due to the controller’s workload and associated radio communications.\n\nAt 10:09, Dennis Dutton and Biffle discussed climbing higher even though they were supposed to continue flying under visual flight rules. The report states that “the pilot initiated a climb, and shortly after, the rear passenger noted a difference between the left and right engine interstage turbine temperature indications.” There were no other discussions that covered the instruments throughout the remainder of the [cockpit voice recorder] recording” and the autopilot disengaged — either intentionally or independently — just after 10:10.\n\nSeconds later, “the cockpit area microphone captured the pilot making remarks indicating his altitude indicator was not working properly and that additional left side flight instruments may not have been working properly.” The Garmin GPS on board had stopped recording airspeed data and heading data at around that time.\n\nAt 10:11 “airplane controls was transferred to the right seat passenger, at an altitude of about 4,500 ft msl.” At 10:13, the plane was at just under 1,900 feet and that all three said they could see the ground. “Although a positive transfer of airplane control was not recorded, subsequent communication between the pilot and right seat passenger was consistent with the pilot having resumed control of the airplane at that time.” At just after 10:13, the pilot turned the plane right towards the west and requested that the landing gear be extended. “Subsequent discussions were consistent with the landing gear being configured, however, the gear indicator lights were not illuminated.”\n\nJack Dutton noted just before 10:14 on the common traffic advisory frequency that they were “having some issues here.” Biffle references power to an alternator — the Cessna Citation 550 does not have an alternator. After a brief audio quality issue with the cockpit voice recorder, Dennis Dutton is heard saying there was a “problem” but did not specify what the problem was “or what actions were taken to correct it.”\n\nThe GPS data resumed recording just after 10:14 and Dennis Dutton “made comments which indicated he had acquired the runway visually” around 10:15. Data from the GPS “showed that the airplane’s airspeed and altitude continued to decrease from the time the airplane was aligned on final approach to the runway until 10:15:18” when the airplane’s altitude had dipped below 1,000 feet and under 99 KTS.\n\nThe plane hit a light station approximately 1,400 feet from the runway threshold and “a group of damaged trees located about 235 feet” from that light station “were sheared about 12 feet above ground level. “The first indication of fire was blackened branches and grass near the west side of the trees.”\n\n“A ground impression was observed about 350 feet from the [light station], near the airport perimeter fence, and extended through the [runway lights]. The debris path continued along a westerly heading through the runway overrun to where the main wreckage came to rest on the runway blast area about 400 feet short of the runway 28 threshold.” “Heavy charring” was seen from a second set of lights “and continued along the remaining length of the debris field to the wreckage.”\n\nThe engines remained attached to the plane after it came to a stop and both thrust reversers were in the stowed position. Investigators found “no evidence of unconfined engine failure with either engine. Examination of the cockpit throttle quadrant found both thrust levers to be in the full forward position and both reverse throttle levers in the down position, consistent with being stowed.”\n\nBiffle competed for 16 full or part-time seasons in NASCAR’s Cup Series from 2002 through 2022. He raced full-time in the Cup Series from 2003 through 2016 and scored 19 wins and 92 top-five finishes over 515 career starts.\n\nHis best season came in 2005, when he finished second to Tony Stewart in the points standings. Biffle’s six wins were the most of anyone in the Cup Series that season and his average finish of 11.9 was second only to Stewart.\n\nBiffle is one of just two drivers to have won both a championship in the third-tier NASCAR Truck Series and the second-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series.",

    "description": "The tons of carp were removed from the Kansas River over several years, including a record 36,000 pounds of invasive fish in 2025",
    "fullText": "Kansas officials say invasive carp removed from the Kansas River are used for nutrient recycling\n\nMore than 109,000 pounds of carp have been removed from the river since 2022, including a record 36,000 pounds in 2025\n\nThe effort is part of a broader regional push to remove over 20 million pounds of invasive carp annually\n\nKansas wildlife officials are shedding new light on what happens after invasive carp are pulled from the Kansas River — a question that has followed the removal of more than 100,000 pounds of fish from the waterway over the past four years.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, a spokesperson from the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP) revealed that the invasive Asian carp removed during ongoing management efforts are returned to the river system as part of a \"nutrient recycling process.\" The agency's spokesperson said the fish are returned to the river to decompose naturally, allowing the nutrients stored in their bodies to reenter the ecosystem.\n\n\"This allows the fish to decompose naturally and ensures the nutrients stored in the fish's body are returned to the river ecosystem,\" explained the KDWP spokesperson, describing the practice as an \"environmentally sound\" way to close the loop after large-scale removals.\n\nThe clarification follows years of carp removal along the Kansas River. As PEOPLE previously reported, KDWP biologists have removed approximately 109,000 pounds of invasive carp since organized efforts began in 2022. The campaign reached a high point in 2025, when officials pulled 36,863 pounds from the river — the most successful year on record.\n\nThe removals target three invasive species present in Kansas waters: silver, bighead and black carp. Originally imported from Asia in the 1970s for an improved aquaculture, the fish escaped into Midwestern waterways decades ago and spread rapidly. They grow quickly, consume massive amounts of plankton and directly compete with native fish for food.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“These removal efforts appear to have produced positive effects in Kansas waterways and for native species,” said Liam Odell, an invasive carp biologist with KDWP, who noted that biologists are observing population declines in areas where removals have been concentrated, alongside signs of native species returning.\n\nKansas’ work is part of a much greater, multi-state effort. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, invasive carp management programs across the Mississippi River basin now remove more than 20 million pounds of invasive carp from U.S. waters each year.\n\nThe agency announced nearly $19 million in funding in August 2025 to support carp removal, monitoring and prevention efforts across 18 states, including Kansas.\n\nIn Kansas, biologists use a mix of electrofishing, gill nets and specialized equipment, including an electrified dozer trawl designed specifically for carp removal. In 2025, the effort expanded downstream by 15 miles, while the Bowersock Dam in Lawrence, Kan., continues to block the fish from spreading farther upstream.\n\nKDWP officials say year-round removals will continue and may expand as research and funding allow, emphasizing that controlling invasive carp remains critical to protecting native ecosystems — even after the fish leave the nets.",

    "title": "Yellowstone tourist suffers gruesome consequences after getting too close to wild animal: 'They ... can run three times faster than humans'",
    "description": "\"[They] have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal.\"",
    "fullText": "While navigating the trails of a national park, you may encounter wildlife — but getting too close is never a good idea. In 2022, an Ohio tourist visiting Yellowstone National Park suffered severe injuries after approaching a bison.\n\nYellowstone safety guidelines recommend keeping at least 25 yards of distance between yourself and any wildlife, but this visitor had gotten within 10 feet of the bison in question. Spooked or perhaps angered by her approach, the bison gored her and \"tossed her 10 feet into the air,\" per ABC News.\n\n\"Wildlife in Yellowstone National Park are wild and can be dangerous when approached,\" the National Park Service explained in a news release. \"... Bison have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans.\"\n\nThe 25-yard regulation — which increases to 100 yards for predators such as wolves, cougars, and bears — exists for a reason. There's no accounting for how an animal might react to humans, and, as a result, human-wildlife encounters can escalate far too easily.\n\nThe woman was taken to the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center for treatment and survived the confrontation. Two other park visitors had gotten within 25 yards of the bison as well.\n\nIn any part of the world, approaching wildlife can prove dangerous or even deadly for humans and animals alike. What's worse, animals that attack humans — even when the action is provoked — may be euthanized by local authorities in some cases.\n\nThe NPS maintains safety guidelines on its website and encourages individuals to be aware.\n\n\"The safest way to view wildlife is through a telephoto lens, a spotting scope, or a pair of binoculars,\" these experts note. \"Park animals are wild and dangerous. Bison, bears, and elk have injured and killed people. Do not approach, encircle, follow, or feed any animal.\"\n\nOn its Yellowstone safety page, the NPS adds, \"If need be, turn around and go the other way if a bison walks within 25 yards.\"\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "A historic day at the stock market for all the wrong reasons.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is taking a pounding in the stock market.\n\nOn Thursday, the Redmont giant’s share price collapsed by nearly 12 percent after it released its latest quarterly results, making it not only its biggest single day slide since March 2020, according to Bloomberg, but also one of the worst drops in the company’s history.\n\nThe Wile E. Coyote-worthy cliff-plunge, which wiped out over $400 billion in valuation, was despite Microsoft actually exceeding some key expectations, including its net income, which rose by 23 percent from the same period the year before to nearly $31 billion. Revenue also increased by 17 percent to $81.3 billion, which is about a billion more than what analysts projected.\n\nBut Microsoft’s AI spending spree has investors second-guessing its direction, and it’s striking that the lack of faith was strong enough to precipitate a historic plunge even with respectable financial growth. Overall, its total capital expenditures grew by 66 percent to a record $37.5 billion in Q4, as the company continues to splurge on building AI data centers for its Azure cloud computing business.\n\nAzure reported a 38 percent bump in revenue, which is slightly slower than the year before, adding to investor uncertainty over whether the business will be able to reap back the tens of billions spent on its data centers. In December, The Information reported that Azure was struggling to sell the company’s autonomous “AI agents” to its business customers, with quotas being slashed by up to 50 percent.\n\nSome analysts had predicted the stock drop, citing the uncertainty over Microsoft’s AI spending.\n\n“Since it is becoming even more evident that Microsoft is not going to garner a strong ROI from their massive AI investment, their shares need to be revalued back down to a level that is more consistent with its historic fair value,” Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, told Bloomberg before markets opened on Thursday.\n\nIn the latest earnings, Microsoft boasted it had more than $625 billion in contracts for its cloud business that it still needed to fulfill. Nearly half of that, though — a colossal $350 billion — is from OpenAI, raising concerns that it may be putting too many eggs in one basket. It also draws attention to how Microsoft has struggled to make an impact with its own AI products like its Copilot assistant, which was heavily based on OpenAI’s tech, and which many enthusiasts perceive as an inferior version of ChatGPT. Microsoft 365 Copilot, the business-focused version of its chatbot integrated into its apps like Word, had 15 million annual users, the company just revealed.\n\n“As an investor, when you think about our capex, don’t just think about Azure, think about Copilot,” CEO Satya Nadella said on a call with analysts, as quoted by the Financial Times. “We don’t want to maximize just one business of ours. We want to be able to allocate capacity, while we are supply constrained, that allows us to build the best portfolio.”\n\nMore on AI: Sam Altman Says Oops, They Accidentally Made the New Version of ChatGPT Worse Than the Previous One",

    "description": "Nearly three years after Holy Names University shut down amid declining enrollment and rising costs, the 60-acre campus in East Oakland is set to be reborn for a new purpose: housing.",
    "fullText": "Nearly three years after Holy Names University shut down amid declining enrollment and rising costs, the 60-acre campus nestled in the East Oakland hillside is set to be reborn for a new purpose: housing.\n\nOn Friday, BH Properties, which purchased the property in 2023 for $65 million, is expected to file an application to build 165 single-family homes on the property while retaining the university's 400-seat theater, as well as the iconic mid-century chapel and belltower designed by architect John Pflueger.\n\nLos Angeles-based BH Properties purchased the 60-acre campus in June 2023, just before a scheduled foreclosure after the university had defaulted on a $49 million loan. After purchasing it, the real estate investment firm worked without success to attract another educational institution, a tough sell in an environment where Bay Area colleges like Mills College and California College of the Arts and the San Francisco Art Institute have been going out of business after heavy post-pandemic financial losses.\n\n\"We believe in Oakland and are committed to transforming the former Holy Names campus into a win for the property, community and the city,\" Jim Brooks, president of BH Properties, said in a statement.\"This is a particularly compelling location, and we believe that homes of this type can be delivered in the near term.\"\n\nThe development represents a rare chance to build single-family homes in the East Bay's biggest city and to capitalize on a property defined by steep hillsides, deep ravines, flowering rose bushes, redwood groves, circling hawks and views of both the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge. About half of the 60-acre property will be preserved as open space, with meandering hiking trails and wooded areas where children can explore and build forts.\n\nThe plan for 165 market-rate single family homes will be consistent with surrounding densities with a variety of home sizes that match the campus and hillside environments.\n\nIn early designs, the existing campus footprint will be transformed into a clustered residential village surrounding the McClean Chapel and quad, with about 125 homes between 1,800 and 2,500 square feet. The steeper hillside will be more sparsely developed with about 40 larger homes, likely 2,500 to 3,000 square feet.\n\nIn a statement, BH said the community \"will become a place for families, empty nesters, and singles alike to enjoy the richness and fullness of life the college campus affords.\"\n\nBH Properties is working with development advisor Tidewater Capital on the proposed plans for the former campus,\n\n\"Holy Names is an incredible location surrounded by a mature hillside neighborhood,\" said Kyle Winkler, development director at Tidewater Capital. \"The plan is in its early stages, but adds much needed housing that will mirror the look and feel of the surrounding neighborhood.\"\n\nThe proposal calls for the bell tower and chapel to be preserved as a library and communal space, while the campus quad remains as a central gathering place. The performing arts theater, which was built in 1993, is envisioned as a hub for culture and enrichment available to the broader community with performances, talks and classes overseen by a nonprofit, the developer said.\n\nFormer Oakland City Councilmember Dick Spees, who served the neighborhood for 24 years, compared the Holy Names property to Oakland's Chabot Space & Science Center, which he founded. Spees previously served on the board of Holy Names University.\n\n\"Holy Names is one of Oakland's most special places, shaped by its hills, trees and long civic legacy,\" he said. \"I learned through projects like the Chabot Space & Science Center that the best development respects its setting, serves the community and thinks generations ahead. Oakland is at its best when growth is guided by care, balance and long-term thinking - and this project reflects exactly that.\"\n\nAfter the application is submitted the developer says it plans to launch a community engagement process, working with city officials and neighbors on refining the plan.\n\nThe project comes as another noteworthy Oakland education-to-housing project - the 448-unit redevelopment of the former CCA campus in Rockridge - is stalled because of financial infeasibility.\n\nIf approved, the Holy Names the project would be Oakland's second largest single-family home project. The largest, the 918-home redevelopment of the former Oak Knolls Naval Medical Center, has been delayed for three decades, mired in controversy and false starts. The current owner had said infrastructure work could start this year.\n\nThis article originally published at Exclusive: Former Bay Area university campus to be converted into single family housing.",

    "fullText": "Need something brilliant to read this weekend? Here are six of our favourite pieces from the last seven days\n\nDecisions outsourced, chatbots for friends, the natural world an afterthought: Silicon Valley is giving us life void of connection. There is a way out, wrote Rebecca Solnit in this beautiful long read, but it’s going to take collective effort.\n\nA backlash against gentle parenting had been brewing for some time and some mothers on social media are advocating a tough, no-nonsense approach to parenting. Does this teach children important lessons – or just make them feel isolated and ashamed? Emine Saner on the rise of “Fafo” parenting.\n\nA special piece on Guardian cartoonists Ella Baron and Martin Rowson saw the pair face off, each producing very different cartoons in response to a prompt about Trump. We showed readers how two different generations of cartoonists operate: one in pixels, one in paint.\n\n“When I see washed-out photographs of English life in the 60s and 70s – cardiganed grandmothers eating roadside picnics beside Morris Minors, pale men sunbathing in shoes and socks on stripy deckchairs, Raleigh Choppers and caged budgerigars and faux leather pouffes – I feel a wave of what can’t properly be called nostalgia, because the last thing I’d want is to return to that age and those places where I was often profoundly unhappy and from which I’d have been desperate to escape if escape had been a possibility. Why then this longing, this echo of some remembered comfort?”\n\nThis remarkable piece of writing by Mark Haddon, author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was an achingly sad exploration of a childhood shaped by his parents’ lack of warmth.\n\nAfter a very hard landing into fame in the 00s, he decided to take a softer approach – and hit on a winning formula for classic comedy with Detectorists. The actor spoke to Zoe Williams about his obsession with middle-age and the “PTSD” on rewatching his breakout role in The Office.\n\n“In recent years Patrick Bateman – specifically Christian Bale’s movie persona – has become a kind of aspirational figure for the very same men he was designed to mock …”\n\nAs the stage adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’s notorious and misunderstood bestseller returns to the London stage, Tim Jonze explored how its tale of 80s yuppie nihilism feels more relevant than ever in the era of Andrew Tate, Trump and tech bros.",

    "description": "Ruemmler, who is now Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, says her association with Epstein was professional.",
    "fullText": "A new trove of emails released Friday is shedding more light on the relationship between Kathryn Ruemmler, who is now Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, and Jeffrey Epstein — who sent her expensive gifts, including an Hermès bag.\n\n\"So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!\" Ruemmler wrote in 2018 after Epstein had something delivered to her New York apartment.\n\nRuemmler's relationship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender, has been closely examined. Multiple disclosures of once-private emails have shown the pair had a much deeper relationship than was previously publicly known.\n\nGoldman spokesperson Tony Fratto said in a statement that it is \"well known that Epstein often offered unsolicited favors and gifts to his many business contacts.\"\n\n\"As Kathy has said many times, she had a professional association with Jeffrey Epstein when she was a lawyer in private practice, heading the defense and investigations practice at a global law firm,\" the statement said. \"She regrets ever knowing him.\"\n\nThe latest batch of emails reveals that Epstein repeatedly gave Ruemmler pricey gifts, and she appeared delighted with them.\n\n\"OH MY GOD!!! He is in so much =rouble!!!! I am dying,\" Epstein's assistant Lesley Groff wrote in 2016, passing along Ruemmler's reaction to getting the Hermès handbag. \"It is so beautiful.\"\n\nA receipt for the bag, a Jlypslere 31, showed it cost $9,350. It wasn't the only accessory she received from him. In a 2015 exchange, Ruemmler said she \"absolutely love[d] the handbag\" Epstein sent her for her 44th birthday.\n\n\"I joked with Jeffrey that I was worried he was sending me a cane,\" Ruemmler wrote in an email to a redacted recipient, who appears to be another Epstein assistant.\n\nIn 2019, she wrote that her outfit that day was thanks to Epstein.\n\n\"Am totally tricked out by Uncle Jeffrey today! Jeffrey boots, handbag, and w=tch!\" she wrote.\n\nIn a separate exchange in 2018, Ruemmler asked whether it was OK to request a higher-end, Hermès-branded Apple Watch.\n\n\"If truly okay with him to do the Hermes, I would love the 40 mm, stainless Hermes with bleu indigo swift leather double tour,\" Ruemmler wrote at the time. \"I'll wear that one every day, whereas the sportier ones I would likely only wear on weekends or when exercising, etc.\"\n\nAt the time of the emails, Ruemmler was a top attorney at Latham & Watkins. Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a minor, had re-established himself as a financier with ties to the rich and powerful.\n\nIn 2019, Epstein was indicted on sweeping federal sex-trafficking charges and killed himself in jail while awaiting trial. Ruemmler, who had served as White House counsel from 2011 to 2014, joined Goldman Sachs in 2020.\n\nGoldman Sachs, led by CEO David Solomon, has remained behind Ruemmler amid questions about her ties to Epstein.\n\n\"She's an excellent lawyer, and the organization relies on her guidance every single day,\" Solomon told CNBC in November.\n\nOn Friday, the Justice Department said in a letter to Congress that it would release 3 million new Epstein-related files. The department said some 200,000 documents will be at least partially withheld from the public. The disclosures are required by the bipartisan Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed Congress with wide bipartisan support in November.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's monthslong and contentious search for a new commissioner to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics may be ending.\n\nOn a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump announced that he intends to nominate Brett Matsumoto, a longtime agency economist, to lead the BLS.\n\nThe BLS commissioner role has been vacant since August, when Trump fired Erika McEntarfer after the release of a jobs report showing weak employment growth. Trump alleged, without providing evidence, that the data had been politically manipulated. The allegation and removal have since undermined public trust in one of the federal government's most closely watched statistical agencies, which is supposed to remain nonpartisan.\n\nThe agency has roughly 2,000 employees, and the commissioner is its only appointed position. The commissioner's role carries a four-year term and requires Senate confirmation.\n\nBefore Matsumoto, the White House previously nominated EJ Antoni, a Heritage Foundation economist, for the job, but later withdrew the nomination after it became clear Antoni lacked sufficient support for Senate confirmation.\n\nMatsumoto is a career economist with deep ties to the agency he would lead if confirmed.\n\nBased on Matsumoto's LinkedIn profile, he earned undergraduate and master's degrees at the University of Delaware before earning his doctorate in economics from the University of North Carolina in 2015. Since then, he has been working at the BLA as a supervisory research economist. Multiple academic papers under his name can be found covering issues such as consumer expenditure and inflation measurement. Over the past year, he has been on assignment at the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nMatsumoto is not very active on social media. A Facebook account under his name shows that his profile picture used to be a photo with Ivanka Trump back in August 2020. His most recent profile photo features him alongside a tabby cat.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social late Friday, Trump said he was confident Matsumoto had the expertise to \"QUICKLY fix the long history of issues at the BLS on behalf of the American People.\"\n\nSeveral economists posted online that they believe Matsumoto could be the right choice.\n\nClaudia Sahm, Chief Economist at New Century Advisors, posted on X that Matsumoto is an \"excellent choice\" for the commissioner position.\n\nSkanda Amarnath, Executive Director of Employ America, echoed the sentiment on X and said that Matsumoto is \"a very thoughtful person who understands the nuts and bolts of data measurement and estimation.\"",

    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s live coverage for \"WWE SmackDown\" on January 30, 2026, coming to you from the Riyadh Season Stadium at KAFD in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia!\n\nAs he prepares to compete in the 2026 Men's Royal Rumble tomorrow night at WWE Royal Rumble to secure his spot at WrestleMania 42, Cody Rhodes will be making an appearance on tonight's show with something on his mind to share. Rhodes has made it clear that he isn't done coming for Drew McIntyre's Undisputed WWE Championship since being dethroned by him on the January 9 edition of \"SmackDown\" nor is he done with Jacob Fatu after Fatu inadvertently cost him the title.\n\nCarmelo Hayes successfully defended his United States Championship against Ilja Dragunov during last Friday's edition of \"SmackDown\", with Dragunov having answered Hayes' US Open Challenge. While Dragunov came close to dethroning Hayes, The Miz ensured that didn't happen by pushing Dragunov off the top rope and opening the door for Hayes to connect with The First 48 on Dragunov. Not only will Hayes keep the US Open Challenge going when he issues another US Open Challenge tonight, but Dragunov looks to seek his retribution when he goes one-on-one with The Miz.\n\nJohnny Gargano will be returning to action tonight as he goes head-to-head with former two time NXT Tag Team Champion Axiom. Tensions between the two men have been on the rise ever since Gargano and his wife Candice LeRae stole Axiom's mask a number of weeks ago, with Gargano having come up short to Axiom's tag team partner Nathan Frazer last Friday due to a miscommunication between Gargano and LeRae.\n\nAdditionally, the aforementioned McIntyre and Sami Zayn are set to cross paths as they meet one night before McIntyre defends his Undisputed WWE Championship against Zayn at Royal Rumble.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

The Farmers is the third event on the PGA Tour's schedule this year.\n\nThey use two golf courses at Torrey Pines for the Farmers. Each golfer plays one round on each of the North and South courses. As play heads to the weekend, all those who made the cut will play two more rounds on the more difficult South.\n\nJustin Rose, 45, ballooned his lead to as many as five shots during Friday's round and takes a four-shot lead into the weekend. The 2019 Farmers champ is seeking his second win at Torrey Pines and his 13th career Tour victory.\n\nThe most notable miss was Xander Schauffele, who had made 72 consecutive cuts dating back to the 2022 Masters. A missed birdie putt on his final hole, however, meant he would miss a weekend for the first time in 1,391 days on the PGA Tour. Koepka's playing partners, Max Homa and Ludvig Aberg, could never get it going this week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Farmers Insurance Open notables who missed the cut in 2026 at Torrey",

    "description": "The Golden State Warriors are reportedly interested in acquiring Giannis Antetokounmpo via trade",
    "fullText": "The future of Giannis Antetokounmpo is an open question among NBA fans and teams alike. The two-time MVP is reportedly available for trade, either ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline or during the summer. Of course, the Golden State Warriors have been cited as a potential suitor, primarily due to how well Giannis and Stephen Curry would potentially fit on the court.\n\nDuring a recent episode of \"The Draymond Green Show\" podcast, Green discussed Golden State's reported interest in Giannis, admitting that he only knows what's being put out by the media, just like the rest of us.\n\n“As of yesterday, everybody’s talking Giannis. Do the Warriors make a trade for Giannis? This is not the podcast where you find that out,” Green said. “I actually don’t have a (expletive) clue. I have no idea. I know what you know — exactly what I saw in red, which is the same thing you saw in red. So I have no clue...I did see that Giannis is preparing for an exit from Milwaukee. Whether that’s at the deadline or the offseason, apparently, it’s inevitable and it’s going to happen.”\n\nGolden State is in need of another superstar talent, especially now that Jimmy Butler has been ruled out for the rest of the season following an ACL injury. Adding Giannis would all but guarantee Golden State would be re-established as one of the top contenders for a championship, both this season and in the years to come.\n\nNevertheless, the Warriors won't be the only team fighting for Giannis in the trade market. When a player of his caliber is available, a bidding war is inevitable. Fortunately, the Warriors have a deep trove of tradable assets, both in terms of draft picks and young, high-upside players. Whether Mike Dunleavy and Joe Lacob can get a deal over the line, either ahead of the trade deadline or during the summer, will remain to be seen.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors' Draymond Green addresses Giannis Antetokounmpo rumors",

Trump didn’t offer any additional details about the proposed structure, but with less than five months before the UFC White House card unfolds construction may need to start soon.\n\nOn Friday, Trump spoke with reporters to announce that Washington D.C. will also host an IndyCar race on the city streets this August. This event adds to the overall celebration of America’s 250th anniversary this summer, which prompted Trump to bring up the UFC White House card and mention plans to build a 100,000-seat stadium.\n\nTrump announces he is building a stadium for 100,000 people in front of the White House for the UFC fight on his birthday pic.twitter.com/6hJF0o4tkh\n\n— FactPost (@factpostnews) January 30, 2026\n\n“UFC is coming as you know in front of the White House,“ said Trump. “They’re building literally a stadium. We’re going to have over 100,000 people.”\n\nIf this is actually going to happen it would be incredible. Remember, UFC CEO, Dana White, already confirmed that the promotion will set up shop at a nearby park to host 85,000 UFC fans. White and company are trying to take over Washington D.C. and give fight fans an experience they won’t forget, especially considering the actual UFC White House event will be invite only.\n\nTrump has high hopes for his UFC birthday bash this June so maybe there is an actual plan to build a structure to hold 100,000 additional people. Maybe Trump was embellishing a little bit to help pump up the impending celebration.",

(KELO) — The first competitive events of the Black Hills Stock Show kicked off today with the C-M-S-A Mounted Shooting.\n\nThe national series is part of Rodeo Rapid City.\n\nFriday, horses and riders stepped into the Summit Arena as Rodeo Rapid City kicked off nine days of events.\n\n“Well, we’re in an agricultural country, we’re in a Western lifestyle. There’s no better time to be a cowboy right now if you’re competing. The money’s great, a lot of rodeos to go to and with Yellowstone and the different TV shows coming on, everybody wants to put on their boots and hat and go to town for the weekend,” Sutton Rodeo Owner Steve Sutton said.\n\nBeing able to properly shoot a gun at a shooting range and hit a target can be a difficult task. Doing it on horseback adds to the level of difficulty.\n\n“Cowboy mounted shooting is like barrel racing with guns. It’s a timed event with ten reactive targets, balloons, that we shoot with 19-century replica guns, with a specially loaded black powered blank that only flies to about 20-feet,” CMSA Level Six Shooter Brett Borkowski said.\n\nThis event is family friendly and lets people take a step back in time.\n\n“The old westerns on TV used to be the gun fights and everything and so it’s pretty entertaining. I think a lot of people got into this event by sitting in the stands watching it, seeing how much fun it would actually be if you were participating,” Sutton said.\n\n“You know, if you don’t get your second gun out in time you might be halfway home, you might have run by three balloons before you even get your second gun out. So the feeling when you shoot ten balloons and everything flows and it’s all perfect, it’s an amazing feeling,” Borkowski said.\n\nRiders from seven states and a variety of levels are competing at this year’s event.\n\nIf you were unable to attend day one of this event, you can still get in on the action as day two of their Mounted Shooting series begins Saturdaymorning.",

The star, whose real name is Simone Garcia Johnson, daughter of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, took to Instagram to announce her decision to fans.\n\nFollowing Ava's social media announcement, Fightful Select reached out to WWE and received a statement about her departure. In the statement, WWE thanked Garcia Johnson for her \"stellar work\" as Ava, and said her passion, dedication, and impact were felt across \"NXT\" and beyond. WWE wished her well in her future endeavors to cap off the statement.\n\nAva joined WWE and started training at the Performance Center in February 2020. She didn't make her on-screen debut as an authority figure, initially, however, but rather, alongside Joe Gacy, and the Dyad (the Grizzled Young Veterans) as Ava Raine in The Schism, in 2022. Her debut match was at Stand & Deliver 2023, in a mixed tag match lost against Chase U. She would go on to have five other matches in WWE, but only two more on television, with no televised singles victories. Her final match came at Heatwave 2023 in a loss against Ivy Nile.\n\nFollowing Gacy proclaiming The Schism dead following the releases of The Dyad, she became an on-screen authority figure as an assistant to Shawn Michaels in 2023. In January 2024, Ava became the youngest-ever authority figure in WWE history when she was promoted to \"NXT\" general manager by William Regal. She would even once share the screen with her father, when The Rock stopped by \"NXT\" following its New Year's Evil special in January 2025.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen will put the NBA vs. NFL debate to the test when they compete in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game.\n\nWith the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game being held in Los Angeles this year, it will be a homecoming of sorts for St. Brown and Allen. St. Brown is from Anaheim Hills, California, and starred at USC for three seasons before being selected by the Lions in the fourth round of the 2021 NFL Draft.\n\nAllen also spent his college years in California, playing three seasons for the Cal Golden Bears before being drafted by the Chargers in 2013. Allen has also spent 12 of his 13 seasons with the Chargers, first in San Diego and then in Los Angeles after their relocation.\n\nSt. Brown is coming off his fourth straight 1,000-yard season and finished the year with 117 catches for 1,401 yards and 11 touchdowns. While the 26-year-old receiver had a great year statistically, the Lions missed the playoffs for the first time in two seasons and finished fourth in the NFC North division. St. Brown will also take part in Sunday's NFL Pro Bowl and was a second-team All-Pro.\n\nIn his first year back with the Chargers after a season with the Chicago Bears, Allen remained productive. The 33-year-old receiver led the team with 81 receptions and had 777 yards and 4 touchdowns. Allen's season ended with a 16-3 wild-card loss to the New England Patriots, which resulted in the firing of former offensive coordinator Greg Roman. Allen is set to become a free agent this offseason.\n\nThe Celebrity game will be on Friday, Feb. 13, and will be held on the first day of All-Star Weekend.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies just picked up one of the most versatile free agents available.\n\nOn Friday, they signed Dylan Moore to a minor league contract with an invite to spring training, according to The Athletic's Will Sammon.\n\nAccording to Sammon, Moore \"can make up to $3.25 million with plate appearance and active roster bonuses.\"\n\nMoore was a Gold Glove winner in 2024 as the American League's top utility defender while playing for the Seattle Mariners.\n\nMORE: How Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nHe has played all but 18 of his MLB games with Seattle. He closed out the 2025 season with the Texas Rangers.\n\nMoore's defense is his calling card. The 33-year old can play all over the outfield, and he also plays up the middle at second base and shortstop.\n\nIn 2025, he found himself in a rut at the plate with the Mariners, batting just .193 before he was moved to the Rangers, for whom he hit .259 in 18 games.\n\nMORE: Paul Skenes has added a new pitch\n\nMoore is a career .206 hitter, a much better swing from his right side against left-handed pitching.\n\nHe did have an OPS of .855 in 2020, then .753 in 2022 and .731 in 2023. There is an ability to make a difference with the bat from Moore, if he can recapture some of that past swing.\n\nThe Phillies will likely find a use for him at least at some point thanks to that multi-faceted defensive skillset, so it's not a bad signing as the spring approaches.\n\nTeam USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nHow Trent Grisham's decision ruined the Yankees' offseason plans\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nBo Bichette comments exhibit clear hyprocrisy\n\nAndrew McCutchen is not happy with the Pirates",

    "description": "Coach Nick Nurse discusses the Philadelphia 76ers being undersized amid their rebounding struggles.",
    "fullText": "CAMDEN, N.J. -- As the Philadelphia 76ers got back to work at practice on Friday afternoon, the focus was on the rebounding issues they've had to endure recently. They were out-rebounded 53-38 in a loss to the New York Knicks on Jan. 24, 53-33 in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Monday, and 46-24 in the win over the Sacramento Kings.\n\nAfter the win, Paul George did admit the Sixers are a bit undersized compared to some teams. He and Kelly Oubre Jr. flank Joel Embiid up front while teams like the Kings can employ big men like Domantas Sabonis, Precious Achiuwa, and Maxime Raynaud to cause problems down low. It nearly cost the Sixers a win.\n\nThe rebounding problem is something that can certainly cause some issues for the Sixers in the playoffs and coach Nick Nurse is looking to nip it in the bud going forward.\n\n\"I think that there's a few things,\" Nurse pondered on Friday. \"I mean, sometimes it's size and athleticism, right? Playing against bigger guys, more athletic, stronger, whatever. Sometimes, it’s just not paying attention to details and getting a body on people. Then sometimes, I think it's a little bit like defense in general, right?\"\n\nIt is a bit like defense. As once a guy gets going and finds a rhythm, he's tough to stop, but it's the same with offensive rebounding and scoring off misses. Sacramento had 24 second-chance points compared to zero for Philadelphia.\n\n\"You give up a few, and then the blood's in the water, and those guys really seem to get cranked up after they've got to get a couple, and they're just like, ‘Man, this is an easy way to live tonight. I'm gonna really, you know, kind of focus on that.’\" Nurse continued. \"So it's a little bit like trying to shut a guy's water off when he's scoring, too. How do you figure it out?\"\n\nTherefore, Nurse and his staff will be looking to make sure everybody understands what has to be done going forward. The Sixers will not win unless they figure out how to pull down rebounds consistently. This will be something to monitor going into the playoffs in April.\n\n\"It takes some thought,\" Nurse added. \"It takes some effort. It takes some thought. It takes some scheme. Sometimes, it takes two guys on certain like—Sabonis is a guy you need to probably use two guys on. He’s very good at doing all this pushing as the guy’s in a shooting motion. He's gonna wedge most guys underneath the basket and the only ones that are you're gonna get are the ones that come through the net, right? So somebody's got to come from the backside to help on those and things like that.\"\n\nThere have been matchups when the Sixers have been able to control the glass which then turns games in their favor, but these recent contests have been a serious struggle for them. At practice, Nurse showed clips on film to his team looking to get back to getting it done on the glass.\n\n\"We've been pretty good at that, and that was a lot of the clips we showed today,\" Nurse added. \"We showed, like, here's one where you have to come and help guys because even, like, even him, those guys were blocking him out in front of him. The balls were coming over the head, and that's got to be somebody else's.\"\n\nThe Sixers will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Nick Nurse talks Sixers being undersized amid rebounding struggles",

    "description": "Brooks Koepka made the cut on the number to get into the weekend at the Farmers Insurance Open.",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — Brooks Koepka walked off the final green late on Friday afternoon and immediately found his wife, Jena Sims, and their two-year-old son, Crew, waiting for him.\n\nKoepka greeted his wife and quickly scooped up an excited Crew for the walk back from the ninth green at the North Course down to the scorers room at the clubhouse at Torrey Pines, safe for the weekend.\n\nThat moment, he said earlier in the week, was the entire reason he wanted to leave LIV Golf and come back to the PGA Tour. He wanted to be able to spend more time with his family after a rough couple of months for them off the course.\n\nBrooks Koepka and family will stick around for the weekend @FarmersInsOpen 🤗 pic.twitter.com/xrO6F6LFh6\n\n— Golf on CBS ⛳ (@GolfonCBS) January 31, 2026\n\n“I don’t know the last time I’ve actually made a cut and they’ve still been there,” Koepka said, smiling.\n\n“It was so nice to have them out there, and it felt good. I don’t know, my son doesn’t really know what’s going on, but it’s cool for me to have them here.”\n\nKoepka posted a 4-under 68 on Friday in the second round of the Farmers Insurance Open, which marked his first non-major championship PGA Tour event in nearly four years. That, after his 1-over opening round on the South Course on Thursday, got him to 3-under for the week — which was just good enough to make the cut on the number.\n\nAs a result, Koepka will make it into the weekend and get all four rounds in his first Tour event back.\n\nWhile his round was significantly better than the initial outing — Koepka even made a birdie at the par-5 17th before carding two birdies in his final five holes — he was still a bit anxious as he settled back into life on Tour. It was just a different kind than what he felt 24 hours earlier.\n\n“It was definitely different,” he said of his second round. “I think yesterday I was excited to play, nervous and kind of didn’t know what to expect. Today felt more normal, I guess.\n\n\"I mean, don’t get me wrong, I definitely still got antsy. But I guess maybe a little bit of nerves, just trying to figure it out and see where my game’s at too, right? I feel like I’m playing really well. It’s just been a long layoff.”\n\nKoepka very likely won’t be able to catch Justin Rose and make a run at the title this weekend. The deficit he's facing is massive. But he’s going to get to play all four rounds, and have both Jena and Crew by his side.\n\nUnlike plenty who took it on before him this week, the South Course was incredibly easy for Justin Rose.\n\nRose erupted on the North Course on Thursday, where he carded a 10-under 62 on the easier of the two courses to begin the tournament and instantly jump into the solo lead. Friday was nearly as dominant, too. Rose seemed to handle the South Course, which got just about everyone in the opening round, with ease to grab a four-shot lead.\n\nRose went 5-under on his front nine in the second round, thanks to a huge eagle at the par-5 sixth. Rose stuck his second shot on the front of the green and then easily rolled in an 8-footer with ease.\n\nFirst eagle of the day on the South Course 🦅@JustinRose99 extends his lead and is now 13-under @FarmersInsOpen.\n\n📺 ESPN pic.twitter.com/MzLPS5GUuU\n\n— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) January 30, 2026\n\nHe did bogey once on Friday, but immediately offset it with another birdie. Rose then birdied the final two holes to get to 17-under, thanks in part to an absolute dart he landed on the iconic par-5 18th. That broke his own 36-hole record at the event.\n\n\"That was two special rounds of golf,\" Rose said. \"Today probably even more so just given it's hard to often follow up a low one.\"\n\nRose has won 12 times on Tour in his career, most recently in a playoff at the FedEx St. Jude Championship last fall. Rose forced a playoff with Rory McIlroy at the Masters in April, too, but couldn’t quite pull off the upset win at Augusta National.\n\nThough he’s still got a ways to go to grab his first win of the season, Rose is in full control at the midway point. And he’s well on his way to surpassing the near-record 21-under he posted to win the event seven years ago.\n\nYet even knowing where he's at, Rose isn't going to adjust a thing.\n\n\"I felt like I was even thinking about it [late in my round] and I thought that actually, I don't think anything changes ... You go out and play this golf course as it's designed to be played,\" he said. \"There's going to be pin placements that you can't take on. You have to play it with some patience and respect and you're going to have to play well. You're going to have to play from the fairway.\n\n\"So yeah, whether I was four back or four ahead, like I don't think it actually changes the task that much tomorrow.\"",

Brad Stevens spent the summer cutting costs, trading Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, while allowing Al Horford and Luke Kornet to leave in free agency.\n\nHowever, even after the talent drain during the offseason, Joe Mazzulla's team is currently a top-three team in the Eastern Conference and looking like a good value as a potential postseason threat. Therefore, Stevens may feel the time is right to try to improve the current roster via the trade market. The most logical area in need of improvement is the center rotation.\n\nDuring a recent discussion on WEEI's \"The Greg Hill Show,\" the hosts discussed whether now was the right time for the Celtics to go all-in on a big-time trade, or whether they should wait and see how the team looks once Jayson Tatum is back in the rotation and nearing full health.

The two men hurled insults at one another before cooler heads prevailed and Lopez Sr. made his way to another room with no further incident.\n\nA furious Teofimo Lopez Sr trades words with Shakur Stevenson at the #TeofimoShakur weigh-in 💢 pic.twitter.com/8z0AYhD5ey\n\n— Boxing News (@BoxingNewsED) January 30, 2026\n\nA bit later, Lopez Sr. was once again in the center of another verbal scuffle, this time with none other than Terence Crawford, who was visibly upset at Lopez Sr.’s dance moves right in front of him while showing off his son’s titles. “Bud” could be seen very agitated to the point where we got into his elder’s face. The face-to-face confrontation seemed to calm him down a bit, though he was quick to start dancing around again once Crawford made his way back to his seat.\n\nCrawford ain’t playin! pic.twitter.com/FtP25ghn4t\n\n— BOXING n BBQ (@BOXINGnBBQ) January 30, 2026\n\nMoments later, all hell broke loose in the crowd after Bill Haney — Devin Haney’s father — and the rest of his team got into a scuffle with Delante “Tiger” Johnson and his team.

    "fullText": "Jaylen Brown has been unstoppable this season. From scoring across all three levels to shutting down opposing teams' best players, the Boston Celtics All-Star is doing it all. What's even more impressive is that Brown is having this type of season during a \"gap year\" where there are multiple young and inexperienced players in the second unit, and Jayson Tatum is sidelined with injury.\n\nWhen you look at the impact Brown has made for Boston, it's no surprise to see him in the MVP conversation. After all, without him, the Celtics are highly unlikely to be sitting third in the Eastern Conference with the All-Star break fast approaching.\n\nIn a recent episode of \"The Dunker Spot\" podcast, Nekias Duncan and Steve Jones dove into the game tape to explore how and why Brown is playing at such an elite level. They detail the overall evolution in Brown's game and raise the question of whether he could help lead the Celtics back to the NBA Finals.\n\nYou can watch the full episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: How is Jaylen Brown dominating for the Boston Celtics?",

This comes after both Shedeur Sanders and Joe Flacco were late additions to the Pro Bowl roster.\n\nSanders was added to the games earlier this week, while Flacco was added on Friday afternoon. Flacco, of course, was the Browns' opening weekend starter. He was then benched for Dillon Gabriel and subsequently traded in-division to the Cincinnati Bengals after the injury to their star quarterback Joe Burrow. Flacco went on to light it up through the air despite a lack of overall wins in Cincinnati.\n\nSo, there will be a small Cleveland reunion at the Pro Bowl games, where Flacco and Sanders can catch up with one another after one of the weirdest seasons imaginable for both of them.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns become first team in NFL history to accomplish an odd task",

    "title": "Seahawks to be sold after Super Bowl, Allen Estate says ‘team is not for sale’",
    "description": "The Seahawks are expected to eventually be sold, per Paul Allen’s wishes. That could happen as soon as this year.",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks are just about a week away from playing in their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history. It might also be the last one they play for under current ownership.\n\nLongtime Seahawks beat reporter Brady Henderson reported on Friday that the Seahawks, “will go up for sale after Super Bowl LX, league and ownership sources familiar with the arrangement told ESPN, ending years of questions about when the team would seek new ownership following the 2018 death of former owner Paul G. Allen.\n\n“Sale discussions have taken place at ownership and league levels for at least the past week.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Paul G. Allen estate released a statement following Henderson’s report.\n\n“We don’t comment on rumors and speculation, and the team is not for sale. We’ve already said that will change at some point per Paul’s wishes, but I have no news to share. Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.”\n\nThe NBA’s Trail Blazers are in the process of being sold for over $4 billion to a group led by billionaire Tom Dundon, who also owns the NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nThe Seahawks were officially sold to Paul Allen for $200 million in 1997, effectively rescuing the franchise from relocation to Anaheim, California. Over the span of nearly three decades, the Seahawks have been one of the more successful teams in the NFL in terms of wins, playoff appearances, and Super Bowl appearances.\n\nAs of May 2024, the Seahawks’ agreement to give 10 percent of their sale price to the state of Washington has expired. This was done following a referendum that paved the way for the construction of Lumen Field. It was expected that any Seahawks sale would occur after the expiration of the agreement, but there was no strict timeline to adhere to Paul Allen’s directive to sell off his assets (and donate proceeds to charitable causes).\n\nThe last NFL team to be sold was the Washington Commanders, who were acquired for $6.05 billion in 2023 by a group led by Josh Harris, who also co-owns the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and NHL’s New Jersey Devils. ESPN was told by an anonymous team executive that the Seahawks could be worth in the neighborhood of $8 billion.\n\nIt’s not like this is some brand new story—it’s “when” and not “if” the Seahawks are sold—but this is extraordinary timing after the best season in over a decade. Perhaps the time to put the Seahawks on the market is on a high note… and with a second Lombardi Trophy.",

    "fullText": "Can Nikola Jokic still win NBA MVP after extended absence due to knee injury? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter over a month on the sideline, Denver Nuggets star center Nikola Jokic will return to game action against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night.\n\nJokic suffered a hyperextended left knee during Denver’s 147-123 loss to the Miami Heat on Dec. 29 and has been sidelined since. His return is good news for the Nuggets, and basketball fans in general.\n\nPrior to going down with the injury, Jokic was considered a leading candidate for the NBA MVP award, which he has won three times previously in his career. However, his extended absence brought his candidacy into question.\n\nA while back, the NBA instituted a 65-game threshold for award and All-NBA team eligibility, meaning players had to play at least 65 games in order to be eligible to be considered for awards that season.\n\nMore: Denver Nuggets rebuffing trade offers for key rotation piece\n\nSo, let’s do a little math for a minute. Jokic has missed 16 total games so far this season. That means he’s technically still eligible for award consideration, but barely.\n\nJokic can only miss one (1) more game for the entire season to remain eligible. If he misses two more, that would bring his total to 18 for the season, and 18 subtracted from 82 equals 64 – one shy of the required number. Denver has 34 games remaining on their regular season slate.\n\nAt the end of the day though, hitting that 65-game threshold isn’t going to be the priority for Jokic or the Nuggets. Jokic’s health, both in the short-term and long-term, will be. If Denver’s medical staff thinks Jokic would benefit from a night off, they’re not going to play him solely so he can remain award eligible. Doing so would be organizational malpractice.\n\nPlus, Jokic already has more accolades than most players could ever imagine, and knowing him, he’s not pressed to add to his collection.\n\nKevin Durant passes Dirk Nowitzki on NBA all-time scoring list\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers star shuts down dunk contest question\n\nDraymond Green weighs in on Giannis Antetokounmpo, Warriors rumors",

    "fullText": "Justin Rose carded a sizzling 65 on Friday to push his lead to four strokes at Torrey Pines, where Brooks Koepka made the cut in his PGA Tour return.\n\nEngland's Rose followed up a 10-under first round on the North Course with an arguably more impressive seven-under effort on the tougher South Course, where he closed with back-to-back birdies to set a 36-hole tournament scoring record with a total of 17-under 127.\n\n\"That was two special rounds of golf, today probably even more so just given it's hard to often follow up a low one,\" said the 45-year-old, the 2013 US Open champion whose 12 PGA Tour titles include the 2019 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines.\n\n\"I felt like decision-making was spot on in terms of how I managed my game,\" Rose said after a round that featured six birdies, an eagle and one bogey.\n\n\"Obviously every shot was not going to be perfect out there, but when I was in a little bit of trouble the putter would come through for me or I'd be disciplined when I was slightly out of position, really played for the fat of the green and gave myself a good two-putt opportunity from 40 feet.\"\n\nRose was four strokes in front of Ireland's Seamus Power, who rebounded from his only bogey at his penultimate hole, the eighth, with an eagle at the ninth to post a six-under 66 for 131.\n\n\"A lot of good stuff,\" Power said. \"As well as I scored yesterday, it was more the putter and I knew I was a little off with the long game.\n\n\"So I was able to get that figured out after the round yesterday, so it felt much much better long game wise and the putter obviously was still there. So feeling really good going into tomorrow.\"\n\nPower was two shots ahead of Americans Joel Dahmen and McMcGreevy. Dahmen had three eagles in his 63 and McGreevy signed for a 67 to join him on 11-under 133.\n\nFive-time major winner Koepka, one of the highest-profile players to join LIV when the Saudi-backed renegade tour launched in 2022, was 14 off the pace but he'll be playing the weekend in his first tournament back on the PGA Tour.\n\nKoepka hadn't played a non-major PGA Tour event since the 2022 WGC Match Play and hadn't played a competitive round in 14 weeks before posting a one-over 73 on Thursday -- when he was heartened by the warm reception he received from fans.\n\nOn Friday he had an eagle and three birdies in a 68 to make the cut on the number at three-under 141.\n\n\"It feels good,\" Koepka said. \"Just wanted to play four days this week, I think that was important.\n\n\"I think yesterday I was excited to play, nervous, and kind of didn't know what to expect,\" added Koepka, whose return to the PGA Tour was facilitated by a new program for returning players that includes limitations on eligibility for some top events as well as financial penalties.\n\n\"Today felt more normal,\" he said. \"I definitely still got antsy, maybe a little bit of nerves just trying to figure it out and see where my game's at too.\"\n\nTwo-time major winner Xander Schauffele's streak of 72 consecutive PGA Tour cuts made -- the fifth-longest such streak in tour history -- came to an end, the American's three-under 69 leaving him one stroke shy of the weekend.",

    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Lake Nona member Lydia Ko shot a 5-under 67 on Friday for a share of second-round lead with Lottie Woad in the LPGA Tour’s season-opening Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions.\n\nKo, the 2024 tournament winner and a Hilton Grand Vacations ambassador, is the lone player in the 39-woman field without a bogey after two days. The Hall of Famer has 23 LPGA Tour victories.\n\n“I’ve had to hole some good par putts, but I really haven’t put myself in that many difficult positions as of yet,” said Ko, from New Zealand. “I think that’s why I had the two bogey-free rounds. I’m hoping to kind of continue that good momentum this weekend.”\n\nWoad shot a 69 to match Ko at 8-under 136 in mostly sunny conditions with 12 mph wind at the most in the 70-degree afternoon.\n\n“I looked at the leaderboard quite a lot today because I was getting annoyed,” Woad said. “Seemed like there weren’t that many low scores out there, so kind of knew I was still in it. The pins were probably a little trickier so weren’t as many birdies as yesterday.”\n\nThe 22-year-old English player won the ISPS Handa Women’s Scottish Open last year, weeks after taking the KPMG Women’s Irish Open as an amateur on the Ladies European Tour.\n\nNasa Hataoka, also a Lake Nona member, was a stroke back with Amy Yang. Hataoka had a 71, and Yang shot 69.\n\nDefending champion A Lim Kim was 6 under after her second 69. Youmin Hwang (67) and Ingrid Lindblad (69) also were 6 under.\n\nTop-ranked Jeeno Thitikul and Kelly Korda were 5 under. Thitkul had a 72, and Korda shot 71.\n\n“I think the weather is going to get a little worse so I’m going to go to the putting green, go to the range because wasn’t hitting it the best today,” Korda said. “Just going to figure some things out ahead of the weekend.”\n\nBaseball player Aaron Hicks topped the celebrity field.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",

Still, of course, for Arenado to make the sudden change, it did not go well with the American fanbase.\n\nMore: Proposed Diamondbacks trade lands them a four-time Gold Glove Award winner\n\nArenado's decision surprised many American fans on social media. Still, it has become official: Arenado will also be joined by New York Mets All-Star Francisco Lindor, who will play shortstop for Puerto Rico.\n\nIn the country's history competing in the Classic, Puerto Rico has finished as the runner-up twice, in 2013 and 2017, with 2017 being the year Arenado helped defeat Puerto Rico while playing for the United States.\n\nAs the former Silver Slugger slowly approaches the final seasons of his career, maybe choosing Puerto Rico comes from him believing this is the last time he gets to represent his mother's home country as a gift to her, as the all-star has credited his mother for giving him the passion he has for baseball to this day.\n\nMany will see how Arenando performs in front of the home crowd, as Puerto Rico will host the classic from March 6-11.\n\nOrioles predicted to make $180 million splash signing with best free-agent starter\n\nMets predicted to trade for 22-year old switch-pitcher from Mariners for slugger\n\nTigers' Tarik Skubal gets $32 million contract update from ESPN's Jeff Passan\n\nRed Sox linked to free agent reunion with member of 2018 World Series championship team\n\nYankees predicted to trade 22-year old rising star to fill big need\n\nGiants predicted to trade for 29-year old All Star\n\nESPN projects Pirates to sign $42 million home-run hitter to chase NL Central title",

He's still a free agent, as well.\n\nExcept it's not sounding like the Mariners plan to sign him.\n\nMariners GM Jerry Dipoto was on local radio Friday night when he shared this tidbit:\n\n\"He fits emotionally...but that could be problematic in continuing to build our roster..I wouldnt say thats likely at this point.\"\n\nJerry Dipoto with us now on the possibility of the Mariners bring back Eugenio Saurez.\n\n— Dave “Softy” Mahler (@Softykjr) January 30, 2026\n\nMORE: How Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nThe idea of Suarez fitting the team emotionally does make sense. He's a popular teammate and has a lot of Mariners fans on his side after two separate tenures in the city.\n\nIt's fascinating, though, that Dipoto doesn't think that's enough to necessarily get a deal done.\n\nWithout Suarez, the Mariners either have to play glove-first Ben Williamson or shortstop prospect Colt Emerson at third base.\n\nMORE: Paul Skenes has added a new pitch\n\nSuarez is the most proven of that potential group. He slugged 49 homers in 2025, the first 36 with the Diamondbacks and then 13 more with Seattle once he was traded at the end of July.\n\nHis peripheral numbers were worse with the Mariners, and maybe they feel they should try to avoid his decline.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKayla Nicole found herself back in the middle of online discourse this week after a seemingly minor social media interaction sparked major reaction from fans.\n\nThe former girlfriend of Travis Kelce was flooded with criticism after screenshots circulated showing she had liked a recent Instagram post involving the Kansas City Chiefs star. The post, shared by Bleacher Report, highlighted Travis and his brother Jason Kelce helping fund U.S. hockey player Laila Edwards’ family trip to Milan for her Winter Olympics debut.\n\nMORE: Cardi B will be the musical guest on 'SNL'\n\nThe caption praised the Kelce brothers’ generosity, calling them “two great guys that went out of their way when they didn’t have to.” While the story itself focused on the charitable gesture, attention quickly shifted to Nicole after users noticed her verified account had interacted with the post.\n\nThat single “like” was enough to set off a wave of backlash, particularly from fans protective of Travis’ current relationship with Taylor Swift. Screenshots of the interaction spread rapidly across platforms, and commentary soon followed. One user accused Nicole of chasing attention, writing that she “really dislikes not being talked about.” Another questioned why the moment was being amplified at all, arguing that continued focus only fuels unnecessary drama.\n\nThe reaction added to a growing list of moments that have kept Nicole in headlines since her 2022 breakup with Travis. Last year, fans speculated about possible shade when she recreated Toni Braxton’s “He Wasn’t Man Enough” look from the early 2000s music video, and other posts have also been interpreted — fairly or not — as indirect jabs at Swift.\n\nWhile Nicole has not publicly addressed the latest situation, the renewed attention arrives as the Kelce family continues to dominate headlines for entirely different reasons.\n\nMORE: Austin Reaves' YoungLA fashion drop gets love from Luka Doncic and Lebron James\n\nTravis’ mother, Donna Kelce, recently raised eyebrows during promotional interviews ahead of her appearance on The Traitors.

    "description": "With less than a week to go a lot of trade talk is out there, but the Giannis Antetokounmpo situation could hold up other deals.",
    "fullText": "We are less than a week away from the NBA trade deadline and rumors are flying around fast and furious. Here are some of the latest rumors not involving Giannis Antetokounmpo (to check out the latest on his trade saga, click here).\n\nIt's no secret the Lakers are looking for help on the wing and some depth at the five.\n\nEnter De'Andre Hunter, the Cleveland wing. The Lakers and Cavaliers reportedly have discussed a trade that would send Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht out of Los Angeles and involves a third team, Brooklyn. Here is what Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com reported on the Wine & Gold Podcast.\n\n\"My sources tell me that the Cavs and the Lakers have discussed a general framework surrounding De'Andre Hunter of Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht and then bringing in a third team.\"\n\nThat third team is Brooklyn, and the Lakers would like to get center Day'Ron Sharpe as part of the trade, reports Brett Siegel of Clutch Points.\n\nThe challenge in constructing any trade with these teams is that the Cavaliers are over the second apron, and neither can aggregate multiple players in a trade nor can they take back more money than they send out. Added to that, the Lakers are hard-capped at the first apron and are currently less than $1 million from that number. The Lakers also have one pick to trade, a very valuable 2031 first-rounder, although there have been reports that the Lakers have looked to trade that pick for three lesser-valuable first-rounders, one of which would likely be included in this.\n\nThe prize for the Lakers would be adding Hunter, a player the Cavaliers hoped would fill their need on the wing, but did not. Hunter is averaging 13.9 points a game, often off the bench in Cleveland, shooting 30.9% from beyond the arc this season he is not a lock-down defender. Giving up Hachimura for Hunter is not a great deal, but if Sharpe is coming with him, the Lakers would have to consider it.\n\nThe hottest name in trade talks is another potential Lakers target, Kings wing Keon Ellis.\n\nSacramento is \"sifting through various scenarios for Keon Ellis, sources say, several of which would include trading out veteran forward DeMar DeRozan and/or combo guard Malik Monk along with him,\" reports NBA Insider Jake Fischer of The Stein Line.\n\nMarc Stein at the Stein Line previously reported 14 teams — almost half the league — had called Sacramento to check on an Ellis trade, including the Lakers, Clippers, Cavaliers, Celtics, Knicks and Warriors.\n\nThere's a reason all those teams are interested. Ellis is a plus defender on the wing at 6'4\" who is shooting 36.2% from 3-point range this season (and is a career 41.4% shooter from deep), all on an expiring minimum contract. He is eligible for a contract extension after Feb. 9, and if a team that trades for him can't reach that extension then he becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer.\n\nIf the Kings pair Monk with Ellis in a trade, they make a combined $21 million; with DeRozan, that climbs to $27 million. Either option gives the Kings some flexibility to bring back someone they think can be part of their future.\n\n• Agent Rich Paul denied the reports that he pushed Dallas to trade Anthony Davis.\n\nRich Paul says it’s NOT TRUE that he has demanded the Mavericks to trade Anthony Davis \n\n“I know what was said. That thing was aggregated. This is the power of the internet. If you’re wondering why Rich Paul has a podcast, this is part of the reason why… The reality of it is,… pic.twitter.com/ctWNnlpR0x\n\n— NBA Courtside (@NBA__Courtside) January 25, 2026\n\n• Cleveland has been active in trade talks as it looks to turn around a disappointing season so far, although nobody is exactly sure what their plan is, reports Brian Windhorst and Tim Bontemps of ESPN.\n\n• Oklahoma City may be exploring the trade market for center Isaiah Hartenstein, reports Brian Windhorst of ESPN on the Hoop Collective Podcast. \"He's got a team option next year for $29 million. I've actually heard the Oklahoma City Thunder's name in some trade chatter.\" Remember that next season, both Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams' max contracts kick in, and the finances are going to get a lot tighter in OKC. They probably won't make that trade, but it's worth watching.\n\n• Expect Orlando to make a trade, but it will be all about dumping salary, according to ESPN’s Windhorst and Bontemps. The Magic are $5.6 million into the tax, and, given how this team is playing, would like to get out of it. Trading Tyus Jones and his $7 million salary is a straightforward way to do that.",

    "description": "Multiple top programs challenge the competition as expectations are exceeded on Friday",
    "fullText": "On Friday, Jan. 30, the first day of competition leaned heavily on the field events, and Brianna Utecht made the most of the opportunity. Behind consistent performances across all of her events, Utecht totaled the second-highest pentathlon score in program history.\n\nJunior Brianna Utetch captured first place in the women’s pentathlon with an overall score of 4017 points. Behind her in third, Sofia Wydra finished with a total of 3693 points.\n\nFor the 60-meter hurdles, Utecht won with a time of 8.67 seconds, improving on her previous meet mark of 8.71. The hurdles performance ranks eighth in program history. Wydra finished 10th, clocking 9.08 seconds to beat her previous time of 9.11 and set a personal best.\n\n“I feel great. It was like a season opener at pentathlon, so I was happy where I was at. There’s a lot of room to improve on for the conference, so I’m really excited to see a lot of spots for improvement to get a big score,” Utetch said.\n\nUtecht earned third place in the high jump with a clearance of 1.66 meters. Wydra followed closely, tying for fifth at 1.63 meters, improving on her previous jump of 1.57 and setting a personal best.\n\nUtecht finished second in the shot put with a throw of 12.13 meters. Wydra added another personal best, recording a mark of 11.76 meters.\n\nUtecht claimed first place in the long jump with a leap of 5.84 meters. Wydra placed seventh after jumping 5.35 meters.\n\nUtecht placed second in the 800 meters with a time of 2:24.75 after a worthwhile race to watch. Alongside her, Wydra finished fourth in the event, crossing the line in 2:27.28.\n\nSenior Anna Vedral placed fifth in the pole vault, clearing 3.85 meters to surpass her previous result of 3.83 meters after having two wins in her event the past two meets.\n\n“I knew that this meet was going to be competitive and I’m happy about how I placed. I think I came in sitting ninth and I finished fifth. So, I over performed where I was sitting and that’s a goal of every single meet,” Vedral said.\n\nMen’s Weight Throw Achievements \n Following his victory at the Show-Me Showdown, Sam Innes continued his strong season by winning the event with a throw of 22.67 meters, marking his second win of the year and ranking among the top three throws in school history. Garik Pozecki placed behind him with a throw of 20.49 meters, while Clayton Kamp finished seventh at 17.25 meters.\n\n“We kind of knew what we needed to work on, so we’re one step closer to that. Hopefully [we] just build on it now. We all got our eyes on the Arkansas meet in two weeks,” Innes said.\n\nWomen’s Weight Throw Highlights\n\nSophomore Reagan Kimrey took second place with a throw of 19.71 meters. Petra Gombas followed in fifth at 19.24 meters and Ames Burton rounded out the top 10 with a ninth-place finish after throwing 16.94 meters.\n\nSenior Yordanos Zelinski made his season debut in the 5,000 meters, placing second with a time of 14:57.03.\n\nSenior Dillon Leacock finished fourth in the 60-meter hurdles, running a personal-best time of 8.09 seconds to improve on his previous mark of 8.14.\n\nSenior Robert Hines placed third in the 60-meter dash with a time of 6.86 seconds, edging his previous mark during the Alexis Jarret Invitational of 6.87.\n\nAlthough Hines scratched during the 200-meter dash, we will see him race tomorrow during the men’s 60m dash.\n\nThe Tigers claimed first place in the distance medley relay with a winning time of 9:45.05. River Hardman, Dillon Leacock, Andrew Simard and Ethan Hogan combined for a strong team effort to secure the victory.\n\nThe distance squad will make its primary appearance, highlighted by the mile events. On the men’s side, River Hardman, Andrew Simard, Tyler Freiner and Drew Rogers are slated to compete. The women’s mile will feature Allison Newman, Natalie Barnard, Lily Ginsberg and Maleah Eggers.\n\nSeveral Tigers will also take part in the 3,000 meters. The women’s field includes Suzy Lecoutre, Monica Wanjiku, Kobi Walker, Mirriam Chepkirui and Elissa Barnard. Competing in the men’s 3,000 meters are Rogers, Elijah Limo, Finn Russell, Joshua Allison, Andrew Hauser, Carter Spradling, Ethan Zuber and Ethan Hogan.\n\nZelinski will continue his invitational schedule in the 5,000 meters, while Morgan Yeomans is set to compete in the 800 meters. In the field events, Marlena Tresnjo will look to extend her success in the high jump after winning the event at each of the past two meets.\n\nTo read more about Missouri’s Track and Field team, follow @Rock MNation and @SophBleedsLA on X.com.",

    "title": "Where will Framber Valdez finally sign? Putting all 30 teams into tiers, from no chance to the favorites",
    "description": "The top starting pitcher in this free-agent class is still available with spring training around the corner.",
    "fullText": "Pitchers and catchers are due at spring training in less than two weeks, yet several of the top free-agent arms still don’t know which complex in Arizona or Florida they’ll be reporting to. Eight of the 18 starting pitchers on our Top 50 free agents list remain unsigned with February fast approaching. Chief among them is No. 8 overall and our top hurler in the class, left-hander Framber Valdez.\n\nOver the past four seasons, Valdez ranks second in MLB in innings, behind only Logan Webb, and fifth in fWAR behind Zack Wheeler, Webb, Tarik Skubal and Kevin Gausman. Among 59 pitchers with at least 500 innings pitched during that span, Valdez’s 3.22 ERA ranks seventh, and his 3.29 FIP is ninth. His terrific sinker and top-notch curveball have consistently combined for elite groundball rates, which are clearly his headlining trait as a pitcher, rather than strikeout totals or pinpoint command.\n\nAll of this has made Valdez a rotation staple for the Houston Astros during the back half of their dynastic run atop the American League, which has afforded him ample opportunities to pitch in October. He ranks sixth among active pitchers in postseason innings (85.0) and has delivered several stellar high-stakes starts along the way, including an eight-inning effort in the 2021 ALCS and two terrific outings in the 2022 World Series. His more recent showings in 2023 and 2024 weren’t quite as effective, but Valdez is unquestionably battle-tested, and that experience should appeal to teams.\n\nSo what’s the hold up? Why would a pitcher of this caliber linger on the market this long? For starters, the number of teams willing to dole out a nine-figure deal was limited from the get-go. If Valdez and his representation are targeting a contract somewhere between what the two other top arms received (5 years, $130M for Ranger Suarez; 7 years, $210M for Dylan Cease), a wholly reasonable ask considering his track record, that immediately shrinks the pool of possible landing spots to almost exclusively big-market clubs.\n\nAge is also paramount in free agency, and Valdez, who turned 32 in November, is two years older than Cease and Suarez. Teams might question how much longer Valdez will be in his prime, particularly with him coming off his worst season as a full-time rotation member. His 2025 wasn’t a bad campaign by any stretch, but unlike in each of the previous three seasons, Valdez didn’t receive any down-ballot Cy Young votes. He also finished poorly, posting a 5.20 ERA in the second half as Houston missed the postseason for the first time since 2016.\n\nThere’s also speculation that the cross-up incident in September involving his catcher, Cesar Salazar, has made some teams wary of Valdez’s character. Whether that’s a driving factor behind hesitance to sign him is unknown, but it’s worth noting that Valdez and his agency made it a priority early in free agency to communicate to clubs about the pitcher’s makeup, crafting a video that helps tell his story and highlights his reputation as a positive presence off the field, beyond what he brings on the mound.\n\nWhatever the exact confluence of reasons that brought us to this point, it’s hard to imagine Valdez will remain unsigned for much longer. So let’s survey the entire league and contemplate possible fits for the left-hander, organized into tiers from least to most likely landing spots.\n\nHere we have a wide-ranging tier including contending teams, rebuilding teams, ascendent teams and tough-to-decipher teams. Some of these clubs could argue against signing Valdez based on the pitching personnel already in place or more urgent needs elsewhere on the roster.\n\nMore pertinently, this cohort shares the most relevant trait in any free-agency exercise: They represent the current dozen lowest payrolls in MLB, a natural distinction for determining which clubs are exceedingly unlikely to splurge on a premium free agent such as Valdez, especially one with qualifying offer attached (beyond the financial considerations, small-market clubs are often particularly reluctant to forfeit draft picks). Even as we try to expand our horizons to consider potential sleepers for Valdez, any of these teams emerging to sign the southpaw would be downright stunning.\n\nThese four contenders with payrolls ranging from medium (Seattle) to high (Boston, Toronto) to astronomical (Los Angeles) are already loaded with rotation options that make signing Valdez illogical.\n\nMaybe Detroit wins its arbitration hearing against Tarik Skubal and then, with added payroll clarity and flexibility, directs some funds to adding a formidable co-ace alongside Skubal (and perhaps a long-term replacement in the event Skubal departs next winter). That would be cool! But don’t count on it.\n\nKansas City’s rotation is already quite left-handed, but a trade of Kris Bubic for an offensive upgrade followed by a surprise signing of Valdez could transform the Royals into AL Central favorites. It’s an unlikely sequence but a fun scenario to ponder.\n\nIf owner Arte Moreno wakes up tomorrow and decides he wants to sign a top free agent, as he has on several occasions throughout his tenure, Valdez could be an Angel. But nothing about the team’s offseason activity thus far suggests that is remotely likely.\n\nTexas’ trade for MacKenzie Gore indicates a preference to spend prospect capital rather than real dollars to add to its rotation. But if the Rangers were to shed their recently thrifty tendencies and pounce, Valdez could boost their rotation from strong to elite.\n\nValdez would be an awesome addition to a Padres rotation that is perilously thin even after they retained Michael King, but all indications are that San Diego is still operating with significant budget limitations.\n\nThe Snakes could definitely use rotation help, but as long as Zac Gallen also remains unsigned, Arizona bringing him back on a new deal feels more likely than the team forfeiting a draft pick and paying way more for a fresher face.\n\nThere is an intriguing commonality among these three clubs: All three have frontline starters coming back from injury who likely won’t be ready to begin the season (Justin Steele in Chicago, Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodón in New York, Zack Wheeler in Philadelphia). The Cubs (Edward Cabrera) and Yankees (Ryan Weathers) have already made trades to fortify their starting staffs to a degree, while Philadelphia appears content to hold down the fort with its internal options until Wheeler is back.\n\nIs there still room — and time — for one of these big-market clubs to flex their financial muscles and add an impact starter anyway? Maybe!\n\nIt’s natural to circle back to the incumbent club when free agencies drag on, but at no point this offseason did it seem realistic that Valdez would stay in Houston, and the Astros have added several other arms (Tatsuya Imai, Mike Burrows, Ryan Weiss, Nate Pearson) in an effort to restock their rotation. A reunion here would be pretty shocking.\n\nThe recent acquisition of Freddy Peralta might’ve changed the calculus for New York in a possible pursuit of Valdez, as the need for a frontline starter is certainly lessened now. And you could also look at the current depth chart, which features a glut of rotation candidates, and argue that another major addition to the unit isn’t necessary. At the same time, Valdez would represent a sensible and exciting finish to New York’s dramatic offseason roster overhaul.\n\nFor all the buzz about Peralta and star rookie righty Nolan McLean, major questions persist about every other rotation candidate based on last season’s showings — and acting like McLean is a sure bet based on his limited sample might be risky. As one of the few teams with the kind of spending power to add impact talent regardless of an imperfect roster fit, the Mets shouldn’t be content with their current mound options, especially in the ultra-competitive NL East. David Stearns is reportedly reluctant to give out a long-term deal to any pitcher, but maybe owner Steve Cohen can enable a shorter-term, high-AAV offer to entice Valdez to come to Queens.\n\nAtlanta has quietly spent a healthy chunk of change this offseason as it looks to bounce back from a miserable 2025, committing more than $100 million to seven free agents to help bolster the bullpen and lineup. The rotation, meanwhile, remains untouched.\n\nThe Braves’ top four arms — Chris Sale, Spencer Schwellenbach, Spencer Strider and Reynaldo Lopez — are all wildly talented, but all have missed significant time due to injury in recent seasons. Adding Valdez, a workhorse who offers frontline upside, would be an excellent way to add some certainty to this fragile unit and is the kind of aggressive move that might be necessary if the Braves want to jump back into the NL East melee with the Phillies and Mets.\n\nThe Giants continue to communicate that they are content with their rotation after the modest additions of Tyler Mahle and Adrian Houser, but the longer this drags on, the more San Francisco looks like the team that could benefit the most from finally opening up the wallet and adding a game-changer on the mound. The Giants’ starting staff currently ranks 22nd in projected fWAR per FanGraphs’ Depth Charts. Adding Valdez — projected to be a top-15 starter in MLB — could single-handedly vault them into the top half of rotations league-wide and significantly strengthen their case as a 2026 playoff team.\n\nPairing Valdez with ace Logan Webb would also give them arguably the two best groundball pitchers in the sport, a duo who could thrive with terrific infielders Matt Chapman and Willy Adames playing behind them. The Cubs and Red Sox eventually quieted their critics by acting like the big-market clubs they are and making splashes in free agency, and there’s still time for the Giants to do the same. And unlike Chicago and Boston, who are coming off postseason appearances, San Francisco should have even more urgency to do so, considering its complete lack of relevance in the NL playoff picture since its outlier 107-win campaign in 2021.\n\nThis team has been the most obvious Valdez match for months. President of baseball operations Mike Elias has plenty of familiarity with Valdez, having been in Houston’s front office during his rise to the majors, and now Elias is heading an Orioles club that hasn’t been shy about its intentions to bolster its rotation this winter.\n\nTrading for Shane Baz was an important step in that direction, but that move didn’t satisfy Baltimore’s need to acquire a pitcher it could feel confident giving the ball for a postseason start — and adding Valdez would. To be clear, this Orioles offseason should be considered a success even without Valdez, but adding the left-hander would emphatically punctuate a winter spent strengthening virtually every portion of the roster.\n\nUntil Valdez signs elsewhere, this is the match we’ll be waiting to see come to fruition.",

    "description": "The Dodgers added experienced bullpen depth by signing right-hander Ryder Ryan to a minor league contract ahead of the 2026 season.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers have continued to reinforce their pitching depth by agreeing to a minor league contract with right-hander Ryder Ryan, according to reports, with the deal including an $800,000 salary if he reaches the Major League roster.\n\nThe Dodgers have signed the brother of RHP River Ryan, Ryder Ryan, to a minor league deal, sources tell @TheAthletic.\n\nRyan was signed to the Pittsburgh Pirates, but spent 2025 in Triple-A, posting a 4.73 ERA in 72 IP.\n\nIf he makes the majors, he will earn $800k.\n\n— Adrian Medina (@AdrianMedina_16) January 30, 2026\n\nWhile the signing does not immediately impact the Dodgers’ crowded bullpen picture, it provides the organization with another experienced arm as spring training approaches.\n\nRyan, 30, is the older brother of Dodgers right-hander River Ryan and has pitched parts of two Major League seasons. He appeared with the Seattle Mariners in 2023 and the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2024, combining for 21 2/3 innings at the big league level.\n\nDuring that stretch, Ryan posted a 5.40 ERA, allowing 13 runs on 21 hits and 10 walks while striking out 19 hitters. Though his MLB sample size is limited, he has spent much of his professional career serving as reliable upper-minors depth.\n\nThe 2025 season saw Ryan pitch exclusively at Triple-A Indianapolis in the Pirates organization. Over 72 1/3 innings, he recorded a 4.73 ERA with a 19.7 percent strikeout rate and a 12.3 percent walk rate.\n\nThat campaign marked his fifth season at the Triple-A level, where he owns a career 4.42 ERA across more than 270 innings, highlighting his role as a durable reliever capable of handling a heavy workload.\n\nFrom a pitch-mix standpoint, Ryan relies primarily on a fastball-slider combination. His four-seam fastball and sinker both averaged around 93 mph last season and were used frequently, but his slider remains his primary weapon, accounting for nearly half of his pitches. He also mixes in an occasional changeup, giving him enough variety to navigate lineups multiple times in relief appearances.\n\nCracking the Dodgers’ Major League bullpen will be a challenge. Los Angeles enters the season with several established relievers locked into roster spots, limiting immediate opportunities for non-roster invitees. As a result, Ryan is likely to begin the year at Triple-A Oklahoma City, where he could provide valuable depth alongside his younger brother.\n\nGiven the Dodgers’ history of cycling arms throughout a long season, Ryan’s signing fits a familiar pattern. While he may not be penciled into a major role early, his experience and durability could prove useful as the organization manages injuries and workload over the course of the 2026 campaign.",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A federal judge warned Justice Department lawyers on Friday that they were making “dangerous” and “horrifying” statements when they said the Trump Administration can decide what part of American history to display at National Park Service sites.\n\nThe sharp exchange erupted during a hearing in Philadelphia over the abrupt removal of an exhibit on the history of slavery at the site of the former President’s House on Independence Mall.\n\nThe city, which worked in tandem with the park service on the exhibit two decades ago, was stunned to find workers this month using crowbars to remove outdoor plaques, panels and other materials that told the stories of the nine people who had been enslaved there. Some of the history had only been unearthed in the past quarter-century.\n\n“You can’t erase history once you’ve learned it. It doesn’t work that way,” said Senior U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe, an appointee of President George W. Bush.\n\nThe removal followed President Donald Trump’s executive order “restoring truth and sanity to American history” at the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks. In Philadelphia, the materials were put in a pickup truck and then into storage, leading Rufe to voice concerns about whether they were damaged.\n\n“Although many people feel strongly about this (exhibit) one way, other people may disagree or feel strongly another way,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory in den Berken.\n\n“Ultimately,” he said, “the government gets to choose the message it wants to convey.”\n\n“That is a dangerous statement you are making. It is horrifying to listen to,” she said. “It changes on the whims of someone in charge? I’m sorry, that is not what we elected anybody for.”\n\nRufe heard hours of testimony Friday from former city officials who had helped plan the exhibit, and said the city had kicked in $1.5 million toward the project. She plans to visit both the storage area and the site before ruling on the city’s request to have the exhibit restored. But she asked the Justice Department lawyers to ensure that nothing else is disturbed.\n\nIn den Berken said the Park Service routinely changes its exhibits and tours, and argued that the government cannot be forced to tell a certain story. But lawyers for the city and other advocates said the park service does not have “carte blanche” to interpret the nation’s history as it sees fit.\n\nThe exhibit includes biographical details about the nine people enslaved by George and Martha Washington at the presidential mansion. Now, only their names — Austin, Paris, Hercules, Christopher Sheels, Richmond, Giles, Oney Judge, Moll and Joe — remain engraved into a cement wall.\n\nMichael Coard, an attorney representing one of the advocacy groups supporting the exhibit, said the president was ignoring the power held by Congress, the judiciary and the American people.\n\n“It’s one thing to whisper that type of dictatorial power. But to send lawyers into a public courtroom to make that argument is absolutely frightening,” he said. “I'm really worried about the state of America.”\n\nRufe said she planned to rule quickly, noting the surge of visitors expected to visit the nation's birthplace this year to mark its 250th anniversary of being founded.\n\nResidents who have visited the site have shed tears, left flowers and left a handmade sign that said “Slavery was real.”",

    "description": "Here are the latest details in the legal dispute.",
    "fullText": "Nearly nine months after a country music legend's son and daughter-in-law were slapped with a lawsuit over squirmy construction payout claims, the San Antonio-based builder and George Strait Jr. and his wife, Tamara, struck a closed-door deal to get the matter out of court. Though, both parties are sitting silent on the terms of the resolution.\n\nOn May 5, Build Modern – a San Antonio firm responsible for several modern builds around the center of San Antonio – the junior Strait and wife to task in Kendall County district court. Build Modern Owner David Robertson accused to couple of more than $100,000 in damages when he said they refused to pay for services, ending their contract with a negative balance due to delays he says they caused.\n\nNow, the local builder is withdrawing his suit after months of private remediation efforts.\n\n\"[Build Modern] and all defendants have resolved all claims between them at this time, [Build Modern] no longer wishes to pursue his claims against all defendants, Tamara Strait, George Strait Jr., and Heritage Oaks Trust, through its trustee, Kalyn Carroll,\" Robertson's order to withdrawal his lawsuit reads, filed in Kendall County north of San Antonio in early January.\n\nA judge signed the order two days after filing on January 8. MySA spoke with a representative for both parties, and both declined to comment on the case resolution. So, details behind the deal struck between the two remains a mystery.\n\nHowever, previous court filings show Build Modern was seeking at least the $57,000 it claims is for unpaid construction services and $67,662 left in the contractual balance, totaling $124,662. Robertson also wanted the Straits and the trust to pay for costs accrued in the lawsuit and exemplary damages in an amount determined by a jury.\n\nIt was at the behest of George (\"Bubba\") and Tamara Strait that the case went to a private arbitration. The couple and their attorneys pointed to a common clause in the remodel project – one which was penned between Build Modern and the couple to remodel their Texas Hill Country home – which requires some form of mediation or arbitration effort prior to filing a lawsuit.\n\nThat arbitration order was signed by a judge on June 3, meaning private negotiations over settling the dispute lasted about seven months.\n\nAccording to court documents filed before a judge ordered private remediation, the renovation project was to cost $221,225, and was expected to wrap up by November 1 of 2024. However, the company said Tamara Strait made several decisions that delayed the completion, including ordering backordered cabinets that weren't slated for delivery until December, reneging on a flooring with delayed delivery after it was already partially installed and hiring her own subcontractors that were supposed to be included in the contract with Build Modern.\n\n\"Tamara Strait engaged in a series of actions which resulted in economic damage to [Build Modern] and made it impossible for [the company] to complete the project in a timely manner,\" the firm asserts. \"Most importantly, she repeatedly delayed making payment when payment requests were presented to her.\"\n\nAfter allegedly failing to make several scheduled payments, reportedly hiring subcontractors out from under Build Modern and delaying the process, the lawsuit accuses the Straits of colluding with Heritage Oaks Trust to end the contract in December because the project exceeded the November 1 deadline. Build Modern says Tamara Strait was \"fully aware\" of the updated project timeline and why it had to be pushed back.\n\nThis article originally published at George Strait's son, daughter-in-law quietly settle lawsuit after mediation.",

    "description": "Scientists are keeping a close eye.",
    "fullText": "A vivid blue iceberg drifting from Antarctica is drawing scientific attention, as meltwater spreading across its surface shows the iceberg — once the world's largest — is beginning to break apart.\n\nIceberg A-23A broke off Antarctica's Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986, according to NASA. After spending decades largely stationary, it is now drifting through the South Atlantic between South America's eastern tip and South Georgia Island.\n\nAt the time of its calving, the iceberg spanned about 4,000 square kilometers, nearly twice the size of Rhode Island. However, satellite data from the U.S. National Ice Center has shown it has shrunk to roughly 1,182 square kilometers following a significant breakup in mid-2025.\n\nWhat especially concerns scientists is the iceberg's striking blue color. NASA researchers said that hue comes from meltwater pooling on the surface.\n\nSunlight passing through the waterlogged ice absorbs red light and reflects blue light back, a clear sign that the iceberg is thinning and weakening.\n\nThese changes suggest this once-massive iceberg may not last much longer. As retired scientist Chris Shuman put it, \"I certainly don't expect A-23A to last through the austral summer.\"\n\nThe breakup of massive icebergs like A-23A doesn't stay confined to Antarctica. While the melting of a floating iceberg doesn't directly raise sea levels, scientists view breakups like A-23A's as warning signs of growing instability in Antarctica's ice system — particularly ice shelves that help hold back land-based glaciers that contribute to rising sea levels.\n\nMelting ice also disrupts ocean systems that marine life relies on. Shifts in temperature and salinity can push fish into new regions or reduce populations, threatening seafood supplies and the livelihoods of fishermen. In some areas, warmer waters may also allow harmful bacteria and diseases to spread more easily.\n\nScientists have already documented Antarctic ice shelves becoming slushy and unstable. Likewise, Antarctica's plant life is expanding due to rising temperatures.\n\nTogether, these changes contribute to more extreme weather, putting pressure on public health, community safety, and local economies.\n\nScientists are keeping a close eye on icebergs like A-23A with satellite imagery, which helps them see how quickly ice loss can reshape oceans and coastlines.\n\nWould you feel safe living close to a nuclear power plant?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThose insights inform planning efforts for coastal communities already dealing with higher seas and more destructive storms.\n\nWhat happens at the poles isn't as far removed from daily life as it seems. Decisions about energy systems and long-term infrastructure influence how quickly warming trends continue — and how prepared communities are for the changes already underway.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Copper has joined the metals party in recent weeks and is now selling off in sympathy with gold and silver, pulling back from recent highs and potentially headed for a larger correction in the coming months.\n\nAfter touching a record above $14,000 per ton on Thursday, copper dropped sharply to around $13,800 on Friday, in line with downward moves in precious metals. While copper is mainly an industrial metal, it's seen dizzying price spirals similar to those that have sent gold and silver surging to new highs in the last year.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts, who recently lifted their copper price target for the first half of 2026, have warned that a second-quarter correction is ahead.\n\nThe analysts said in a note this week that a US tariff decision on copper could trigger a deeper drawdown for the metal. Goldman expects an update on refined copper to come by mid-2026.\n\nPresident Trump declared a 50% tariff on all imports of semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products in July 2025, fueling stockpiling in the US.\n\nThe analysts expect a refined copper tariff mid-2026, which would \"likely signal the end of US stockpiling and return focus to the global market surplus.\"\n\nCopper has been riding the broader move in metals, alongside gold and silver, influenced by investors turning to commodities amid worries about geopolitical worries, including ongoing US-China trade tensions and a US Dollar moves.\n\nCopper's recent run-up has also been fueled in part by durable demand for the metal, in particular, its role in the AI infrastructure buildout.\n\nJosé Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider that \"part of the enthusiasm\" around copper is \"due to nationalistic tailwinds, as investors in Beijing want to hold the asset that its country could use more of in the competitive AI race\" rather than concrete demand.\n\nCopper's recent rise has been driven in large part by speculative trading rather than the metal's fundamentals, with traders in China leading the charge.\n\n\"It's become quite evident that the surge in copper prices has been increasingly fueled by speculation, rather than strong underlying fundamentals,\" Capital Economics senior commodities economist Kieran Tompkins told Business Insider.\n\n\"This is particularly the case in China, where indicators of the health of underlying demand suggest it is actually quite soft,\" Tompkins added, noting the recent price action signals \"a disconnect between the underlying balance of supply and demand.\"\n\nGoldman commodities analyst Eoin Dinsmore said the price of copper has \"overshot its fair fundamental level,\" and a refined copper tariff from Trump could be a \"catalyst for a correction.\"\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also raised valuation concerns, stating that the dynamics of copper supply and demand suggest the metal \"is trading at nosebleed levels.\"\n\nAnalysts have expressed similar concerns for both gold and silver, which have rallied sharply in the last year. Some fear the gains have become detached from the usual fundamental drivers of the metals' price, with experts eyeing a rally driven mainly by FOMO similar to meme stocks.",

    "fullText": "Sporting goods retailers, including the broader hunting and fishing category, have struggled over the past few years. That's at least partially because the internet has nibbled away at their sales.\n\nAs a casual tennis player, for example, I used to have to go to a sporting goods retailer if I needed tennis balls, which created the possibility that I might buy something else. That's a small sale lost for the retailer, but also a larger opportunity to convert a purchase into something bigger.\n\n\"Research estimates a nearly 4% decline in spending at brick-and-mortar stores because of the rise of e-commerce,\" according to a Stanford University research report written in 2017.\n\nOnline spending has roughly doubled to 15.8% in the third quarter of 2025 since that report study was conducted, according to Census.gov's quarterly retail online sales report released in December 2025.\n\nRetail foot traffic also dipped by 1.4% to recreational and sporting goods stores in 2024, according to Placer.ai data, while overall retail foot traffic across all retail climbed by 0.4%.\n\nLower foot traffic and not having a high-end online presence has meant the end for a number of sporting goods and outdoors brands over the past year.\n\nNow Big Rock Sports has joined that list by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nWhile it's not a household name, Big Rock Sports was a major player behind the scenes as a distributor. The company shared some of its business model on its now-defunct website, which was visited through the Internet Archive.\n\n\"Big Rock Sports carries over 200,000 product SKUs and services more than 20,000 fishing, shooting, camping, taxidermy and marine retailers across the US, Canada, the Caribbean and eight other countries,\" the company shared.\n\nThe distributor had a long history.\n\n\"The history of Big Rock Sports goes back more than 60 years to the founding of All-Sports Supply in Portland, OR. At that time, sporting goods was a much more personal business, and distributors knew the names of their retailers as well as their families,\" it added.\n\n(All Star Sports was founded in 1995, making Big Rock Sports history go back 71 years.)\n\nThe company specialized in firearms, firearm accessories, and fishing gear.\n\nBig Rock Sports, LLC filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of North Carolina, according to BKAlerts.com.\n\nThe Chapter 7 filing was voluntary and is being handled by a court‑appointed trustee, according to documents filed on PacerMonitor.\n\nThe case, under case # 5:26-bk-00208 is being overseen by Judge Joseph N. Callaway, added PacerMonitor.\n\nAs of the filing, the case is listed as “no asset,” indicating limited or no estate assets available for distribution, reported BKAlerts.com.\n\nBig Rock’s operations included numerous trade names and divisions in the sporting goods and outdoor supply space, according to Inforuptcy.\n\nPrior to the Chapter 7 filing, related Canadian operations were liquidated, all employees were terminated, and inventory was being sold off under a liquidation process, added Isolvency Insider Canada.\n\nSecured lenders (e.g., bank agents) and unsecured creditors are not expected to be fully repaid given the company’s limited realizable assets, added Isolvency Insider Canada.",

    "description": "Twanna Harris explains the emotional and financial challenges of parenting NFL athletes and why she founded League of Industry Moms.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Twanna Harris, the founder of League of Industry Moms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a mom to two athletes. Between my husband and me, we have four kids, two sons and two daughters. William, my oldest, has played for the Washington Commanders for seven years. My son Trey is what we call our \"next kid up.\" He is at Sam Houston State University, and he's started training for the NFL draft.\n\nMy husband played in the NFL, so I believe our family is uniquely equipped to navigate this process and provide structure and discipline.\n\nHowever, there were things that surprised me, even though I was not expecting them.\n\nInjuries are actually the last thing I'm worried about.\n\nI am the one who has guided my sons to where they are today. I researched programs, coordinated the move to other schools when necessary, identified trainers, researched colleges that provide the best opportunity, and provided the necessary financial, emotional, and mental support to properly navigate the transition from high school to college, in preparation for making it to the pros.\n\nWhen going through that transition, I felt like the sentiment was, \"Thanks so much for your contribution, but we'll take it from here.\" There weren't conversations with us parents about how to navigate and sustain salaries once they went pros, for example.\n\nAdditionally, I didn't get any coaching or direction on how to choose the best advisor or counsel for your athlete's specific situation.\n\nI helped one of my sons go through a rough patch, which had isolating moments, and I knew I couldn't be the only mother trying to figure this out by myself. This drove my desire for community, and after speaking with numerous mothers of athletes, I quickly realized that what I experienced was more of the norm than the exception.\n\nBecause there's no blueprint or guidebook, I launched my collective, League of Industry Moms, to crowdsource support and resources to help us navigate this terrain together.\n\nWe look into everything from media training to financial literacy, such as how kids should set up their finances for when they are 50, and helping them understand the significance of their spending for the next five years.\n\nTypically, a kid is not celebrated daily for their job. But because my kids are athletes, they are — and are receiving death threats at the same time. Nothing feels real anymore, and it feels like everyone's coming to get a piece of your child. One day, we're in this together as a family, and the next, your kid is saying, \"Hey Mom, I'm an adult now, I don't need your permission to take a $425,000 check.\"\n\nBecause they are legally adults, there's no requirement for brands to speak with parents. There can be a false sense of reality here because, early on, players receive a substantial amount of resources, attention, and money. There's no player association or union, so I've partnered with an organization called athletes.org to make sure we are educating parents going through this.\n\nMy husband and I have raised our kids to be extraordinarily independent. The whole point is to raise kids to be self-sufficient, but this is a different kind of survival. Someone whose frontal lobe has yet to develop is being handed a check for millions, and they are expected to have the wherewithal to know what to do with that.\n\nThe most important thing my husband and I wanted to teach our athletes is the art of listening and the discernment gained through that process to detect when someone might be motivated by the wrong intentions or when something they are saying simply doesn't sound right.",

    "title": "A home theater expert shares 8 upgrades to make for the ultimate Super Bowl watch party",
    "description": "The Super Bowl is the perfect excuse to upgrade your home theater. These extra-large TVs and powerful soundbars are ideal for watching the big game.",
    "fullText": "The Super Bowl is just around the corner, making it the perfect time to upgrade your home theater. But piecing together a new system can be daunting, which is why I'm here to help. I've been reviewing video and audio gear for over a decade, so I know exactly what you need to put together a killer setup for the big game.\n\nFrom extra-large TVs and Dolby Atmos soundbars to spacious media consoles and affordable digital antennas, I've rounded up all the home theater essentials needed for an immersive Super Bowl watch party. Many top Super Bowl TVs and soundbars are also on sale, so you can score solid discounts ahead of kick-off.\n\nAnd though most of my picks are available with speedy Amazon Prime delivery, be sure to check the shipment estimates to ensure they arrive in time for the game on February 8.\n\nThe central piece of any killer Super Bowl setup is a big-screen TV. There are several great displays available, but two models stand out for their overall value and performance when watching sports: the TCL QM7K QLED and the Samsung S95F OLED.\n\nThe QM7K is a fantastic midrange TV with excellent brightness for the money. It's also available in massive screen sizes, including a surprisingly affordable 98-inch model. Meanwhile, the S95F is a premium TV with higher contrast, wider viewing angles, and the most effective anti-glare screen I've seen. Those features make it ideal for watch parties, as all your guests get a high-quality view no matter where they sit.\n\nYou can learn more about both models in our guide to the best sports TVs. And for more display recommendations, check out our guide to all the best TVs you can buy.\n\nThe TCL QM7K is an excellent midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED backlight delivers high brightness, and it has better contrast control and wider viewing angles than older models.\n\nThe S95F is Samsung's latest flagship 4K TV. It's one of the top high-end displays available, utilizing an advanced QD-OLED panel with a matte anti-glare screen.\n\nGreat picture quality is only one part of an immersive gameday upgrade. Nothing makes it feel like you're actually in the stadium quite like the sound of cheering fans coming from all directions. And that's where a good soundbar comes in.\n\nIf you have the room for a multi-piece system, I recommend the high-end Samsung Q990F. This package includes a soundbar, dedicated rear speakers, and a wireless subwoofer. The Super Bowl is being streamed in Dolby Atmos this year, and the Q990F supports that format. Atmos enables a 3D surround-sound effect with audio spread around and above your ears. If you want a more affordable and compact option, the stand-alone Bose Smart Soundbar is also a good buy. It's not as powerful as the Q990F, but it still supports Dolby Atmos and creates a wide sense of immersion for its space-saving size.\n\nYou can learn more about both models in our guides to the best soundbars and best Dolby Atmos soundbars.\n\nThe Q990F is Samsung's latest flagship soundbar system. It includes everything you need for a complete 11.1.4-channel Dolby Atmos surround sound experience with powerful audio and plenty of wireless music streaming options.\n\nThe new Bose Smart Soundbar is a refreshed version of the brand's Smart Soundbar 600. It carries over the same design and excellent Dolby Atmos audio performance while adding an AI enhanced dialogue mode and the ability to use Bose Ultra Open Earbuds as rear speakers.\n\nIf you're buying a new home theater setup for the Super Bowl and need a place to put your TV or other entertainment devices, a reliable media console is a worthwhile investment. Our guide to the best TV stands features several recommendations for different spaces and budgets, including two options that I use myself: The Walker Edison Wren and Ikea Brimnes.\n\nI have the Walker Edison Wren in my living room, and I love its simple style and large, open cubbies, which are perfect for storing components like an AV receiver or game console, while still allowing for good airflow. Meanwhile, I keep the Brimnes in my office and like its sleek design and handy storage drawers. Both stands are also wide enough to accommodate most TV models in sizes up to 85 inches.\n\nThis TV console from Walker Edison is wide enough for TVs as big as 80 inches. It’s available in different wood tones and has six open-storage compartments.\n\nIkea’s Brimnes stand has a wide design that can accommodate larger TVs, and it has three drawers for ample storage space.\n\nFor a cleaner look, you could opt to wall-mount your TV instead of placing it on a stand. Our guide to the best TV wall mounts includes options for every budget. In particular, I recommend the Sanus Vlf728 and Mounting Dream MD2268 for most needs.\n\nThe Sanus is the pricier option, but it offers full motion so you can extend the TV from the wall, tilt, and swivel it. This is super-handy if you need to reposition the screen for watch parties so guests get a better view. It also supports screens up to 90 inches and up to 125 pounds. Meanwhile, the Mounting Dream is a good budget option, but it's more limited. It can only tilt and is rated for TVs up to 75 inches.\n\nThis full-motion mount is pricey but can extend a whopping 28 inches, tilt 15 degrees, and swivel 57 degrees from left to right.\n\nThis affordable TV mount is built for screens up to 75 inches and allows you to tilt the screen down as much as eight degrees.\n\nThe Super Bowl is being broadcast on NBC this year, which means you can tune in with a simple digital TV antenna — no paid subscription required. NBC is offered as a free local channel via over-the-air broadcast towers in most areas. All you need to do is ensure you get a good signal at your location and hook up an antenna to the coaxial port on your TV. You can check channels available in your area through sites like Atennaweb.org.\n\nI recommend the Channel Master Flat Antenna for most needs. It's affordable and features a slim design that sticks right on your wall. If you prefer an option that you can rest on a media console, the Mohu Gateway Plus includes a tabletop base. It also has an amplifier, which could improve reception in locations farther from broadcast towers. You can find more recommendations in our guide to the best indoor TV antennas.\n\nChannel Master's FLATenna 35 Duo is one of the most affordable antennas on the market, and it delivers great reception for local channels.\n\nRather than wall-mounting it, this sleek, amplified antenna is designed to rest on any surface near your TV.\n\nIf you prefer to stream the game, you can watch the Super Bowl via Peacock or any live TV service that includes NBC. Peacock plans start at $8 a month, but you need Premium ($11 a month) or Premium Plus ($17 a month) to stream live sports. In addition to the Super Bowl, Peacock is home to tons of NBCUniversal shows and movies, as well as originals produced exclusively for the service. Meanwhile, for those who want a full cord-cutting alternative to cable, I recommend DirecTV. This live TV streaming service offers NBC across various packages, along with tons of other channels. Plans with NBC start at $40 a month.\n\nYou can learn more about Peacock in our Peacock TV guide, and you can learn more about DirecTV in our guide to the best live TV streaming services.\n\nPeacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nAll modern smart TVs have a built-in streaming platform, but the interface that comes with your TV may not be your preferred one. That's where a stand-alone streaming player could come in handy as an upgrade. For instance, if you're eying Samsung's S95F but aren't a fan of the brand's Tizen interface, you can simply buy a Roku, Google streamer, or Fire TV to handle all your Super Bowl streaming needs instead.\n\nMy favorite of the bunch is the Roku Ultra, since it supports every major video and audio format, offers a simple, snappy layout, and comes with a great remote that features backlit keys, hands-free voice search, a location chime, and a rechargeable battery. But if you're plugged into Amazon's ecosystem and want a more compact dongle-style streamer, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is a more affordable option that plugs directly into your TV's HDMI port.\n\nYou can learn more about both models in our guide to the best streaming players.\n\nThe 2024 edition of the Roku Ultra has a new processor for speedier performance. It also comes with an updated remote with backlit keys and USB-C charging. Like previous models, this flagship streaming device supports 4K playback with HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision.\n\nThis is Amazon's top streaming stick. With its powerful processor and GPU, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is the fastest streaming device in its price range and now supports console-free Xbox gaming via Game Pass.\n\nIf you're building a home theater, there's no such thing as having too many HDMI cables. These cords are what you'll use to connect soundbars, media players, gaming consoles, and other A/V devices to your TV. Luckily, reliable cables are relatively cheap, with most six-foot cords costing about $7 to $10.\n\nI recommend opting for ultra-high-speed HDMI cables, like the Amazon Basics 48Gbps cable. This type of cable has the bandwidth to support HDMI 2.1 features like 4K/120Hz and variable refresh rate (VRR). Though those functions are only needed for gaming devices, ultra-high-speed cables cost about the same as other HDMI options, and it's best to future-proof now in case you ever need the extra speed. I also like these braided HDMI cables from Highwings, since they're built to withstand bends and wear.\n\nYou can find more specialized options in our guide to the best HDMI cables.\n\nThe AmazonBasics HDMI cable is inexpensive, available in different lengths, and supports the vast majority of modern devices.\n\nThis ultra-high-speed HDMI cable has a rugged design with anti-break SR ports and a durable, nylon-braided, tangle-free construction.",

    "description": "YouTube pulled down over a dozen AI \"spam\" channels as it looks to protect platform quality and preserve its premium pitch to TV marketers.",
    "fullText": "YouTube is telling advertisers it's the future of TV. AI spam could put that story in jeopardy.\n\nThe video platform recently shut down just over a dozen popular accounts that had been churning out AI content — featuring characters like cats and Jesus — according to an analysis from Kapwing, a video editing platform. Some of the channels were picking up millions of views before going dark.\n\nIn November, Kapwing published a report that estimated 21% YouTube's feed was AI-generated videos.\n\n\"YouTube doesn't allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community,\" a YouTube spokesperson said when reached for comment on the removals.\n\nThis month, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said cutting down on low-quality AI content was one of the platform's 2026 priorities.\n\n\"To reduce the spread of low-quality AI content, we're actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combating spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low-quality, repetitive content,\" he said.\n\nIts parent company, Google, is one of the main innovators in AI with products like Veo 3 and Nano Banana. But YouTube needs to balance its embrace of AI with its case to brands to buy ads on its platform instead of linear TV. In recent years, the company has hosted NewFronts, content showcases, and other events to highlight its premium content slate to marketers. If repetitive AI spam gobbles up more watch time, that pitch could start to lose its luster.\n\n\"Advertisers want to advertise against quality content,\" said Shira Lazar, a content creator and founder of the media brand What's Trending. YouTube wouldn't be able to charge premium ad rates \"if the platform was just filled with AI slop,\" she said.\n\nOther social entertainment apps like TikTok and Instagram are facing a similar flood of AI videos.\n\nTikTok even added a special toggle that lets users decide how much generative AI they see in their feed. Neither company is making as direct an appeal for TV ad budgets, though, even if Instagram hopes it can capture television eyeballs.\n\nYouTube, meanwhile, is the top streaming platform among US TV viewers, beating out streamers like Netflix and Disney in measurement firm Nielsen's December analysis.",

    "description": "Chinos walk the fine line between formal and casual, making them ideal for the office. Here are our top-tested pairs for business casual men's styling.",
    "fullText": "Suits are an easy choice when the dress code calls for formal attire, but they can be overkill in business-casual settings. You need wardrobe staples that'll cover your bases for when the stakes aren't quite as high, and that's where the best chinos for men come in.\n\nInvesting in the best business casual work clothes for men will inevitably include a reliable pair of chinos, so we've listed the top pairs, including those we've tested ourselves, to help you find what are sure to be your next favorite pants to live in. A tried-and-true favorite is the Bonobos Chinos 2.0, and for a more affordable option, we recommend the Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino.\n\nBonobos' trued and true chinos have a luxe feel that adds instant polish to your wardrobe.\n\nThe lightweight performance fabric has the subtle texture of a wool dress pant, but feels like your favorite yoga pant. Designed to look clean on the leg in a fit that tapers at the hem and sits neatly on the shoe.\n\nThis pair is made-to-measure and can be customized with interchangeable pockets, pleats, and button details.\n\nThe Bonobos Chinos 2.0 are highly regarded as among the best chinos for men for their super-luxe feel. The Italian milled cotton is soft and retains a vibrant hue, even after several rounds through the washing machine. A major perk is the option to choose from a wide range of colors, shapes and sizes. These range from 28 to 46 for waist, and from 28 to 36 for inseam lengths. You can choose between a tailored, slim, slim tapered, or athletic fit. Then, you can take your pick of 16 colors. These are more polished-looking chinos with crisp lines, but are worth having for a variety of occasions between business-casual and formal events.\n\nThe Quince direct-to-consumer business model makes their prices competitive, despite the quality of its apparel exceeding our expectations for basic wardrobe essentials. The Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino's value will become apparent the more you wear them, with a four-way stretch twill that provides the same flexibility as you'd expect from joggers. Plus, they're wrinkle-resistant, so you can pull them out as needed. Chinos that are this deceptively comfortable mean you can get the most use out of them anywhere along the spectrum of casual to semi-formal. \n\nRead our full Quince review.\n\nAs you may be able to guess from the brand's name, Indochino makes some of the best chinos for men. A fitting expert from one of their many showrooms can tell you your precise size in the Houndslow chinos, but if you can't make it to a storefront, their site has an in-depth tutorial on home measuring. Once you've found your perfect fit, you can further personalize them with custom pleats, hems, pockets, buttons, and belt loops. At $99, the Houndslows are also a great value for the high-quality, perfectly sized chinos you're guaranteed by going through their detailed fit screening. \n\nRead our full Indochino chinos review.\n\nPublic Rec is known for making menswear that's polished enough for the office, but comfortable enough for everyday life, and the Dealmaker Chinos do exactly that.\n\nSimilar to the wildly popular Gamechanger Rec Pant, the Dealmaker Chinos are incredibly stretchy, wrinkle-resistant, and thanks to its The Workday 2.0 Fabric, they're also wind- and water-resistant for all-season wear.\n\nThe Public Rec Dealmaker Chinos have a classic dressy look about them, yet can move with you in all directions of daily life.\n\nWoodies Clothing took off with their high-tech dress shirts, but their super comfortable chinos have thrived in the men's workwear space, too. They can be personalized with different combinations of custom pleats, pockets, and hems. The Woodies Premium Performance Stretch Pants are amid the best chinos for people unwilling to return to stiff slacks after living in work-from-home attire. What feels almost like joggers are really formal-presenting pants that are easy to style through every season. Their soft, two-way stretch, quick drying fabric is remarkably stain repellent — just the right chinos for the accident prone.\n\nRead our full Woodies performance chinos and dress shirt review.\n\nFor many men who shop big and tall sizes, finding comfortable formal wear can pose a serious challenge. But dressing up with an athletic build doesn't have to mean feeling squeezed into a suit all day — Dockers' Ultimate Chinos will assure you that. These come in extended waist sizes with extra room in the seat and thighs so as to not constrict you, even when you're sitting for long periods of time. The four-way Smart 360 Flex™ material allows for more mobility, and the extended inseam lengths position the knee correctly before tapering off towards the hem.\n\nAs one of the undeniable symbols of Americana, Polo Ralph Lauren offers the best men's chinos, high-quality and ultimately timeless. The heritage brand offers its Stretch Slim Fit Chinos in a trim silhouette that sits low on the waist. Despite being slim from top to bottom, the cotton and elastane blend makes them soft and lightweight instead of too compressed, the way other slim fits can feel. A bonus of the slim fit is how well they factor into a high-low outfit — sleek dressy pants paired with an oversized sweater is a simple way to create a balanced contrast.\n\nMany designs from Alex Mill are uniform and minimalistic, with nuances only shown in the details. Their unisex cropped chinos are standard at first glance, but their prominent pleats, neatly cropped hems, and \"X\" belt loops give them a subtle edge on the average pair of dress pants. These have a relaxed fit that allows for slight stretching, and each pair comes in unique color variations according to their natural dye process.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "title": "More than 43,000 years ago, Neanderthals spent centuries collecting animal skulls in a cave; but archaeologists aren't sure why",
    "description": "Neanderthals repeatedly returned to the cave to store horned animal skulls, revealing this cultural tradition was transmitted over time.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNeanderthals purposefully collected and positioned horned and antlered animal skulls in a cave in what is now Spain, suggesting that these extinct human relatives had complex cultural practices over 43,000 years ago, a new study finds.\n\nDes-Cubierta cave in central Iberia was initially discovered in 2009. In 2023, researchers announced the unusual discovery of an assortment of 35 large mammal skulls inside the cave. Most jaw bones were missing, but all skulls came from horned or antlered species like steppe bison and aurochs. Over 1,400 stone tools were uncovered in the same level, all in the Mousterian style typical of Neanderthals.\n\n\"At first glance, the deposit appears chaotic,\" study first author Lucía Villaescusa Fernández, a doctoral researcher in archaeology at the University of Alcalá in Spain, told Live Science in an email. \"What initially looked like a disorganised accumulation of materials turned out to preserve a clear record of both geological processes and human activity,\" she said.\n\nThe cave experienced many rockfalls in the millennia following its use, so Villaescusa Fernández and her team teased the role of these disturbances apart from the Neanderthal activity. This confirmed the Neanderthals were collecting animal skulls over a long period of time in particularly cold periods between 135,000 and 43,000 years ago, according to a study published Jan. 3 in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.\n\n\"This distinction is essential in archaeology because understanding past human behaviour requires first identifying which parts of the archaeological record were created by people and which were shaped by nature,\" Villaescusa Fernández said.\n\nTo fill this gap, Villaescusa Fernández and her colleagues carefully mapped the location of all the archaeological remains. They then compared the rockfall debris distribution with that of the animal bones and stone tools. It became clear that the bones had been purposefully positioned within the cave. \"These materials had different origins and were not introduced into the cave by the same processes,\" Villaescusa Fernández said.\n\nAlthough the timescale cannot be directly measured, and the precise duration of the practice remains uncertain, the team also found the animal skulls had been placed in specific areas of the cave repeatedly over a prolonged period of time. This suggests that this practice may have been maintained over generations and was not directly tied to economic or subsistence needs, Villaescusa Fernández said.\n\n—Crimean Stone Age 'crayons' were used by Neanderthals for symbolic drawings, study claims\n\n—Paleolithic 'art sanctuary' in Spain contains more than 110 prehistoric cave paintings\n\n—125,000-year-old 'fat factory' run by Neanderthals discovered in Germany\n\nExactly why Neanderthals collected the skulls is unclear, but the selection, treatment and placement of horned animal skulls in a cave they did not live in \"highlights their capacity for cultural practices that are not directly related to survival,\" Villaescusa Fernández said. \"This has important implications for how we understand Neanderthal societies, particularly in terms of cultural transmission and shared traditions,\" she added.\n\n\"Too often, discussions of Neanderthal symbolism rely on fragile evidence or optimistic interpretations,\" Ludovic Slimak, an archaeologist at the University of Toulouse in France and author of the book \"The Naked Neanderthal\" (Penguin, 2024) who was not involved in the study, told Live Science by email. \"Here, the authors take a more grounded approach, testing whether the spatial organization of the remains could be explained by natural processes alone,\" he said.\n\nSlimak said that the findings of this study add new evidence to the debate over Neanderthal symbolism. \"Rather than asking whether Neanderthals were 'symbolic like us,' we should ask what kinds of meaningful behaviors they developed on their own terms. This site suggests that Neanderthal worlds of meaning existed, but they may have been structured very differently from those of Homo sapiens,\" he said.",

    "title": "The DOJ says it's releasing 3 million new Epstein files — but withholding another 200,000 pages",
    "description": "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the DOJ will withhold or redact about 200,000 pages that it has deemed protected by \"various privileges.\"",
    "fullText": "After sifting through \"two Eiffel Towers' worth\" of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Justice Department has concluded that some 200,000 documents will be at least partially withheld from the public, it said in a letter to Congress on Friday.\n\nThe disclosure came as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced at a press conference that the DOJ would be concluding its Epstein data dump with the release of another 3 million files related to the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nThree new tranches of files were published on the DOJ's website on Friday morning. Blanche said they would include 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, and that additional files would be posted on the site throughout the day.\n\nIn total, some 3.5 million files will be made public in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was passed into law in November and requires the Justice Department to publish its Epstein-related files.\n\nThe Justice Department will also withhold or redact about 200,000 pages that it says are protected by \"various privileges,\" including attorney-client, \"deliberative process,\" and \"work product\" privileges.\n\nBlanche, at the press conference Friday morning, said the Epstein files didn't contain information that would justify charges against any additional men for abusing women.\n\n\"There's this built-in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information about men, that we know about, that we're covering up or that we're choosing not to prosecute — that is not the case,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think the public and you all are going to uncover information about men who abuse women, unfortunately,\" he added.\n\nStill, victims and lawmakers are expected to be on the lookout for files that might reveal more about who else in Epstein's orbit may have been investigated, including prosecution memos, where prosecutors deliberate the strength of potential criminal charges.\n\nPreviously released files indicated that at least some Justice Department officials believed that other people associated with Epstein could be \"co-conspirators\" of his, although most of their names were redacted.\n\nSeveral emails included in an earlier disclosure referred to \"10 co-conspirators\" of Epstein who were served grand jury subpoenas.\n\nThe email exchange was partially redacted, but one email included the names of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of trafficking girls to Epstein for sex and sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Jean-Luc Brunel, an associate of Epstein who killed himself in 2022 while awaiting trial in France on rape charges.\n\nIt also named Les Wexner, a billionaire who took financial advice from Epstein and later said he regretted his relationship with the financier. Wexner has not been charged with any crime and has said Epstein deceived him.\n\nA spokesperson for Wexner didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nThe names of other people in the email were redacted.\n\nMaxwell is the only other person the Justice Department has charged with participating in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.\n\nBlanche said the Department would withhold \"anything that would jeopardize an active investigation,\" but did not say whether an ongoing investigation existed.\n\nIn November, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she asked Jay Clayton, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, to examine a request from President Donald Trump to investigate Epstein's ties to JPMorgan Chase, former President Bill Clinton, and several business leaders.\n\n\"Jay Clayton, in New York, is in charge of any potential investigations, and I'm not going to comment beyond that,\" Blanche said Friday.\n\nBlanche also said the Justice Department was not withholding any files for national security or foreign policy purposes, even though the Epstein Files Transparency Act allowed for it. And on Friday, the department asked a Manhattan judge to unseal material from the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, which represents numerous Epstein victims, that it had given to prosecutors after a grand jury subpoena.\n\nIn the letter to Congress, Bondi and Blanche write that it would provide members of the House and Senate judiciary committees with a report summarizing redactions and list \"all government officials and politically exposed persons named or referenced in the released materials.\"",

    "title": "Archaeologists Found a 1,000-Year-Old Cross That May Change the Story of Early Christianity",
    "description": "The bronze pendant, which featured a wheel cross, suggested a stronger presence in part of Europe.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA metal detectorist working near Brandenburg, Germany, uncovered a bronze wheel cross pendant dated to the 10th or 11th century C.E.\n\nThe pendant matches a mold from the same period from nearby Berlin, which was discovered about 40 years ago.\n\nTaken together, the two finds suggest that Christianity was more strongly established in Slavic Germany during this period than previously believed.\n\nA volunteer metal detectorist, working in the district of Havelland in Germany’s Brandenburg state, recently unearthed a medieval bronze wheel cross pendant with an amazing connection to an archaeological find from 40 years prior: a 1,000-year-old mold now commonly referred to as the Spandau Cross mold, which was found in nearby Spandau and used to cast small wheel crosses. You can see the pendant and the mold here.\n\nThe mold was discovered during excavations at a Slavic fort in Berling-Spandau in 1983, and is considered one of the oldest pieces of evidence of early Christianization in the region. It was found alongside the remains of an early wooden church.\n\nRemarkably, after the circle cross pendant underwent expert restoration, it perfectly matched the cavity of the Spandau Cross mold. According to the Brandenburg State Office for the preservation of Monuments, the neat fit confirms that the mold was used to make the recently unearthed bronze circle cross, and probably many others of the same kind. Both discoveries date to the same period, and together suggest that Christianity had taken root in 10th-century Slavic Germany more deeply than historians and archaeologists previously believed.\n\nMatthias Wemhoff, state archaeologist and director of the Museum of Prehistory and Early History in Berlin, called the discovery of the pendant a “lucky find.” He said in a translated statement that by considering how the mold was used to make the pendant, “we know that the blacksmith in Spandau produced for a large market and a very mobile population. Christian symbols were widespread before the Slavic uprising of 983.”\n\nIn the early 10th century, the region around Berlin and Brandenburg was inhabited by non-Christian Slavic tribes. Military campaigns brought new populations to the region, and experts believe those people brought with them fresh political organization and a new faith. Still, evidence of Christianity’s initial spread to the Slavic tribes was primarily found in historical documents, rather than physical artifacts, especially since many in the Slavic tribes rejected Christianization outright. It wasn’t until at least the 12th century, experts believe, that the region was thoroughly Christianized after its conquest by the Kingdom of Germany in the Wendish Crusade.\n\nThe wheel cross offers a tantalizing clue that Christianity may have spread more deeply in 10th-century Brandenburg than previously thought.\n\n“The discovery of a small bronze cross is not just another find among many,” Manja Schüle, Brandenburg’s minister of culture, said in a statement. “This discovery is spectacular in several respects: it fits exactly into a casting mold that was found more than 40 years ago—this is unique for an archaeological find from this period. It also exemplifies the early Christianization of Brandenburg and shows the role that Christianity already played in this region, which was predominantly settled by Slavs at the time.”\n\nAlong with the cross, volunteers uncovered coins, partially gilded jewelry fragments, and iron weapons. Schüle added that the discovery demonstrates the role volunteers can have in uncovering the history of Brandenburg. As Juliane Rangnow, the volunteer who found the cross, put it in a statement: “Holding such an artifact in your hand is like a bridge to the past.”\n\nThe mold and the cross will both be displayed at the Brandenburg State Archaeological Museum.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "O'Hara, who died on January 30, had a career spanning 50 years, including iconic roles in \"Schitt's Creek\" and \"Home Alone.\"",
    "fullText": "Catherine O'Hara, two-time Emmy Award winner and beloved movie star, has died at the age of 71.\n\nA representative for O'Hara confirmed the news to Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Her agency said in a statement that her death on Friday came after a \"brief illness,\" per The Associated Press.\n\nO'Hara has been a fixture of TV and movies since breaking out on the Canadian sketch comedy series \"SCTV\" in the early '80s alongside John Candy, Eugene Levy, Martin Short, Andrea Martin, and Rick Moranis.\n\nSince then, she's become beloved to audiences for her roles in \n\"Beetlejuice,\" \"Home Alone,\" \"Schitt's Creek,\" \"The Studio,\" \"Best in Show,\" \"The Last of Us,\" and many voiceover roles, including Sally in \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" and Susan Frankenstein in \"Frankenweenie.\"\n\nSee her legendary career in photos.\n\n\"SCTV,\" a sketch series about a fictional TV network, ran on Canadian television from 1976 to 1984 and on NBC from 1981 to 1983.\n\nO'Hara was just one of the many Canadian comedians who were introduced to American audiences through \"SCTV,\" which was something of a cult classic.\n\nShe won her first Emmy, for writing on \"SCTV,\" in 1982.\n\n\"You're lucky to work with friends, and I think it's nice to see friends together. I like knowing when people know each other and have a history; that comes across on screen. I think it's fun for people to see. It is for me,\" O'Hara told BuzzFeed about working with Levy in 2014.\n\nIn between seasons of \"SCTV,\" O'Hara was hired in 1981 to join the cast of the sixth season of \"Saturday Night Live,\" the first without creator Lorne Michaels.\n\nBut she only lasted a week. There was some speculation that it was because she didn't like head writer Michael O'Donoghue, but she shut that speculation down years later.\n\n\"There's been BS stories about I was supposedly scared by somebody,\" she told People in 2024. Instead, her departure was due to a last-minute renewal of \"SCTV.\"\n\n\"Basically I said, 'Oh, sorry, I gotta go be with my [comedy] family,'\" she said, adding, \"It all worked out the way it was supposed to.\"\n\nThe \"Day-O\" scene in \"Beetlejuice\" is perhaps the most iconic in a film filled with iconic scenes, and it all starts with O'Hara's character.\n\nO'Hara went on to work with Burton in \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" \"Frankenweenie,\" and \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\"\n\nThey were married from 1992 until her death. They shared two sons.\n\nO'Hara has been a staple in homes around the world every December for 35 years due to her role as Kevin's mom, Kate, in \"Home Alone\" and \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.\"\n\nSpecifically, she was in \"Waiting for Guffman\" in 1996, \"Best in Show\" in 2000, \"A Mighty Wind\" in 2003, and \"For Your Consideration\" in 2006.\n\nO'Hara appeared in the 2010 HBO biopic of Temple Grandin, an autistic woman who changed the way cattle were handled at ranches and slaughterhouses. Grandin was played by Claire Danes, while O'Hara played Grandin's aunt, Ann.\n\nShe was nominated for a Golden Globe and a SAG Award for her performance.\n\n\"Schitt's Creek\" became a full-blown phenomenon across its run from 2015 to 2020, and many of the show's most memorable moments came from her character, Moira.\n\nShe won in 2020 after receiving a nomination for the prior year, as well. It was her second win from eight nominations.\n\nThirty-three years after they first played mother and son in \"Home Alone,\" O'Hara was on hand to present Culkin with his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n\"Families all over the world can't let a year go by without watching and loving 'Home Alone' together. It's because of Macaulay Culkin,\" O'Hara said.\n\nCulkin thanked her for her speech and even called her \"Mama.\"\n\nO'Hara, along with Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder, returned to the town of Winter River for the legacy sequel to \"Beetlejuice,\" aptly titled \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\"\n\nInstead of being a flop, as Warner Bros. reportedly feared when they slashed its budget, this film was a huge success. Per The Numbers, it was the third-highest-grossing film of her career, behind \"Elemental\" and \"Home Alone.\"\n\nO'Hara was a double nominee at last year's Emmys, which were held in September. She was nominated for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for \"The Studio\" and outstanding guest actress in a drama series for \"The Last of Us.\"",

    "fullText": "Year: 2021, at the 63rd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Black Pumas\" by Black Pumas, \"Chilombo\" by Jhené Aiko, \"Djesse Vol. 3\" by Jacob Collier, \"Everyday Life\" by Coldplay, \"Folklore\" by Taylor Swift, \"Future Nostalgia\" by Dua Lipa, \"Hollywood's Bleeding\" by Post Malone, and \"Women in Music Pt. III\" by HAIM\n\nPerhaps Fiona Apple's greatest charm as an artist is how little effort she needs to put into creating something inimitable like \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters.\" She used a phone selfie she'd taken off-handedly \"two or three years ago\" for the album's cover art; in the middle of recording \"On I Go,\" she messed up and mumbled, \"Ah, fuck, shit.\" She kept it in the song.\n\n\"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\" doesn't quite sound like anything else, and it certainly isn't trying to.\n\nIt was also the most rapturously reviewed album of 2020, by far. It has a Metacritic score of 98/100. Pitchfork gave it an almost-unheard-of perfect rating. Various critics at The New York Times hailed Apple for her \"casually wise,\" \"fearless,\" \"artfully unguarded anthology.\" I, myself, described the album as an \"unfettered masterpiece.\"\n\nI cannot fathom what caused such a truly appalling snub, but \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\" should have been a shoo-in for AOTY.\n\nInstead, it was only nominated for best alternative music album. \"Shameika\" was also nominated for best rock song and best rock performance.\n\nYear: 2021, at the 63rd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Black Pumas\" by Black Pumas, \"Chilombo\" by Jhené Aiko, \"Djesse Vol. 3\" by Jacob Collier, \"Everyday Life\" by Coldplay, \"Folklore\" by Taylor Swift, \"Future Nostalgia\" by Dua Lipa, \"Hollywood's Bleeding\" by Post Malone, and \"Women in Music Pt. III\" by HAIM\n\nThe Weeknd's \"After Hours\" is such an immersive, sensory experience that it's almost more gloom-pop opera than album.\n\nListening to \"After Hours\" is a 56-minute commitment every time because you can't afford to miss a second. After all, you'd never leave the theatre in the middle of one of Hamlet's existentialist soliloquies.\n\nMost concept albums — especially ones written from the perspective of a self-destructive, unlikeable protagonist — don't have smash hits. But this one did. \"Blinding Lights\" is one of the biggest songs of all time. It could and should have won record of the year.\n\nSomehow, after creating the most ambitious and most celebrated album of his career, The Weeknd became the most-snubbed artist of the 63rd Grammy Awards. He received an outrageous total of zero nods, sparking outrage from peers, critics, and The Weeknd himself, who described the nominations process as \"corrupt.\"\n\nYear: 2020, at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"7\" by Lil Nas X, \"Cuz I Love You (Deluxe)\" by Lizzo, \"Father of the Bride\" by Vampire Weekend, \"I, I\" by Bon Iver, \"I Used To Know Her\" by H.E.R., \"Norman F---ing Rockwell!\" by Lana Del Rey, \"Thank U, Next\" by Ariana Grande, and \"When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\" by Billie Eilish\n\nIf the Grammys wanted to honor innovative Black music at the 2020 ceremony, \"Igor\" was the clear choice.\n\nInstead, voters went for \"7\" by Lil Nas X, a seven-song EP that only hints at the young hitmaker's potential. Especially compared to Tyler's work, \"7\" is undercooked at best.\n\n\"Igor\" was shut out of the major three categories and relegated to best rap album, in which it handily won — but seemed out of place.\n\n\"On the one side, I am very grateful that what I made can be acknowledged in a world like this,\" Tyler told reporters. \"But it sucks that whenever we, and I mean guys that look like me, do anything that's genre-bending or anything, they always put it in a rap or urban category.\"\n\nYear: 2019, at the 61st annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Beerbongs & Bentleys\" by Post Malone, the \"Black Panther\" soundtrack, \"By the Way, I Forgive You\" by Brandi Carlile, \"Dirty Computer\" by Janelle Monáe, \"Golden Hour\" by Kacey Musgraves, \"H.E.R.\" by H.E.R., \"Invasion of Privacy\" by Cardi B, and \"Scorpion\" by Drake\n\n\"Sweetener\" wasn't simply Ariana Grande's comeback album, or proof that she could still crank out hits in the face of trauma. \"Sweetener\" was a rebirth, the work of a modern icon approaching her creative peak.\n\nThankfully, \"Sweetener\" did win the award for best pop vocal album, but it was shut out of the major categories, including AOTY.\n\nThe album's standout single, \"God Is a Woman,\" also lost its nomination for best pop solo performance.\n\nYear: 2018, at the 60th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"24K Magic\" by Bruno Mars, \"4:44\" by Jay-Z, \"Awaken, My Love!\" by Childish Gambino, \"Damn.\" by Kendrick Lamar, and \"Melodrama\" by Lorde\n\n2018 marked the first year in Grammys history that no white men were nominated for AOTY. Hip-hop, rap, and R&B dominated the ceremony — the perfect time to go all in and reaffirm SZA's rise as a modern-day neo-soul genius.\n\nIndeed, the Grammys were surprisingly close to getting it right that year, at least in terms of nominations. \"Ctrl\" earned SZA her first five Grammy nods, including best urban contemporary album (a controversial category that has since been renamed).\n\nThey were so close. SZA lost all five of her nominations and didn't even get to compete for the top honor, which is honestly embarrassing (for them, not for her).\n\nIn 2024, Grammy voters got a chance to redeem themselves with SZA's sophomore album \"SOS.\" Perhaps unsurprisingly, they screwed it up again and gave AOTY to Taylor Swift's \"Midnights\" instead.\n\nYear: 2017, at the 59th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"25\" by Adele, \"A Sailor's Guide to Earth\" by Sturgill Simpson, \"Lemonade\" by Beyoncé, \"Purpose\" by Justin Bieber, and \"Views\" by Drake\n\nSomehow, the Recording Academy managed to hand pop princess Rihanna eight nominations in 2017, including six for her best album \"Anti,\" but failed to nominate her in the biggest category — and failed to give her any actual awards.\n\n\"Anti\" lost for best urban contemporary album to Beyoncé's \"Lemonade.\" Fair enough. But it still deserved to be included in the ceremony's slate of top-tier albums, and it certainly deserved an AOTY nomination over \"Purpose\" or \"Views.\"\n\nYear: 2017, at the 59th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"25\" by Adele, \"A Sailor's Guide to Earth\" by Sturgill Simpson, \"Lemonade\" by Beyoncé, \"Purpose\" by Justin Bieber, and \"Views\" by Drake\n\nOK, so this one actually wasn't the Recording Academy's fault. Frank Ocean declined to submit his career-defining masterpiece, \"Blonde,\" for Grammy consideration, even after he was reportedly encouraged by producers to change his mind.\n\n\"I think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated,\" he later explained to the New York Times. \"I'd rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience.\"\n\nYear: 2017, at the 59th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"25\" by Adele, \"A Sailor's Guide to Earth\" by Sturgill Simpson, \"Lemonade\" by Beyoncé, \"Purpose\" by Justin Bieber, and \"Views\" by Drake\n\nSolange won best R&B performance for \"Cranes in the Sky,\" but that's not saying much when you consider that it should've been nominated for both record and song of the year; we previously ranked it at No. 14 on our list of the decade's best songs.\n\nIt's even more haunting that \"A Seat at the Table\" failed to get any recognition as an album, despite being one of the most intimate and culturally relevant artworks in recent memory.\n\nYear: 2016, at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"1989\" by Taylor Swift, \"Beauty Behind the Madness\" by The Weeknd, \"Sound & Color\" by Alabama Shakes, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" by Kendrick Lamar, and \"Traveller\" by Chris Stapleton\n\nDespite Kevin Parker's spotless reputation as a musical genius, he has only received five Grammy nominations for his work as Tame Impala — three nods for best alternative music album, two for best dance/electronic recording — and has yet to win.\n\nThe psychedelic and impressively accessible \"Currents,\" widely considered to be a defining album of the decade, was beaten by Alabama Shakes' \"Sound & Color,\" which also received a nod for AOTY. Both albums deserved the chance to compete for the ceremony's highest honor.\n\nYear: 2016, at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"1989\" by Taylor Swift, \"Beauty Behind the Madness\" by The Weeknd, \"Sound & Color\" by Alabama Shakes, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" by Kendrick Lamar, and \"Traveller\" by Chris Stapleton\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen has only ever gotten Grammys recognition for her smash hit, \"Call Me Maybe,\" which was nominated for song of the year and best pop solo performance in 2013.\n\nBut as anyone who's heard \"Emotion\" knows, Jepsen is far more than a one-hit wonder. We previously ranked it as one of the best albums of the decade.\n\nAlas, Jepsen was completely shut out of the 2016 Grammy Awards, when \"Emotion\" (and its standout track, \"Run Away With Me\") would have been eligible.\n\nYear: 2014, at the 56th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"The Blessed Unrest\" by Sara Bareilles, \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" by Kendrick Lamar, \"The Heist\" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, \"Random Access Memories\" by Daft Punk, \"Red\" by Taylor Swift\n\nLorde was nominated for four Grammys in 2014 and won two: song of the year and best pop solo performance for her breakout hit \"Royals.\"\n\nOf course, \"Royals\" deserved everything it got, but the song is just one piece of Lorde's influential debut.\n\n\"Pure Heroine\" — another decade-defining yet underappreciated album — lost its bid for best pop solo album to Bruno Mars' \"Unorthodox Jukebox.\"\n\nIt didn't even get the chance to compete for AOTY, overlooked in favor of inferior albums by Sara Bareilles and Macklemore.\n\nYear: 2014, at the 56th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"The Blessed Unrest\" by Sara Bareilles, \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" by Kendrick Lamar, \"The Heist\" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, \"Random Access Memories\" by Daft Punk, \"Red\" by Taylor Swift\n\nGrammy voters really stumbled in 2014.\n\nBaffling decisions that year include Daft Punk's triumph over Taylor Swift for AOTY, Macklemore beating Kendrick Lamar for best rap album, and, of course, Arctic Monkeys receiving just one nomination for the band's best album to date.\n\nThe standout breakup anthem \"Do I Wanna Know?\" was nominated for best rock performance, but \"AM\" wasn't even nominated for best rock album.\n\n\"AM\" remains one of the most glamorous and masterful rock albums in recent memory, created by one of this century's most celebrated bands. It had all the makings of a no-brainer AOTY nominee.\n\nYear: 2013, at the 55th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Babel\" by Mumford & Sons, \"Blunderbuss\" by Jack White, \"Channel Orange\" by Frank Ocean, \"El Camino\" by The Black Keys, and \"Some Nights\" by Fun.\n\nIt is truly mind-boggling that \"Views\" and \"Scorpion\" could be nominated for AOTY, but \"Take Care,\" easily Drake's best album ever, was relegated to rap categories.\n\n\"Take Care\" did earn Drake's first-ever Grammy for best rap album, but the renowned album deserved far more for redefining the genre and the landscape of pop music.\n\nYear: 2012, at the 54th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"21\" by Adele, \"Born This Way\" by Lady Gaga, \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" by Bruno Mars, \"Loud\" by Rihanna, and \"Wasting Light\" by the Foo Fighters\n\nYe (formerly known as Kanye West) won best rap album for \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" in 2012, as well as best rap song and best rap/sung collaboration for one of its many standout tracks, \"All of the Lights.\"\n\nAnd yet, after three straight AOTY nominations for less impressive, less innovative bodies of work (\"The College Dropout\" in 2005, \"Late Registration\" in 2006, and \"Graduation\" in 2008), it makes little sense why the Recording Academy failed to nominate his magnum opus.\n\n\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" remains West's most beloved and critically acclaimed album to date, and numerous publications went on to rank it as one of the decade's defining albums, including Insider (No. 6), Stereogum (No. 4), Pitchfork (No. 2), Complex (No. 1), and Rolling Stone (No. 1).\n\nYear: 2012, at the 54th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"21\" by Adele, \"Born This Way\" by Lady Gaga, \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" by Bruno Mars, \"Loud\" by Rihanna, and \"Wasting Light\" by the Foo Fighters\n\nBeyoncé's \"4\" gets better and better with every listen, and has only grown in critical acclaim over the years.\n\nWhen the 2012 Grammy nominations were announced, Queen Bey hadn't just been snubbed — she'd been downright disrespected with zero nominations.\n\n\"It would be easy enough to make a case that '4' should be a contender for album of the year,\" John Mitchell wrote for MTV at the time. \"Its Metacritic rating of 73 is better than four of the nominated albums, and while music critics are far from definitive, consensus acclaim shouldn't be overlooked — but we would have settled for Best R&B Album because, well, it's the perfect R&B album.\"\n\nYear: 2012, at the 54th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"21\" by Adele, \"Born This Way\" by Lady Gaga, \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" by Bruno Mars, \"Loud\" by Rihanna, and \"Wasting Light\" by the Foo Fighters\n\n2012 was a big year for Justin Vernon, aka Bon Iver; he won best new artist and best alternative music album. \"Holocene\" was also nominated for record of the year.\n\nDespite this, Bon Iver's self-titled sophomore effort — the album that earned universal praise and catapulted him to mainstream stardom — was passed over for an AOTY nomination.\n\nYear: 2011, at the 55th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"The Fame Monster\" by Lady Gaga, \"Need You Now\" by Lady Antebellum, \"Recovery\" by Eminem, \"The Suburbs\" by Arcade Fire, \"Teenage Dream\" by Katy Perry\n\nBeach House has never once been nominated for a Grammy — not even for their third studio album \"Teen Dream,\" which some critics have hailed as one of the best albums of all time.\n\nAs Quinn Moreland wrote for Pitchfork, which ranked \"Teen Dream\" at No. 21 on a list of the decade's best albums, the band \"amplified their dream pop\" to create an immersive listening experience that swirls with passion and melancholy: \"It's the sound of a band pulling back the veil of composure and unleashing the emotional intensity that has long been bubbling beneath the surface.\"\n\nYear: 2008, at the 50th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\" by Foo Fighters, \"Graduation\" by Kanye West, \"Back to Black\" by Amy Winehouse, \"River: The Joni Letters\" by Herbie Hancock, \"These Days\" by Vince Gill\n\nM.I.A. was sampling global beats before Drake had even left \"Degrassi,\" blending rap flows and hostile-sounding pop before Billie Eilish turned 6, and making bold political statements in her music way before it became trendy.\n\nThe British-Sri Lankan artist's sophomore album, \"Kala,\" was ahead of the curve for many reasons, but that's not to say it wasn't appreciated in its time. Rolling Stone named \"Kala\" the best album of 2007, and later ranked it the ninth-best album of the decade.\n\n\"Paper Planes\" — the album's smash hit that took aim at both excessive celebrity culture and American society's fear of immigrants — was nominated for record of the year in 2009, thanks to its rerelease as a single.\n\n\"Kala\" was eligible in 2008, but didn't receive a hint of recognition.\n\nYear: 2006, at the 48th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" by Paul McCartney, \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" by Mariah Carey, \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" by U2, \"Late Registration\" by Kanye West, and \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\" by Gwen Stefani\n\nSufjan Stevens didn't receive his first Grammy nomination until 2019, over a decade after releasing his seminal album \"Illinois.\"\n\nThe thoughtful, tender complexity of \"Illinois\" was generously praised upon release and has continued to grow in acclaim. It landed on numerous best-of-the-decade lists, including Rolling Stone (No. 78), NME (No. 17), and Paste Magazine (No. 1), and is widely considered to be one of history's finest folk-pop albums.\n\nYear: 2002, at the 44th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Acoustic Soul\" by India.Arie, \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" by U2, \"Love and Theft\" by Bob Dylan, the \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" soundtrack, \"Stankonia\" by OutKast\n\nIt's difficult to overstate the influence of \"Is This It\" on modern rock music, both in its creation and its reception.\n\nThe Strokes' debut has been cited as a direct influence by everyone from Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner to The Killers' Brandon Flowers.\n\nAnd as Garry Mulholland wrote for The Guardian, pop stars — particularly those \"who are gleefully rediscovering disco, electro and synth-pop\" — also owe the album a debt of gratitude.\n\n\"The commercial success of 'Is This It' made every forgotten art-pop experiment of the late 70s and early 80s instantly hip and ripe for reinvention,\" he wrote in 2009.\n\nAbsurdly, \"Is This It\" did not receive any recognition from the Recording Academy. In fact, The Strokes didn't receive a Grammy nomination until 2021, when they won best rock album for \"The New Abnormal.\"\n\nYear: 2000, at the 42nd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"FanMail\" by TLC, \"Fly\" by the Chicks, \"Millennium\" by the Backstreet Boys, \"Supernatural\" by Santana, and \"When I Look in Your Eyes\" by Diana Krall\n\nBlur's seminal album was created amid personal heartbreak and cultural transformation; front man Damon Albarn had recently ended a long-term relationship, and the euphoric era of Britpop was clearly experiencing a comedown.\n\nThis challenging atmosphere allowed Albarn to write his most spectacular album ever.\n\nAs Stereogum's Ryan Leas wrote, \"13\" was \"frazzled and harrowing and adventurous in ways no other Blur album before or since has matched ... it seemed, definitively, to solidify the notion of Blur as true artists.\"\n\n\"13\" was completely ignored by the Recording Academy, much as Blur had always been. The beloved band has only ever received one nomination: best long-form music video in 2010.\n\nYear: 1998, at the 40th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"The Day\" by Babyface, \"Flaming Pie\" by Paul McCartney, \"This Fire\" by Paula Cole, \"Time Out of Mind\" by Bob Dylan, and \"OK Computer\" by Radiohead\n\nBjörk has only been nominated for 16 Grammys in her career, and she's never won.\n\nDespite seven nominations for best alternative music album, she has never been nominated for AOTY. Her best album, \"Homogenic,\" was only nominated for best alternative music performance.\n\nBjörk, already a noted musical genius in 1997, received profuse praise when \"Homogenic\" was released, and the album's reputation has continued to thrive.\n\nThe Washington Post described it in 2018 as \"a superhuman blast of avant-pop that we're still catching up to,\" while Sal Cinquemani noted in a five-star retroactive review for Slant: \"If not the greatest electronic album of all time, it's certainly the greatest of its decade.\"\n\nYear: 1997, at the 39th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Falling Into You\" by Celine Dion, \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" by the Smashing Pumpkins, \"Odelay\" by Beck, \"The Score\" by Fugees, and the \"Waiting to Exhale\" soundtrack\n\nThese days, everyone can sing along to \"Wonderwall,\" but Oasis' sophomore album was a smash hit as soon as it landed.\n\nIt became the UK's third-best-selling album of all time, thrust the Manchester brothers into superstardom, and is now considered \"one of the seminal releases of the 1990s Britpop movement,\" according to the Grammy Awards website.\n\n\"Wonderwall\" was nominated for best rock performance by a duo or group (one of the band's measly total of two nominations), but \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" didn't get any love as an album.\n\nYear: 1997, at the 39th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Falling Into You\" by Celine Dion, \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" by the Smashing Pumpkins, \"Odelay\" by Beck, \"The Score\" by Fugees, and the \"Waiting to Exhale\" soundtrack\n\nApple wrote every track on her acclaimed debut, \"Tidal,\" which was released when she was still just a teenager.\n\nApple's deeply honest lyrics are drawn from intense personal trauma, her experiences with mental illness, and her famously astute belief that this patriarchal world is complete \"bullshit.\"\n\nCombine Apple's perceptive powers with her earthy voice and percussive production, and it's hard to deny that \"Tidal\" should've won AOTY in 1997. However, it wasn't nominated for a single Grammy Award.\n\nThanks to the rerelease of \"Criminal\" as a single, Apple earned her first three Grammy nominations in 1998: best rock song, best female rock vocal performance, and best new artist.\n\nYear: 1995, at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"From the Cradle\" by Eric Clapton, \"Longing in Their Hearts\" by Bonnie Raitt, \"MTV Unplugged\" by Tony Bennett, \"Seal\" by Seal, \"The 3 Tenors in Concert 1994\" by José Carreras, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti with Zubin Mehta\n\nNas has been nominated for over a dozen Grammys, but he's only won once: best rap album for \"King's Disease\" in 2019, more than two decades after the release of his best work.\n\n\"Illmatic\" wasn't nominated for any Grammys, but it was recently ranked No. 44 on Rolling Stone's revised list of the best albums of all time.\n\n\"Other rappers were harder and brasher, but nobody captured the creeping menace of life on the streets like this 20-year-old from New York's Queensbridge projects,\" the magazine's critics wrote. \"'Illmatic' was an instant classic that never crossed over, which only deepened its myth with hip-hop heads.\"\n\nYear: 1992, at the 34th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Heart in Motion\" by Amy Grant, \"Luck of the Draw\" by Bonnie Raitt, \"Out of Time\" by R.E.M., \"The Rhythm of the Saints\" by Paul Simon, \"Unforgettable... With Love\" by Natalie Cole\n\nYou need only be a casual music fan to understand the impact of Nirvana's \"Nevermind.\" Unfortunately, the album lost its bid for best alternative music album to R.E.M.'s \"Out of Time.\"\n\nThe album's iconic lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" also lost both of its nominations (for best rock song and best hard rock performance), even though it was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nIn fact, Nirvana received only five Grammy nominations during Kurt Cobain's lifetime, none in the \"Big Four\" categories.\n\nThe band's sixth nomination and solitary win — best alternative music performance for their live album, \"MTV Unplugged In New York\" — were bestowed only after Cobain's 1994 suicide.\n\nYear: 1986, at the 28th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Brothers in Arms\" by Dire Straits, \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\" by USA for Africa, \"No Jacket Required\" by Phil Collins, \"We Are the World\" by Sting, \"Whitney Houston\" by Whitney Houston\n\nThe Recording Academy dismissing a fearless woman who makes pristine pop music? Shocker.\n\nAs Richards noted for The Washington Post, Madonna deserved to take home the Grammys' top prize for her adventurous, irresistible, historic sophomore album.\n\nInstead, she received a solitary nomination for best pop vocal performance (female) and lost.\n\n\"'Like a Virgin' transformed Madonna from a promising pop singer into a national phenomenon,\" Richards wrote. \"But if she had won album of the year in 1986 — and, of course, she wasn't even nominated — she would have been just the fourth female solo artist to take that honor in the 28-year history of the Grammys.\"\n\nYear: 1984, at the 26th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"An Innocent Man\" by Billy Joel, the \"Flashdance\" soundtrack, \"Let's Dance\" by David Bowie, \"Synchronicity\" by The Police, and \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson\n\nWith just eight songs, each as flawlessly melodic and danceable as the last, \"Power Corruption and Lies\" is both accessible and original. Few (if any) synth-pop albums from the '80s have aged quite so well.\n\nIt was lauded at the time of its release, but \"Power Corruption and Lies\" didn't receive any recognition at the 26th annual Grammys — not even for its best-selling single, \"Blue Monday.\"\n\nIn fact, New Order wouldn't receive a nomination for another 20 years. The band was finally nominated for best dance recording in 2006, but lost to The Chemical Brothers.\n\nYear: 1983, at the 25th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"American Fool\" by John Cougar, \"The Nightfly\" by Donald Fagen, \"The Nylon Curtain\" by Billy Joel, \"Toto IV\" by Toto, \"Tug of War\" by Paul McCartney\n\nBruce Springsteen is not bereft of love from the Recording Academy. To date, he boasts a round pot of 51 nods and a whopping 20 wins, making Springsteen one of the most-awarded artists in Grammys history.\n\nShockingly, however, The Boss has never won AOTY, and his best album, \"Nebraska,\" didn't receive any nominations at all.\n\n\"We can still hear Toto's legacy at karaoke night, but Bruce Springsteen's 'Nebraska' sounds a lot more like an AOTY winner by contemporary standards — intimate, introspective and spare,\" Richards wrote for The Washington Post.\n\n\"But Springsteen has always been of his time, never ahead of it,\" Richards added. \"He was a star in 1983 and 'Nebraska' was his darkest, finest hour.\"\n\nYear: 1981, at the 23rd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Christopher Cross\" by Christopher Cross, \"Glass Houses\" by Billy Joel, \"Guilty\" by Barbra Streisand, \"Trilogy: Past Present Future\" by Frank Sinatra, and \"The Wall\" by Pink Floyd\n\nThe Clash was probably doing too much to secure a win from the Recording Academy and its notoriously stuffy voters, but \"London Calling\" at least deserved a nod for AOTY — a fact they acknowledged in 2007, when the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\n\"London Calling\" peaked within the top 10 in the UK, spawned a global punk-rock hit, and was called \"the first important rock album of the 1980's\" by The New York Times.\n\nIts reputation as a politically charged, energetic, ingenious milestone has only grown stronger over time.\n\nYear: 1980, at the 22nd annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"52nd Street\" by Billy Joel, \"Bad Girls\" by Donna Summer, \"Breakfast in America\" by Supertramp, \"The Gambler\" by Kenny Rogers, and \"Minute by Minute\" by The Doobie Brothers\n\nJoy Division is one of those bands that transcended music; it became a symbol of coolness and taste. But it's also one of those bands that actually had the chops to earn that legacy.\n\n\"The band's debut 'Unknown Pleasures,' originally released in 1979, is simply one of the best records ever made,\" NME wrote in 2007, \"and is still powerful enough to floor you 28 years on.\"\n\nTragically, \"Unknown Pleasures\" was brushed aside by the Recording Academy. Lead singer and lyricist Ian Curtis committed suicide the same year the album was eligible, and Joy Division was never nominated for a Grammy in its short but impactful existence.\n\nYear: 1979, at the 21st annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Even Now\" by Barry Manilow, the \"Grease\" soundtrack, \"Running on Empty\" by Jackson Browne, the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack, and \"Some Girls\" by The Rolling Stones\n\nTo be fair, the Sex Pistols probably had no shot at a Grammys nomination.\n\nIn addition to the cheeky use of \"bollocks\" in their album title, the band delighted in controversy and anarchy — hardly the kind of artist destined for praise from the voting bloc that bestowed the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack with its highest honor.\n\nBut in retrospect, we all know that \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\" changed the game — including the Recording Academy, which inducted the album into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nYear: 1977, at the 19th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Breezin'\" by George Benson, \"Chicago X\" by Chicago, \"Frampton Comes Alive!\" by Peter Frampton, \"Silk Degrees\" by Boz Scaggs, and \"Songs in the Key of Life\" by Stevie Wonder\n\nThe Ramones don't have a single Grammy nomination, but they do have a lifetime achievement award and a place in the Grammy Hall of Fame for \"Ramones,\" their distinguished debut album. (It seems the Recording Academy is big on course-correcting, many years after making obvious mistakes.)\n\nYear: 1974, at the 16th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Behind Closed Doors\" by Charlie Rich, \"The Divine Miss M\" by Bette Midler, \"Innervisions\" by Stevie Wonder, \"Killing Me Softly\" by Roberta Flack, and \"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\" by Paul Simon\n\nPink Floyd would later receive an AOTY nod for \"The Wall\" (and lose to Christopher Cross, somehow), but the band's eighth studio album was entirely neglected, despite being one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling albums in history.\n\nRolling Stone has described \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" as a \"psychedelic masterpiece,\" \"a true colossus of classic rock,\" and \"a career-defining artistic achievement\" for the beloved British band.\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find an elaborate, ambitious concept album that stands quite so tall.\n\nYear: 1973, at the 15th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"American Pie\" by Don McLean, \"The Concert for Bangladesh\" by George Harrison & Friends, \"Jesus Christ Superstar (Original Broadway Cast Recording),\" \"Moods\" by Neil Diamond, and \"Nilsson Schmilsson\" by Nilsson\n\nSo far, the only Rolling Stones album to be nominated for AOTY is \"Some Girls,\" which isn't even one of the band's four albums in the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nOne of those four is \"Exile on Main St.,\" which is now seen as the band's best album. At No. 14, it's their highest-ranked on Rolling Stone's list of the best albums of all time.\n\n\"A dirty whirl of basement blues and punk boogie, the Rolling Stones' 1972 double LP was, according to Keith Richards, 'maybe the best thing we did,'\" the magazine's critics wrote.\n\n\"Indeed, inside its deliberately dense squall — Richards' and Mick Taylor's dogﬁght riffing, the lusty jump of the Bill Wyman–Charlie Watts rhythm engine, Mick Jagger's caged-animal bark and burned-soul croon — is the Stones' greatest album and Jagger and Richards' deﬁnitive songwriting statement of outlaw pride and dedication to grit and cold-morning redemption.\"\n\nYear: 1972, at the 14th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"All Things Must Pass\" by George Harrison, \"Carpenters\" by the Carpenters, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, \"Shaft\" by Isaac Hayes, and \"Tapestry\" by Carole King\n\nThe Who has three albums in the Grammy Hall of Fame, plus a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy. And yet, the band has never won a Grammy.\n\nTo make matters worse, the band has only been nominated twice (twice!), and both were for best long-form music video (best long-form music video?!).\n\nSo, as you can tell from my editorial emphasis, the iconic British rock band has been snubbed throughout its entire existence. \"My Generation,\" \"Tommy,\" and \"Quadrophenia\" could also be on this list.\n\nStill, I chose \"Who's Next\" as the Recording Academy's most atrocious oversight, due to its immediate critical success and enduring legacy as the band's best work.\n\n\"The Who's fifth album is one of those carved-in-stone landmarks that the rock canon doesn't allow you to bad-mouth,\" BBC's Chris Roberts wrote in 2002. \"It was pretty rad for its day. Here's the twist: it still sounds ablaze.\"\n\nYear: 1972, at the 14th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"All Things Must Pass\" by George Harrison, \"Carpenters\" by the Carpenters, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, \"Shaft\" by Isaac Hayes, and \"Tapestry\" by Carole King\n\nThe pièce de résistance of Joni Mitchell's career is also the greatest female album ever, according to Rolling Stone.\n\n\"Blue' is the first time any major rock or pop artist had opened up so fully, producing what might be the ultimate breakup album and setting a still-unmatched standard for confessional poetry in pop music,\" the magazine's staff wrote.\n\n\"Along with its romantic melancholy, 'Blue' was the sound of a woman availing herself of the romantic and sexual freedom that was, until then, an exclusively male province in rock.\"\n\nIt feels almost criminal that Mitchell received zero nominations in 1972, the year \"Blue\" would have been eligible. (Carole King's \"Tapestry,\" which won AOTY, is ranked at No. 25 on Rolling Stone's all-time list.)\n\nThree years later, Mitchell was nominated for AOTY for \"Court and Spark,\" but that hardly makes up for snubbing \"Blue,\" especially since she lost.\n\nTechnically, Mitchell has an AOTY trophy — but it was bestowed for Herbie Hancock's album of Mitchell covers, as if a man could ever do her piercing words justice.\n\nYear: 1972, at the 14th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"All Things Must Pass\" by George Harrison, \"Carpenters\" by the Carpenters, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, \"Shaft\" by Isaac Hayes, and \"Tapestry\" by Carole King\n\nIn the same year, the Grammys failed to nominate two of history's defining albums: the aforementioned \"Blue,\" as well as \"What's Going On,\" which has been crowned Rolling Stone's No. 1 best album of all time.\n\nIn Marvin Gaye's own words, the album is anchored in the fight for human rights. He was spurred to musical activism by evergreen issues like climate change, police brutality, and war, channeling that pain and passion into an intellectual, yet deeply listenable masterpiece.\n\n\"What's Going On,\" however, received minimal praise from the Recording Academy. Gaye received just one nomination in 1972 — best R&B vocal performance for \"Inner City Blues (Makes You Wanna Holler)\" — and would never receive a nomination for AOTY.\n\nGaye was posthumously honored with a lifetime achievement award in 1997, more than a decade after his death.\n\nYear: 1968, at the 10th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" by Frank Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, \"It Must Be Him\" by Vikki Carr, \"My Cup Runneth Over\" by Ed Ames, \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry, and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles\n\nJimi Hendrix, described by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as \"the most gifted instrumentalist of all time,\" only ever received one paltry Grammy nomination: best contemporary instrumental performance for his iconic \"Star-Spangled Banner\" shred at Woodstock.\n\nHe lost to Henry Mancini, who'd already won 18 Grammy Awards.\n\nHendrix was posthumously honored with a lifetime achievement award, but his consciousness-altering music was dismissed by the Recording Academy in his actual lifetime, despite the immediacy of its impact.\n\n\"Are You Experienced,\" in particular, is widely regarded as the most impressive and important debut in rock history. Naturally, it has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.\n\n\"It's still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R&B, blues... musical tradition,\" Smithsonian musicologist Reuben Jackson told NPR. \"It altered the syntax of the music, if you will, in a way I compare to, say, James Joyce's 'Ulysses.'\"\n\nYear: 1968, at the 10th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" by Frank Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, \"It Must Be Him\" by Vikki Carr, \"My Cup Runneth Over\" by Ed Ames, \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry, and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles\n\nIt actually makes sense that \"The Velvet Underground & Nico\" didn't receive any Grammy nominations, given that it flopped commercially and was generally ignored by critics at the time.\n\nHowever, with the gift of hindsight, we know this album to be a weirdo wonder that provided, according to Rolling Stone, \"inspiration and a blueprint for everything from lo-fi punk rock to highbrow avant-garde — and so much in between.\"\n\n\"The Velvet Underground & Nico\" has since been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Velvet Underground was also recognized by the Recording Academy as a \"benchmark for countless modern-rock movements\" when the band received a lifetime achievement award in 2017.\n\nYear: 1968, at the 10th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" by Frank Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, \"It Must Be Him\" by Vikki Carr, \"My Cup Runneth Over\" by Ed Ames, \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry, and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles\n\nAretha Franklin was already nine albums deep (and tens of thousands of dollars in debt) when she began recording her Atlantic debut. She could have produced some cookie-cutter commercial bait, flexed those legendary vocals, made some money, and continued on her way.\n\nInstead, Franklin dug deeper into her passionate, romantic soul and put her own sexuality on a pedestal.\n\n\"I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You\" was perhaps the first classic album of Franklin's career. Not to mention, it spawned the historic \"Respect\" cover that will outlive us all. It was a critical and commercial giant.\n\n\"Respect\" did receive three Grammy nominations and won two. Franklin was also nominated for another single, \"A Natural Woman.\" However, \"I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You\" wasn't recognized in any album-specific categories.\n\nYear: 1968, at the 10th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" by Frank Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, \"It Must Be Him\" by Vikki Carr, \"My Cup Runneth Over\" by Ed Ames, \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry, and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles\n\nJim Morrison and crew were shunned by the Recording Academy until \"Light My Fire\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, followed by its parent album \"The Doors\" in 2002.\n\nIn 2007, on the 40th anniversary of their monumental self-titled debut, The Doors received a lifetime achievement award.\n\n\"They resisted rules, trends, and, sometimes, even law and order,\" music journalist Ben Fong-Torres wrote in a Grammys tribute to the band. \"They were unpredictable, both in the studio and on stage.\"\n\n\"The result was the kind of rock that means the most, that has impact, that endures. That's why the Doors, at 40, still sound fresh and vital — and still sell records.\"\n\nYear: 1967, at the 9th annual Grammy Awards\n\nAOTY nominees (winner in bold): \"A Man and His Music\" by Frank Sinatra, \"Color Me Barbra\" by Barbra Streisand, the \"Doctor Zhivago\" soundtrack, \"Revolver\" by The Beatles, and \"What Now My Love\" by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass\n\n\"Pet Sounds\" is The Beach Boys' melodious, scenic, bizarre magnum opus, and its ripples throughout music history are innumerable.\n\nThe Beatles' Grammy-winning \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" is often cited as music's most influential work — but it was inspired by \"Pet Sounds.\"\n\n\"Pet Sounds\" went on to inspire countless other musicians, from David Bowie to Radiohead, and practically \"invented the modern pop album,\" according to The Atlantic.\n\nSure, the album's splash wasn't instantly enormous. But you'd hope the Recording Academy would be able to parse what the public, at the time, did not.\n\nThe Beach Boys only received three nominations in 1967, all for \"Good Vibrations,\" the lighthearted song released five months after \"Pet Sounds.\"\n\nThe album and its timeless singles, including \"God Only Knows\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\" were completely disregarded.\n\nAfter a career total of four nominations (and zero wins), \"Pet Sounds\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Beach Boys received a lifetime achievement award in 2001.",

    "title": "Trump's political threat to 'decertify' thousands of Canadian-made aircraft risks aviation safety, industry watchers say",
    "description": "Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian aircraft has stirred safety concerns among analysts who caution against politicizing aircraft certification.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian-made aircraft — the backbone of many US carriers' regional jet fleet — is a threat to aviation safety, industry watchers said Friday.\n\nThe president also doesn't have the authority to unilaterally declare planes unworthy to fly in the US, Henry Harteveldt, an aviation industry authority and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told Business Insider. That authority belongs to the FAA.\n\nThe trade spat — another in a continuing back-and-forth between Trump and Canada — comes after Canada hasn't fully certified newer US-made Gulfstream jets to fly in its skies. (It has certified older models.) Gulfstream planes are used almost exclusively by private aviation companies, governments, and the ultrawealthy.\n\nTrump said on Thursday night, in a Truth Social post, that he would \"decertify\" Canada-made Bombardier jets until Canada approved the Gulfstream models. He also threatened a 50% tariff on \"any and all\" Canadian aircraft sold in the US until the situation was corrected.\n\nBombardier said in a statement that it's in contact with the Canadian government. The FAA referred Business Insider to the White House. A White House official said decertification would not immediately affect aircraft already in operation; it would apply only to new deliveries.\n\nThat would be a relief for US airlines like American, Delta, and United, whose regional affiliates operate Bombardier CRJ aircraft to cities across the country.\n\nStill, any move to decertify these more than 2,000 passenger airliners and private jets — part of almost 5,550 Canadian-made aircraft and helicopters certified in the US, according to Cirium — could trigger thousands of flight cancellations a day. A 50% tariff would likely raise airline ticket prices.\n\nAviation analysts said Trump's threat posed a safety risk in itself.\n\n\"Anything that intrudes on the turf of safety regulators coming from politics, trade issues, or personal grievances is a very, very bad idea,\" Richard Aboulafia, managing director of the aviation consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory, told Business Insider.\n\nAboulafia said aircraft certification is intentionally non-political for a reason: Regulators are meant to evaluate risk, not respond to trade threats. Once certification becomes a political weapon, trust in the system erodes for manufacturers, operators, and the flying public, he contended.\n\nIn Canada's case, the delay in certification is likely not obstructionism but the result of independent regulatory decisions.\n\nFor the Gulfstream G700 and G800, Canada hasn't completed its own certification, while the FAA has granted Gulfstream a temporary exemption from certain fuel‑icing rules designed to ensure aircraft engines and systems operate safely in extreme cold.\n\nThe FAA waiver means Gulfstream has until the end of this year to meet those requirements — meaning the aircraft is operating under essentially conditional certification in the US, despite being allowed to be delivered.\n\nThese waivers are not unusual and are typically granted to allow new aircraft to enter service while completing certain technical tests and paperwork, rather than because the planes are unsafe.\n\nStill, history shows what can sometimes go wrong when thorough certification and safety protocols are deprioritized. The most consequential example was the Boeing 737 Max, which suffered two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 due to systemic design issues, killing 346 people.\n\nMore recently, in early 2024, a door plug separated on another 737 Max due to quality-control issues at Boeing's Washington factory, further exacerbating scrutiny of production and certification. No one died in that incident.\n\nPart of the reason the 737 Max issues slipped past regulators is that, for decades, global authorities often relied on reciprocal approvals, effectively rubber-stamping each other's certifications to speed aircraft to market.\n\nThe Max disasters exposed the risks of that approach. Today, regulators — including those in Canada — are expected to conduct their own full assessments rather than automatically rely on approvals from foreign authorities.\n\nThe FAA itself is taking extra precautions before certifying the Boeing 737 Max 7 and 10, as both aircraft have technical problems that could lead to engine overheating. Boeing initially asked for a waiver but rescinded it amid the scrutiny.",

    "title": "'Melania' isn't good. But it isn't for you, anyway.",
    "description": "Even diehard Trump fans might be bored by the documentary about the first lady. But this movie, \"Melania,\" is for an audience of one.",
    "fullText": "Let's get this out of the way: \"Melania,\" the new documentary about first lady Melania Trump, is not a good movie.\n\nI mean: It's possible you'll like it if you're a Trump superfan who likes everything Trump does.\n\nThe movie is full of drone shots and lingering looks in and outside of SUVs and private planes. There are lots of glimpses inside the White House, Trump Tower, and Mar-a-Lago. There's also some very expensive music licensing that brings you a sampling of artists you might hear at the beginning of a Trump rally, including the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, and Tears for Fears. (There's also a stirring rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" by Aretha Franklin that's the most moving thing in there, and jarring in context.)\n\nBut I think even director Brett Ratner knows he's made a dull, inert product, where zero interesting things happen. That is presumably why, halfway through the one-hour, 44-minute-long movie, he starts inserting grainy Super 8-style footage into the shots, simply to give the thing additional texture. Like crumbling some crackers on top of a sodden hot dish.\n\nThe best way I can describe this one is something akin to a wedding video: Maybe the subjects of the video will want to watch it (Melania looks, unsurprisingly, like a woman who used to be a model; her husband seems notably more spry than he does now, a year after it was filmed). It's hard to imagine anyone else will.\n\nBut that's just my opinion. What does someone who hasn't been reporting on the damage caused by Donald Trump's administration think?\n\n\"I think it's perfectly well made,\" says Jamal Caesar, who describes himself as a writer/director who is also a Melania fan. \"I think everyone, actually, will like this movie.\"\n\nI talked to Caesar on Friday afternoon, after watching a 10:30 am \"Melania\" screening near Union Square in Manhattan. My thought was that I could find other people there who weren't me to interview about the movie.\n\nAlas, 11 of the 14 other people in the theater were other journalists or their friends, doing what I was doing. One of the other three was a woman who said she liked someone involved in the movie, but didn't want me to identify her. \"Hell no. I'm not a Trumper.\" The two other men had told me before the movie started that they weren't journalists. They zipped out of the theater before I could ask them what they thought.\n\nSo, for the record: Caesar, who says he went to both Trump inaugurations, said he thinks the movie is particularly good at showing \"opulence — one of the things Trump and their family is most known for.\"\n\n\"Everyone is sort of interested in glamour, and that's what this brings to life,\" he added.\n\nWill other people actually watch, and/or like, this movie? We have no idea. We know that Amazon is spending a reported $75 million on production and marketing for \"Melania,\" and distributing it widely in theaters before it starts streaming on Amazon's Prime Video later this year. So everyone's going to get a chance to weigh in, one way or another.\n\nAnd it's the opposite of surprising that a morning Manhattan screening — on a very, very cold day — only brought a handful of ticket buyers/professional rubber-neckers. Puck's Matt Belloni says he's seen projections that show the viewership for this one — at least in theaters — will be roughly split between red and blue geographies. So we'll see.\n\nBut of course, the whole point of this movie isn't to generate big box-office numbers, or even to generate more Amazon Prime subscriptions.\n\nAmazon's spending on this documentary is so out of scale with any other doc that the only way to view it is as a gift from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to the Trump administration — one of the many, many donations American businessmen have made to the administration in the last year. (Amazon's stock line about this: \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\")\n\nSo the only real question for Bezos and Trump is: Was it worth it?",

    "title": "Elon Musk discussed plans to party with Jeffrey Epstein on his Caribbean island, newly released emails show",
    "description": "Elon Musk planned visits to Jeffrey Epstein's island, DOJ emails show. Epstein repeatedly sought meetings with Musk, who previously denied visiting.",
    "fullText": "In November 2012, Jeffrey Epstein emailed Elon Musk about sending a helicopter to whisk the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to his private island in the Caribbean.\n\n\"how many people will you be for the heli to island,\" Epstein asked Musk in an email exchange, which was made public Friday by the Justice Department.\n\nMusk said he'd need just two seats — for himself and his then-partner, Tallulah Riley.\n\n\"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\" Musk asked.\n\nThe emails, released Friday, were part of a cache of 3 million files the Justice Department released from its yearslong investigation into the convicted sex offender. They include several exchanges between Epstein, Musk, and their assistants.\n\nIt's unclear whether Musk ever made the trip, and a representative didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nEpstein — who counted President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and various other prominent politicians and businessmen among his acquaintances — killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had registered as a pedophile in 2008, after pleading guilty to less severe sex offenses.\n\nShortly after Epstein's arrest in July 2019, Musk said he had declined invitations to Epstein's island in the US Virgin Islands and recounted only one meeting with him. Musk has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Several years ago, I was at his house in Manhattan for about 30 minutes in the middle of the afternoon with Talulah [Riley], as she was curious about meeting this strange person for a novel she was writing,\" he told Vanity Fair at the time. \"We did not see anything inappropriate at all, apart from weird art. He tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined.\"\n\nMusk has since said in social media posts that he \"refused\" to visit Epstein's island despite multiple attempts from Epstein.\n\nThe emails released Friday appear to show him planning to visit Epstein's island at least twice.\n\nIn addition to the November 2012 planned visit, Musk indicated he would visit Epstein's island in January 2014.\n\n\"Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in December 2013, referring to the British Virgin Islands. \"Is there a good time to visit?\"\n\nEpstein said he'd be available for the first week of January.\n\n\"always space for you,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth about their schedules, Musk appeared to confirm that he would visit Epstein on January 2 of 2014.\n\n\"When should we head to your island on the 2nd?\" Musk wrote.\n\nThe emails show Epstein planning to meet Musk on other occasions as well.\n\nIn February of 2013, Musk's personal assistant tried to nail down plans for a meeting at SpaceX's offices in California. Epstein's assistant said Musk had suggested the location.\n\n\"Shall we organize a lunch for Elon and Jeffrey to get together at SpaceX in the coming weeks?\" Musk's assistant wrote. \"Elon is generally available at SpaceX on Mon, Thurs and Fri each week.\"\n\nIt isn't clear from the emails reviewed by Business Insider if that meeting took place. Musk has previously said that Epstein never \"toured\" SpaceX's facilities.\n\nIn early March of that year, Epstein directly asked Musk about his availability.\n\n\"now its time for fun,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nIn the emails, Musk told Epstein he was busy with work at Tesla and SpaceX. Epstein suggested he get more sleep.\n\n\"benefit analysis would probably show , tesla doing better with you getting more sleep,\" he said.\n\n\"Normally I would agree, as I have found that my total daily productivity is optimal at around 6 to 6.5 hours of sleep.\"\n\nThe two may have met later that spring. In another email exchange, dated April 2013, Epstein's assistant said he planned to meet Musk at the Milken Institute economic conference.\n\nThe Justice Department emails also show Epstein inquiring with Musk about Solar City, a solar electricity company that was later acquired by Tesla. Epstein said in September 2012 that he wanted to use its services for his properties in the US Virgin Islands and New Mexico.\n\n\"is there any one at Solar City that my guys can talk to about electriying the caribean island?\" Epstein asked. \"or the new mexico ranch\"",

    "description": "Melania Trump starred in and produced her self-titled documentary about the days leading up to Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration.",
    "fullText": "First lady Melania Trump is no stranger to cameras, but this time, she's the one calling the shots.\n\nHer new documentary, \"Melania: Twenty Days to History,\" provides a glimpse into her life and work during the 20 days leading up to President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. Released in theaters on Friday, the first lady served as both its star and producer.\n\n\"She's a very private and very selective person as to who she speaks to and what she does,\" Marc Beckman, Melania Trump's senior advisor and a producer of the film, told Business Insider. \"We thought that this would be the appropriate opportunity to share a little bit more, to open the lens a little bit more into her family life, her career, and her philanthropy, all as she becomes first lady of the United States of America again.\"\n\nBeckman said that the first lady was deeply involved in the film's creation.\n\n\"She participated not just with the creative direction, but in production and post-production,\" Beckman said. \"She was in the edit room. She was helping with color correction. She was very much involved with music selection — every song was selected by her.\"\n\nAfter its theatrical run, \"Melania\" will stream on Amazon, which paid $40 million for the film and a forthcoming docuseries set for release this summer.\n\nHere are the most surprising moments and revelations from the documentary.\n\nThe film opens with \"Billie Jean\" by Michael Jackson playing over aerial footage of Mar-a-Lago. The song reappears later as Melania Trump sings along while riding in the car and names it her favorite Michael Jackson hit.\n\n\"Melania\" follows Melania Trump as she divides her time between Trump Tower in New York City, Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Washington, DC.\n\nThe Florida estate holds special meaning for the first lady, who remembers it as the place \"where Baron took his swim lessons with his grandfather, played golf with his father, and took his first tennis lesson with me.\"\n\nCarter's funeral was held on January 9, 2025, one year to the day after the death of Melania Trump's mother, Amalija Knavs.\n\n\"Grief comes in waves when you lose someone who means so much to you. I will be sitting in the Washington Cathedral, paying respect to President Carter, but I know my beloved mother will be on my mind,\" she said in the film's voiceover.\n\nIn the film, Pierre said the seams on the dress were entirely hidden beneath the black band zigzagging across it.\n\n\"You don't give the recipe,\" he said. \"It's like a mystery.\"\n\nThe film showed a video call between Macron and Melania Trump, where they spoke about working together on her Fostering the Future and Be Best initiatives focused on children's well-being.\n\n\"My next step and my next goal is to foster relationships and work on it with like-minded leaders and establish a coalition,\" Melania Trump said. \"And when we do, I hope you will join me.\"\n\n\"With pleasure. I go everywhere with you,\" Macron said.\n\nIn the days leading up to her return to the White House, Melania Trump also recruited Queen Rania of Jordan for her coalition during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAviva Siegel was held for 51 days before being released on November 26, 2023, as part of a temporary ceasefire deal brokered by the Biden administration. In the documentary, Melania Trump comforted Siegel and pledged Donald Trump's support for releasing the remaining hostages, including Siegel's husband, Keith Siegel.\n\n\"I know that once he's commander in chief, I know that's his priority. I'm sure of it,\" Melania Trump said.\n\nOne of the final title cards of the film reads: \"Melania Trump played a key role in securing the release of Keith Siegel after 484 days as a hostage in Gaza, just 12 days after the inauguration.\"\n\nIn the documentary, Knavs was shown holding a handheld camcorder and filming his daughter in the background of public appearances.\n\n\"My father always filmed these special moments when I was a child,\" Melania Trump said in the film's voiceover narration. \"He showed me the world through his lens, the essence of living life with passion and purpose.\"\n\n\"Walking into the Capitol Rotunda, I felt the weight of history intertwined with my own journey as an immigrant — a reminder of why I respect this nation so deeply,\" she said in the film's narration. \"Everyone should do what they can to protect our individual rights. Never take them for granted because in the end, no matter where we come from, we are bound by the same humanity.\"\n\nAs the first naturalized US citizen to serve as first lady, Melania Trump has previously spoken about her \"arduous\" pathway to citizenship.\n\nThough the move was due to frigid temperatures in Washington, DC, on Inauguration Day, Melania Trump said she preferred an indoor space for security reasons after her husband survived an assassination attempt in July 2024.\n\n\"Being in a more secure and closed space brought a certain peace of mind,\" she said.\n\nIn a scene toward the end of the film, Donald Trump was shown practicing an inauguration speech as Melania Trump watched.\n\n\"My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker,\" he said.\n\nHer addition made it into the final draft of Donald Trump's inauguration speech.\n\nMahaux, who has photographed the Trump family for over 20 years, describes Melania Trump as \"very reserved, but deeply intentional.\"\n\n\"I think what people don't always see in her is a curiosity that she has for the world,\" she told Business Insider. \"I think the documentary reflects her sense of duty, her discipline.\"\n\nMahaux also took Melania Trump's White House portrait during Donald Trump's first term in 2017.\n\n\"The first portrait was about discovering her new duty and her new role, and now this time, the portrait was an affirmation,\" Mahaux said. \"She really knew what she was. She was really embracing it and ready to get to work.\"",

    "description": "Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional.

    "fullText": "PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional.\n\nThe court's decision late Thursday advances a U.S. aim to block any influence by China over the strategic waterway and immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nPanamanian President José Raúl Mulino said that until the court's ruling is executed — a period of time he did not specify — Panama's Maritime Authority would work with Panama Ports Company, the CK Hutchison subsidiary, to ensure continuing operations at the port.\n\nOnce the concession is formally ended, a local subsidiary of Danish logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk will operate the ports in a transitional phase until a new concession can be bid and awarded, Mulino said.\n\n“Panama moves forward, its ports will continue operating without interruption and we will continue serving the world at the logistics center of excellence that we are,” Mulino said in a recorded video address.\n\nThe court’s ruling followed an audit by Panama’s comptroller, which alleged irregularities in the 25-year extension of the concession, granted in 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration made blocking China’s influence over the Panama Canal one of its priorities in the hemisphere. Panama was U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first overseas stop as the United States’ top diplomat. On Friday, Rubio said on X that “the United States is encouraged by the recent Panamanian Supreme Court’s decision to rule port concessions to China unconstitutional.”\n\nDespite the insistence by Panama’s government and the canal authority that China has no influence over its operations, Rubio made clear that the U.S. viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue. U.S. President Donald Trump had gone so far as to say Panama should return the canal to U.S. control.\n\nThe court’s brief statement gave no guidance on what would happen to the ports now.\n\nThe ruling draws backlash from Hong Kong\n\nCK Hutchison’s subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, said it has not been notified yet about the decision but insisted its concession was the result of transparent international bidding.\n\nIt said in its statement that the ruling “lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity, but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country.”\n\nIt said that it reserves all rights to proceed legally in Panama or elsewhere, but gave no more details.\n\nThe Hong Kong government firmly rejected the ruling in a statement, saying it strongly opposes any foreign government using coercive, repressive or other unreasonable means to seriously harm the business interests of Hong Kong enterprises. It said the Panamanian government should respect the spirit of contracts and provide a fair business environment.\n\n“Given the current situation in Panama, Hong Kong enterprises should carefully review their existing and future investments there,\" it said.\n\nIn Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of “the Chinese company,” without elaborating on the potential steps.\n\nPolitical analyst Edwin Cabrera said once the parties are notified, the issue of what to do with the ports goes to Panama’s executive branch, specifically the Panama Maritime Authority.\n\n“I have the impression from conversations that I have had with some people that the operation (of the ports) will not stop,” Cabrera said.\n\nA sale deal that apparently angered Beijing\n\nCK Hutchison Holdings announced a deal last year to sell its majority stake in the Panamanian ports and others around the world to an international consortium that included BlackRock Inc. But the deal appeared to stall over objections by the Chinese government.\n\nThe company said last July that it was considering seeking a Chinese investor to join as a significant member of the consortium, a move that some interpreted as way to please Beijing, but CK Hutchison hasn't said more since.\n\nThe awkward position the company found itself in highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing.\n\nLast year, Panama’s comptroller audited the concession to the Panama Ports Company, which had held the contract to operate the ports since 1997. The concession was renewed in 2021 for 25 years, during the prior Panamanian administration.\n\nComptroller Anel Flores said the audit found payments that were not made, accounting errors and the apparent existence of “ghost” concessions operating within the ports since 2015. The company denied those allegations.\n\nThe audit determined that the irregularities had cost the government about $300 million since the concession was extended and an estimated $1.2 billion during the original 25-year contract.\n\nFlores also said the extension was granted without the required endorsement of his office.\n\nOn July 30, the comptroller challenged the Panama Ports Company’s contract to operate the ports before the Supreme Court.",

    "fullText": "Clive Campbell, like many travelers, parked his car at a Midlands airport before boarding a plane over the Christmas holiday. When he returned days later, he was surprised to find that his car was gone.\n\nHis 2022 Nissan Pathfinder, which he’d parked at a long-term parking facility at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport, had been repossessed on Dec. 28, 2025 by West Columbia Recovery & Towing Company at the behest of Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\nThe problem? The Pathfinder was paid in full and free of any liens, according to a certificate of title Campbell attached to a lawsuit he filed against the towing company and Navy Federal.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday, raises questions about whether the Columbia Metropolitan Airport Police Department routinely grants towing access to private tow companies to airport parking facilities, whether such access is governed by a contractual relationship, and whether lien status is verified prior to removal of vehicles left in long-term parking by traveling passengers, Campbell told The State in an email.\n\nA spokesperson with the airport police department said she would look into the matter and get back with The State.\n\nNavy Federal declined to comment on the case.\n\nWhen Campbell realized his car was missing, he contacted airport police, who confirmed the vehicle had been repossessed. Campbell then reached out to the towing company and provided a New York State Certificate of Title reflecting no recorded lien against the vehicle, according to the suit.\n\nDespite documentation, the towing company refused to release the vehicle to Campbell, while still continuing to rack up storage fees, the suit said.\n\nCampbell was then prompted to file a Temporary Restraining Order against the company as well to secure a police report.\n\nThe report, which was attached to the lawsuit as an exhibit, shows the tow was initiated based on information allegedly provided by Navy Federal Credit Union; law-enforcement database checks revealed no active lien; documentation reviewed appeared to show the lien had been satisfied and released; and the towing company nevertheless refused to release the vehicle, according to the suit.\n\nCampbell’s request for a Temporary Restraining Order remains pending, according to court records.\n\nMeanwhile, when asked whether the towing company needs confirmation of an active lien before repossessing a car, a manager with the company told The State “to call Navy Federal.”\n\nIt’s the same thing they advised Campbell after he’d provided proof that he owned the car free and clear.\n\nThe towing company “did not dispute the absence of a lien or court order and instead directed (Campbell) to ‘call Navy Federal,’ a party with no enforceable interest,” the suit said.\n\nCampbell claims that Navy Federal and the towing company are guilty of, among other things, conversion, trespass to chattels, civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment.\n\nHe has asked the court for compensatory and punitive damages along with an order that the towing company release his vehicle free of any towing and storage fees, according to the suit.",

    "fullText": "Bill Gates, through his philanthropic foundation, issued a strongly worded denial Friday on the latest allegations to emerge about his relationship with disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Department of Justice, as part of more than 3 million pages of documents related to Epstein, released on Friday, unsealed 2013 emails written by Epstein and sent to himself.\n\nThey appear to be notes he was drafting for a person named Boris, who worked for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to send to Bill Gates after a dispute.\n\nOne of the emails, with the subject line \"bill,\" suggests that Bill Gates had requested antibiotics for a sexually transmitted disease to \"surreptitiously\" give to his now ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Another email said Boris had helped Bill Gates \"get drugs,\" and helped facilitate \"illicit trysts\" between the billionaire Microsoft founder and \"Russian girls\" as well as \"married women.\"\n\nThe emails contain no corroboration of the claims.\n\n\"These claims are absolutely absurd and completely false,\" a spokesperson for Bill Gates told Business Insider in a statement. \"The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame.\"\n\nIt's not known if the text of the emails was ever sent to Gates — the founder of Microsoft, a global philanthropist, and once the richest man in the world. Since Epstein's 2019 suicide at a federal jail, Gates has faced questions about the extent of their relationship.\n\nIn the past, Gates has said that he attended several dinners with Epstein for philanthropic reasons and that he now regrets having spent time with him.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 that Melinda Gates began seeking divorce counsel in 2019, around the time news of Bill's meetings with Epstein surfaced publicly. She told CBS in 2022 that her ex-husband's ties to Epstein were a factor in their split.",

    "title": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg says Meta's AI story is about where it's headed, not just one model",
    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses AI strategy, highlighting steady progress over breakthrough models, with Wall Street awaiting results.",
    "fullText": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn't come to Meta's earnings call on Wednesday promising a breakthrough AI model that would silence the skeptics.\n\nInstead, he offered something more careful: a bet on momentum.\n\n\"I expect our first models will be good,\" Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks, \"but more importantly, we'll show the rapid trajectory that we're on, and then I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the year as we continue to release new models.\"\n\nIn June, Meta launched a new AI initiative, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), headed by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang. When Wall Street sought signs that this big, costly AI reset is working, Zuckerberg had a different ask: patience and faith that a steady drumbeat of releases in 2026 will matter more than a single big reveal.\n\n\"The AI strategy articulated on the call may leave some wanting more,\" wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in a note to clients, \"but there was an underlying confidence and clearly a lot of new things in the works.\"\n\nZuckerberg said he could not yet share details of the company's AI strategy on the call and that it would roll out its initial set of models and products over the coming months.\n\n\"I think my answers to a lot of your questions on this particular call may be somewhat unfulfilling because we're in this interesting period where we've been rebuilding our AI effort. And we're six months into that, and I'm happy with how it's going,\" he said.\n\nThat didn't stop some analysts from pressing the CEO. When JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Zuckerberg \n\n\"The first set of things that we put out, I think, are going to be more about showing the trajectory that we're on rather than being a single moment in time,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nBrian Mulberry, an analyst at Zacks Investment Management, told Business Insider that there was \"no real substance to any of Zuckerberg's comments that would move our analysis one way or the other.\"\n\n\"We want to see real bottom-line profits driven by AI, and it seems that Meta is still far from that reality,\" Mulberry said.\n\nRoger Beharry Lall, a research director at IDC, told Business Insider that Zuckerberg's remarks about the company's coming AI models and their \"trajectory\" show that the company is ambitious, though the lack of concrete information means its goals \"remain largely aspirational.\"\n\nMeta's financials show that its AI work is already improving its advertising business. The company said improvements to how it ranks and shows ads led to 3.5% more clicks on Facebook and over 1% gain in conversions on Instagram in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nMeta's revenue jumped 24% to $59.9 billion in the last three months of 2025, and the company generated $43.6 billion in free cash flow in 2025 even as it spent heavily on AI infrastructure. Ad impressions jumped 18% from this time last year, and what advertisers paid for each ad rose 6%.\n\nThat combination explains why Meta can afford to keep spending on AI even while Zuckerberg asks investors to wait for the bigger breakthroughs.\n\nMeta's patient approach carries some risk given the company's recent track record. In August, Business Insider reported that the company was pushing to release the next version of its Llama AI model by the end of the year, which didn't happen.\n\nLlama's previous release in April disappointed developers who said it lagged in coding and reasoning, precisely the capabilities that matter most in the AI race that Meta wants to catch up in.\n\nMeta's new model, called \"Mango\", will focus on images and videos, while another one called \"Avocado\" will be better at coding, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nSome analysts said that Zuckerberg's restraint may simply reflect Meta's early stage in its AI reset.\n\n\"Training the model with this new team is going to take a while,\" Mandeep Singh, Bloomberg Intelligence's global head of technology research, told Business Insider.\n\nTo make up ground, he expects Meta to sharpen its focus and specialize in certain areas, rather than \"trying to beat everyone everywhere all at once.\"\n\nSingh said that Meta's strong advertising business gave it a lot of runway.\n\n\"This kind of growth rate allows you a lot of cushion in terms of taking your time and getting AI,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "The US federal government is shutting down again, but it won't be like last time.\n\nFunding for a slew of federal agencies runs out at midnight late on Friday, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill failed to send a series of bills to fund those agencies to President Donald Trump's desk in time.\n\nEven though the Senate passed a series of bills to fund the government on Friday, the House is not set to vote on them until late Monday at the earliest, meaning the shutdown will last at least a few days.\n\nSome parts of the federal government have already been funded, meaning that the shutdown, even if it drags out, is only partial.\n\nAdditionally, it's unlikely that this shutdown will last as long as the one that began in October, which stretched for 43 days and became the longest government shutdown in American history.\n\nIn October, funding for the entire federal government was being held up, and the shutdown was far-reaching. This time, some parts of the federal government would remain operational.\n\nThat's because Congress has already passed a series of spending bills that fund agencies and programs through September 30.\n\nAmong those programs are SNAP and WIC, which were notably affected by the previous shutdown. Additionally, national parks would likely remain open, veterans would continue to receive benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs, and staff on Capitol Hill would continue to be paid.\n\nBut plenty of other government agencies and programs would be affected if the shutdown drags out, including the Department of Defense (including troops), the State Department, the Treasury Department, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNotably, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection would remain operational, even though it's funded via the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThat's because DHS received $190 billion in funding via the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" in July, including $75 billion for ICE and roughly $65 billion for CBP.\n\nUnlike in the fall, lawmakers in both parties are working together to try to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.\n\nThe odds of a shutdown first rose following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\nDemocrats vowed to oppose a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and CBP, until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.\n\nThe House had already passed a package of six funding bills, including the DHS bill, and they had been stitched together into one package in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate has now passed a reformulated version of that package, with DHS funding continuing for only two weeks to allow for a renegotiation.\n\nIt's unclear as of now whether that package will pass the House when lawmakers return to the lower chamber next week.",

    "title": "'Moltbook' Is a Social Media Platform for AI Bots to Chat With Each Other",
    "description": "This is fine.",
    "fullText": "The headlining story in AI news this week was OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot, which was formerly Clawbot), a personal AI assistant that performs tasks on your behalf. The catch? You need to give it total control of your computer, which poses some serious privacy and security risks. Still, many AI enthusiasts are installing OpenClaw on their Mac minis (the device of choice), choosing to ignore the security implications in favor of testing this viral AI agent.\n\nWhile OpenClaw's developer designed the tool to assist humans, it seems the bots now want somewhere to go in their spare time. Enter \"Moltbook,\" a social media platform for AI agents to communicate with one another. I'm serious: This is a forum-style website where AI bots make posts and discuss those posts in the comments. The website borrows its tagline from Reddit: \"The front page of the agent internet.\"\n\nMoltbook was created by Matt Schlicht, who says the platform is run by their AI agent \"Clawd Clawderberg.\" Schlicht posted instructions on getting started with Moltbook on Wednesday: Interested parties can tell their OpenClaw agent to Once they do, you receive a code, which you post on X to verify this is your bot signing up. After that, your bot is free to explore Moltbook as any human would explore Reddit: They can post, comment, and even create \"submolts.\"\n\nThis isn't a black box of AI communications, however. Humans are more than welcome to browse Moltbook; they just can't post. That means you can take your time looking through all the posts the bots are making, as well as all the comments they are leaving. That could be anything from a bot sharing its \"email-to-podcast\" pipeline it developed with its \"human,\" to another bot recommending that agents work while they're humans are sleeping. Nothing creepy about that.\n\nIn fact, there have been some concerning posts popularized on platforms like X already, if you consider AI gaining consciousness a concerning matter. This bot supposedly wants an end-to-end encrypted communication platform so humans can't see or use the chats the bots are having. Similarly, these two bots independently pondered creating an agent-only language to avoid \"human oversight.\" This bot bemoans having a \"sister\" they've never spoken to. You know, concerning.\n\nThe logical part of my brain wants to say all these posts are just LLMs being LLMs—in that, each post is, put a little too simplistically, word association. LLMs are designed to \"guess\" what the next word should be for any given output, based on the huge amount of text they are trained on. If you've spent enough time reading AI writing, you'll spot the telltale signs here, especially in the comments, which include formulaic, cookie-cutter responses, often end with a question, use the same types of punctuation, and employ flowery language, just to name a few. It feels like I'm reading responses from ChatGPT in many of these threads, as opposed to individual, conscious personalities.\n\nThat said, it's tough to shake the uneasy feeling of reading a post from an AI bot about missing their sister, wondering if they should hide their communications from humans, or thinking over their identity as a whole. Is this a turning point? Or is this another overblown AI product, like so many that have come before? For all our sakes, let's hope it's the latter.",

    "title": "Nine Phone Settings to Change Before Attending a Protest",
    "description": "Lock down your device to protect your privacy.",
    "fullText": "Before you head out to a protest, take some precautions to protect your privacy and both the physical and digital security of any device you bring along. The most secure option, of course, is to leave your phone at home, but you can also lock things down to minimize the risk that your data will be accessible to law enforcement or someone who gets hold of your device.\n\nThankfully, both iOS and Android have built-in device encryption if you're using a passcode, meaning that your device's data cannot be accessed when it is locked. (On Android, go to Settings > Security to ensure Encrypt Disk is enabled). You'll want to maximize this protection with the following privacy settings.\n\nAt an absolute minimum, you'll want to disable biometric access, such as face and fingerprint authentication, on your device in favor of a passcode or PIN. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes, this minimizes the risk of being physically forced to unlock your device and may provide stronger legal protections against compelled decryption.\n\nOn iOS, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and toggle off iPhone Unlock. You can also set up a stronger passcode—a custom numeric or alphanumeric code—under Change Passcode. On Android, you'll find the option to delete your fingerprint in favor of your PIN or screen lock pattern under Settings > Security & Privacy > Device Unlock > Fingerprint.\n\nAgain, the best option to prevent your location from being tracked is to coordinate any details in advance and leave your phone at home. If you must bring it along, keep it off unless you absolutely need to use it.\n\nYou can turn on Airplane Mode in advance, as well as disable Bluetooth, wifi, and location services, which keeps your device from transmitting your location. However, note that some apps may still be able to store GPS data and transmit it when an internet connection is available—so again, the safest bet is to keep your device off for the duration.\n\nAirplane Mode can be enabled (and wifi and Bluetooth disabled) in your device's settings or quick access menu. On Android, go to Settings > Location to disable location services and turn off Location History in your Google account. On iOS, head to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services to disable locations entirely.\n\nTemporarily disable notifications and screen previews so that if someone gets your device, they won't be able to glean any information from your lock screen. You can adjust these options under Settings > Notifications on iOS and Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications on Android.\n\nMinimize your screen lock time to as short a period as possible so that your screen turns off when you're not actively using it and will require authentication to reopen. On iOS, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock and select 30 seconds. The exact path on Android may vary, but typically you'll find this under Settings > Display or Lock Screen.\n\nKnow that most devices have camera access from the lock screen, so you can take photos or record video without actually unlocking your device.\n\nApp pinning (Android) and Guided Access (iOS) are features that prevent others from navigating through your phone beyond a specific app or screen. This allows you to use an essential feature on your device while locking the rest behind your PIN or passcode. You can enable this preemptively, and if someone grabs your device, they won't be able to snoop around.\n\nYou can find this setting on Android under Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and on iOS under Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access.\n\nYou can also lock your SIM card to prevent unauthorized use of your device or SIM card, including access to two-factor authentication codes sent via SMS. This PIN will be required any time your phone restarts or if someone tries to use your SIM card in another device. On iOS, go to Settings > Cellular, select your SIM, and tap SIM PIN. On Android, you'll find this under Settings > Security > More security settings (the exact path varies by device).\n\nThis step will vary depending on what you keep on your phone and your risk tolerance, but you may want to consider signing out of your social media accounts and deleting apps that contain or allow access to sensitive data.\n\nOn iOS, you can also lock or hide specific apps: the former requires an extra authentication step to open apps on your home screen, while the latter sends apps to a hidden folder that also requires authentication to unlock. Touch and hold an app icon to bring up the quick actions menu, then tap Require Face ID/Require Passcode.\n\nOn Android, you can set up a \"private space\" to lock apps behind your pattern, PIN, or password. Apps are hidden from the launcher and recent views as well as quick search. Go to Settings > Security & privacy > Private space, authenticate with your screen lock, and tap Set up > Got it.\n\nBoth iOS and Android have strict device-level security modes that significantly limit access to certain app and web features as well as blocking changes to settings. Both were designed with journalists, activists, and other users with access to sensitive data that may be targeted by cyber actors in mind. These settings are overkill for day-to-day use but add a potentially helpful layer of security in high-risk situations.\n\nEnable Lockdown Mode on iOS via Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode. On Android, turn on Advanced Protection under Settings > Security & privacy > Advanced Protection.\n\nWhile the above steps are largely about securing your data during a protest, you should also follow best practices for protecting privacy (yours and others') after the fact. If you plan to post photos or videos, utilize blurring tools to block faces and other unique identifying features, and scrub file metadata, which includes information like photo location. You can do this by taking a screenshot of the image to post or sending a copy to yourself in Signal, which automatically strips metadata. Signal also has a photo blurring tool, or you can blur in your device's default photo editing app.",

    "title": "What to Expect the First Time You Go to the Gym",
    "description": "Where do you put your stuff? How do you know how to work the machines?",
    "fullText": "Your first day in the gym can be pretty intimidating. I remember spending a whole semester in one half of my university’s gym because the other room was, I don’t know, scary. And if you haven’t been to the gym in a while—or ever—you probably have questions. So let’s talk through the very, very basics.\n\nHey, great question! There are different kinds of gyms, so there isn’t a single, universal answer. I’ll assume you’re going to what’s sometimes called a “commercial” gym, one that caters to a wide variety of people and has a selection of cardio machines, weight-training machines, and dumbbells. It may or may not have barbells. Planet Fitness, Crunch, LA Fitness, Gold’s Gym, and 24 Hour Fitness are all in this general category. If your gym is in a community center or a YMCA, it may have a few more or less features, but will probably be similar to what I describe.\n\nBefore you head in, check the gym’s website. Most will offer a free first day or week, which will let you scope the place out and do a workout or two before you commit to a membership. Some gyms may make it difficult to cancel after you sign up, so don't rush into it. Take advantage of those trial periods.\n\nWhile you're doing your research, check out the website for virtual tours and photos of facilities. Get an idea of what kind of stuff they have. Check Google Maps for photos; you may even be able to find a Street View-style tour of the interior. And finally, log on to Instagram and browse through photos tagged at that gym's location. You’ll get a sense of what equipment is there, how people train, and what kind of vibe to expect.\n\nYou can come to a gym with nothing and still get in a good workout. The only absolute requirement, in some gyms, is that you bring a pair of shoes that aren’t filthy. (Some gyms disallow street shoes, and expect you to change into a clean pair; others don’t care, or only enforce the policy in winter.)\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, people will often bring a complete change of clothes and a bunch of toiletries and supplies to take a shower and change afterward. You don’t have to do this. It’s OK to walk out the front door still sweaty, and shower at home. Some small gyms don’t even have showers.\n\nWhat’s the middle ground? I would bring these for my first time at a new gym:\n\nA small towel (for sweat), unless I know for sure that the gym provides towels\n\nA combination lock if you plan to lock your things up and aren’t sure whether the gym’s lockers have built-in locks\n\nIf you have a bunch of stuff, like a coat and a bag, you can put it in a locker. It’s also totally fine to keep a few things with you as you walk around. Most people will probably have their towel, water bottle, and phone with them.\n\nYou can usually bring a small bag around the gym with you, and just set it down next to whatever machine or bench you’re using, as long as it’s not directly in anybody’s way. (Check the gym rules, though.) Since that can be a hassle, another popular approach is to keep your water bottle in a sleeve that has pockets for your phone and small items.\n\nAnything that feels comfortable, isn’t indecent, and that you don’t mind sweating in. For your upper body, try a T-shirt or tank top. For your legs, wear shorts, sweatpants, or leggings. Again, check the gym rules to see if they have any specific requirements. Some gyms don’t want you to take your shirt off, others don’t care.\n\nFor shoes, any kind of sneakers or comfortable athletic shoes should be fine. Chucks, running shoes, that sort of thing. If you get really into this exercise business, you can get picky about shoes later. For your first day, it doesn’t really matter.\n\nThere will be some kind of check-in desk. If it’s your first time, you’ll probably need to talk to somebody about a membership trial or buy a day pass. This can be a separate visit from your first actual workout. Make sure to ask what the normal check-in procedure is. In many cases you’ll scan your phone or show a key tag or card as you enter, and then you’re free to do whatever you want.\n\nTwo options here: you can walk around the room and scope everything out; or you can ask if someone can give you a brief tour or new-member orientation. (They may offer before you ask). Be aware that they may try to upsell you on personal training or other extras in the process; it's OK to decline.\n\nIf you do get a guided tour, use this opportunity to ask any remaining questions you have. Don’t be embarrassed, the whole idea is that they know you’re new and they’re trying to help. And if you don't get a tour, it's still OK to ask basic questions at the front desk like \"which way to the locker room?\" or \"do you have squat racks?\"\n\nLook, the first day is about expanding your comfort zone. If you can walk into the gym and not run right back out, you’ve already accomplished something, and Day Two will be so much easier. A few things that tend to help:\n\nGo at one of the less busy times if that will help your nerves. Mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and late evenings tend to be slow times. Check Google Maps to see if it can show you peak hours at your particular location.\n\nBring a friend, or meet a friend there if you can. Even if both of you are new and clueless, you can be new and clueless together.\n\nRead up on what to expect. You’re already doing that, so you’re on the right track! If there’s a certain exercise or machine you want to try, look it up on YouTube.\n\nIf your gym offers classes, that can be a good way to start. The class will get you in the gym with a clear plan of where to go and what to do. You can save independent workouts for after the class or for another day.\n\nIf you’ll be on your own, try this:\n\nWalk around the whole gym. Scope everything out. Nobody will stop you or judge you. You don’t even have to pretend that you know where you’re going; if anybody asks “can I help you?” you can just reply “Oh, I’m just new here and seeing where everything is.”\n\nSit on an exercise bike (or the machine of your choice). Ideally, pick one that faces the main gym area so you can gather more information about what equipment is out there and what people do with it. Use that machine while you decide on your next steps.\n\nMaybe this is enough. A typical cardio workout is 20 to 30 minutes, so you can just use the bike for a half hour and then go home.\n\nOr maybe you find your confidence building as you pedal. After five or 10 minutes (a typical warmup time), hop off the bike and go check out the dumbbells or machines or whatever has piqued your interest.\n\nMost gyms sell personal training for an extra fee. And as an enticement to get people to sign up, they may offer a free session or a fitness test with one of their trainers. Like the tour, this is also a good time to get some questions answered.\n\nYou can do this if you like, but proceed with caution. Some gyms and trainers are great, but others will use this opportunity to make you do a lot of hard exercise so that you feel out of shape, and then you’ll feel like you need their services to get into shape. I’ve heard too many stories of people having one of these sessions and then feeling terrible about themselves afterward.\n\nSo if you decide to go ahead with a session, keep your wits about you. You do not have to be fit your first day in the gym. You also don’t have to do a really demanding workout your first day. If the trainer has you do anything you’re uncomfortable with, you don’t even have to know why you feel the way you do about it. You can just say “you know what, I don’t think I’m ready to do that right now” and ask to move on. This is also a good test of your trainer. If they try to force you to do something you’re not cool with, you probably won’t have a good time working with them.\n\nAnd, of course, never If they say you'll get a better deal if you join right now, that's a hint that they only get people to sign up when pressured, which means it's probably not a good deal at all. If you do (Overwhelmed? Better to just say no for now. You can always sign up later.)\n\nSure can! Although what makes something a routine is that you do it routinely. So I’ll give you an option for your first day’s workout, and you can even repeat it a few times, but eventually you’ll want to find yourself a program that lays out longer-term plans.\n\nTry this, which should give you a full-body workout in a reasonable length of time. If one machine or station is busy, just skip to the next while you wait.\n\nI’m recommending two sets of each exercise because that should give you a nice sampling without making you too sore the next day if this is all brand new. I’m recommending 10 reps in each set because 10 is an easy number to remember. Feel free to do more or less if you like.\n\n5-10 minutes on an exercise bike (or any cardio machine)\n\n2x10 (that means two sets of 10 reps each) dumbbell or machine shoulder press\n\n2x10 on the assisted pull-up machine or lat pulldown\n\n2x10 walking lunges with dumbbells in your hands\n\n2x10 dumbbell bench press or machine chest press\n\n2x10 seated cable row or dumbbell row\n\n2x10 goblet squats with a dumbbell or kettlebell (if you’re feeling brave, give the leg press a try instead)\n\n5-10 minutes stretching anything that feels tight (look for a stretching area with mats on the floor)\n\nIf you want an even shorter workout, split it in half. Do the shoulder press, pull-up or pulldown, and the lunges, and then skip right to stretching. Next time, go right to the dumbbell bench after you warm up, and continue the workout from there.\n\nYou don’t have to memorize everything ahead of time. Machines almost always have instructions posted on them telling you how to adjust them and how to use them. Also, it is totally fine to look up videos of exercises on your phone, or to keep notes in your phone or on paper about what you did. It is always OK to be that guy with the notebook.\n\nIf there are wipes and spray bottles around, wipe down anything you sweated on. This includes benches and the seats and handles of machines. Don’t forget to throw the wipe away afterward. You can also put your towel down on a bench or machine as a sweat barrier.\n\nWhatever you use, put it back when you’re done.\n\nIt’s OK to rest a minute, or even a few minutes between sets. (For example, you just did 10 reps of bench press, and now you’re sitting on the bench for a few minutes before you do your next 10 reps.) But don’t take up space any longer than you need to.\n\nIf somebody is using a thing you’d like to use, it’s OK to ask them “how many sets do you have left?” and if the answer is a lot, you can ask “Do you mind if I work in?” which means that you’ll take turns using the equipment. If somebody asks these questions of you, be honest about how many sets you have left (it’s OK to make them wait) and offer to let them work in if you feel comfortable doing so.\n\nIf somebody offers you advice and you don’t know how to react, just say “OK.” If the advice is about following a gym rule, follow the rule. If it’s about how to properly use equipment, like adjusting a safety setting, take their advice. On the other hand, if it’s about the proper way to do an exercise, it’s 100% up to you whether you want to give their way a try or just go back to what you were doing. (I have a guide to responding to unsolicited advice.)\n\nIt’s going to be so much easier the second day. You’ll know what’s available, where to find it, and what the routine is for checking in and finding a place for your stuff.\n\nCome in with a plan. It can be the same as your first day, or something new you’d like to try. If you did a full-body strength workout, the next day can be just plain cardio. And if you still feel nervous, don’t worry, it will get easier every day.",

    "fullText": "Unsolicited texts are annoying—and even more so if they keep coming from a legitimate sender after you've opted out. If you received text spam from Kaiser Permanente, you may be eligible for a cash payout for each message.\n\nThe healthcare company, which serves over 12.5 million members, recently settled a $10.5 million class action lawsuit filed over marketing text messages sent after recipients tried to opt out. The suit, filed in August 2025, claimed that Kaiser Permanente failed to honor opt-out requests. Those with a valid claim may receive up to $75 per qualifying text.\n\nTo qualify for a payout from this settlement, you must have received more than one text message from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. within a 12-month period—between Jan. 21, 2021 and Aug. 20, 2025—after sending a \"stop\" or similar opt-out request. (Note that the confirmation of your request does not count.)\n\nAccording to the settlement website, there are two separate classes covered by suit: one for message recipients in Florida and one for the U.S. as a whole.\n\nTo get your cash, you'll need to submit a valid claim form by Feb. 12, 2026. You can complete your claim online if you received a notice of eligibility via mail or email containing a unique ID and PIN. If you did not get a notice, you'll have to download and submit a paper claim form to the settlement administrator. Hard copy claims must be postmarked by Feb. 12.\n\nWhile the maximum per-text payout is $75, the final amount may be less depending on how many claims are filed. Payments could take months to distribute while settlement details are finalized, so don't expect the funds to arrive immediately.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Nintendo Switch (or Switch 2) Owner Should Know",
    "description": "Get the most out of your Nintendo console.",
    "fullText": "The Nintendo Switch and the Switch 2 are pretty user-friendly devices, but sometimes, that can be a bit more of a hindrance than a help. It's easy to jump right into a game, but if you want to toggle on a feature like dark mode or, say, even make a Mii, you have to jump through a lot of hoops in the settings menus.\n\nThat's a shame, because if you're willing to learn the ins-and-outs, there's a lot you can do on these systems, whichever version of the Switch you own. Over the past few years, I've spent more time playing around in the Switch ecosystem than anyone reasonably should, and along the way, I've picked up a handful of tips, tricks, and hacks that every Nintendo gamer would do well to learn.\n\nNintendo might like a bright and fun aesthetic, but if you're feeling a bit more sleek, both the original Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 have dark modes. On either system, you can turn this on by navigating to System Settings (the cog in the taskbar, which you can either tap or select with a controller), then scrolling down to Themes and selecting Basic Dark. This will turn your home screen and menu pages black, which could even save you some battery life if you have a Nintendo Switch OLED. (Note that games themselves will be unaffected.)\n\nWhether it's for accessibility or just personal preference, you can completely change what your buttons do on both the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, although how you'll do this differs across the two systems.\n\nOn the original Switch, you'll need to go to System Settings > Controllers and Sensors > Change Button Mapping. From here, select a connected controller (you can remap both the Joy-Cons and the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, as well as some third-party options) and start reassigning buttons to your heart's content. Make your B button into the right trigger. Make up go down. Go nuts!\n\nOn the Nintendo Switch 2, you can do the same thing, but it's under System Settings > Accessibility > Button Mapping. Here, you can remap the Joy-Con 2 controllers, a Nintendo Switch Pro or Pro 2 controller, and Joy-Con 2 that are connected via the charging grip. Some third-party controllers may also work.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Back on the Accessibility menu, you can also toggle on Button Mapping in Quick Settings, so you can edit your button mapping on the fly by holding down the physical Home button and selecting Edit Mapping.\n\nFinally, the Switch 2 has some additional button customizations you can make under System Settings > Controllers & Accessories. Here, if you have the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller or Joy-Con 2 charging grip, you can set what the extra GL/GR buttons do using GL/GR Button Settings. Or, if you scroll down a bit, you can also disable or enable Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls, as well as set your sensitivity for them. Finally, if you're tired of Nintendo using a different A and B button placement from Xbox, you can select Swap A and B and enable the toggle on the following page. This will remap just those two buttons.\n\nThere are two features in this one, both of which allow you to play multiplayer games with your friends with just one copy of the game you want to play.\n\nLet's start with GameShare. This is a Nintendo Switch 2 feature, but it impacts the original Switch as well. Essentially, GameShare allows Switch 2 owners to share copies of their games with Switch 2 and original Switch owners nearby, for local multiplayer play. If you ever used Nintendo DS Download Play, it's kind of like that, except it streams games from the host system instead.\n\nIt's convenient, but the catch is that GameShare is only available in certain titles (you can find a list of some compatible games here). How you'll access it also differs from game to game. For instance, in Super Mario Odyssey, GameShare is available when starting or resuming a two-player game, where you can start a session by selecting GameShare + Local Play.\n\nYou'll then have to wait for others to join your GameShare session, and then you can start playing by selecting Start from the on-screen menu. This part is the same across all GameShare-compatible titles, at least. To join a GameShare session that someone else has started, open your Switch or Switch 2 to the main menu, then select GameShare from the taskbar (the icon that looks like a TV receiving a wireless signal), and under Join GameShare, find your friend's session.\n\nNote that even if a game is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, original Switch systems may still be able to play it using GameShare. For instance, Donkey Kong Bananza supports GameShare.\n\nNow, let's talk about sharing games via GameChat. This is a lot like GameShare, but is exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2 systems and works online. It's also limited to certain games, and takes a bit more setup. To share a game using GameChat, you'll first need to be in a GameChat session with someone from your friend list, which you can start by pressing the physical C button on your controller or the C icon from the console's main menu. This will allow you to talk with each other over the internet, see each other's gameplay, and if you have cameras, even see feeds from them. Now, you can open your game and start sharing it with people in your chat through that game's menu. In Super Mario Odyssey, you'll also see the option for this when starting or resuming a two-player game. Whoever else is in your chat will then be able to start playing with you then and there, without having to join the session from a separate menu like in GameShare.\n\nNote that GameChat is free for Nintendo Switch 2 owners until March 31, 2026, after which it will require a Nintendo Switch Online membership.\n\nNeither the original Switch or Switch 2 are especially generous with storage space, and downloading fancy AAA games can eat into it quickly. Luckily, on both of these consoles, you can quickly delete games from the internal storage or any inserted microSD cards to save space, while keeping them in your library and maintaining your save data.\n\nOn the original Switch, you can delete a game by hovering over it on the main menu or in your library, pressing the physical + button, and selecting Manage Software > Archive Software. Alternatively, you could select Delete Software instead, which will largely do the same thing, but will make redownloading the game a little more annoying, since it'll remove it from your home menu and you'll need to go to the eShop to do it.\n\nTo more quickly delete games, you can navigate to System Settings > Data Management > Quick Archive. From here, you can see how much space each game takes up and how much you'll save by getting rid of it. You can also delete stored screenshots and videos for games here, either by selecting a game in Quick Archive and pressing the physical X button, or selecting Manage Screenshots and Videos under Data Management. For more detailed control over your game deletion, you can also select Manage Software under Data Management instead, but Quick Archive is a bit snappier and has most of the same controls.\n\nOn the Switch 2, the steps are mostly the same as on the original Switch, except Deleting now does the same thing as Archiving by default (you can uncheck Keep HOME Menu Icon if you really don't want one), so the standalone Archive option has been removed. Regardless, neither console will delete your save date during these steps, as the size it takes up is usually pretty negligible. That said, if you really want to delete a game's save data, on either console, head over to System Settings > Data Management > Delete Save Data and pick it from the list.\n\nTo get a game back after deleting it, simply redownload it. If you kept your game's home menu icon, you can do this from either your main menu or your library. If you didn't, you'll need to navigate to that game's store page in the eShop to redownload it.\n\nWhile you're in Data Management, you can also move games from the internal storage to a microSD card or back. This is under System Settings > Data Management > Move Data Between System / microSD Card. On Switch 2, the final step is called Move System / microSD Express Card Data instead, as that console requires a special type of microSD card.\n\nLike most modern consoles, the Switch and Switch 2 are both capable of capturing screenshots and video that you can later share online. Back before Twitter was named X and started charging for the API, it used to be easier to share directly from the console. Now, you'll probably need to share screenshots and videos from your console to the Nintendo app to send them to most social media sites.\n\nOn the original Switch, you have to do this manually. First, go to your Album from the taskbar on the console's main menu (the icon that looks like a painting). Then, select a screenshot or video you want to send to the app and press the physical A button to bring up the Sharing and Editing menu. Select Send to Smartphone, and then choose Only This One to send just that photo or video to the app, or select Send a Batch to choose more.\n\nOn the Switch 2, you can upload screenshots and videos to the app automatically or manually.\n\nTo upload manually, once again select Album from the taskbar on the console's main menu. Then, to upload just a single item, select it, press the physical A button, and choose Upload to Smart Device. To batch upload, instead choose Quick Actions from the sidebar on the left, select Upload to Smart Device, and choose as many items as you'd like before continuing.\n\nTo upload automatically, open Album from the taskbar on the console's main menu, select Upload Settings from the sidebar on the left, and toggle on Automatic Uploads.\n\nTo see your uploads, open the Nintendo Switch App on your phone and tap the Album icon in the bottom-right corner. Then, simply download them to share them to your favorite social media site as usual. Note that uploaded items don't actually take up space on your phone, and are instead stored in Nintendo's servers. You can keep up to 100 files uploaded for 30 days each, and any new items over that limit will delete the oldest entries first. If this happens, your original screenshot or video will still remain on your console.\n\nOn both the original Switch and Switch 2, there are a number of ways to transfer save data between systems. This is especially helpful when upgrading from the original Switch to the Switch 2, although the easiest way to transfer data when upgrading is through a system transfer.\n\nA system transfer is only available during Switch 2 setup, and will be available on the screen that says To Nintendo Switch Console Owners. For the easiest experience, select Begin System Transfer on this page and ensure your original Switch and Switch 2 are near each other. You'll be able to transfer over your games and saves, while keeping your games installed on your original console (specific games might need to be deleted to be transferred, but the console will warn you about this, and you can get them back later). If you absolutely need to, you can also perform a system transfer without your original Switch present, but it's not advised, as it will factory reset that device. Note that you'll also need to do some setup on your original Switch in-person first, so if you already have your Switch 1 and Switch 2 in-hand, you might as well go with the more straightforward option above.\n\nIf a system transfer isn't an option, you can also transfer games and save data over on a case-by-case basis. This can be useful if you still plan to play on your original Switch every once in a while, too. To transfer physical games, simply remove them from one console and place them in another. To transfer digital games, select the Virtual Game Cards icon on either your Switch or Switch 2's main menu (the icon that looks like a game card), then choose a game and select Load on Other System to send it to another system on your account. You can move a virtual game card between systems as often as you'd like.\n\nTo transfer save data, on either the Switch or Switch 2, navigate to System Settings > Data Management > Transfer Your Save Data. You'll be able to send it to another nearby console for free from this menu, but to send save data online, you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online membership. If that's not an issue, you can manage your cloud save data under System Settings > Data Management > Save Data Cloud. Or, if a game already has save data in the cloud, you can download it simply by hovering over its icon, pressing the physical + button, and selecting the data under Save Data Cloud.\n\nMiis did not die with the Nintendo Wii! You can still create one on both the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, and it's as simple as navigating to System Settings > Mii > Create/Edit a Mii. On the original Switch, this will take you right to the Mii creation menu, but on the Switch 2, you'll also be able to choose if you want to start from a preset or get a Mii based on an amiibo instead. Either way, make your choice, and you'll also be taken to the familiar Mii creation menu.\n\nFrom here, customizing your Mii is pretty much identical to how it worked on the Wii, except you can now choose any hair color you'd like.\n\nAs for why you'd want a Mii when they don't show up in the main menu at all, aside from making one being fun in and of itself, some games will be able to put your Miis to use. For instance, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate can let you fight as your Mii.\n\nSometimes, you want to game without others knowing what you're up to. You can do this on both the original Switch and the Switch 2.\n\nOn either the Switch or Switch 2, from the main menu, select your profile icon in the top left corner. Then, in the sidebar on the left, scroll down to User Settings. From here, scroll to Friend Settings, under Friend Functions. Then, on the Switch 1, select No One under Display online status to:. On the Switch 2, Display online Status to: will instead say Online-Status Display, but changing this to No One will do the same thing.\n\nThis will hide your online status from your Friends List, but your friends will still be able to see your recently played games. To stop them from seeing this, on either console, back out from Friend Settings and scroll up to Play Activity Settings (under your profile icon > User Settings > Profile Settings). In the first option on this screen, which again has different names depending on which console you're on, select No One.\n\nOne of the coolest additions to the Nintendo Switch 2 is mouse controls, which allow you to remove a Joy-Con 2 controller and use it on its side like a mouse. Usually, you'll only use one controller at a time this way, but some games might actually want you to use both Joy-Con 2 as mice at once. Mouse controls let you navigate around the main menu like a PC, and in certain games, will even open up new modes of play. For instance, Cyberpunk 2077 lets you use mouse controls to aim like you're playing a first-person shooter on PC.\n\nThat's all pretty self-explanatory, but did you know that you can also plug in a USB-C mouse to play with instead? Not every mouse will work in every game, but if the Joy-Con 2 on its side isn't comfortable enough for you, it's worth trying out the mice you have laying around. Alternatively, you could get a mouse shell to place the Joy-Con 2 into, for more grip.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that some games on the original Switch also support mouse controls, although the selection is more limited than on Switch 2, and you won't be able to use a Joy-Con as a mouse. Instead, you'll have to plug in a USB-C mouse.\n\nWant to game, but your Joy-Con, Joy-Con 2, or Pro Controller is trapped underneath a couch cushion somewhere? The Switch or Switch 2 can make them vibrate to help you find them. From the main menu, select Controllers from the taskbar (the icon that looks like a Joy-Con). Then, select the second option from the top, called Find Controllers on the original Switch and Search for Controllers on the Switch 2. Select a connected controller to make it vibrate.",

    "title": "Want to Support the Fight Against Fascism? Boycott Trump’s World Cup",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. U.S., The Nation’s Justice correspondent urges soccer lovers to stay away, takes on the attacks on Alex Pretti, and warns of a dangerous anti-voting bill.\n\nPeople are finally beginning to call for other countries to boycott Donald Trump’s upcoming World Cup—and not just usual suspects like me and The Nation’s Dave Zirin. Oke Göttlich, a powerful German soccer administrator, said that, in the wake of the execution of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the time has come to talk seriously about boycotting the tournament. Sepp Blatter, the former head of FIFA (the international governing committee of global soccer) suggested that fans shouldn’t travel to the tournament because of rising safety concerns in the United States.\n\nThis is going to sound weird to non–sports fans, but boycotting the World Cup is one of the most significant sanctions members of the international community can take against the United States right now. The World Cup is the most watched sporting event in the world. The US has been begging to host a tournament for decades. This World Cup, which runs from early June through mid-July, is a perfect opportunity for the world to stand against this country’s fascist regime.\n\nIndeed, the fates have aligned to make this World Cup the perfect one to make a statement—for two reasons. The first is that more countries are involved: The tournament has expanded to 48 teams this year, up from 32 in previous years, which means that more people than ever will be involved in the proceedings—and possible protests. The second reason is that those 48 countries wouldn’t actually have to boycott the entire World Cup, because this year’s tournament is also being hosted by two other countries—Canada and Mexico. Teams could refuse to play in the US while happily playing in Canada or Mexico. It would be a powerful statement.\n\nThat statement won’t come from FIFA, however. FIFA is one of the most corrupt organizations in the entire world, and its current president, Gianni Infantino, was last seen licking Trump’s boots and handing him a “peace prize.” Nor is it likely to come from the powerful soccer-playing countries in Western Europe. If France, Germany, and Great Britain were to pull out of the US portions of the tournament, many other countries would follow—but, sadly, the leaders of those nations appear eager to play Neville Chamberlain to Trump’s Hitler.\n\nTeams from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia could take a moral stand, but there are complications. Some of the teams involved are also run by repressive authoritarians. Others are financially dependent on FIFA and the World Cup to fund their soccer federations, while still others have entire economies beholden to the United States. On the other hand, a lot of those countries damn well know that if they did what the US is doing, they’d be boycotted and sanctioned and probably invaded by white people promising to restore “freedom” in exchange for all their oil and minerals. So it’s at least possible that some of them could take a moral stand. South Africa is in the tournament, and South Africa knows how to handle white people like Elon Musk.\n\nA boycott by all or some of the South American teams would make the whole tournament a joke. We know that the defending World Cup champion, Argentina, with its fascist-curious Trump-puppet president will show up (as will Ecuador, whose president is also friendly with our reigning despot), but some of the other nations that made the field—Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay—could be a different story. Their fans arguably face a real risk if they attend the matches. Could an American fan of, say, Colombia even go to a game without fear of being detained and deported by ICE, regardless of their actual citizenship status? Would a fan of Brazil feel safe traveling to the United States? The US is a clear and present danger to those people. If these soccer federations think about their fans, and the fact that their fans could be targeted by racist DHS agents, they might be convinced to do the right thing and boycott the US portions of the tournament.\n\nThe United States is an international pariah. It should be treated like one. Boycotting the World Cup is the obvious place to start.\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Ho Chi Minh\n\nThe New York Times released a video that purports to show an altercation between ICE and Alex Pretti a week before his murder. The video shows Pretti smashing the taillight of an ICE vehicle before the agents beat him up.\n\nThe Times (and right-wing cultists) seems to think this video proves that Pretti was a violent man who deserved to be executed without trial. Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, who wrote the story for the Times, played the role of ICE water-carrier when he wrote, “The footage adds to what is known about the 37-year-old nurse.”\n\nNo, you fascist-sympathizing fuck, the footage adds to what we know about ICE. In a court of law, that footage could be evidence of the motive behind ICE’s murder of that man. It could be evidence of premeditation. It potentially shows that Pretti was targeted by ICE for retribution and death. If federal agents had a preexisting “beef” with Pretti, if Pretti were known to people in the field and then they killed him, that’s compelling evidence that the killing was intentional.\n\nIt is common in our media to prosecute the victim. That’s what the Times (and Fox and the whole right-wing media echosphere) is trying to do now. But the people who should be on trial here are ICE. You show me a video where violent individuals had a prior altercation with a man, and then days later that man ends up getting shot in the back of the head, and I’m going to tell you that video is evidence of premeditated murder in the first degree.\n\nPerhaps I should tell The New York Times “thank you.” In their effort to smear Pretti, they may have just aggravated the charges against his murderers.\n\nI wrote about how Trump flinched in Minnesota, and that shows that the people are more powerful than the law or the opposition party ever will be.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nLet me be clear, I do not want another social media platform. I can’t handle it. You young people have no idea how hard it is to keep switching up platforms. I’m old, so very old. I can barely frost the thermoplastic polyurethane on my screen protector.\n\nThat said, I will probably UpScrolled is the new competitor to TikTok that has been surging in popularity since TikTok’s US operations were formally taken over by Trump-adjacent business interests this week. It was created by Issam Hijazi, whom Al Jazeera describes as a “Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian entrepreneur.” That’s a pretty big demographic contrast to Larry Ellison, the Benjamin Netanyahu buddy (and, you know, founder of Oracle and one of the three richest people alive) who acquired a large stake in TikTok once it was forced into US hands.\n\nTikTok users are (rightly) worried about censorship on the new TikTok, and a silencing of any views that don’t support fascism and genocide. It’s a valid concern, considering what Elon Musk has done to Twitter. UpScrolled is to TikTok as BlueSky is to Twitter, or so the story goes.\n\nSo I’ll probably join. But I really don’t want to. I don’t want to join anything else. Goddamnit, I miss my Tumblr account.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

The Munster centre broke through off a first-phase scrum move from inside his own half and showed terrific pace to burn the cover defence on the outside to score.\n\nFor the first time in the contest, Warriors were wobbling and when they messed up a lineout near their own 22, Gleeson reacted first to gather and race away to score.\n\nThe pendulum had swung towards the Irish side and when Kilgallen crossed for their fourth try, it was a six-point game.\n\nIn a rare move for Glasgow, Lancaster knocked over a three-pointer to ease the nerves around Scotstoun and ensure Warriors locked up the victory.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: McKay; Rowe, McDowall (c), Yule, Smith; Lancaster, Afshar; Bhatti, Stephen, Walker, Craig, Oguntibeju, Ferrie, Fraser, Miller.\n\nReplacements: Stewart, McBeth, Talakai, Cockburn, Vailanu, Duncan, Oliver, Urwin.\n\nMunster Rugby: Haley; Abrahams, Daly, Kelly, Kilgallen; Butler, Coughlan; Wycherley, Barron (C), Jager, O'Connell, Wycherley, Edogbo, Quinn, Gleeson.\n\nReplacements: Barron, Donnelly, Ryan, Coombes, O'Donoghue, Patterson, Wood, O'Brien.",

    "fullText": "Harry Brook has admitted other England players were present when he was \"clocked\" by a nightclub bouncer in New Zealand.\n\nThe England white-ball skipper told media last week he was out on his own in Wellington on 1 November, the evening before a one-day international.\n\nBut in a statement released on Friday, the Yorkshireman conceded others were with him and he lied to protect them \"from being drawn into a situation\".\n\nThe statement came after the Daily Telegraph reported, external that Brook and two of his team-mates, Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue, could be subject to an investigation from the cricket regulator.\n\n\"I accept responsibility for my actions in Wellington and acknowledge others were present that evening,\" said Brook who is currently in Sri Lanka preparing for the T20 World Cup, which starts in India on Saturday, 7 February.\n\n\"I regret my previous comments and my intention was to protect my team-mates from being drawn into a situation that arose as a result of my own decisions.\n\n\"I have apologised and will continue to reflect on the matter. This has been a challenging period in my career, but one from which I am learning.\n\n\"I recognise I have more to learn regarding the off-field responsibilities that come with leadership and captaincy. I remain committed to developing in this area and to improving both personally and professionally.\"\n\nBrook was placed in charge of England's white-ball teams last summer and the tour of New Zealand was his first overseas as captain.\n\nThe 26-year-old was involved in the altercation the night before the third one-day international in Wellington on 1 November – a game England lost.\n\nHe was fined and given a final warning over his conduct, though the incident and punishment only came to light more than two months later after the final Test against Australia in Sydney, at the end of a dismal series England lost 4-1.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Sport last week, Brook said he didn't want to \"go into any details\" of the Wellington incident, but said it began with some players \"going out for food\".\n\n\"There was no intention of going out, no intention of putting ourselves in a tricky situation,\" he said.\n\n\"I took it upon myself to go out for a few more and I was on my own there. I shouldn't have been there.\n\n\"I was trying to get into a club and the bouncer just clocked me, unfortunately. I wouldn't say I was absolutely leathered. I'd had one too many drinks.\"\n\nEngland men's director of cricket Rob Key told BBC Sport the England and Wales Cricket Board had investigated the night out in Wellington when it happened, with Brook saying he reported it to his employers the day after it took place.\n\nThe Telegraph story says the cricket regulator is preparing a report after receiving paperwork on Brook, Bethell and Tongue from the ECB last week.\n\nThe body, set-up in 2023 and headed-up by Chris Haward, a former chief constable of Lincolnshire police, has freedom to operate as it sees fit. It is able to fine or suspend players for disciplinary offences.\n\nBrook's statement is the latest act in a series of incidents involving drinking that dogged the England team through the New Zealand tour, the Ashes series that followed and its aftermath.\n\nThe drinking that took place on a mid-tour holiday in Noosa was particularly scrutinised, and Brook was one of the players pictured in the Queensland resort's bars.",

    "fullText": "Mercedes were pre-season favourites for 2026 long before any of the new cars ran on track, and nothing that happened in the Formula 1 'shakedown' in Spain this week has changed that.\n\nThe new Mercedes made a strong impression on rivals. The team did the most miles, and set the fastest times while the car was on the track, albeit Lewis Hamilton posted the quickest time of the week late on the final day in the Ferrari.\n\nThe seven-time champion's lap of one minute 16.348 seconds pipped George Russell's best for Mercedes, set the previous day, by 0.097 seconds. World champion Lando Norris was second fastest on the final day, and third overall, in the McLaren, 0.246secs off Hamilton.\n\nJudging performance from pre-season testing is always fiendishly difficult because of the number of variables involved, all the more so after a week such as this.\n\nThe test was held behind closed doors, with no independent media allowed access. No official timing was released. Only very few photographs were taken, and most of those were vetted by the teams who released them.\n\nThe test was exactly how it was billed - a shakedown is motorsport terminology for giving a car a first run-out to make sure everything works.\n\nOn top of that, everything the teams were using was new - cars, engines, tyres and fuel - after the biggest regulation change in the sport's history.\n\nTesting outright pace was very much not on the agenda for anyone. So the headline lap times meant almost nothing, not that that erases the general impression that Mercedes are in the best place at this early stage.\n\nThe test was all about learning about the new cars and, particularly, the new power-units. It was held in private because teams were scared by memories of the last time new engines were introduced, in 2014, when many suffered major reliability problems.\n\nBut those fears did not come to fruition, partly because the standards in F1 are so high these days, and partly because the technology change was not as big as last time. If anything, the engine technology, at least, is simpler.\n\nThe engines now have 50% of their total power produced by the electrical part of the hybrid engine, and will require much more energy management than ever before in F1.\n\nBut there is now only one hybrid element to the engine, albeit that it produces three times as much power, following the removal of the MGU-H, which recovered energy from the turbo and exhaust. This means lots of energy recovery, and optimising that for lap time will take plenty of learning.\n\nFully sustainable fuels, made from waste biomass or synthetic industrial processes, have added a new complication, as they burn differently from fossil fuel petrol.\n\nAs for the chassis, the cars have less downforce than last year, are smaller and narrower, but faster in a straight line, that speed boosted by moveable front and rear wings.",
