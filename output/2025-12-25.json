(Photo by Claudio Villa/Getty Images for FIGC)\n\nReduced to playing second fiddle to Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo, Chiesa has been at the bottom of the pecking order at Liverpool.\n\nIndeed, the former Juventus star has accumulated just 151 minutes in the Premier League this season.\n\nDespite his limited first-team opportunities, he has scored two goals and managed one assist.\n\nHowever, a player of Chiesa’s quality doesn’t deserve to sit on the bench.",

    "fullText": "Luke Karg and his mentor Gary Foree fish together at Peaceful Valley Lake in Owensville in 2021 (Photo submitted).\n\nThe water on Truman Lake was colder and muddier than normal this April, making for some tough fishing conditions.\n\nLuke Karg, of House Springs, had one last shot before graduating to win the Missouri TBF High School Trail Super Tournament for bass fishing – which he and his then 16-year-old fishing partner, A.J. Massa, had won the year before.\n\nIt’s the last tournament of the season for the Missouri student program of The Bass Federation, and it’s also the final opportunity to earn enough points to be named Team of the Year — the top-scoring duo in the state.\n\n“The tournament itself meant a lot to us, with it being our last state tournament together,” Karg said. “It was very tough. There was, at most, two inches of visibility in the water, but a lot of fishing is just adapting to the changes.”\n\nKarg and Massa headed out on the water for two days for eight hours each. At the end of each day, they weighed their top five fish.\n\n“The first day, they caught almost enough bass to win the tournament,” said Gary Foree, Karg’s mentor and family friend, who is a former professional fisherman. “They had almost 19 pounds, which is insane. There hasn’t been a tournament in three years over 17 pounds on Truman Lake.”\n\nThey brought in 16 pounds on the second day, which would have brought their total up to nearly 35 pounds. But unfortunately it didn’t count. Their boat malfunctioned, making them miss the weigh in.\n\n“It was pretty heart-wrenching,” Karg said. “It was one of our best bags as a team on one of the most difficult days.”\n\nKarg and Massa ended up taking second place at Truman Lake with one day’s worth of fish, and they still had enough points to be named Team of the Year, just as they were last year.\n\nKarg has been part of the Team of the Year five years in a row, including as an incoming high-school freshman.\n\nThat title also sent the team to the TBF Student Angler Federation High School National Championship, which was held at Oklahoma’s Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees in June.\n\nOnly the top two high-school teams from each state can compete, and Karg is the only person in Missouri to have qualified for that opportunity five years in a row, according to officials for the national championship.\n\n“To be one of the top two teams in Missouri for five consecutive years is pretty freaking amazing,” said Karl Buck, who previously led the federation’s high school program in Missouri and was also Karg’s team leader. “I’m just so proud it’s unbelievable. I mean, I can’t believe that I was involved in his upcoming as a fisherman.”\n\nKarg began competitive fishing when he was 12 and participated in dozens of individual and team tournaments as a teen. Through it all, he struggled with an autoimmune illness that made him miss numerous days from school, he said, but he’s proud he still managed to graduate on time in May and continue fishing.\n\nWhile it was grueling standing on a boat for hours under the hot sun, Karg said the national championship was exhilarating because some of the world’s top fishermen were watching.\n\n“It’s the biggest tourn of the year, and a lot of people only get to go to it once, if even,” Karg said. “It really could be the biggest tournament of your life.”\n\nKarg has loved to fish ever since he could hold a rod, said his father Rick Karg. Even as early as 5, he said Karg could catch fish when the adults around him were coming up empty.\n\n“There’s a magic,” Rick said. “My scientific brain says, ‘Is there like a vibration from his heartbeat that travels down the line because he’s got his finger touching it, that the fish like?’”\n\nForee met Karg because of a life-changing promise he made to Karg’s mother, Becky Rumley.\n\nRumley was the nurse administering Foree’s chemotherapy treatment at St. Claire Hospital, and one day, she told him how much her nine-year-old son loved to fish. At the time, Foree thought he only had a few months to live.\n\n“I ended up telling her that if I survive this, I’ll take him to Lake of the Ozarks and get him a five pounder because I used to be a [fishing] guide on the lake,” he said.\n\nForee did pull through, and when they went out fishing, Karg didn’t just catch one five-pound bass.\n\n“I caught three five-pound bass and two six pounders, and like a bunch of big fish,” Karg said. “It is probably the best day of fishing in my life. And ever since then, he’s just dedicated a huge part of his life to help teach me and my partner.”\n\nForee was equally amazed after Karg pulled out nearly 40 pounds of fish that day.\n\n“He just had the best day of fishing anybody could have,” Foree said. “That’s how I got him hooked on fishing.”\n\nOver the years, Foree taught him about tracking fish through the different seasons and how to read the water and the banks. He also helped him get his first boat.\n\nNow, Foree said, Karg’s instincts are his fishing superpower.\n\n“So many times they won a tournament when the fishing was really tough, and Luke said, ‘Let’s try over here. That bank looks good,’” Foree said. “And they’ll go over, and they’ll catch enough fish on that bank to win the tournament.”\n\nKarg believes his instincts have developed with the dozens of tournaments and countless hours of fishing.\n\n“Over time, it’s become more of an instinct, than having to think about, ‘Oh, I should make a change,’” he said. “It just naturally comes.”\n\nFor instance, at both the Truman Lake and national championship, Karg said he was painting his own custom lures while he was on the boat.\n\nAt Truman, he made the decision to color a half-inch chartreuse line on his spinner bait, he said, and he ended up catching much bigger fish, but less fish. If his lure had a straight tail, the catch was better as well, he said.\n\n“It’s all about how the bait works in the water,” he said. “The smallest little detail that can just trigger the fish to eat. That’s where a lot of the fun comes into it for me, is all the difficulties and fun little changes you can make. You can go from catching no fish for hours on end to catching your limit in a minute.”\n\nKarl Buck remembers meeting Karg when he was about 12 on a dock at the Peaceful Valley Lake in Owensville, where Karg’s grandparents have a lake house. Buck used to run a student program called the Owensville Anglers, and they were finishing up a tournament that day.\n\n“When we were doing our weigh-in down at the dam, they came down to the boat ramp to inquire,” Buck said. “He’ll probably hate this, but he was the most bashful young man, super quiet and reserved.”\n\nThe Owensville Anglers is how Karg got his start with tournament fishing, which Buck says is much different than regular fishing.\n\nIn a tournament, Buck said the first rule is “find five.”\n\n“You’re fishing for five fish,” Buck said. “Doesn’t matter what they weigh, they just got to be keepers,” meaning they are big enough to keep.\n\nThe fish go in the box where they’re kept alive and healthy, which is a standard conservation practice in the high-school tournaments.\n\n“After you have five, then you’re going to change your game,” he said. “It’s now no longer about just catching fish. You’re looking to upgrade the fish that you already have. Big fish get big for a reason. They’re hard to catch.”\n\nBig fish know how to hide, and that’s where casting skills come into play, Foree said. He called Karg’s casting skills “insane.”\n\n“He can skip jigs and lures and put them in places nobody else can,” Foree said. “That’s why he’s so good.”\n\nBut he wasn’t always that good, Buck remembers, which is why Karg earned the nickname “Oops” after fishing with Buck and his son one day.\n\n“Luke throws this cast — I believe it was a spinner bait — and it winds up on the roof of this dock, stuck,” Buck said. “So we go up and we get it. A little while later, he makes another cast and it gets stuck on somebody’s dock.”\n\nAfter each time, Karg would just say, “Oops” and the nickname was born. Buck said when they fished together this past summer, he was blown away at his talent.\n\nKarg and Massa ended up placing 56th out of more than 200 teams in the national championship in Oklahoma.\n\n“We lost three three-pounders that came off the boat,” Karg said after the tournament finished. “That would have gotten us up to nine or 10 pounds. We would have been around 12th place probably.”\n\nKarg said he’s proud of his accomplishment over this high school career, and he couldn’t have done it without his fishing partners Massa and previously Kyle Kannawurf, along with their boat captains.\n\n“No one gives credit enough to our boat captains, which were both of our dads,” he said, “just giving the time to drive all the way out there and standing with us out the boat for eight hours straight a day.”\n\nAs boat captain, Rick said he was in “constant amazement” at his son’s skill.\n\n“I’d just sit there and watch and think, ‘How in the world are you doing this?’” Rick said. “You’re like a super sharp shooter.”\n\nRick said he’s watched Karg fish for seven hours without catching anything, but he’d still have the focus and creativity change his strategy and get a big catch at the last minute. Karg’s humility and attitude are among the most impressive things about him, said Foree and Buck, particularly his ability to bounce back from setbacks.\n\n“He never got rattled,” Foree said. “Oh, he’d get upset if he lost a big fish, but he’d just say, ‘Okay, I learned something from that,’ and go on to the next one. His ability to focus and stay focused in times of turmoil when he loses fish or the weather changes is very, very important in professional bass fishing.”\n\nKarg has his own boat detail business, and there are several career paths he’s interested in taking, including a professional fisherman.\n\n“But for that, I would have to be away from home around 200 days of the year,” he said. “So the one I’m probably gonna go with is a natural environmentalist studying fresh water fish.”",

    "description": "The Orioles have already given their fans quite a few presents this offseason.",
    "fullText": "Good morning, Camden Chatters, and Merry Christmas to all who celebrate.\n\nFor Orioles fans, it feels like Christmas has come early. For the first offseason in what feels like forever, the O’s have acted aggressively and decisively — and spent a boatload of money — to improve their team. Pete Alonso, of course, was the biggest gift of all, signing by far the largest free agent contract of the Mike Elias era. But the Orioles have doled out a bunch of other presents, too, from outfielder Taylor Ward to new closer Ryan Helsley to starting pitcher Shane Baz. They even brought back setup man Andrew Kittredge, who we’ll call more of a stocking stuffer.\n\nDon’t expect to find any other presents under the tree from the Orioles today. Christmas Day is usually a quiet one for MLB transactions. Baseball executives have families too, you know.\n\nBut once the holiday season is over, the O’s figure to be right back at work trying to fill the remaining holes on their roster. If they’re going to make a play for Japanese right-hander Tatsuya Imai, they’ll need to do it soon; his posting period ends Jan. 2. If not Imai, maybe Elias will have another starting pitcher to gift to Orioles fans before winter is over.\n\n’Tis the season to feel optimistic about the Orioles. Hopefully this feeling lasts through the spring and beyond.\n\nIf Orioles signed Valdez or Suárez, what would rotation look like? | MAILBAG – BaltimoreBaseball.com\n\nThe answer: better. Much better.\n\nThe O’s need to get better against lefty pitching and their additions will help – Steve Melewski\n\nThis is the second straight offseason the O’s have tried to address their problems against lefties. Let’s hope this year’s solutions turn out better than Tyler O’Neill and Gary Sánchez.\n\nThese 5 prospects improved their stock the most in 2025 – MLB.com\n\nMLB Pipeline’s Jim Callis has some encouraging words about O’s prospect Nate George (and some less-than-encouraging words about Enrique Bradfield Jr.).\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! Four ex-Orioles were born on Christmas, including a 2025 Oriole, catcher Alex Jackson (30). Jackson was the sixth catcher the O’s used this year and turned out to be be one of the best, posting a .763 OPS and five homers in 36 games. The Orioles traded him to the Twins last month. Also born on this date were infielder Tom O’Malley (65) and the late right-handers Charlie Beamon (b. 1934, d. 2016) and Mike Blyzka (b. 1928, d. 2004).\n\nThe Orioles have never made a roster move on Christmas Day, because of course they haven’t. Enjoy your day, everyone!",

The Cowboys were knocked out of contention last week when the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Commanders to clinch the NFC East. Washington is down to their third-string QB in Josh Johnson, and they added last year’s third-string QB (Jeff Driskel) this week with both Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota out.

    "fullText": "Anfernee Simons’ future with the Boston Celtics has been a subplot to the opening months of the 2025-26 NBA season. The score-first guard was acquired in the deal that sent Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers during the summer. Simons is in the final year of his four-year $100 million deal.\n\nIf the Celtics choose to make a move close to the Feb. 5 trade deadline, the team views Simons as a logical trade chip. After all, it is better to flip him in return for long-term assets, rather than risk losing him for nothing in the summer.\n\nHowever, if Simons does stay in Boston beyond the trade deadline, ESPN’s Tim Bontemps, speaking on a recent episode of ESPN’s ‘The Hoop Collective’ podcast, is not convinced he will have a significant role once the postseason begins.\n\n“Frankly, I don’t think Anfernee Simons is going to have a very big role in the playoffs either way,” Bontemps said. “They’re going to be playing Derrick White and Payton Pritchard a ton of minutes. He’s (Simons) not at all a good defensive player. I think he’ll be a liability in large part in the playoffs anyway.”\n\nSimons has become an important part of Boston’s bench rotation. In 29 games this season, all from the bench, he’s averaging 13 points, 2.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists, shooting 43.1% from the field and 36.9% from deep. However, according to DunksandThrees, he’s still struggling on the defensive end, ranking in the bottom 10th percentile of guards for Defensive Estimated Plus/Minus.\n\nBrad Stevens and the Celtics’ front office will likely explore potential trades as the deadline approaches. It’s fair to assume that Simons will feature in those discussions, if for no other reason than to perform some due diligence on his potential market.\n\nThe problem Boston will face is that trading Simons will leave it short on depth at the guard position. As such, if Simons is moved, multiple additional moves could follow to ensure there’s enough balance within the roster ahead of the postseason.\n\nNBA Analyst Weighs In on Jayson Tatum’s Potential Return",

    "fullText": "Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. The Cleveland Cavaliers are in the Mecca for a matchup with the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Cavs and Knicks have a history of bad blood between them. Their meeting in the 2023 NBA Playoffs was a stepping stone for New York and a reality check for the Cavaliers. The Cavs have been carrying that loss with them ever since — and they are hungry for a chance to redeem themselves in a potential rematch.\n\nBoth Cleveland and New York entered the season as favorites to win the Eastern Conference. That might have changed recently as the Detroit Pistons wedge themselves into the mix and the Cavaliers struggle to get out of the gates. But make no mistake, these two rosters are still among the most talented in the East. This game could carry weight by the time the playoffs begin.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe Knicks had a slow start last season as growing pains muddied their process. But following a trip to the Western Conference Finals, a coaching change and some roster tweaks, they’ve gotten off to a much better start this season.\n\nNew York holds the 2nd-best record in the East. They have the 2nd best offense, 14th best defense and 5th best net rating this season according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nThis is a team that has found its identity and plays basketball like they trust each other. They can give as good a challenge as any.\n\nIt’s pretty simple. The Cavs have had a rough December full of low points. But after winning back-to-back games at the start of the week, they have a chance to really make things right with a statement win over their rival on Christmas Day.",

    "title": "'A million choices': Lakers' defense will get a Christmas Day test vs. Rockets",
    "description": "Coach JJ Redick says the Lakers will not make all the correct choices, but \"can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.\"",
    "fullText": "It’s not the lineups, the injuries or necessarily the system. The cause of the Lakers' defensive demise is a thousand little decisions gone wrong.\n\n“It comes down to just making the choice,” coach JJ Redick said after the Lakers gave up 132 points in a blowout loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday. “It's making the choice. There's shortcuts you can take or you can do the hard thing and you can make the second effort or you can sprint back or you can't. It's just a choice and there's a million choices in a game, and you're very likely not gonna make every choice correctly. But can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.”\n\nComing off back-to-back losses for the first time this season, the Lakers (19-9) are ranked 28th in defensive rating in the last 14 games entering a Christmas Day showcase against the Houston Rockets at 5 p.m. PST at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers, without any individual shutdown defenders, need a perfectly executed team defense to compete. But 15 different starting lineups in 28 games has delayed some of the team's ability to build continuity. The Lakers have had their full complement of 14 standard contract players for two games.\n\nForward Rui Hachimura (groin) and Luka Doncic (leg) could return Thursday. Guard Gabe Vincent, one of the team’s top defensive options on the perimeter, will miss his fourth game with lower-back soreness. Center Jaxson Hayes tweaked his left ankle in the second quarter of Tuesday’s loss and didn’t return.\n\nThe Rockets (17-10) limp into the Christmas Day blockbuster with their own struggles. The team thought to be one of the few who could challenge Oklahoma City in the West has lost five of its last seven games. Three of the losses were in overtime and four came against teams currently out of the play-in picture, including Tuesday’s loss to the Clippers.\n\nLed by Kevin Durant’s 25.2 points, the Rockets are a statistical anomaly in the sped up, possession-maximizing modern NBA. They have the third-ranked offense in the league despite being one of the slowest. They shoot the fewest three-pointers per game, but make them at a 40% clip that ranks second, and dominate the glass with NBA-leading 48.7 rebounds and 16.1 offensive rebounds per game.\n\nHouston’s physicality and expertise on the boards could be especially worrisome for a team that still has to consciously choose defense on a possession-by-possession basis instead of consistently living up to a standard of playing hard.\n\n“There's really no defense, no scheme we can do when we're giving up offensive rebounds in crucial moments like we are, our [opponents] are getting wherever they want on the court,” guard Marcus Smart said after Tuesday’s loss. “And there's no help, there's no resistance, there's no urgency. … It's on us.”\n\nThe Suns grabbed 12 offensive rebounds against the Lakers on 35 missed shots, an offensive rebounding rate of 34.3%. After the Suns scored a three-pointer by twice grabbing offensive rebounds off tipped balls, Lakers players had an animated discussion in a timeout with Smart was gesturing toward center Deandre Ayton about tipping rebounds. Ayton, who finished with 10 rebounds and 12 points, and Smart ended the timeout with a high-five.\n\n“[I need to] just continue to talk to guys, even though sometimes they might not want to hear it,” said Smart, a free-agent addition the Lakers coveted for his leadership and tenacity on defense. “Especially when we losing, nobody wants to hear it, myself included, but also understand that it's integral for us to hear those things, to see and to be able to talk to one another and figure it out as players on the court, because we're the ones out there.”\n\nRedick intentionally built in moments for players to connect and communicate during every timeout this season before coaches speak. The strategy was meant to encourage players to take a larger leadership role. “Championship communication” was one of the team’s three pillars.\n\nAlong with “championship shape,” Redick also asked his team to build “championship habits.” Living up to the mantras is easier said than done.\n\n“It's not the easy choice,” Redick said. “It's human nature. … We do it on a daily basis. We make easy choices cause it's comfortable. Comfortable doesn't win.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Dallas moves Tyler Guyton to injured reserve",
    "description": "Here's the latest news surrounding the Dallas Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "Second-year left tackle Tyler Guyton is done for the 2025 season.\n\nThe Cowboys could get one of their Pro Bowlers back in the lineup on Christmas.\n\nDefensive tackle Quinnen Williams (neck) was one of four Cowboys listed as questionable on the team’s injury report for Thursday’s game against the Washington Commanders.\n\nGuard Tyler Booker (ankle), corner Caelen Carson (hamstring) and wide receiver Ryan Flournoy (knee) were also listed as questionable.\n\nFive Cowboys were ruled out for Thursday: Payton Turner (ribs), DeMarvion Overshown (concussion), Phil Mafah (shoulder), Josh Butler (knee) and Tyler Guyton (ankle), who was placed on injured reserve Thursday.\n\nThings are a little different this year under Brian Schottenheimer.\n\nAnother year, another lost season. The Dallas Cowboys have two games left to play and once again find themselves mathematically eliminated from the playoff picture. Despite undergoing major changes to the coaching staff over the previous offseason, the Cowboys are on the same trajectory as they were last year under Mike McCarthy.\n\nThe situation in Year 1 of Brian Schottenheimer has caused many to call for something along the lines of an “organic tank.” By replacing proven veterans with young up-and-comers the Cowboys can simultaneously learn more about their roster and increase their odds of losing in a somewhat respectable fashion.  Obviously, the motivation behind that would be to gain better draft position in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nIt was a similar plea heard around Cowboys Nation in McCarthy’s final season last year. The year was 2024 and McCarthy had just finished his fifth and final season under contract. After three consecutive 12-win seasons, 2024 marked a clear decrescendo for McCarthy’s tenure.\n\nWhile the plea and circumstances behind it are similar for this year, the situations are apples and oranges. The first season in any head coach’s term is about building a culture. Messages are important and have lasting consequences. Send the wrong message early and a coach may never be able to overcome. It’s why letting off the gas, even a little, is a dangerous proposition, even when there’s seemingly nothing to gain.\n\nWhat the Cowboys need to do to get their seventh win of the season.\n\nIn a year that’s been effective all across the board for the Cowboys offense, one area they’ve executed at a high level in is the short passing game, with attempts that are between the line of scrimmage and 10 yards down field.\n\nFor the year, the Cowboys have the third most passing yards in the short passing game (1,716) with 12 touchdowns and five interceptions to go alongside it.\n\nIn their first meeting with the Commanders earlier this season, Dak Prescott completed 15 of his 20 passing attempts within 10 yards for 81 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nDallas has multiple different ways that they can get to those types of plays. George Pickens’ quick slant routes were one of them. We’ve seen quick throws from Prescott to his tight ends on curls routes too. Or, Prescott can get into his groove in the play action game and hit someone on a crosser as well.\n\nUltimately, the Cowboys will have their choice for how they can use the short passing game to move downfield. The good news is, the Commanders have struggled recently to get pressure on the quarterback since their first meeting with Dallas, when they lost DE and former Cowboy Dorance Armstrong for the season to a knee injury. Since Armstrong’s injury, Washington has gone from a 40.7% pressure rate (third-highest in the NFL) to 25.9% (second-lowest).\n\nChance to try new things on defense\n\nWe saw a little bit of experimentation from the Cowboys in a few ways last week, most notably with defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus moving from the sideline to the coaches booth in order to try and gain a better perspective of the defense.\n\nAnother moment that stood out was a specific formation where the Cowboys had three down linemen, and Donovan Ezeiruaku lined up like a linebacker and rushed against the interior of the offensive line as opposed to the outside like he usually does. He was trying to spring open Kenny Clark on a stunt, but the Cowboys couldn’t get home.\n\nWhile that specific instance didn’t work, this week’s game and next week’s serve as an opportunity to continue to try different things and see if there’s anything that you can find success with that could carry over into next season.\n\nFor example, and I’m not saying this is the sole option that could be experimented with nor am I hinting it’ll happen, what about trying some more six-man blitzes? The Cowboys have sent six rushes 5.8% of the time this year, the tenth-lowest mark in the league. Could that be a way where they can finally turn pressure into sacks?\n\nBelieve it or not, the Cowboys have recorded the 15th highest pressure rate in the NFL this season at 34.7%. Pressure is well and good, but getting the quarterback to the ground and forcing them into bad decisions is what makes that number look better. The Cowboys have struggled to do the latter half of that equation, but could try some new things against Washington considering the quarterback situation they are in.\n\nMatt Eberflus has plenty of pressure on him in Week 17.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are intent on playing their starters on Christmas Day despite being eliminated from playoff contention, including quarterback Dak Prescott.\n\nThe Washington Commanders don’t really have a choice. Not only is starting QB Jayden Daniels done for the year, but now it won’t even be QB2 Marcus Mariota taking the field on Thursday.\n\nJosh Johnson to face Cowboys defense\n\nLong-time NFL journeyman Josh Johnson will start at quarterback for the Commanders, Washington head coach and former Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn announced on Wednesday.\n\nMariota is dealing with a hand injury and he entered the concussion protocol in the third quarter of the Commanders’ loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last weekend. Johnson recorded a 28.7 passer rating in his relief, completing five of nine pass attempts for 43 yards and an interception.\n\nJohnson is better known for having played for 14 NFL teams, the most in league history. The last time he recorded a start was in 2021 for the Baltimore Ravens, when he completed 70% of his passes for 304 yards, two touchdowns, and a pick in a 41-21 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nMatt Eberflus can’t afford a bad game\n\nTalk about a nothing to gain, everything to lose scenario for defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus.\n\nThe front office’s comments have already made it clear that Eberflus is on the hot seat. Prior to Week 16, Jones said the team’s final three-game stretch would be big criterion when deciding on the defensive coordinator’s fate. So far, it’s not going great after J.J. McCarthy put on a career performance against Dallas last weekend.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: I don’t see how a good game against Johnson would raise his stock. The guy is about to start his tenth career game since first arriving in the league in 2009. But a bad outing? It could drive Eberflus’ stock into the ground.\n\nCowboys owner and GM Jerry Jones recently pointed out how struggling quarterbacks have consistently outperformed expectations when facing the defense. It can’t happen on Thursday, right?",

    "fullText": "Northwestern assistant head coach Harlon Barnett has a long list of nicknames ready to use whenever he addresses or talks about safety Robert Fitzgerald.\n\nThe Terminator. The World’s Greatest Tackler. The Face of the Big Ten. The Eraser. The General. The Example. Mr. Consistent.\n\n“He’s going to start forgetting his own name,” Barnett said.\n\nFitzgerald has given Barnett a lot of reason to talk about him in a breakout season that continues at noon Friday in Northwestern’s game against Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on ESPN.\n\nThe redshirt junior goes into the game at Detroit’s Ford Field as the Big Ten leader with 68 solo tackles for a Wildcats defense that fueled their 6-6 regular season. He ranked fourth in the conference with 109 tackles and also had 6½ tackles for a loss, three passes defended, an interception and a fumble recovery.\n\n“He’s maximizing his gifts, talents and abilities that the Lord has given him,” Barnett said. “And he takes no days off.”\n\nFitzgerald’s season, for which he was named second-team All-Big Ten by coaches, comes after three years of working his way into bigger roles with Northwestern. He began with the Wildcats scout team and then played primarily on special teams in his first two seasons before earning more time on defense last year.\n\nThroughout the climb, he focused on the process, determined that when the Wildcats needed him, he would be prepared.\n\n“You’ve got to put the work in, day in, day out, no matter how long it takes,” Fitzgerald said. “But eventually your opportunity is going to come. And when that opportunity came, I knew that I was going to be ready based on all the work that I’ve been putting in for the past three years, on and off the field, in the weight room, in the training room, getting my body right, learning the playbook, studying film.”\n\nFitzgerald’s approach — and his understanding of the value of each day — was developed in part before his time at Northwestern. During his senior year of high school in Dallas, he watched his father, Matthew, fight ALS, and his memories of his dad have shaped how he lives now.\n\nThe Fitzgerald family would have Italian beef and Lou Malnati’s shipped to Dallas for Chicago Bears-Green Bay Packers games. Fitzgerald and his sister, Olivia, were Packers fans because of their mom, Amy, who is from Wisconsin. Matt, who grew up in the Wildwood/Edgebrook area of Chicago, cheered for the Bears.\n\n“He always said that my mom brainwashed me and my sister to be Packers fans,” Fitzgerald said.\n\nFitzgerald said his father was passionate about the work he did as a marketing executive. Midway through his career, he met Mark Cuban at the gym, became friends with him and became the Mavericks senior vice president for marketing and communications, a job that allowed Fitzgerald to be a Mavs ball boy and meet Dirk Nowitzki as a kid.\n\nMatt could light up a room and was passionate about his family and friends, a trait Fitzgerald carries with him to his relationships.\n\nAnd the former Loyola Academy safety loved football, a passion he passed on to his son. Fitzgerald remembers spending countless hours on the couch watching NFL Sunday Ticket with his dad. They would play in the backyard, reenacting Super Bowl-winning drives, making sideline grabs or playing goal-line tackle, the latter game one his mother didn’t love.\n\nFitzgerald said his dad was the biggest influence on his football career, giving him everything he needed to be successful. And he kept cheering on his son even after he was diagnosed with ALS the summer before Fitzgerald’s senior year at Jesuit College Prep. Fitzgerald, an All-State safety and running back that season, would look up into the stands to see his dad.\n\n“I’d be like, ‘Whatever I’m going through — I’m tired out here; I’m exhausted — whatever I’m going through is minuscule compared to what he’s going through,’” Fitzgerald said. “So that kind of drove me in high school my senior year, and I’ve kind of been able to use that as fuel going forward.”\n\nFitzgerald, who is no relation to former Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald, chose Northwestern in part because of his father’s connection to the Chicago area. His grandmother still lived at the time in the same home Matt grew up in. Fitzgerald’s aunt lives in Naperville. His dad’s friends are around and come to games.\n\nIllinois and Northwestern are headed to bowl games: Here’s what to know\n\nBut Matt didn’t get to see him play for the Wildcats. Matt died on July 22, 2022, just as Fitzgerald was beginning fall camp with Northwestern.\n\n“The whole thing changed my perspective on life for sure,” Fitzgerald said. “I don’t take a single day for granted anymore. Just watching the way he handled it and the way he attacked it just really was amazing to see. And it was amazing to see how strong my mom was throughout the entire disease. And it was also amazing how many people showed up for my family. The community really showed up for us.”\n\nWhen Fitzgerald thinks about how he got through that time in his life — getting acclimated at a new school in the midst of losing his father — he said his family helped, especially his mom, who was “the rock throughout the whole thing.”\n\nAnd his Northwestern teammates and coaches helped too. It wasn’t just letting him know they were sorry or there for him. Sometimes it was just acting normally, because he needed that too.\n\n“My teammates just really rallied around me, and they kind of became like 110 brothers that I never had,” he said.\n\nFitzgerald’s freshman season wasn’t easy on the field either as he realized he would be playing behind guys with several years of experience.\n\nHe played scout team for a 1-11 squad before getting a few reps on special teams at the end of the year, which became a redshirt season. But he believed that if he kept working, he could increase his opportunities.\n\nIn his second season, he started on three special teams units and played in a third-down subpackage. By his third year, he made the defensive rotation and started some at nickel for the Wildcats.\n\nBarnett, who joined Braun’s staff before the 2024 season, saw a player who was intentional and diligent with his work. He told Fitzgerald at the end of that season that he probably should have played more at safety, and he saw that message take hold to build Fitzgerald’s confidence in the offseason.\n\n“I saw toughness,” Barnett said. “I saw a willingness to get better. I saw a guy that takes coaching. He’s one of those guys who’s going to do exactly what you tell him. He’s going to take it to heart, he’s going to listen to you and he’s going to apply it. And that’s what you like to see as a coach.”\n\nBarnett, who played defensive back at Michigan State and in the NFL, always tells his players that they need to believe that they are the best player on the field.\n\nRecapping an eventful 2025 for Chicago sports on — and off — the field\n\nFitzgerald said he knew he was meant to be in the starting-safety role after the opener against Tulane, when he had 13 tackles. But his confidence was really in place by the fourth game of the season against UCLA, a 17-14 Northwestern win in which Fitzgerald had nine tackles, including a tackle for a loss. He wouldn’t freak out if he missed a tackle. He told himself he was the best player on the field.\n\n“Then he started playing like that — ‘I’m the baddest dude out here. I’m the baddest guy on the field,’” Barnett said.\n\nFitzgerald had numerous big plays in Northwestern’s near-upset of Michigan at Wrigley Field on Nov. 15. He had a career-high 15 tackles, including a tackle for a loss, and picked off quarterback Bryce Underwood in the fourth quarter, but Barnett got excited about a hit on a Wolverines running back late in the fourth.\n\n“He came in and smacked one of the running backs,” Barnett said. “I am vicariously playing through the players. And so, oh, man, I was so fired up. … And I don’t like Michigan, so that also adds to it.”\n\nRecapping an eventful 2025 for Chicago sports on — and off — the field\n\nChicago basketball report: WNBA players authorize a strike — and ‘Ain’t no Christmas’ for Notre Dame men\n\nKeaton Wagler powers No. 20 Illinois past Missouri 91-48 for the biggest blowout in Braggin’ Rights rivalry\n\nNotre Dame — with 96-game rivalry series vs. USC now on pause — announces home-and-home with BYU\n\nHannah Hildago posts triple-double in No. 20 Notre Dame women’s 110-38 win over Bellarmine\n\nFitzgerald will have one more chance this season to show up Friday against Central Michigan. He said the Wildcats want to finish with a winning record, send their seniors out on a high note and build some momentum heading into next season.\n\nBarnett said in the offseason Fitzgerald will continue to work on his speed and change of direction, on honing his already solid ball skills and tackling and improving his “vision and break” to where the quarterback is sending the ball.\n\nHe expects him to continue to develop his leadership too. Fitzgerald delivered a speech to the team before the Tulane game to rally his teammates and said he is working on being a more vocal leader, which comes naturally after he feels like he has earned it.\n\nThat merit has come this season. Earlier this year, Northwestern coach David Braun said Fitzgerald should be proud of the demeanor and the consistency with which he has played, adding “there’s no one in this program that reflects our values more than that young man.”\n\nFitzgerald has thought about how his dad would view this breakout season, and he knows he would revel in it.\n\n“He would eat this season up,” Fitzgerald said. “He would love to see me. I know he’s watching, but he would love to be in those stands and see me out there, just like I was playing in high school.”",

    "description": "It’s the premiere teenager tournament, this time located in Minnesota!",
    "fullText": "What is it?: Teenager hockey at the highest level being played in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada!\n\nWhen is it?: The games start December 26th, and the medal round begins just after New Year’s Day on the 2nd.\n\nWhere can I watch it?: TSN in Canada, NHLN in the states, apparently TUBI will also have it if you stream your hockey.\n\nWho’s the defending champs?: The United States, who is going for a threepeat this year!\n\nWhy should I care?: Why, you get to see the NHL stars of tomorrow face off for World Juniors glory! Gavin McKenna gets to wow you before he even gets the chance to play for an NHL team! Also it’s pretty inoffensive hockey that people get super wound up over while you’re puttering around the house during the holidays, so there aught to be some good yucks at certain fanbases (read: Canada’s) expense. Also, the relegation round is always a fun treat for those who want to see imperfect, desperate hockey, a personal favorite of mine.\n\nTeam USA: James Hagens, Will Zellers\n\nOne must imagine Sweden happy, because once again they should be set up to be a powerhouse…and it might shock you to learn that nobody is concerned because they have to get past the US and then will have to beat Canada or Finland in order to get the Gold Medal they so desperately crave. There’s just no winning for them unless they win it all, and that will be tough. In the round robin they usually do pretty well, and their roster this year is once again damn good; Sascha Boumedienne, Loke Krantz, Ivar Stenburg, Anton Frondell, with decent netminders in Goos and Härenstam suggests they will be just as good as they usually are. Problem is, we know that. We know they will likely cruise to another Group top or close to it. Then they have to play in the elimination round. Tre Kronor’s biggest issue remains that elimination round play, and who knows if this version of Sweden can survive it. I’m pretty sure they can…they just have to, you know…do it.\n\nSlovakia remains interested in proving they are A) Not Mad about Juraj Slafkovsky’s comments that suggest the federation is indolent, and B) You can ignore their considerable interest in buddying up to the Russian Federation because they’re A-Okay, baby. Slovakia unfortunately does have some issues facing them coming into the tourney: their 2023 class has aged out entirely, and a vast majority of their team is so, so young. In some cases that may benefit them, as there’s less tape on these kids and the ones who they do have tape on are pretty good. For most however…well, they don’t have the same caliber of player they used to in a division where Sweden and the US are, and they usually had a good chance to beat the US up ‘till now. They’re going to have to hope Michal Pradel can hold the fort long enough for guys like Michal Capos, Jan Chovan, and Michal Svrcek can get these youngsters moving like they can. I don’t think they’re necessarily worse than the rest of their division, but I certainly wouldn’t put them any higher than 3rd unless Pradel starts doing 3rd eye goaltending.\n\nHere’s the thing: by all accounts, Germany should be in trouble. Their defense is kind of awkward and not especially noteworthy, and they’re banking on a WHL goalie to be their rock in net. That is a rock I think they could trust in spurts here or there, but maybe not all the way. Why I think they escape relegation this year is that Die Eismannschaft is more offensively gifted than Switzerland; especially up front. Max Penkin, Max Schafer, and David Lewandowski have all found great success this year in Canadian Junior/DEL play, and zee Germans might have something in brothers Timo and Fabio Kose, who play different positions but have shown great flashes of talent against grown-ass men in the DEL. Against players their own age? They may yet shine. Veillard, while I don’t necessarily trust an .890 SV% goalie, is a vet for this squad, and I imagine they will rally around him.\n\nIt breaks my heart to suggest Switzerland may end up on the relegation block this year, I have loved their fundamentals only, no funny business kind of hockey for years, but ultimately the level of talent at the WJC is improving, and so far the Swiss have failed to meet the moment. It stinks especially because they do have interesting talent! They have\n\nAfter Canada publicly embarrassed themselves last year and the year before, The True North appear to have taken a much more humble approach to the World Juniors of casually bringing everyone who is good and available to the World Juniors. Even better, the omissions this year were largely because the Pacific teams that they were signed to still want them to be on the roster, and thus can’t justify assigning them. Even better than that, Group B is about as easy a division as you could ask for if Canada really is as built up as they say they are…which is what I would say, had Gavin McKenna not made it clear that he’s prone to error as much as anyone else, and Sweden doesn’t even have to play Canada until a hypothetical medal round. In general, a lot rides on Canada right now. They’ve been slipping badly over the past few tourneys and have turned “underdog gets first win over Canada” into an almost yearly spectacle. Regardless of how you feel about their place in the sport, Canada in the tourneys that count does not have the luxury of expecting to be good anymore. In short, they need to run away with this one and quickly, or we are once again going to start a dialogue about the decision-making corps for the Red and White (and sometimes black).\n\nFinland’s effort in the early parts of this tournament have always been a bit slow; especially with their proclivity for penalties, so don’t be surprised if they look like they’re in trouble to start out. What they are however, is in a very weird place. They’re without Konsta Helenius; their current premiere prospect of World Juniors age, and as such are going to need to adjust to life without him. They’re not screwed by a long shot, but now they need to focus down on other talents to help them out. In net, as per usual, they will have a murderer’s row of good goalies to choose from; Kim Saarinen and Petteri Rimpinen will once again be their rock in net, allowing talents like Julius Miettinen, Emil Hemming, Matias Vanhanen, and Max Westergard to do what they usually do best; cause a ruckus on the boards, rip off a solid pass, and score goals. Losing Helenius however means they lose a level of dynamism that would have otherwise given them an edge against the Group leader once we get to that point on the calendar. Still, the Finns always find a way to drag teams down to their level, so while Canada might get the edge on them to start, they always find a way to crawl back in and make you regret it. Also, Rimpinen has the coolest pads in this tournament. Bar none.\n\nCzechia has traditionally been an offense or bust kind of team; one that’s free-wheeling and fun if a little chaotic. That chaos allowed them to be Bronze Medalists at last year’s tourney. Is that gonna change? Maybe! Granted, they still have plenty of impressive and fun forwards they can call on to make their brand of frantic and fun hockey work, but now they’ll have an extra hand from the backend; they’ve decided to bring Radim Mrtka, Jakub Fibigr, Vashek Blanar, and Adam Jiricek to the dance, and from the skaters alone it seems like Czechia plans to survive this tourney through blistering offense.\n\nLatvia has the benefit of their upset win over Canada to allow them to survive through this tournament. That’s probably what’s going to get them through this tournament entirely because otherwise Latvia has lost a lot of the talent that made them so special last year. They will have to rely on the work of players who’ve spent a lot of time abroad: Roberts Naudins has been tearing it up for Shattuck St. Marys Prep, Daniels Serkins has been doing great for SC Bern in Switzerland, and of course; the Latvians have their wunderkind; Alberts Smits, who is projected to be a first round pick this year. They do have a team attitude and game plan that usually makes them a lot tougher to play than you might expect, but they also tend to need their goalies to be lights out. Of the three they brought; Nils Roberts Maurins would likely have to play way above his paygrade to keep them in games. Otherwise, their tournament will be as per usual; passionate fans, painful results.\n\nThere are going to be players on Denmark with more middle names than goals this year. Have fun playing Switzerland in the knockout round!\n\nIt looks like this! The games begin on December 26th, and the Elimination round begins on January 2nd.",

    "description": "Mile High Report’s Christopher Hart gives his picks for Week 17 of the 2025 NFL regular season.",
    "fullText": "Week 17 of the NFL regular season is upon us. Only two more weeks of regular season picks are left. My Week 16 picks were not optimal. I picked just 9 of 16 games correctly. Through fifteen weeks I’m now sitting at 160-80 with predictions. Let’s see if I can do better than I did last week.\n\nChristmas Day (Early Game) —Dallas Cowboys at Washington Commanders\n\nHad events played out differently in the regular season, this game could have been garnered huge playoff implications. Unfortunately, these NFC East rivals are both eliminated from playoff contention. I think the Cowboys end up winning this one on the road.\n\nChristmas Day (Afternoon Game) — Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe only way the Lions can make the playoffs is by winning out and the Packers losing their final two games. It’s a longshot, but stranger things have happened. Not that he has been great, but J.J. McCarthy won’t be playing in this one. That being said, I think Detroit will win this one easily.\n\nChristmas Day (Night Game) — Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Broncos lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars last Sunday. Denver still controls their own destiny and can earn the AFC’s top seed if they beat the Chiefs and Chargers the next two weeks. They’ve got a lot of mistakes to clean up, but I have a feeling they will deliver Broncos Country a present on Christmas night and beat Kansas City.\n\nSaturday Football (Afternoon Game) — Houston Texans at Los Angeles Chargers\n\nBoth the Texans and Chargers are poised to make the postseason. The only question is will it be as a wildcard team or division champion. The stakes are huge for both of them. Houston’s defense has been the strength of their team and Justin Herbert has impressed despite numerous key losses to their offensive line. All things considered, I think DeMeco Ryans has his team ready to win this one.\n\nDeMeco Ryans on the game vs the Chargers:\n\n“No doubt about it. It’s defintley a playoff game. It was a playoff game for us last week. That’s where you want to be in December, playing meaningful games & that’s what this team has earned.” pic.twitter.com/sRbAg9pofV\n\n— Houston Stressans (@TexansCommenter) December 23, 2025\n\nSaturday Football (Evening Game) — Baltimore Ravens at Green Bay Packers\n\nThe Ravens aren’t out of the playoffs yet, but their chances of making the postseason are slim. Currently, the Packers are the NFC’s seventh seed and can punch their playoff ticket with a win. With a back contusion suffered in Week 16, there is a good chance Lamar Jackson doesn’t play. If so, that should make the Packers heavy favorites in this one. I’m taking Green Bay at home.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Arizona Cardinals at Cincinnati Bengals\n\nThis Sunday game is an uninteresting matchup with two teams out of playoff contention. After laying a goose egg a few weeks ago, the Bengals kicked things into high gear last weekend and scored a lot of points. I think they will do the same on Sunday, as the Cardinals are in a tailspin having lost seven games in a row. I’m picking Cincinnati.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Pittsburgh Steelers at Cleveland Browns\n\nThe formula is simple for the Steelers to make the postseason. A win over the Browns guarantees them the AFC North title and the opportunity to host a Wild Card round playoff game. Could the Browns play spoiler? Sure, but don’t count on that. I’m confident that Pittsburgh takes care of business here.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — New Orleans Saints at Tennessee Titans\n\nThe Saints have won three in a row and are now 5-10 on the season. Meanwhile, the Titans are a 3-12 team coming off a victory against the Chiefs in Week 16. There isn’t anything compelling about this matchup to really write about. That being said, I’ll take New Orleans on the road.\n\nTHREE IN A ROW DUBS#Saints | @Gatorade pic.twitter.com/br2Fm49xjA\n\n— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) December 21, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis Colts\n\nThe Jaguars earned a playoff berth defeating the Broncos last weekend. They have a path to the AFC’s top seed, though it will take some help. In order for that to happen, beating the Colts who have dropped five games in a row is a must. Based on what I saw against Denver last Sunday, I like their chances against Indianapolis.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Miami Dolphins\n\nThe Buccaneers started off the season hot but have dropped three games in a row. They have to win this game, and the Panthers need to lose against the Seahawks in order to keep their postseason hopes alive. I’m expecting both of those things to happen, with the Week 18 Buccaneers/Panthers matchup deciding who wins the NFC South.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — New England Patriots at New York Jets\n\nThe Patriots have a path to the top seed in the AFC. In order for that potentiality to become reality, finding a way to beat the Jets on the road needs to take place. I have no concerns about their ability to do so. I don’t think this game will be close at all. I’ve got New England winning on the road in a landslide.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Seattle Seahawks at Carolina Panthers\n\nThe Seahawks defied the odds and rallied late to defeat the Rams in Week 16, whilst the Panthers were able to defeat Tampa Bay. Both these teams want this game. Seattle winning would pretty much assure them the top seed in the NFC. A Panthers win would give them a shot at the NFC South title if the Buccaneers wind up losing. A lot is at stake in this one, but I think Seattle gets a huge road win.\n\nThe Rams would be eliminated from both the #1 seed and NFC West title race if the Seahawks beat the Panthers and the 49ers beat the Bears in Week 17. pic.twitter.com/5H1p6Zi0Ba\n\n— Brian Nemhauser (@hawkblogger) December 23, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — New York Giants at Las Vegas Raiders\n\nSporting 2-13 records, the Giants and Raiders are the worst teams in their respective conferences. The loser of this game will have the upper hand relative to earning the #1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. But maybe something crazy happens and it ends in a tie. Who knows? I don’t really care. I’ll just pick the Giants for the heck of it.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills\n\nBoth the Eagles and Bills have clinched playoff berths. Philadelphia won the NFC East and will get to host a playoff game. The Bills aren’t out of the AFC East race yet but need some help for that to happen. I ultimately expect the Patriots to take that division. Even so, I think the Bills beat the Eagles. It should be a fun matchup either way.\n\nSunday Night Football — Chicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers\n\nBoasting 11-4 records, the Bears and 49ers are also in the postseason. Each team has a slim path to the top seed in the NFC. What both of them have accomplished this year is impressive. I certainly didn’t have either of them securing 11 wins this season. This might be the most fun matchup of Week 17 and should be a great primetime game for all football fans to enjoy. I’m taking the 49ers in this one.\n\nMonday Night Football — Los Angeles Rams at Atlanta Falcons\n\nThe Rams definitely need to find a way to win this game after being stunned by the Seahawks in Week 16. Dropping that game plummeted their chances of being the NFC’s top seed. I’ve got Los Angeles winning this one. And guess what? A victory will make the first-round pick they get from Atlanta better in the ‘26 NFL Draft.",

    "description": "Find out which of MotoGP’s 22 circuits are secured by long-term contracts and which face an uncertain future...",
    "fullText": "MotoGP’s calendar has expanded rapidly over the years, peaking at 22 grands prix in 2025. With the addition of sprints, riders are now required to contest a total of 44 races a year.\n\nIn many respects, MotoGP has followed Formula 1’s lead in recent years, not only in expanding its calendar but also in its approach to circuit agreements. Like F1, MotoGP is now increasingly signing long-term deals with promoters, providing greater stability to the championship.\n\nAs a result, many circuits - primarily those located in Europe - are already confirmed well into the next decade. At the other end of the spectrum, however, several venues currently have just one remaining race in 2026 before their contracts expire.\n\nBelow is an overview of MotoGP’s current circuit agreements and the known duration of each contract as of December 2025.\n\nDespite serious doubts surrounding the future of the Thailand Grand Prix, the government successfully finalised a new contract with Dorna in November 2025. The five-year extension, added to the existing agreement that runs through 2026, ensures that MotoGP will continue racing at Buriram until 2031.\n\nThailand has become an important market for the championship since it debuted on the calendar in 2018.\n\nMotoGP will return to Brazil in 2026 at the heavily-renovated Autodromo Internacional Ayrton Senna in Goiania. The deal was signed at the end of 2024 with Brazil Motorsport, the same company that organises the Formula 1 race at Sao Paulo, and covers five seasons through to 2030.\n\nBrazil last hosted a MotoGP event under the Rio Grand Prix moniker in 2004.\n\nMotoGP is set to race in the US until at least 2027 according to an agreement signed between Circuit of the Americas and the City of Austin. The Texan venue joined the MotoGP calendar in 2013, just under a year after it was constructed, as part of a 10-year agreement. That deal was reinforced in 2018 and is understood to run through the 2027 season. Since then, only the 2020 event had to be cancelled due to the pandemic. MotoGP itself has not issued formal confirmation of the contract’s duration.\n\nMotoGP has a long-standing agreement with Lusail Circuit that was signed back in 2019, keeping the Qatar Grand Prix on the calendar until 2031. The track was built primarily for motorcycle racing and has been a staple on the MotoGP schedule since 2004. For much of its tenure, it held the slot for the season opener.\n\nJerez will remain on the MotoGP calendar into the next decade. The Spanish venue has been an ever-present fixture on the calendar since 1987, and even hosted two races in 2020 during COVID-19. The latest contract that was agreed ahead of the 2025 event in April runs through the end of 2031.\n\nMotoGP also agreed a new deal with the organisers of the French Grand Prix in 2025. And as is the case with some other races, this is also a long-term contract extension covering the next six events until 2031. Le Mans has proven hugely popular with fans, with the 2025 race recording the largest attendance in the championship’s history.\n\nLike several other European tracks, the Catalan GP has a safe future in MotoGP. A new agreement between Barcelona and Dorna was signed in February 2025, and will conclude in 2031. Barcelona has already held 35 grands prix since it debuted on the calendar in 1992. By the end of the new contract, that number would go up to 41.\n\nMugello will enter the final year of its current contract in 2026. The organisers had previously agreed a two-year extension with Dorna in 2023, covering the ‘25 and ‘26 races. The Ferrari-owned track has been the annual host of the Italian Grand Prix since 1994, having first staged a 500cc race in 1992. With the 2026 race approaching, discussions over a new contract are likely to follow.\n\nMotoGP did not disclose the length of its contract with Balaton Park when it announced that Hungary will join the calendar from 2025. What’s clear is that, following its debut race this year, it will remain on the MotoGP map in 2026. Organisers were required to complete several upgrades to bring the venue up to top-level motorcycle racing standards. Balaton Park is only the second track in Hungary to stage MotoGP after Hungaroring played host to two races in the early 1990s.\n\nAfter a four-year absence, the Czech Grand Prix made a successful return in 2025 at Brno. The agreement announced by the then-Czech Prime Minister covers five seasons until the end of 2029. Brno is one of the most iconic venues in the championship’s history, with its permanent layout first debuting on the premier class calendar in 1987. Earlier configurations of the circuit, incorporating public roads, had hosted grand prix racing for decades prior to that.\n\nThe historic Assen track will remain an integral part of MotoGP for years to come. An agreement with the Dutch GP organisers was struck in 2024, adding five years to the previous contract that ran until 2026. That means the TT Circuit, built back in 1955, will remain on the calendar until at least 2031.\n\nAs part of MotoGP’s strategy to secure long-term contracts with promoters, the championship has also inked a new deal with Sachsenring until 2031. This agreement also runs for five years on top of MotoGP’s existing arrangement with the circuit until 2026. The new deal is also significant because 2027 marks the 100th anniversary of the inaugural race on the public roads in Hohenstein-Ernstthal, where the Sachsenring was later built.\n\nSilverstone’s contract with MotoGP is due to expire after 2026. It’s unclear when and if a new deal will be agreed. For now, the British Grand Prix has been moved back to a more traditional slot in August after the 2025 event was held in May and on the same weekend as the Monaco Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500. Outside of the pandemic, Silverstone has been the host of the British GP every year since 2010, when it took over from Donington Park.\n\nAragon’s contract with MotoGP is also up for renewal after 2026. The Spanish track previously signed a new contract with Dorna in 2022 that stipulated three grands prix over a five-year period. However, the agreement was restructured in 2024, guaranteeing Motorland an annual place on the calendar until the end of 2026. Aragon first held a grand prix in 2010 and has since become a regular fixture on the calendar, with 2023 the only year the race didn’t take place.\n\nMisano is another track that agreed a fresh deal with MotoGP in 2025. Already confirmed till 2026, the new contract ensures the race that runs under the San Marino GP banner will remain a part of the calendar until 2031. Several tracks in Italy have hosted the San Marino GP over the decades, but it has been held annually in Misano since the circuit’s comeback in 2007.\n\nAustrian GP’s future on the MotoGP map is also secure, with the last deal - signed in 2024 - running until the end of 2030. It was a five-year extension on top of the existing deal, which had been due to expire after 2025. Spielberg joined the MotoGP calendar in 2016, a year before Austrian manufacturer KTM entered the championship.\n\n2025 was a year of contract renewals for MotoGP and another track which the championship locked in for the long term is Motegi. As part of the deal, the Honda-owned track will remain on the calendar until 2030. Motegi first held a MotoGP event in 1999, but it was only in 2004 that it permanently replaced Suzuka as the venue for the Japanese GP.\n\nAlthough there is still some uncertainty, it is understood that Mandalika signed a 10-year agreement with MotoGP when it joined the calendar for the first time in 2022. This means the Indonesian GP will continue to run until at least 2031. While MotoGP has not officially confirmed the duration of the deal, organisers have consistently indicated that the agreement is long-term.\n\nThe 2026 Australian GP will be the last race under the current contract. Melbourne’s MotoGP future has been a subject of intense speculation for some time, amid uncertainty over whether a new deal could be completed. Phillip Island first hosted a grand prix in 1989, but only became a regular on the calendar in 1997. Its picturesque surroundings and unique layout have made it a popular venue for MotoGP.\n\nSepang’s contract is set to expire after 2026, but organisers remain confident that a new deal could be agreed over the winter break, describing it as their priority. One of the first modern circuits built in Southeast Asia, Sepang took over hosting duties for the Malaysian Grand Prix in 1999 and has remained a popular venue with both local and international fans ever since.\n\nAnother race whose contract expires in 2026 is Portugal. Portimao was at risk of dropping off the calendar after 2024, but a new two-year deal was agreed that saw the event being repositioned near the end of the season, forming a double-header with the Valencia finale. With the Portuguese government signing a fresh contract with F1 in December 2025, it remains to be seen whether it will also reach terms with MotoGP.\n\nValencia struck a five-year contract extension at the start of 2025, just months after its 2024 event had to be cancelled due to severe flooding in the region. With the new deal, Circuit Ricardo Tormo will stay on the calendar until at least 2031. Valencia first joined the MotoGP calendar in 1999 and has hosted the season finale every year since 2002, with just one exception.\n\nMotoGP has also announced that it will return to Argentina in 2027 at a renovated Autodromo Oscar y Juan Galvez. The track, located in the capital Buenos Aires, last hosted a MotoGP race in 1999. Although the exact duration of the deal hasn’t been disclosed, the track effectively replaces Termas de Rio Hondo, which dropped off the calendar after 2025.\n\nPedro Acosta: “Forgetting about the championship” transformed my MotoGP form\n\nRain spoils debut of Honda’s 850cc engine in Sepang test\n\nCarlos Ezpeleta: “We don’t have enough space” for every circuit asking to host MotoGP\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys will travel to Maryland to face the Washington Commanders on Christmas Day.\n\nBoth these NFC East teams are eliminated from postseason contention. However, they'll be the opening act for the NFL on Christmas.\n\nThe Cowboys' season was a tale of two sides of the ball. The Dallas offense was one of the more exciting units in the entire league. With Dak Prescott playing at an elite level, throwing the ball to both CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, it was thrilling to watch the Cowboys' offensive attack.\n\nHowever, their defense was one of the worst in the NFL. It got so bad that Jerry Jones brought in some defensive assets to help the struggling unit. While it seemed to improve the defense's overall state, it was not enough to save their season.\n\nAs for the Commanders, it was an unlucky season to say the least. Every week it felt like another key player on their team was injured. Whether it was Jayden Daniels, Terry McLaurin, Austin Ekeler and the list goes on.\n\nWhile neither team has anything to gain, there's always a level of effort for divisional games.\n\nHere's how to listen to Commanders vs. Cowboys on Christmas.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channel 225 (away), 226 (home)\n\nCommanders radio channels: BIG 100 (WBIG-FM 100.3 FM)\n\nCowboys radio channel: 105.3 The Fan (KRLD-FM)\n\nThe Commanders vs. Cowboys game can be listened to on SiriusXM on channels 225 (Cowboys), and 226 (Commanders)\n\nLocally, fans in the Washington area can tune into BIG 100 (WBIG-FM 100.3 FM). In Dallas, fans can listen on 105.3 The Fan (KRLD-FM).\n\nIf you are a new subscriber to SiriusXM, you can get your first month for free. Listen to every NFL game live, plus other sports like college football, MLB, NBA, NHL, NASCAR and more.

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Penguins will have two players participating in this year’s World Junior Championships, the U-20 tournament that takes place starting tomorrow, Friday December 26th and lasting through Monday January 5th over in Minnesota. What the Pens lack in quantity will be made up for in quantity with Canada’s Harrison Brunicke and the US’s Will Horcoff both expected to fill key roles for the two powerhouse teams.\n\nHorcoff finished the tune-up games on the first line for the Americans, playing left wing for high draft pick James Hagens. Center depth has been a question mark and potential question mark for the US, it shows where Horcoff is that he’s being used for the national team on the wing, just as where he normally plays for the University of Michigan these days.\n\nSteven Ellis from the Daily Faceoff listed Horcoff among his handful of top performers in that tune-up game against Finland:\n\n#24 Will Horcoff, LW (Pittsburgh Penguins): After scoring twice against Germany, Horcoff looked great again today with a good first-period goal. He does an excellent job of rushing to the net and using his big frame to bully opponents. He also has quick hands, something that very few players his size manage to replicate. Horcoff likely has played his way onto the top line with James Hagens and Brodie Ziemer for good.\n\nThe good news there is that description is perfectly in-line with what Horcoff has been doing all fall so far at Michigan, where he’s emerged as a goal-scoring machine and one of the top prospects in NCAA hockey this season. Horcoff could be on the verge of an even bigger coming out party on the international stage if he can prove himself against the best players in his 18-19 year old age bracket.\n\nThe US plays Germany on Friday at 6:00pm eastern (NHL Network) as they look to repeat on last year’s championship and add a fourth ‘chip within the last six years. The US follows that up with round robin games against Switzerland (Dec 27th), Slovakia (Dec 29th) and Sweden (Dec 31st) before the single-elimination quarterfinals start on January 2nd.\n\nHarrison Brunicke and the Canadians are over in the other group, they will play the Czechs on the 26th to open things up, followed by Latvia on the 27th, Denmark on the 29th and Finland on New Year’s Eve.\n\nEllis did a nice writeup on the experienced Brunicke heading into this tournament as well:\n\nIn total, Brunicke has played 26 pro games between the NHL and AHL over two years. For a player his age, that’s a lot of quality competition and increased speed he has had to deal with.\n\n“Coaches love that at this level,” one scout said. “They know they can count on the guys who’ve played against the best of the best. They’re coachable.”\n\nBrunicke has played a lot of meaningful hockey early in his career. He played in the Memorial Cup in 2023 prior to his draft year and then helped Canada win gold at the U-18 World Championship the following spring. Brunicke even skated in a pair of games with the senior national team ahead of the 2025 World Championship – showing a high level of trust from the Hockey Canada brass. That, plus his NHL experience, has allowed Brunicke to handle every challenge thrown his way so far.\n\n“When you’re in more high-pressure situations, you get more comfortable with it,” Brunicke said. “I’m hoping to bring that here.”\n\nMany believe Brunicke will be loaned back to Kamloops for the team’s WHL playoff push after the tournament. Others think the 6-foot-3 defender would benefit more from playing against men in the NHL. Regardless, he needs playing time – and he’s set to get a lot of it for Canada.\n\n“I’m still trying to build that pro style of game, where it’s strictly hard defense, where you’re moving the puck and moving your feet, less risks,” Brunicke said. “That’s what I’m trying to bring here.”\n\nParekh is projected to be Canada’s No. 1 right-handed defender. That’ll leave Brunicke on the second pair, where he’ll still be able to eat heavy minutes as he did in Kamloops. Canada has a strong contender this year, and Brunicke is expected to be a leader, especially with his NHL experience.\n\nBrunicke has played just five games over the past month, all coming in the AHL. The native of Johannesburg, South Africa had four points in that span, showing a high level of puck proficiency. On the surface, going from playing against men and adjusting to junior hockey sounds easy. But there’s a real adjustment, especially from a tempo perspective.\n\nBrunicke is ready for the challenge.\n\n“Whatever position I’m put in, whatever role, I’m ready to execute it,” Brunicke said. “I’m a two-way defenseman, playing hard defensively and getting to show my offense as well. I want to be a reliable defenseman who can eat minutes.”\n\nAfter a fall mostly spent watching or practicing, Brunicke should certainly get all the chances he can handle in this venue where he is one of the most experienced players. Team Canada looks stacked with talent, they’ll need a veteran like Brunicke to help guide them along.\n\nThe fun for the Pens will be what looks like the annual, inevitable collision between the US and the Canadians, which will just so happen to feature Pittsburgh having one of the top American forwards and Canadian defenders. That won’t happen until early in the new year with the group format, but one that would be very closely monitored in Western PA.",

    "fullText": "With the 2025 Christmas break underway, the New York Islanders hold onto the third spot in the Metropolitan Division. In 37 games, their record is 20-13-4, good for 44 points. The 2-1 win against the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday leapfrogged the Islanders over the Washington Capitals, who sit at 43 points after their 7-3 loss to the New York Rangers. Islanders’ General Manager Mathieu Darche has his fingers all over the organization’s rise.\n\nIt’s a big improvement from where the Islanders were a year ago. On December 25, 2024, the Islanders sat five points out of the final wildcard spot. Sporting a 13-15-7 record through 35 games, the Islanders had just 33 points and were 13th in the Eastern Conference. With hindsight, it’s known the Islanders won the lottery and drafted phenom defenseman Matthew Schaefer with the number one overall pick. But at the time, plenty of uneasiness was in the air.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, fans were understandably anxious about the team’s future. The Islanders just finished the season with a 35-35-12 record, good for 82 points and 13th in the East. Five days prior, the Islanders were officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since the 2021-22 season. The Philadelphia Flyers handed the Islanders the final blow. Even if the official elimination was a foregone conclusion by that point, the feeling of the season officially ending after 82 games hurt.\n\nThe Islanders’ future looked bleak. Fans soured on longtime GM Lou Lamoriello, and the Islanders organization seemed to agree. Following seven seasons with the club, Lamoriello’s contract wasn’t renewed, and he was let go on April 22nd. The team was slow. The prospect cupboard wasn’t in the upper echelon of the league. There was a feeling that a new set of eyes was needed to steer the Islanders in the right direction.\n\nThirteen days later, on May 5, they won the number pick in the upcoming draft lottery. 18 days after that, on May 23rd, Mathieu Darche was chosen to be the franchise’s seventh general manager.\n\nDarche didn’t wait long to get started. At the 2025 NHL Entry Draft, Darche traded star defenseman Noah Dobson to the Montreal Canadiens for picks 16 and 17 and Emil Heimeman. Darche used those picks on Viktor Eklund and Kashawn Aitcheson, respectively. Both players are highly touted, and the organization hopes they’ll be making an impact sooner rather than later. Heineman, meanwhile, has been a perfect fit on Long Island this season.\n\nIn free agency, Darche signed Jonathan Drouin and KHL phenom Max Shabanov. Both players have fit in well in Patrick Roy’s new speed-first system. Shabanov specifically has been leaned on by Roy at times to generate offense.\n\nDarche signing David Rittich was an under-the-radar move that has proven to be worth its weight in gold. Rittich was originally supposed to be a temporary backup solution while Semyon Varlamov heals from his injury. He’s been excellent on Long Island through three months of the season. According to HockeyStats.com, Rittich boasts a +11.2 goals saved above expected in thirteen appearances, 15th best in the NHL. Rittich is sporting an 8-3-2 record with a .913 save percentage. His play has taken some of the workload off Ilya Sorokin, who has himself been excellent for the Islanders in a return to form.\n\nMathieu Darche’s first few months as Islanders GM are going well. The team is much faster than it was a year ago. They’re up eleven points on last year’s team. The Islanders can’t rest on their laurels with how tight the Eastern Conference is, but morale is high. If the Islanders keep their playoff spot past game 82, Darche should be in contention for one of the final GM of the Year spots. It’ll be difficult to beat out names such as Chris MacFarland, whose Colorado Avalanche are tearing through the NHL with a 27-2-7 record, but Darche should be given his flowers.\n\nIn twelve months, the New York Islanders have turned on a dime. From a team in murky waters to a speedy and winning roster that is buying in. He’ll get lost in the shuffle, but Mathieu Darche deserves praise for what he’s done on Long Island in the early goings of his GM tenure.\n\nHabs Daily: Merry Christmas, Hutson Surprises Community\n\nGreen Bay Packers Could Have a Hard Time Keeping Upcoming Free Agent\n\nRumor Points to Huge BOS Celtics Addition For NBA Finals Run",

    "fullText": "This week, Chiefs Wire's Ed Easton Jr. spoke with retired All-Pro offensive lineman and CBS Sports analyst Kyle Long.\n\nIn his interview with Easton Jr., Long discussed his role as a remote analyst for NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix today.\n\n\"I will be on the desk with Scott Hanson in Los Angeles, and it'll go out to the rest of the world. Obviously, many people will be watching on Netflix. Every single time you see one of those guys run on the field with the orange gloves and say, TV timeout, or the players get a breather, they'll throw it back to the studio,\" said Long, \"Scott and I will be covering all the happenings from that drive, looking ahead, all the storylines you could think of. Obviously, as people watch, they will try to interact. We'll have multiple opportunities to engage in back-and-forth with people around the world. It's a dream come true for me; Christmas and football are always synonymous, just as Thanksgiving is. Nobody does it like Netflix.\"\n\nNFL CHRISTMAS GAMEDAY\nLIVE on Netflix December 25\n-- \nCowboys vs. Commanders @ 1 PM ET\nLions vs. Vikings @ 4:30 PM ET\n\n— Netflix (@netflix) December 4, 2025\n\nLong, a former Kansas City Chiefs player, discussed the Detroit Lions-Minnesota Vikings matchup, which carries postseason implications for Detroit in the NFC North.\n\n\"You've got to keep in mind this Lions team, they went from winless to the bullies to now, you know, middle of the pack, and I think it's almost poetic, because I feel like a Dan Campbell team is not supposed to be at the top of the heap,\" said Long, \"They're supposed to be scratching and clawing their way in. I believe this aligns with the 'MO' (Main Objective) in Detroit. We've got to earn it. We've got to scratch and claw.\"\n\nKansas City notably defeated Detroit earlier this season in Week 6 at Arrowhead Stadium, while the Vikings will play spoiler as hosts of the second game of the doubleheader.\n\n\"The Minnesota Vikings. I mean, I don't know if you're on social media, but there's been a lot of memes about the Minnesota Vikings, particularly their young quarterback, and what I've seen is that the defense has rallied around this guy. \"The protectors on the offensive side rally around this guy,\" said Long. \"You take a look around the NFC North, and the Bears and the Packers are the two teams most likely to make the playoffs. These two teams are fighting for respect, and they know that next year starts now, especially for a guy like J.J. McCarthy. We know how good their coach is. We know about their defense, but the one big question mark is that quarterback. So we're going to find out more about that on Christmas.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kyle Long explains his role on Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

    "fullText": "CAMDEN, N.J. -- After falling to the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday, the Sixers are sitting at 16-12 heading into a 5-game road trip starting on Friday in Chicago. This is only the second real road trip of the season for Philadelphia--there was a 3-game trip in early November--so this trip will be a challenge.\n\nThe Sixers will have to take on a scrappy Bulls team, then take on the defending champion Thunder on the road before taking on the Grizzlies, Mavericks, and Knicks to finish the trip.\n\nBeing on the road like this can be challenging, but it can also be beneficial for chemistry. The Sixers won't be able to go to their own homes or to their families. They will only have each other and that can be helpful for the players.\n\n\"I believe the road trip will be very beneficial for us to kind of just get us out of our home market and be with each other on the plane, on the team bus, at the hotel, and, like, actually get a chance to do a few things together too,\" said Andre Drummond. \"We have a couple of days in between games, too. So I know we'll set up some team activities and really continue that bonding experience that we're feeling right now.\"\n\nThe Sixers have been a much closer group than in the past and it is shown in the success on the floor despite players being in and out of the rotation. The Sixers will now look to keep things moving in the right direction when they take on the Bulls on Friday and avenge a loss to Chicago back on Nov. 4.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers explain how road trip can be beneficial to their growth",

Iowa held Bucknell to just 39 points off of only 37% shooting from the field, won the rebounding battle 36-16, and forced an astounding 25 turnovers (19 steals and six blocks), and five different players had multiple steals on the night.\n\nAccording to the latest NET rankings, Iowa has risen seven spots to No. 12, thanks in large part to the sensational defensive efforts shown on Saturday.

    "fullText": "It has been a tough old year for the Azzurri and an even more testing one lies in store. Giancarlo Rinaldi examines what could help the national team return to its former glory.\n\nYou certainly can’t fault him for effort. Every time you turn on the television to watch a Serie A game, it seems, you will get a close-up of him in the crowd. If nothing else, Rino Gattuso is hoovering up as much information as he can ahead of one of the most important years in the history of the famous blue colours of his country, which he donned with such distinction.\n\nItaly were put through the wringer in 2025 with two one-sided defeats by Norway, the unwanted highlights of a pretty grim 12 months. There was the rumbustious Nations League elimination by Germany as well, and a madcap match with Israel alongside some more routine victories. In the middle of it all, the Azzurri parted company with Luciano Spalletti and turned to the snappy, snarling former midfielder instead. The results were initially strong enough, but a reality check with Erling Haaland and company suggested that there is much work to be done if they hope to even get to the World Cup in 2026.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 16: Erling Haaland of Norway celebrates with teammates after scoring his team’s second goal during the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Italy and Norway at San Siro Stadium on November 16, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nFor La Nazionale to miss out on the extended party in Mexico, Canada and the USA would be a huge setback and one which would, undoubtedly, provoke more calls for an overhaul in the Italian Football Federation. If they want to get there they will have to first get past Northern Ireland at home and then face a trip to either Wales or Bosnia – neither of which, on current form, look as straightforward as they should be for a country which has, lest we forget, won the World Cup four times in the past.\n\nPart one of Gattuso’s Christmas wish list will undoubtedly be to keep all his key players fit for the vital matches on the horizon. The loss of a midfield stalwart like Sandro Tonali or Nicolò Barella would be a hammer blow ahead of such important fixtures. No wonder he always looks a little edgy whenever he is at a game – he is probably hoping nobody administers one of his own trademark tackles on one of the Azzurri’s more important contributors.\n\nSandro Tonali plays for Italy in Moldova during the 2026 World Cup qualifier (@azzurri)\n\nAnother thing to get sorted is his defence. There is something that has not functioned for a while with the Italian back line, which seems incredible to think of in a nation where the art form of stopping the opposition from scoring has been revered for generations. Despite having a crop of decent players, something is missing from the rearguard, which he will have to try to solve sooner rather than later. A gentle revolution is needed to allow that unit to evolve into one which strikes fear into the heart of any attacker brave enough to take it on. From that solid base, he could hope to build a team which would not only get to the World Cup but might also progress past the group stages.\n\nThe emergence of a few new faces to challenge his old guard would also be welcome. This squad has a solid enough core, but it is definitely in need of rejuvenation and seeing the likes of Francesco Pio Esposito get more game time with Inter would surely be a boost. Italy have done well enough at youth levels of late to suggest that the talent is there but it seems to stall due to lack of playing opportunities in Serie A. Boys who have gone to seek their fortune abroad might well have a part to play.\n\nUp front, all he wants for Christmas is for Moise Kean and Mateo Retegui to thrive. If there has been a positive from Gattuso’s arrival, it has been the commitment to play the two together which has brought goalscoring rewards. He will hope they both keep fit and that Fiorentina start to see a revival in their fortunes in order for their talisman to approach the big matches in March with a degree more confidence than he would right now.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 05: Mateo Retegui of Italy celebrates with teammates after scoring his team’s second goal during the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Italy and Estonia at Stadio di Bergamo on September 05, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Mattia Ozbot/Getty Images)\n\nAnd, finally, there is the Federico Chiesa conundrum. It is now more than four years since his breakout tournament at the delayed Euro 2020 and how Italy could do with that player in that form back in the fold. None of the current wide options offer the drive and attacking threat that he did in his prime, but it is a question of whether he will get many opportunities to show it with Liverpool and how much he feels he can give his country. The phone line between player and manager might well remain open, but the clock is definitely ticking on getting the situation sorted one way or another.\n\nThis, and much more, will be racing through Rino’s mind over the festive season, no doubt. He will be itching to get to the play-off games but, at the same time, hope that Serie A – and elsewhere – can throw him up a few solutions. Italy will not go into these games, which will define an era, with any great confidence, but they can use them as a building block to reconstruct their reputation as one of football’s superpowers. Is Gattuso the man to get them there? Two vital tests in springtime will give us an answer to that question one way or another.",

    "fullText": "NFL execs recently weighed in on who they believe should be the NFL's Coach of the Year, and among those mentioned was the Jacksonville Jaguars' Liam Coen.\n\nThe NFL Network's Tom Pelissero polled 30 execs, asking them to vote on who they believe should win each major end-of-season award, such as MVP, Coach of the Year, and others.\n\nWhen it came to Coach of the Year, New England's Mike Vrabel was the clear-cut winner if it were up to the NFL execs. He received 13 votes.\n\nChicago's Ben Johnson was second with six votes, while Coen was third with four votes.\n\nUnder Coen, the Jaguars have made one of the biggest turnarounds in football, going from four wins a season ago to 11 wins with still two games left in the regular season.\n\nJacksonville has clinched a playoff spot, but they also still find themselves in the mix for the AFC's No. 1 seed.\n\nTrevor Lawrence is playing some of the best football of his career over the last month under Coen. The offense has scored 30-plus points in five of their last eight games as well.\n\nNot to be overlooked either is the staff that Coen has assembled around him, which includes offensive coordinator Grant Udinski and defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile, who has turned the Jaguars into a takeaway-heavy defense.\n\nHowever, perhaps what stands out the most about this Coen-led Jaguars team is their resiliency.\n\nAfter blowing a 19-point fourth-quarter lead to Houston, the Jaguars were 5-4, and it felt like a fork in the road moment for this team. But since then, Jacksonville has won six games in a row, which tells us a lot about the makeup of this team under Coen's leadership.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: NFL execs put Jaguars Liam Coen in Coach of the Year conversation",

    "description": "After an ugly performance in Week 16, New York Giants interim coach Mike Kafka expects a bounce-back game from QB Jaxson Dart against Las Vegas.",
    "fullText": "As the New York Giants prepare for their Christmas week matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders, interim head coach Mike Kafka expressed full confidence in rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart's ability to rebound from last week's disappointing performance.\n\n\"Really, Jaxson, the whole offensive unit, myself, we all are -- obviously, last week's performance wasn't to our standard,\" Kafka told reporters Wednesday. \"So, we came back to work today and yesterday dialed in on the game plan and emphasized the things that we need to get corrected.\n\n\"Today's a great day, a good work day in terms of getting out on the field, full speed, the timing, the rhythm, the communication, ramping that up as well... I'm expecting and anticipating a good work day today.\"\n\nKafka, drawing from his experience coaching Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City, emphasized the importance of the coach-quarterback relationship in navigating ups and downs.\n\n\"It's extremely important,\" he said. \"I've been in those situations, seeing the game through the helmet that way and being able to give them my experiences, not only as a player but also as a coach and having to go through those ebbs and flows of a season or a game or a quarter or a series or a play.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was curious about Dart's response to his first major struggle, Kafka was unequivocal.\n\n\"No, I wouldn't say I was curious. I knew exactly how he would respond, like he would respond to anything. The highs, the lows, he would respond the same way, with great attention to detail, urgency to get better,\" he said. \"Jaxson's had that approach, our whole offense has had that approach, and he's the leader of the ship.\"\n\nKafka also stressed consistent messaging.\n\n\"The messaging is consistent. The highs and the lows, they're all consistent. Where are the opportunities that we can learn from? Where are the opportunities we can grow from? And there's plenty of things that he did well in that game, too,\" he said. \"So, I think the consistency of that dialogue and really where the points of emphasis for that game, kind of turning the page, and now what can we do to apply those same learning tools to this game?\"\n\nAddressing speculation about Dart's freelance style being constrained, Kafka pushed back firmly.\n\n\"We want to give our players the ability to express themselves on the field to the best of their abilities and let their natural ability show,\" he said. \"You take those rules, and then you give it to the players, and then they elevate it, and they put their own stamp on it.\"\n\nHe added that he has heard no frustration from the rookie.\n\n\"No, no, we talk almost every day on a personal level, and then obviously on a football level,\" Kafka said. \"I'm right there arm-in-arm with him in terms of our operation.\"\n\nWith two games remaining in a challenging season, Kafka believes Dart and the offense are poised for a strong response.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants' Mike Kafka expects bounce-back game from Jaxson Dart",

PENN STATE DEFENSE\n\nClemson’s offense will not be hit nearly as hard with opt-outs when compared to the defense, with at least 27 Tigers out for the Pinstripe Bowl. The headline is that three-year starting quarterback Cade Klubnik will be playing in his final game for the Tigers.\n\nKlubnik entered the season as a Heisman hopeful and potential first-overall pick. However, those dreams came crashing down after a 1-3 start that quickly dashed those lofty goals. Klubnick wasn’t completely to blame for failures on offense, but did not perform at the level to help carry the team as expected. He completed 66% of passes on the year, with 16 touchdowns to six interceptions. He also didn’t contribute as much in the ground game as expected, with just 107 rushing yards on the season – although those numbers weren’t helped with 13 sacks on the season.\n\nKlubnik will be without Antonio Williams, who was the team’s most reliable receiver the second half of the season and finished with a team-leading 55 catches. He should still have explosive options in T.J. Moore and Bryant Wesco Jr., who will be able to challenge a short-handed Nittany Lions secondary without A.J. Harris, Elliot Washington and Zakee Wheatley. The absence of Wheatley will be most noticeable, as he was by far the most consistent playmaker in the secondary throughout the year.\n\nClemson will also look to rely on Adam Randall in the running game, who finished the year with two 100-plus yard rushing games to close out the regular season. At 6-2, 230 lbs., Randall is a bruising back who could wear down a shorthanded defense that will be without the best interior lineman in Zane Durant.\n\nPENN STATE OFFENSE VS. CLEMSON DEFENSE\n\nClemson’s defense was hit much harder on postseason attrition between opt-outs, transfers and late season injuries. Several key players will be unavailable for the Tigers, including First Team All-ACC members defensive tackle Peter Woods and cornerback Avieon Terrell, who led the team with nine pass breakups and five forced fumbles. They will also be without standout pass rusher TJ Parker, their top safety in Khalil Barnes and linebacker Wade Woodaz, who finished second on the team with 70 tackles.\n\nWhile Clemson’s front seven was the strength of the team, they will be missing quite a bit of production from the unit that finished 14th nationally in run defense and allowed 20.4 points per game, second in the ACC.\n\nPenn State’s notable absences include running back Nicholas Singleton, who became the program’s career touchdowns leader against Rutgers in his last game as a Nittany Lion. While Kaytron Allen has not opted out of the game, it’s reasonable to assume he may have limited carries as a senior preparing for the NFL Draft. The Nittany Lions will also be without guard Vega Ioane, who is currently projected as the first interior offensive lineman to be selected in the draft.\n\nThis game could be a major opportunity for Ethan Grunkemeyer to continue his impressive growth after taking over as starting quarterback in the final six games of the season. Clemson struggled to stop the pass this season, and will now be without their best safety and cornerback, among others in the secondary. Penn State should have the services of its three starting receivers, notably Trebor Pena and Devonte Ross. True freshman Koby Howard could build on his potential after showing flashes as a deep threat, and could be a key piece of the receiving corps in 2026 if he remains with the team. Tight end Andrew Rapplyea should be a factor in the passing game after becoming more involved in the passing game with Grunkemeyer under center.\n\nPenn State will be turning to some inexperienced running backs with Singleton sitting out and Allen likely set for an early exit. Corey Smith and Cam Wallace were both highly-touted prospects who have not seen much time behind the senior backs. The duo combined for just 11 carries in 2025, but will be set for a much larger role in 2026 depending how the off-season shakes out.\n\nThe Pinstripe Bowl will feature some outstanding specialists for both teams.\n\nClemson’s Nolan Hauser is having an outstanding season, connecting on 16 of 19 field goal attempts with a long of 50 yards. Punter Jack Smith is averaging 42.1 yards per punt, and has placed 2 of his 45 attempts inside the 20.\n\nPenn State’s Ryan Barker is 15 of 16 on field goals, with a long of 49 yards. His only miss on the season was the result of a blocked 50-yard attempt. Gabriel Nwosu showed his big leg in his first year as starting punter, averaging 46.1 yards per attempt.\n\nKing Mack is likely to take over kick return duties with Singleton opting out of the game.\n\nHow do you go about predicting a game with so many new faces in the lineup for both sides? There are so many unknowns with many players seeing significant time for the first time this season. There’s enough attrition on either side to impact gameplans, and you just don’t know if either will be able to establish a run game or get a consistent pass rush like you could rely on when at full strength.\n\nI’m expecting a high-scoring affair with two talented quarterbacks with plenty of skill players still available, while both teams will be without several key players on defense. With so much uncertainty, I’ll strike an optimistic tone and pick the Nittany Lions to wrap up a frustrating season on a high note. Grunkemeyer continues his progress with his best game yet, with Andrew Rappleyea earning game MVP with 120 receiving yards and a touchdown.",

    "description": "Amon-Ra St. Brown is dealing with a knee injury that could keep him out of the Detroit Lions' Christmas Day game against the Minnesota Vikings.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions are getting ready to make a last-ditch playoff push. Will they have their top receiver available on Christmas?\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown is dealing with a knee injury that has left him \"questionable\" for the Lions' short-week tilt with the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nSt. Brown leads the Lions in targets (144), receptions (98), receiving yards (1,194) and receiving touchdowns (11) and was just named to his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl. If without him, Detroit would need other playmakers to step up against a Minnesota defense that has allowed just 13 points per game over its three-game winning streak.\n\nHere's what to know about St. Brown's status for the Lions' Christmas game against the Vikings.\n\nThe Lions have not yet announced whether St. Brown will play in the team's Christmas game against the Vikings. The 26-year-old receiver is officially listed as \"questionable\" for the contest because of a knee injury.\n\nThe good news for Lions fans? NFL Media's Ian Rapoport reports St. Brown \"seems to be in a good position to play\" in the Thursday afternoon game.\n\nThe Lions will have until 3 p.m. ET – 90 minutes before their game against the Vikings kicks off – to determine St. Brown's status for the contest.\n\nSt. Brown suffered a knee injury in the Lions' Week 16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played 72 of 74 offensive snaps during the contest but was listed on the injury report Monday because of the malady.\n\nSt. Brown was a non-participant in Detroit's Monday practice estimation. He was upgraded to limited at Tuesday's walk-through, at which point Lions coach Dan Campbell seemed encouraged by St. Brown's progress.\n\n\"It’s positive news, but he’s a little irritated,\" Campbell told reporters of St. Brown's injury at a Tuesday news conference. \"There’s a little irritation, so short week, we’ll see. But I would say it’s still positive news.\"\n\nSt. Brown remained a limited participant at Wednesday's practice, but the Lions officially listed him as \"questionable\" for Thursday's game.\n\nSt. Brown hasn't yet missed a start for the Lions during the 2025 NFL season. The lone game in which he failed to play at least 77% of the team's offensive snaps came in Week 13, when he suffered an ankle injury after playing just four snaps on Thanksgiving against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nSt. Brown was able to return from that ankle injury just a week later. He logged six catches for 92 yards during his team's \"Thursday Night Football\" win over the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSt. Brown didn't appear on the Lions' injury report in either Week 15 or 16 before popping up on it again ahead of Detroit's Christmas Day game against Minnesota.\n\nThe Lions have six receivers on their depth chart, including St. Brown. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:\n\nIf St. Brown can't play, Williams would serve as the team's No. 1 receiver, while TeSlaa and Raymond would see an uptick in action. Lovett, who hasn't dressed since Week 14, would likely be active in his place, unless the Lions call up either Jackson Meeks or Malik Cunningham from the practice squad to play ahead of him.\n\nIf St. Brown does play, he and Williams will get a bulk of the targets in Detroit's passing game. Meanwhile, TeSlaa will be utilized more as a red-zone weapon and Raymond as a quality change-of-pace option.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update: Is Lions WR playing today vs Vikings?",

    "fullText": "The 5-10 Cincinnati Bengals will host the 3-12 Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. Let’s take a look at three players for Cincinnati that could be impactful in determining the outcome of the game.\n\nHill has been playing at nearly an elite level since moving back to outside cornerback. In his last four games, Hill has allowed just 14 catches for 56 yards total. He is tied with Devon Witherspoon for the fifth-highest PFF grade over that span, with a grade of 86.2. Michael Wilson has been playing well at wide receiver for the Cardinals. This will also be the second game back from injury for Marvin Harrison Jr. Can Dax continue his great play down the stretch of the season? He will be playing on his fifth-year option next year, and could be a candidate for an extension this offseason.\n\nDax Hill vs. Jaguars pic.twitter.com/UcGKcsySvt\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) September 16, 2025\n\nMurphy is a player who will definitely have his fifth-year option picked up after his strong play in the second half of the season. Murphy has excelled in his extended opportunity with Trey Hendrickson out injured. Murphy should have more opportunities than he did a week ago to rush the passer against a Cardinals offense without the same rushing attack as the Dolphins. Another sack or two for Murphy could be on the menu this week.\n\nMyles Murphy vs. Miami Dolphins pic.twitter.com/CUxMsqtVxv\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) December 22, 2025\n\nHiggins has been a touchdown-producing machine this season for the Bengals. He has a ridiculous 10 touchdown catches of his 49 total receptions on the season. His ability to high point the football is arguably the best in all of professional football. Can Higgins add another touchdown or two again this week? I think he will.\n\nThis Tee Higgins catch was crazy.\n\nThe reaction and the athleticism from Higgins was insane. 💪pic.twitter.com/GznB3Y1Bys\n\n— Jackpot NFL (@JackpotNFL) December 21, 2025",

They at least got another productive outing out of running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. and it appears that he’ll be holding down the fort in the backfield for the rest of the way.\n\nBelow, we’ll go over Rodriguez’s outlook in fantasy football for Week 17.\n\nRodriguez continued to take command of the Commanders’ backfield in last Saturday’s loss to the Eagles, putting together a solid performance with 15 carries for 63 rushing yards and a fourth-quarter touchdown that made the score more respectable. He has continued to shoulder a bulk of the workload since their bye last month and Saturday’s loss was the first time where he was on the field for over 50% of the offensive snaps this season.\n\nStart. Whether it’s Marcus Mariota or Josh Johnson starting at quarterback for the Commanders today, I still expect Rodriguez to get a bulk of carries for the holiday showdown. With nothing to play for, he may end up being the primary offensive weapon and could get fed a ton of carries in this one. Start him.",

    "description": "Clearing my 150+ issue backlog with Claude Code.",
    "fullText": "10 years ago I was really into privacy and encryption, and I wanted to run my own VPN server. At the time, OpenVPN was the standard open-source VPN software, and that’s how openvpn-install came to be.\n\nThen WireGuard came along, and I created another script: wireguard-install. Over the years, these projects have been quite popular: currently 15k and 10k stars respectively, tens of thousands of repo visits per month!\n\nThe thing is, all these people have many different use cases and encounter edge cases that are not handled. Over the years, this means a lot of issues and pull requests.\n\nBut the more they pile up, the harder it gets to manage. I tried to keep good triage hygiene by closing low-effort issues or converting to GitHub discussions when it’s a general support question, adding labels, etc.\n\nThe problem with actually tackling the backlog is that it takes a lot of time. I tried a few times but never saw the end of it.\n\nAnd for PRs, I need to do the same and on top of that I need to:\n\nWhich is a lot! But this time, it was going to be different.\n\nOne of the first things I did was to plan for future velocity. My only automated validation on PRs was linting with shellcheck, basically.\nBack in 2020, I felt the need for actual testing, and I set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run the script on a few DigitalOcean droplets. This was helpful to catch some errors, but it only ran on master because I can’t make it run on PRs and forks for safety reasons (and cost).\n\nI didn’t think I would be able to run that in GitHub Actions itself due to Docker limitations (OpenVPN requires the TUN module, IP routing, iptables, etc). But with Claude I was able to experiment and get a full end-to-end testing workflow working in Docker! Turns out it was possible all along, I just convinced myself it wasn’t. With LLMs, I can explore ideas and throw them out if they don’t work, so it allows me to be more exploratory and ambitious. (Debugging CI is certainly not what I want to spend my free time on).\n\nI ended up with all the supported distributions tested and more scenarios, for a total of 30+ tests in the matrix. They’re also pretty fast, since they take a handful of minutes to run.\n\nFor each test, I’m orchestrating a server container and client container that follow a linear script while occasionaly waiting on each other through file presence, file contents, etc. I’m able to test all the features from the initial installation to client connection, revocation, etc. It’s not super sexy as it’s a bunch of bash assertions with grep and ping! But it’s been tremendously helpful, and allowed me to iterate much faster on the rest of the backlog in a safer way.\n\nI still tested manually on actual cloud VMs from time to time, which still helped me catch bugs, but I can skip doing that most of the time.\n\nArmed with my testing setup and Claude, I was able to fix a long list of long-standing issues and missing features:\n\nClaude Code was able to help me implement all of this.\n\nFor big features, drafting implementation plans (with or without plan mode, which didn’t seem to impact much) and giving access to the OpenVPN and easy-rsa source code is very helpful: it can see when a feature was added or deprecated and correct itself on usage. It can use the gh CLI to search for it, but cloning it locally works better.\n\nIt also helped me rebase PRs from external contributors that I wanted to merge. With the big refactors I did, they needed a lot of work, which would have taken a lot of time manually. The good thing is that after rebasing and fixing, I magically had tests in the PRs!\nIt was also nice to add missing tests, docs, etc.\n\nIt took some work, but I was able to go from 150 issues and 50 pull requests to… 0.\n\nDefinitely not! I’m not saying one or two bugs didn’t slip by me, but overall, the project is in a much better state now, especially considering the reworked architecture, the fixed bugs, the additional tests, etc.\n\nIt still required a lot of work to do all of that, and a vision: LLMs didn’t do it on their own. I still carefully reviewed every change until they matched what I had in mind. I just didn’t have to get my hands dirty with the bash syntax, which is why the result is that much better!\n\nClaude Code + Opus 4.5 are clearly world-class right now, and they produce very little slop. Most of the time, it didn’t need that much correction on the implementation itself. It was really useful as a thinking partner to iterate on an idea.\n\nOverall, it still took me a few dozen hours to get through it.\n\nIt would have taken me at least twice as much time without Claude. As a matter of fact, I probably wouldn’t have done it at all.\n\nI used to be a big user of GitHub Copilot inside of VS Code: the chat panel right alongside the code is very handy, and it’s nice to specify the exact context I’m referring to.\n\nBut with CLI agents, I’m able to run many of them in a few Ghostty tabs.\n\nWith Git worktrees, I can run multiple agents on different branches in the same repo. Super handy when they don’t overlap much.\n\nAnd Copilot used to be dramatically slow for file edits especially (see this blog post of mine just a few months ago). Right now it’s much better, but CLI agents are even faster.\n\nWhile every lab has its own agent (even Mistral just came out with its own vibe), claude-code is probably the leader right now in terms of capabilities and features, even if open-source alternatives are catching up.\n\nOpus 4.5 is very smart. Being able to search the web and other repos is also a big plus. Opus picks up on the design decisions of the project, and when implementing, will get it right most of the time. This + local tests + gh CLI = lots of time saved.\n\nIt looks like some other models may support web search, but it’s opt-in only for codex, for example. 🤔\n\nTo be honest, I could replace Opus 4.5 with a placeholder <current SOTA model>, because this is probably going to change in a month. But Opus 4.5 has really been a leap forward. It’s smart, gets the context quickly, and has a very good vibe. GPT-5.x models are smart but very “cold”.\n\nI also liked having the Copilot review bot leave comments on PRs. It was like a second layer of security, even though the hit rate is more or less 50%. I still routinely review the comments myself and tell Claude Code to use gh to get the comments and think about it, then resolve them.\n\nI’m happy I took the time to take care of this project. It’s now in a much better state for the future users, and I learned a lot in the meantime.\n\nI have so many ideas to build, but I will take the time to take care of wireguard-install as well!",

    "description": "AI infrastructure firms are set to win from the evolution of once asset-light Big Tech firms.",
    "fullText": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026.\n\nThe last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.\n\nSuch volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.\n\nInvestors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.\n\nSo far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.\n\nHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms.\n\nThe first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.\n\nBlue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.\n\nMost companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\n\n\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.\n\nThe AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC.\n\nThe bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said.\n\n\"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"\n\nThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies.\n\nCompanies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.\n\nDorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\n\n\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.\n\nTech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.\n\nThe private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added.\n\nIf incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said.\n\nIn addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\"\n\n\"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\"",

    "fullText": "Peter Thiel has been described variously as ‘America’s leading public intellectual’, the ‘architect of Silicon Valley’s contemporary ethos’ or as an ‘incoherent and alarmingly super-nationalistic’ malevolent force. The PayPal and Palantir founder, a prominent early supporter of Donald Trump, is one of the world’s richest and most influential men. Throughout his career, his principal concern has always been the future, so when The Spectator asked to interview him, he wanted to talk to young people. To that effect, three young members of the editorial team were sent to Los Angeles to meet him. What follows is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nWILLIAM ATKINSON: Following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York, an email that you sent five years ago has gone viral. You argued that with accumulating student debt and housing costs, it was no surprise that young people were turning to socialism. How do you explain that there are Gen Zs, like us, who aren’t on the left?\n\n‘The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing. America is no longer a great country’\n\nPETER THIEL: My sense is that in the US, Britain, Germany and France, the Gen Z voters are less centrist. I wouldn’t say they’re more drawn to the extremes, but they do not believe there are solutions within the Overton window straitjacket, the narrow space that’s been defined between New Labour and the Tories [in the UK] for the past three decades. And then there’s Reform, a party that repudiates that spectrum. For the first time in 200 years, there’s a real party to the right of the Tories. It’s not just a Gen Z phenomenon, but there’s a Gen Z part that is very important.\n\nWE: You first argued in the late 2000s that the backlash from globalisation would upend politics. Do you often feel that the world is catching up with Peter Thiel?\n\nPT: These things were coming for a long time. Student debt was $300 billion in 2000, around $2 trillion today. The GFC [global financial crisis] in 2008 was a big watershed. Entry-level jobs became less well paid. For students graduating after 2008, it became much, much harder to get out of the debt. Student debt slows you down from buying a house, getting started with forming a family, becoming an actual adult. You end up with a completely different society. It takes a long time to figure this out. But I started talking about this a lot in 2010… Why did house prices go up so much faster than incomes? Not enough was built. A big part was built as a retirement vehicle for older people. They were happy with the prices going up. The Tory party in the UK is probably completely past the point of no return. The suggestion that I have had was that you must start by throwing everybody out of the party who comes from real estate. You must be willing to purge all the people that are part of this dysfunctional system.\n\nJOHN POWER: What would your advice be to someone in their twenties about how they can have an impact in politics? Should they join Reform?\n\nPT: I think about politics a fair bit, but if I spent all my life on it, I would go out of my mind. I would like people to be more involved in right-wing politics, but I’m not sure that’s the best thing for most. You certainly should work for Reform rather than Labour or the Tories. You can criticise Nigel Farage as too much of a Boomer but he’s less structurally hateful to the young people. But maybe this is not the right way to frame the questions. We’re gonna have a revolution from Gen Z – all these crazy things that they are going to be doing. Is this good or bad? I’ve often said, in the early 20th century you think of both communism and fascism as youth movements that went very, very haywire. In the early 21st century, the reality is we have inverted demographic pyramids. There are not enough young people. We’re not going to get youthful communism or youthful fascism. We have this unbelievably oppressive, powerful gerontocracy. Maybe you can get communism or fascism of old people, but it’s very low-energy. It will avoid some of the defects of the early 20th century.But it’ll have many other kinds of problems. The general challenge for Gen Z is that there are big constraints.\n\nMy hope is that there always are some technological fixes, defining technology as doing more with less. If the debate is more with more spending or less with less spending, you end up with runaway deficits or extremely cruel rationing. I have critiques of the three biggest European countries – Germany, France and Britain. France is way too socialist. That doesn’t work. Germany is just insane. People have got caught up in crazed ideological fixations. There’s almost nothing like the Green party anywhere outside of Germany. Britain is neither too insane nor too socialist, but it’s extremely unpragmatic. It is extraordinary how lacking in common sense it is. The optimistic case for the UK is that there are extraordinary efficiencies one could wring out of the state. It has the greatest room for improvement of any European country. But why haven’t these things been done in the past 60 or 70 years?… Maybe the entire population is just too docile.\n\nLARA BROWN: You’ve talked before about Europe’s choice between ‘Greta on a bicycle’ environmentalism, Chinese surveillance and radical Islam. Would you say Europe has chosen one path?\n\nPT: The bad doors for Europe, the three doors of the future. For the future to have power as a cultural or political idea, you want it to be different. You can’t stay in this Groundhog Day, this Tory/Labour thing where we’re never doing anything new. The problem is the three actual pictures of the future. Behind door number one is Islamic sharia law. Behind door number two is the totalitarian CCP surveillance state, a hi-tech dystopia. Behind door number three is Greta with a bicycle, and then there’s no fourth door. This is why Greta’s been winning.\n\nJP: A lot of people on the American right talk incessantly about how terrible Britain and Europe are in general. But I think there’s selective blindness and chauvinism from some people on the American right about the condition of their own country. There is nowhere in Europe as bad as Skid Row in Los Angeles. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I would defend the Trump version of the Republican party vs the zombie Reagan-Bush era. I don’t think President Trump or J.D. Vance are absurdly optimistic or panglossian about things. Make America Great Again was the most pessimistic slogan any president had in a century, and certainly that any Republican president ever had. The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing, because the red pill is that America is no longer a great country. But you have to make sure it doesn’t become a gateway drug to a black pill, where you become nihilistic and give up and you’re destined to eat too many doughnuts in a trailer park. I don’t think that the right are overly optimistic in America. I don’t think there’s a problem where people describe things as even worse in other places. People in the US don’t pay attention to the world at all. We are a semi-autistic country. Maybe not quite as autistic as China, but we do not think about anything going on outside this country that much.\n\nLB: You mentioned the UK has undergone 70 years of stagnation. Many on the British right would agree, but may think that the period from 1979 to 1990 under Margaret Thatcher offered a respite from decline – she pursued unpopular but necessary policies such as anti-inflationary measures despite employment implications and her approach to the Unions. Would you question this narrative?\n\nPT: Reagan was very formative for me. I was in eighth grade in 1980 when Reagan got elected and felt at the time he was an incredibly great president and had solved all these problems once and for all. I think if I lived in the UK under Thatcher, I would have felt similarly. But they weren’t durable. We got Clinton and Blair after. The size of government didn’t shrink that much. The government sectors didn’t get weakened.\n\n‘Capitalism didn’t increase inequality but globalisation did’\n\nThere’s been a slowdown in tech since the 1970s. There was progress in the world of computers, internet, mobile, crypto, maybe now AI, but in a lot of other areas there was a much slower kind of progress. The question is, why did we not notice this faster? I think it’s because Reagan and Thatcher created a big lift. They made societies more capitalist by lowering marginal tax rates and deregulating. Lots of people got fired but the economy grew so most people ended up better off.\n\nReagan and Thatcher were exactly right for their time. But it wouldn’t work for all time. And to the extent that this distracts us from these science and technology questions, then it was somewhat problematic.\n\nThen there was the Clinton-Blair one-time fix, which was that you could somehow grow the economy and increase productivity through globalisation. That also probably gave you a big one-time lift. It came with very big long-term problems. It led to far more inequality. The Gini coefficient in the US went up more under Clinton than any other president post-1945. So capitalism did not increase inequality, but globalisation did.\n\nMy telling of the 50-year economic history is that we tried more capitalism with Reagan and Thatcher and it was the right thing to do. More globalism with Clinton and Blair was sort of the right thing to do, though it had more negative externalities that people were very dishonest about. We now need to do something very different.\n\nLB: Helen Andrews recently posited that feminism and gender-balance initiatives in the early Noughties led to a ‘Great Feminisation’. She claims this caused the prioritisation of safety over risk, a workplace culture dominated by consensus and appeals to emotion rather than logic in decision–making. How much do you buy into this as a theory of stagnation?\n\nPT: I think it’s very courageous of her to tackle something that is relatively taboo… Yes, I think there was a shift towards a risk-averse society. Feminisation was part of that. Things also went wrong with educational institutions or too much regulation. The deeper cause is that there was something dangerous and scary about where a lot of science and technology had gone.\n\nLB: Are you saying that diversity and inclusion efforts were an attempt to derail technological progress?\n\nPT: I think at some point people got very scared of where this stuff was going. Absolutely. It wasn’t just the nuclear thing. I would say that environmentalism as a movement was very focused on the dangers of limitless progress, even though in theory, you could have a lot of forms of environmentalism that would be pro-tech, right? If you’re concerned about climate change, we could build lots of new nuclear reactors that don’t emit carbon. But if we’re worried that nuclear reactors could be dual use and used to make nuclear weapons then you can’t do that. In some sense the energy shifted into this very anti-tech, anti-science direction for the past 50 years or so.\n\nLB: And you think DEI was a good way to achieve anti-tech goals?\n\n‘We’re going to end up with this really lame world where nothing happens but it’s maybe harder to blow up’\n\nPT: It’s always hard to know how intentional these things were. Diversity can function in an anti-tech way. If diversity really means homogenisation, let’s apply that to scientists. There’s no heterodoxy allowed, no heterodoxy on climate science, no heterodoxy on evolution, no heterodoxy on vaccines, on masks, on the origin of Covid. Everyone looks different but has to think alike. So diversity means conformity. And conformity is not compatible with science. And if diversity is a shibboleth, which I think is its important meaning, then we’re worshipping this god called diversity. It’s an unknown god. It’s a hypnotic magic trick that redirects our attention. And so we don’t care about science any more.\n\nJP: You seem to have a wider picture of American history, particularly in regard to wokeness. Many MAGA-adjacent people seem to think wokeness, or ‘cultural Marxism’, came from nowhere in the early 2010s, while you have identified before that it is a postwar phenomenon.\n\nPT: The culture wars are important. And there are ways in which there’s a side that’s right and there’s a side that’s wrong. But the big problem is that’s distracting us from things like housing or the economy generally, or science and tech or maybe even the CCP takeover of the world. This is where I push back against using the term ‘cultural Marxism’. I always think Marxism was at least about the economy. The focus on identity politics, multiculturalism, affirmative action, starts in the 1970s. That’s when inequality starts to go up. These things were at least correlated with us getting distracted from what I consider to be more important problems.\n\nJP: There are parts of the American right who now look at the changes of the 1960s, such the Civil Rights Act, and think it’s time to re-evaluate the postwar social consensus. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I don’t think you can ever strictly go back. There are three questions about the history going back to the Helen Andrews piece or my stagnation thesis. First, there’s a question of what happened. Second is a question of why it happened. Then there is a very different question of what should be done now. That’s in some ways very different from the first two. Even if we can agree there’s been stagnation, even if we say the society became too feminised or too risk-averse, we don’t want to just get blackpilled from that. And then the question is: where are the places that you have some agency to get out of this straitjacket?\n\nWA: Are you optimistic that that’s happening? And do you think you’ve contributed towards it?\n\nPT: Somewhat, and very much yes.\n\nLB: Earlier you alluded to three doors we can go through: radical environmentalism, sharia law, or Chinese-style authoritarianism. If none of us wants to go through them then what’s the way out?\n\nPT: It’s a challenge on a political level because when you’re trying to win elections it ends up being about broader narratives. For people in Silicon Valley, in a way it’s more local. You can build a company and solve particular problems in that context. Silicon Valley turned out to be a big place where there was a moderate amount of freedom of action in the past few decades, although it wasn’t a panacea. There’s a part of me that thinks that for some problems you have to go through politics. If we’re going to come up with new cures and new types of nuclear power you have to somewhat deregulate the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission]. Some of these things are entangled with politics. But a lot of progress has happened that is decoupled from politics. One of the things that’s still healthy about the United States, unlike Britain and France, is that the political capital, the financial capital, the technological capital are all in different places, so it is very decentred. There are places where these things overlap, but there’s some way where people are able to do things that are independent.\n\nJP: Is tech going to come to the rescue like the Eagles [in Lord of the Rings], deus ex machina, providing abundance that can kind of smooth over some of the economic challenges? And as a rejoinder to that, do you think the AI bubble is about to pop?\n\nPT: There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution. It seems to be very concentrated on bigger companies, so it’s possible a lot of the returns are captured by a few companies, possibly leading to very uneven growth. While it may be a complement to human labour, it is probably more of a substitute than a complement. It will have a zero sum feel to a lot of people. At the same time if there is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it. I don’t think it’s big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\n\n‘There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution’\n\nOn the question of whether or not it is a bubble, I get asked this a lot by Europeans and that is how you know that they’re not going to build a lot of AI in Europe. If it’s a bubble, then people are spending too much money on AI, and they’re building too many data centres and buying too many chips, and you’re eventually going to get seriously diminishing returns on that. During the 1990s bubble, it was mainly the telecom fibre-optic infrastructure stuff where people really spent way too much and that had to get dialled back. But maybe it’s the other way around where there are high returns to AI, enabling the automation of certain workflows and enhanced productivity.\n\nIf the AI bubble does not burst, it’s possible that it ends up being quite inflationary because you have to use more power for these data centres. The atoms part of our economy is regulated and it’s hard to ramp up the power. But if the returns on power going to AI chips are really high, it will absorb a lot of energy. Interest rates could be higher because there’s more demand for capital. My macroeconomic placeholder is that it’s going to keep going.\n\nI’ve been allergic to AI for a long time because it can be a horrible buzzword. There was a 2016 report during the Obama administration on AI by the National Science and Technology council. If you did a search and replace, and replaced every use of the word AI with computers, it would have read the same way.\n\nAI also meant all these really different things over time. In 2014, [Nick] Bostrom defined it as machines being way smarter than humans. Kai-fu Lee wrote the CCP counterpoint AI Superpowers in 2017, where he defined it as this sort of low-tech, big data machine learning. Then in 2022 it turns out the AI revolution is LLMs [large language models] which can pass the Turing test. People had thought this would be what AI was for 70 years. So in the decade before we were about to pass the Turing test we had forgotten about it.\n\nThe dynamic when one has to think through a lot \n\nIf you look at the ratio of how many businesses there are per 100,000 people: what part of the US has the lowest number of businesses? Silicon Valley. That’s because the costs of business are higher, so these subscale businesses that are too small to go anywhere are even harder to get started. In a third-world country where there are no good businesses and everyone is an umbrella salesman, they are very entrepreneurial, but not in a scalable way. So you need to differentiate entrepreneurship from scalable businesses.\n\n‘If you’re too focused on history, you don’t pay enough attention to the future’\n\nThere’s this economist called Thomas Gür who has researched the idea that immigrants are more entrepreneurial. While that is correct, you have to adjust for the quality of the businesses and the immigrants start businesses by starting a taco truck because there’s nothing else you can do. It’s better than going on welfare. But that’s what you do when you’re not really part of a society. It’s better than nothing, but what you really want to do is scale.\n\nJP: Is there a cutting-edge domain that you would focus your energies on?\n\nPT: One of the lines we had in Zero to One [Thiel’s 2014 book about startups co-written with Blake Masters] is from Anna Karenina. It’s the opening line: ‘Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ The opposite is true of business. All failed businesses are more or less alike because they fail to escape from this problem of homogeneous competition. They didn’t do anything special. All successful businesses are special in their own way. That’s the closest I can give you to a formula and it’s incredibly hard to figure out what that is, or how to do it. I have some feel for it, I know it when I see it.\n\nTo wrap things up, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the past. That’s because it’s important. It’s how we got here. It’s what shaped a lot of these debates. At the same time, there’s also some limit to history. If you’re too focused on it, you don’t pay enough attention to the future. The point is not just to reflect on the past.\n\nThere was a medieval play on the Antichrist from 1160 or so, Ludus de Antichristo. It’s not a very good literary production, but there are these three kings, the Antichrist conquerors who focus on things like nationalism or their countries or their history. They lose because they’re too fixated on the past whilst the Antichrist is thinking about the future, and about what can be done. They don’t see Antichrist coming. So while it’s very important for those on the right to think about the past, to think about the history and what happened – they still should not lose sight of the future.",

    "description": "A Texas power developer is proposing to repurpose nuclear reactors from Navy warships to power the United States grid. Read more here",
    "fullText": "A Texas power developer is proposing to repurpose nuclear reactors from Navy warships to power the United States grid as the Trump administration pushes to secure massive amounts of energy for the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nHGP Intelligent Energy LLC filed an application to the Energy Department to redirect two retired reactors to a data centre project proposed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, according to a letter submitted to the agency’s Office of Energy Dominance Financing. The project, filed for the White House’s Genesis Mission, would produce about 450-520 megawatts of around-the-clock electricity, or enough to power roughly 360,000 homes.\n\nIn theory, tapping the reactors could become one of the fastest ways to add baseload power to the grid as the U.S. struggles to meet surging power demand. Building new reactors — traditional big plants or next-generation smaller units — are years away, as are new big natural gas-fired plants. Repurposing military reactors for such civilian use, however, is unchartered territory.\n\nNaval aircraft carriers or submarines are each equipped with two reactors: A4W units made by Westinghouse Electric Co. or S8G-class units made by General Electric. Rewiring two of them would cost about US$1 million to US$4 million per megawatt, a fraction of building new reactor, according to the proposal. HGP’s plan includes a revenue share with the government, and the company would create a decommissioning fund.\n\nThe developer plans to file for a loan guarantee from the Energy Department, according to the letter. The project would require about US$1.8 billion to US$2.1 billion of private capital to build related infrastructure to prepare the reactors for general use, according to the proposal submitted to the DOE and seen by Bloomberg News. The first phase could be completed as soon as 2029, according to the proposal.\n\n“We already know how to do this safely and at scale, and we’re fortunate to have a solid base of investors and partners who share that vision,” HGP chief executive Gregory Forero said in a statement.\n\nWith assistance from Joe Deaux.",

    "fullText": "While flashy growth stocks often steal the spotlight, some of the market’s most consistent winners are hiding in plain sight. This year, two Dividend Kings, companies with decades-long track records of increasing payouts, have not only delivered reliable income but also quietly outperformed the broader market.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops and sells treatments in immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and aesthetics, including blockbuster drugs like Humira and Skyrizi. AbbVie has quietly stood out this year, supported by resilient revenue growth, expanding blockbuster franchises, and a renewed commitment to dividend increases. This has led the stock to soar 29% year-to-date (YTD), outperforming the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) gain of 17.4%.\n\nThis Dividend Stock Just Scored an FDA Win. Should You Buy Shares Now?\n\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWith Humira’s patent expiration, there were concerns that AbbVie might lose its steam. However, the company reported net revenues of $15.7 billion, representing a 9.1% year-over-year (YoY) increase. The company's immunology and neuroscience portfolios drove growth, offsetting the significant decrease in Humira sales. The immunology portfolio alone delivered $7.8 billion in quarterly revenue, a roughly 12% increase, led by Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Skyrizi generated $4.7 billion in revenue, up over 47%, while Rinvoq grew by more than 35% to $2.18 billion.\n\nNeuroscience was another bright spot, with revenues increasing by more than 20% to $2.841 billion. Key drugs like Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy, and Qulipta all experienced strong growth, highlighting AbbVie's diversification beyond immunology. Meanwhile, oncology sales remained constant at $1.682 billion, with gains in Venclexta and Elahere offsetting declines in Imbruvica.\n\nAbbVie reported adjusted diluted profits per share of $1.86 for the quarter. Importantly, management increased its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $10.61 to $10.65. AbbVie has paid and increased dividends for the past 54 years, earning the title of a Dividend King. What truly cements AbbVie’s status as a Dividend King is its shareholder return profile. The company announced a 5.5% dividend increase beginning in February 2026, raising the quarterly payout to $1.73 per share. Since its inception in 2013, AbbVie has increased its dividend by more than 330%, highlighting its long-term commitment to income-focused investors. The company pays an attractive yield of 3.04%, higher than the healthcare average of 1.6%.",

    "title": "Student-loan borrowers in public service risk losing access to a major loan forgiveness program in the new year",
    "description": "The Trump administration's final rule on limiting eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is set to go into effect in July 2026.",
    "fullText": "Big changes are coming for a long-standing student-loan forgiveness program.\n\nIn 2007, Congress approved the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is designed to forgive student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of making qualifying payments. It meant that student-loan borrowers who dedicate at least a decade of their careers to public service work could count on their balances eventually being wiped out.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is changing the popular program, in which about 7 million borrowers are enrolled. At the end of October, the Department of Education finalized its rule to narrow eligibility for PSLF in response to Trump's March executive order directing the education secretary to redefine what \"public service\" means.\n\nA fact sheet from the department said that the rule will change the definition of a qualifying employer \"to exclude employers that participate in illegal activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose.\"\n\nThe final rule is set to go into effect in July 2026, and some student-loan servicers that collect payments from borrowers in PSLF have said that nothing is changing yet, and borrowers will receive updates as the regulations go into effect.\n\n\"For now, there are no impacts to borrowers, payment counts, or discharges,\" one servicer, Aidvantage, posted on its website.\n\nThe Department of Education said that the changes are intended to ensure that borrowers who receive PSLF have employers that contribute to public service and do not violate any laws. However, borrowers and advocates have expressed concerns that the changes to eligibility will block public servants from relief because their employers do not align with the administration's political views.\n\n\"With this new rule, the Trump Administration is refocusing the PSLF program to ensure federal benefits go to our Nation's teachers, first responders, and civil servants who tirelessly serve their communities,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nThe key change in the PSLF rule concerns eligibility for PSLF employers. While any public service employer previously qualified for the program, a fact sheet from the Department of Education said that it will be changing the definition of a \"qualifying employer\" to exclude employers that have participated in \"substantial illegal activity,\" which the department said includes actions supporting terrorism or gender affirming care.\n\nIf the department determines that an employer engaged in illegal activity, affected employers will be notified and receive an opportunity to rebut the department's findings. Borrowers will also be notified, but they cannot appeal the findings themselves.\n\nShould the employer be disqualified from PSLF, they can reapply to be a qualifying employer within 10 years, or they can enter a \"corrective action plan\" with terms agreed upon by the department. Once an employer is deemed ineligible, any payments borrowers make while under that employer will not count toward PSLF, but retroactive payments would continue to be valid.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers in public service raised concerns with the looming PSLF changes. Megan Flocken, a nonprofit worker, told Business Insider: \"I'm counting my lucky stars that there's still the possibility that this PSLF program will remain intact because I have dedicated my whole professional life to public service.\"\n\nShortly after the department released its final rule, a coalition of advocates and nonprofits sued the administration, accusing it of violating the law and harming government and nonprofit recruitment. Some Democratic lawmakers also called for the rule to be rescinded; Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote on X on November 1 that the administration does \"not have the right to take away student debt forgiveness from teachers, nurses, veterans and other public servants if they do not show loyalty to your right-wing political agenda.\"",

    "description": "Rocsys CEO Crijn Bouman is making automated charging ports with the goal of doubling the amount of robotaxis that can be managed by a single human.",
    "fullText": "How many humans does it take to plug a fleet of robotaxis into a charging station?\n\nCrijn Bouman, the CEO and cofounder of Rocsys, did the math on that.\n\n\"Both in China and the US, it's roughly 1:12 to 1:14 ratio of head count versus vehicles in a depot,\" Bouman told Business Insider in an interview. \"It's crazy.\"\n\nRobotaxis aim to take the human out of the driver's seat, but there's another less-glamorous side of the driverless business that Bouman says should be automated: charging and maintaining the vehicles.\n\n\"The operations are a completely overlooked area, which, if you don't get it right, breaks the business case,\" the CEO said.\n\nRocsys, co-founded in 2019, aims to turn every charging port into a robocharger by essentially adding a robotic arm and software on top of the existing infrastructure.\n\nThe goal, Bouman said, is to replace humans in a process he views as wholly inefficient and unprepared for the mass adoption of robotaxis.\n\nThis interview was lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat did you see that led you to start Rocsys and focus on automated charging?\n\nI previously founded a company called Epyon, which made fast chargers for electric cars. That company was acquired by ABB, and I spent six years there as the head of the product line for electric-vehicle charging.\n\nIn my final year at ABB, we had an experience that was somewhat unusual: There was a customer from San Francisco who bought a lot of fast chargers, but they did not want to tell us what they were doing with them.\n\nIt turned out to be Cruise, the self-driving company. This was in 2017. In South San Francisco, Cruise had a big white-box warehouse where they'd built a complete indoor test track, because they didn't yet have a permit to go on public roads. The vehicle would drive for about two hours and then park itself; a person would then walk over and plug it in.\n\nThat triggered the idea: If you take out the human driver, the interface to the infrastructure is actually broken. If you want autonomous vehicles to scale, there needs to be a company that fixes the interface to the built world — such as charging, entering a parking garage, or going into a car wash. All the infrastructure is built for human drivers. That was the big idea behind Rocsys.\n\nWe first began focusing more on ports and logistics yards because, five years ago, there were few autonomous vehicles beyond those used in logistics operations and port terminals. Then, last year, robotaxis became mainstream in the US and China.\n\nLast year, we established a dedicated team to focus on the robotaxi market in the US. We won our first very large customer contract in robotaxis — I can't talk about it publicly — and we are about to sign the second one. That contract is for automated charging at service depots for robotaxis.\n\nRocsys's thesis is that manual charging is prone to errors, time-consuming, and costly to operate. How does automated charging solve those three problems?\n\nWe've been in robotaxi depots in the US and China, using stopwatches to determine how much time each task takes. With charging, you walk to the vehicle, plug it in, and then half an hour later, you walk back and unplug. It may seem small, but upon examining the metrics, it's a substantial amount of work.\n\nAll the metrics add up to that 1:12 or 1:14 ratio of vehicles per head count in the depot. If you take a city like Los Angeles or the San Francisco Bay Area, you might need roughly 10,000 vehicles to operate a sizable fleet, which means you'd need to hire roughly 800 to 1,000 people just to keep that fleet running.\n\nThe reality is, it's not really a career. This job — it's just walking around in a depot outside, plugging a vehicle in, and wiping a screen. The average tenure is about three months.\n\nThe hassle is insane. These tech-savvy companies building autonomous vehicles need to establish a comprehensive parallel infrastructure of gig workers — including HR, facilities, and OSHA requirements — everything. It breaks the scale and is very costly to operate.\n\nOur product means you don't need to build that whole parallel organization, which is a complete distraction from their core business.\n\nLooking closely at depot operations, what do the numbers behind the actual labor look like?\n\nPlugging in, inspecting the vehicle, performing a quick interior clean, and then walking back to unplug lasts between 300 and 400 seconds.\n\nThere are a lot of interruptions in between because charging is so important for the throughput of the depot that it gets priority. So, if someone is cleaning a vehicle, they have to stop when a new one arrives, walk over, plug it in, and then walk back. There's a lot of inefficiency.\n\nIf you automate charging, you take out roughly half the head count. Then you can optimize the other tasks so they're more sequential instead of in an ad-hoc manner. The efficiency gains are huge.\n\nIf the ratio for current depot operations is one human per 12 robotaxis, then what does the ratio look like with automated chargers?\n\nIf cleaning and inspection are still manual processes, then you will more than double the number of vehicles served per person.\n\nWe also have a road map to automate those other processes. We're currently focused on charging because that's the primary customer request, but we have developed a proof of concept for automated inspection and have already built a working system for automated interior cleaning.\n\nWhat are the labor-cost differences between a depot that uses human labor versus a depot with Rocsys?\n\nThe cost savings range from 30% to 70% in the first year, depending on the dynamics of each depot. It's really significant.\n\nA couple years ago, there was some buzz around Tesla's robot charger. What's to stop Tesla from reviving that idea and doing automated charging themselves?\n\nElon Musk will do everything himself, so they might. It would make a ton of sense for them. The whole pitch for Tesla is that it can upgrade the entire fleet to robo­taxis, and those vehicles need to be charged.\n\nTo upgrade a couple of million Teslas to be autonomously driven, they need an automated charging option. So I think it would be very logical for them to bring robotic charging to market. It's likely to be a captive model. Tesla has pitched inductive (wireless) charging for the dedicated Tesla robotaxi.\n\nCurrent robotaxi fleets don't have that. None of the vehicles have it.\n\nBut before we even talk about robotaxis scaling, doesn't the US still have issues with its EV charging infrastructure that need to be solved first?\n\nI think for the robotaxi use-case, it's sort of a parallel world because the charging stations are very dedicated to a fleet. So, robotaxi operators build out their fleets, but in parallel, they also develop the charging infrastructure with partners or independently. It's sort of bespoke to the robotaxi operation. Currently, the hubs are dedicated to one operator — Waymo has its own hubs, while Zoox has its own.\n\nThese differ from public charging infrastructure, so I'd say they are parallel worlds. There's no reason to solve one problem before the other.\n\nAre robo­taxis scaling fast enough today for Rocsys to build a real business on automated charging?\n\nAbsolutely. Over the next five years, we can expect a substantial market for us.\n\nRobotaxis are a limited fleet, but usage is extremely intense. The vehicles are running 24/7, three to four times per day. There is already a substantial market for us, with a fleet of several thousand vehicles.\n\nThe ratio of vehicles to charging bays — the parking spots where a vehicle can be charged — is about one to six. For 6,000 vehicles, you need around 1,000 charging bays.\n\nPublic information suggests that there are somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 robotaxis on US roads, if you add up Waymo, Zoox, and others. That means the current market is a few thousand bays to serve, which is already a very nice starting market. But it's scaling so fast now. There's the Uber-Nuro announcement with a 20,000-vehicle robo­taxi fleet.\n\nWhat we're seeing now already feels like a land-grab dynamic. There's Waymo, there's Zoox. Tesla — let's see how far they actually are. There's also Nuro and Uber. Wayve from the UK, which is also pretty impressive.\n\nIt really feels like a land grab in the next two years.\n\nAre you approaching Uber, Lyft, and all the other players?\n\nYou can be sure that we talk to every one of them.\n\nWhen will you be able to announce your first big robotaxi customer?\n\nWe don't have a date yet, but I'm fairly certain it'll be sometime next year.",

The poll was conducted in mid-December by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center.\n\nMikhail Mamonov, the deputy head of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, said as he presented the results at a roundtable discussion: \"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president.\"\n\nIn previous years, when revealing the results of its annual poll, the organization did not provide data on the share of Russians expecting the war to end. It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

Flipping burgers at McDonald's.\n\nSome of the world's most powerful business leaders — including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk — started their careers far from the C-suite. Many of them are now worth billions of dollars, with all of the net worths in this piece reported using Forbes' estimates.\n\nHere are the unglamorous early jobs of 15 top current and former CEOs.\n\nBefore he was running a $4 trillion company, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was washing dishes and waiting tables at a Denny's in Portland, Oregon. He got his first job at the diner when he was 15, and, years later, batted around the initial ideas behind Nvidia at a Denny's in Northern California.\n\nNow, Huang is worth $163.6 billion.\n\nMichael Dell, the CEO of Dell Technologies, took a gig washing dishes at a Chinese restaurant when he was 12. Today, he's worth $140.8 billion.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is notoriously frugal, despite being worth $148.2 billion. Buffett got his first job delivering newspapers as a teenager. Ever the businessman, he invested some of those savings.\n\nMary Barra is the CEO of General Motors, but she got her start on the assembly line at the age of 18. She spent her time inspecting the hoods and fenders of the vehicles.\n\nAs the founder, former CEO, and current executive chair of Amazon, Jeff Bezos is worth $243.8 billion. But he spent his teenage summers working the grill at McDonald's.Door\n\n\"The most challenging thing was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush,\" Bezos told author Cody Teets. \"The manager at my McDonald's was excellent. He had a lot of teenagers working for him, and he kept us focused even while we had fun.\"\n\nElon Musk, who has cofounded and runs several companies, left his home in South Africa at the age of 17. He stayed with his cousin in Canada, where he tended to vegetables and grain bins on a farm, according to the book \"Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.\" After visiting an unemployment office, Musk ended up cleaning the boiler room at a lumber mill, the book says.\n\nMusk is now the world's richest man, worth $749.7 billion.\n\nDoug McMillon started his career at the same company he now leads: Walmart. For his first job, he unloaded trucks at a Walmart Distribution Center in Arkansas.\n\nBefore co-founding and becoming the CEO of Netflix, Reed Hastings went door-to-door selling vacuums. He's now Netflix's chairman and is worth $5.2 billion, but has said he looks back fondly on that time.\n\nBob Iger, the CEO of Disney, started out as a weatherman in Ithaca, New York, before moving to New York City to work at Disney-owned ABC.\n\nWhen billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban was 12, he said he asked his dad if he could get a pricey pair of sneakers. His dad told him to get a job. That's when one of his dad's friends chimed in and said he needed to sell some garbage bags, so the not-yet-teenage Cuban went door-to-door.\n\nJan Koum, cofounder and former CEO of WhatsApp, immigrated to Mountain View, California, when he was 16. While there, he swept floors at a local grocery store to help his mom pay their bills. Now, Koum is worth $17.2 billion.\n\nThe former Yahoo CEO began her career as a grocery store clerk in Wisconsin when she was in high school. She led Yahoo from 2012 to 2017, and is now worth $1.3 billion.\n\nFormer CEO of Bloomberg and mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, parked other people's cars while in college. He used the job as a summer parking attendant to help pay his way through Johns Hopkins. Bloomberg is now worth $109.4 billion.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook started working when he was 12, delivering newspapers in the early morning hours before sneaking in a nap before school. He said that the job helped \"start my college education.\"\n\nNow, Cook is worth $2.6 billion.\n\nAbigail Johnson's father was the CEO of Fidelity Investments, but he had her start at the bottom of the corporate ladder, taking customers' orders. She took the job the summer before college, before eventually returning and working her way up to CEO in 2014.\n\n\"I was responsible for filling out the forms to correctly put in order the transactions that they were requesting,\" Johnson told Fortune. \"It was a pretty basic job. But it gave me an appreciation of what it was like to be responsible for really important things in people's lives and making sure that they were always done accurately and correctly.\"\n\nJohnson is now worth $35.6 billion.",

    "title": "Major food chains are reinventing themselves. We ranked their efforts to see who's winning the Great Restaurant Reset.",
    "description": "Many restaurant chains have been undergoing rebranding efforts this year. Business Insider ranked each effort in order of effectiveness.",
    "fullText": "It has been a big year for rebranding efforts among major restaurant chains.\n\nAs consumer tastes change — with value and experiential dining increasingly at the forefront — restaurant brands are seizing the moment to reinvent themselves: launching new logos, upgrading locations, and exploring new strategies to win over customers.\n\nBusiness Insider ranked each effort based on available financial performance and commentary from branding experts. Here's which rebrand is winning the Great Restaurant Reset so far.\n\nCracker Barrel launched a $700 million \"strategic transformation\" plan in 2025 aimed at updating stores, menus, and improving the brand's relevance.\n\nHowever, financial results showed essentially flat revenue in 2025 — a third straight sluggish year.\n\nThe most visible part of the refresh — its logo and brand redesign — backfired badly, with intense backlash forcing them to scrap the new logo. Management in September projected an 8% traffic drop for Q1 FY 2026, tied to the controversy.\n\nStock for Cracker Barrel was down more than 52% this year.\n\nOver the past year, Pizza Hut has quietly rolled out a refreshed logo and shaken up its menu and value strategy, launching new deals and limited-time items (like budget-friendly personal-pizza options) designed to win back customers amid sagging same-store sales.\n\nYum! Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut, is openly exploring a sale of all or part of the brand — that's about as loud a vote of \"this turnaround isn't working yet\" as it gets.\n\nUS same-store sales and system sales have been in negative territory, facing a 5% drop in both Q1 and Q2, a 7% decline in Q3 at US locations, and its operating profit was down 8% in Q3.\n\nStock for Yum, which also includes other fast food titans like Taco Bell and KFC, was up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\nParent company Bloomin' Brands announced in November a $75 million, multi-year turnaround plan for Outback Steakhouse, aimed at restoring the chain to its steakhouse roots by improving food quality, updating its restaurants and service, and refining the overall guest experience.\n\nAs its rebrand effort is in its earliest stages, as tracked by Business Insider, it hasn't had the same runway that other brands have. Still, the chain has been struggling for two years, with the recent quarter showing only flat comparable store sales growth.\n\nAs part of a cost-cutting overhaul, they have abruptly closed 21 restaurants, with more closures planned.\n\nThere is a clear, funded strategy and some sequential improvement, but the brand is still closing units and lagging key steakhouse competitors, so the revitalization isn't yet taking root.\n\nBloomin' Brands' stock was down more than 46% year-to-date.\n\nDespite its long run as a growth darling, Chipotle logged two straight quarters of negative same-store sales in 2025 (Q1 and Q2), followed by a flat outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nManagement is repositioning itself around chicken, tweaking menu innovation and marketing, and opening new units at a rapid pace — a pragmatic, multi-front effort to adapt to a changing market.\n\nSo far, this approach appears to be buying time, but it hasn't yet produced a dramatic rebound; instead, it seems more like an attempt at stabilization, setting the stage for a potential recovery if consumer traffic returns.\n\nChipotle stock is down more than 37% year-to-date.\n\nSince emerging from bankruptcy in late 2024 under its new private-equity-backed owner, RL Investor Holdings, and new CEO Damola Adamolekun, Red Lobster has launched a leaner, value-driven, and experience-focused turnaround.\n\nThe overhaul includes ditching the \"Endless Shrimp\" all-you-can-eat deal, simplifying the menu, reviving fan favorites (like hush puppies and popcorn shrimp), and adding new dishes — including their viral seafood boils — to appeal to younger diners.\n\nAs the only private company on the list, Red Lobster's financial situation is murkier than the others ranked by Business Insider.\n\nHowever, foot traffic data from Placer.ai shows that the company's restaurants in June began seeing consistently positive trends in the monthly average visits per location for the first time in over 18 months. And, although its financial performance is still below 2023 levels, Consumer Edge credit and debit card data indicate that Red Lobster posted sales growth of 20% in 2025 Q3, and its average transaction size increased by 10% year-over-year, far outpacing the 1% growth seen for the overall casual dining sector.\n\nMike Perry, the founder of the creative agency Tavern, which has worked on rebranding efforts with companies including Budweiser and Burger King, told Business Insider that Red Lobster's rebranding effort lands squarely in the middle range: not as catastrophic as Cracker Barrel, but not as innovative as others like Starbucks.\n\n\"I think so far they've played it safe, like 'we'll clean it up, we'll package it up and resell it,' which, frankly, it's private equity money anyway, so they're doing the PE playbook appropriately, and it'll work for them, but it's not going to have staying power. It's certainly not going to make you an icon,\" Perry said.\n\nKFC launched its Kentucky Fried Comeback campaign in mid-July, as sales in recent years have been weak enough that the legacy chicken chain has lost share to competitors like Raising Cane's and Wingstop.\n\nRecent quarters have shown US same-store sales down around 5%, which has dragged down parent company Yum's results. Globally, though, KFC has strung together 11 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth, with about 8% systemwide sales growth internationally.\n\n\"The category remains fiercely competitive, and a true comeback will ultimately require more substantial enhancements to its menu, marketing, and real estate strategies,\" R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at the location intelligence and foot traffic data software firm, Placer.ai, told Business Insider when KFC's comeback campaign launched.\n\nFor now, the US rebrand is clearly not \"fixed,\" but internationally the brand refresh is working, and the marketing reboot is resonating — so it ranks slightly above the chains that are still sliding across the board.\n\nUnder its new leadership, Starbucks launched the \"Back to Starbucks\" plan in late 2024, focusing on re-centering the company on its core identity as a neighborhood coffeehouse rather than a discount-driven chain.\n\nThe plan was intended to deliver 7-9% comparable store sales growth; instead, same-store sales remain under pressure, and the most recent updates indicate flat US comparable store sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, and a modest uptick globally, with CEO Brian Niccol acknowledging it as a slow and steady recovery.\n\nWhile foot traffic and comps are not roaring back like Chili's, you can see the reinvention beginning to stabilize Starbucks' business. The scale of investment and early green shoots justify calling the turnaround moderately effective — especially versus peers that are still in full decline.\n\nStarbucks' stock was down more than 7% year-to-date as of December 24.\n\nApplebee's has rolled out a renovation and modernization program called its \"Lookin' Good\" program — updating the menu, remodeling dining rooms to update décor, modernizing interior design, and streamlining kitchens for off-premises and delivery business.\n\nAfter two years of declining traffic, Applebee's delivered a 4.9% same-store sales increase in Q2 2025, driven primarily by traffic growth — the first traffic increase in roughly two years.\n\nDine Brands credits the improvement to menu innovation as well as well-messaged value. The company is now focusing on a 2025 plan that emphasizes marketing and remodels to reinforce its brand repositioning.\n\nThe re-emphasis on \"neighborhood\" value and refreshed menus is clearly translating into positive comps and traffic — a textbook sign of an effective revitalization taking hold.\n\nStock for Dine Brands Global, Applebee's' parent company, is up more than 8% year-to-date.\n\nChili's, with its newly simplified menu, streamlined operations, and restaurant refurbishment, has become a case study in turnaround success. Early quarters in 2025 showed 31% same-store sales growth, propelled by a nearly 21% increase in traffic.\n\nAnalysts have called it one of the best turnarounds \"of all time\" in the casual dining sector, crediting a multi-year strategy focused on simplifying the menu, sharpening value, and operational execution, rather than relying on flashy stunts.\n\n\"If you look at what Chili's has done, its last two years have been maybe the most extraordinary thing I've seen in the business in 20 years,\" Restaurant Business editor in chief Jonathan Maze told Business Insider.\n\nChili's is the clearest example where a planned revitalization has delivered outsize traffic and sales gains, shifted category share, and won over both guests and Wall Street. On a pure rebrand effectiveness basis, it's the standout winner in recent memory.\n\nStock for Chili's parent company, Brinker International, was up more than 14% year-to-date as of December 19.",

    "title": "I moved to the US from India. Here's how I landed a job at Microsoft after first misunderstanding the Big Tech hiring process.",
    "description": "Rishab Jolly moved to the US to get his MBA after starting his engineering career in India. He was hired at Microsoft in 2017 as a product manager.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rishab Jolly, a 37-year-old senior product manager at Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington. Business Insider has verified Jolly's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore moving to the US in 2015, I studied engineering and computer science in India, where I worked as both a software quality tester and an engineer.\n\nI was always interested in the business side of technology, so I left my job in India to pursue an MBA at the University of Arizona. My goal was to gain business acumen to complement my engineering background. I saw firsthand how much innovation takes place in the US and how many opportunities exist to work on cutting-edge products, which inspired me to build my career here.\n\nOne of the most valuable parts of the MBA program was its partnerships with Big Tech companies. As part of the curriculum, representatives from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google brought projects to campus.\n\nStudents formed teams, worked on deliverables, and were graded by company representatives. In 2016, I was team lead on a Microsoft project, and we did an excellent job. That gave me a chance to network and to demonstrate my skills to an actual Microsoft product manager.\n\nI applied to about 200 jobs, sending the same generic résumé without referrals. I received only three calls back and passed two interviews, but both offers were subsequently rescinded: one company considered my visa too risky without a STEM extension, and another cited budgetary reasons.\n\nI needed to secure a job within 60-90 days after graduation, or I would be forced to return to India. I ran out of money, asked a friend if I could crash on their couch, and felt a constant sense of anxiety.\n\nDuring that time, I stayed in touch with the Microsoft contact I'd met through my MBA project. When an opening came up, I asked if he would refer me.\n\nHe agreed, and I rewrote my résumé to match the specific role. The hiring manager liked my application, called me in, and I got a shot. That referral and tailoring my résumé made all the difference.\n\nI was hired by Microsoft in July 2017 and started as a product manager. I became a senior product manager in 2021.\n\nFirst, you have to get the interview, and second, you have to pass it. For the first step, referrals are critical. Big Tech companies receive tens of thousands of résumés every month. A referral can push yours to the top of the stack.\n\nTo prepare for interviews, I relied heavily on mock interviews. I reached out to peers who had been in the same boat and asked them to test me. They helped me refine my storytelling, practice answering metrics-driven questions, and pinpoint areas for improvement.\n\nWhen I finally interviewed at Microsoft, the feedback I received was that my stories were authentic and clearly based on real experiences. That authenticity resonated far more than rehearsed answers pulled from the internet.\n\nIn today's tech world, showcasing your skills outside work or school, whether on LinkedIn, GitHub, or through personal projects, demonstrates passion and initiative.\n\nI started posting more consistently on LinkedIn during the pandemic. I shared lessons from my career, thoughts on product management, and observations about the industry. I wasn't trying to \"build a following,\" I just focused on topics that genuinely resonated with me.\n\nOver time, those posts resonated with others, and a community naturally formed around them. The growth happened gradually and organically, simply because people connected with the ideas and conversations.\n\nRecruiters notice when you go beyond the curriculum to learn new tools or contribute to open-source projects. In a fast-changing industry where AI and new technologies emerge every six months, demonstrating your ability to adapt and self-learn is as important as the content of your résumé.\n\nWhile a small percentage of jobs may prefer an MBA, I know successful product managers who came from accounting, English literature, or completely different areas. Microsoft values diverse backgrounds because innovation thrives when teams bring fresh perspectives.\n\nEven with this knowledge, I would still pursue an MBA because it was not just about academics; it was also about gaining practical experience. It provided me with exposure to new perspectives, helped me transition into product management, and connected me with mentors and peers who have shaped my career in meaningful ways.\n\nI don't think an MBA is mandatory for everyone. It depends on your goals and whether you're looking for a career pivot, a network, or structured learning.\n\nVisa restrictions, financial pressure, and cultural adjustments can make the experience stressful. I had moments when I felt defeated, but staying focused and working smart eventually brought everything together.\n\nAfter over eight years at Microsoft, I plan to continue contributing to the technology and innovation ecosystem. I'm exploring the appropriate pathways that align with my career goals, but nothing is finalized at this time. My focus is on the work itself and continuing to grow professionally.\n\nMy advice to anyone following a similar path is straightforward: network strategically, prepare thoroughly, stay authentic, and continually build your skills and presence. Things may look uncertain now, but persistence and the right relationships can open doors you didn't think were possible.",

    "description": "More money, more problems? Billionaires are passing down trillions to their kids. Here's what they are doing wrong.",
    "fullText": "If the rule stands that you shouldn't discuss money at the dinner table, then there will likely be some awkward conversations happening over the next couple of decades.\n\nIn the next 25 years, an intergenerational wealth transfer of $74 trillion is expected, according to a June report by UBS. Among the ultrawealthy, this transfer is accelerating: By 2040, the world's billionaires are expected to pass down $5.9 trillion to their children, UBS estimated in a December report, which focused on billionaires.\n\nThat amounts to the greatest wealth transfer in history — and plenty of familial expectations.\n\nThe billionaires surveyed by UBS have high aspirations for their children: 82% hope their kids \"develop the skills and values to succeed independently,\" and 61% hope their children are \"happy/comfortable with managing the family's wealth.\"\n\nRichard Orlando, the founder of Legacy Capitals, a consulting and advisory firm for wealthy families and family offices, aims to help that transfer, and the expectations that come with it, go as smoothly as possible. He works with clients to educate them and cement plans around succession, investing, giving, and — the big one — inheritance.\n\nWhile more money can mean more complex problems — Legacy Capitals families are worth between $20 million and $3.5 billion — everyone can learn from a thoughtful approach to these topics, he said.\n\n\"Any family who's more intentional about transferring values, educating, and preparing the next generation for stewardship, whether that's $2 million going to the kids or $200 million,\" sees better results, he told Business Insider.\n\nHe broke down three common mistakes families make when dealing with inheritance — and how to correct them.\n\nMany wealthy parents shy away from discussing money with their children, fearing it may lead to entitlement.\n\nThe problem with that, Orlando said, is that it can leave a child totally unprepared until \"someone dies and the estate plan speaks,\" Orlando said. \"It's almost like a lottery winner.\"\n\nThere are ways to be more open without showing your kids your bank statement or breaking down every asset.\n\n\"Move toward transparency\" gradually, Orlando suggested, adding that families shouldn't expect to flip a switch overnight.\n\nOne of Orlando's clients planned to leave each of their children $100 million, he said. Up until then, their kids had largely been supporting themselves, with no idea they would soon have nine-figure fortunes.\n\nOrlando convinced the parents to put $5 million into wealth management accounts in each of the children's names to prevent a shock to the system.\n\n\"Let's get them to start developing skills,\" he said. \"If you want your children to be responsible for $100 million, don't stay silent.\"\n\nA large part of Orlando's work revolves around creating policies for families around everything from communication to investing.\n\nIf a family owns a business, there should be a conversation about who will take over control and ownership of it. If there is a foundation, there should be a conversation about its goals.\n\nFor example, say a grandparent is conservative and a grandchild wants to give all their money to Planned Parenthood. There will likely be a disagreement. Orlando's suggestion: Find common ground, agree on a few key causes, and incorporate those into a philanthropy mission statement.\n\nGuidelines help prevent future conflict, he said.\n\nAccording to the UBS survey, 43% of billionaires hope their children \"grow the family's business, brand, or assets, ensuring the family legacy continues.\"\n\nBut that expectation can lead to conflict.\n\nOrlando pointed to two billionaire clients with family businesses. The problem, he said, was that in both cases, the next generation wasn't prepared because the patriarch or matriarch didn't trust them with any decisions.\n\nThink Logan Roy in \"Succession\" calling his kids \"not serious people.\"\n\nThe solution is for the leader not to micromanage, but to gradually hand over the reins through projects that are low-risk and allow the children to voice their opinions.\n\n\"That way we can go from a voice to a vote,\" Orlando said. \"There are these progressions.\"",

    "title": "Why Hollywood is paying this 17-year-old up to $20,000 to boost film trailers with TikTok edits",
    "description": "Amid Mohamed, 17, founded a company that helps movie studios generate hype on TikTok in a language that young folks understand: edits.",
    "fullText": "The odds of anyone sitting through a two-minute film trailer while scrolling through TikTok are abysmal, a challenge that studios are grappling with in the age of short-form content.\n\n\"When you see a trailer nowadays, it just fades into the background because most people are just scrolling,\" Amid Mohamed, a 17-year-old based in Dubai, told Business Insider.\n\nThat's why companies like Viral Cartel Inc., the digital marketing and creative agency Mohamed founded in 2024, when he was just 16, are becoming a go-to tool for studios trying to break through on TikTok. Viral Cartel Inc. helps studios generate hype around their films and TV shows on social media in a language that young audiences understand: \"edits.\"\n\nEdits are clips of films, TV shows, and other media that are assembled by editors — either fans or professionals — into short, eye-catching montages paired with music. Many edits are based on a popular IP, so a well-crafted edit can generate organic engagement from fans that translates to millions of views and likes.\n\nMohamed said that stylized edits, rather than traditional trailers, are a more effective way to capture young viewers' attention on social media sites like TikTok. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey found that TikTok is one of the most popular apps for teenagers, ranking second only to YouTube.\n\n\"Trailers have become a scene pack for editors to clip up and flood TikTok,\" Mohamed said. \"Edits aren't just an amplifier anymore. They're part of the process that makes a trailer blow up.\"\n\nA flashy \"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\" edit created under Viral Cartel Inc. hit TikTok in January. As of December, the edit has 68.9 million views, 7.8 million likes, and 1.3 million saves. The Clio Entertainment Awards, which recognize top marketing and communications in the entertainment industry, shortlisted the edit this year.\n\nMohamed's company has also created campaigns for other popular films, including \"F1.\"\n\nStudios like Lionsgate have hired TikTok creators to design their edits for the platform, showing that a new era of marketing is upon us.\n\nAlthough Mohamed has gone all-in on his creative agency, he initially aspired to play professional basketball while living with his family in Sweden. At 14, he began taking videos of himself shooting hoops and posting them to TikTok, which compelled him to learn video editing and study what creates viral content.\n\n\"It also has to be something different,\" Mohamed said. \"When you see someone hooping outside in the snow, of course, people are going to start sharing it. What is he doing? Who hurt him?\" Mohamed said.\n\nAround that time, Mohamed discovered that there were companies willing to pay creators like him to promote songs in their videos, sparking his curiosity about the business of going viral online. Mohamed wanted to know more about how that industry worked, so he secured freelance marketing work to get better insights.\n\n\"I noticed I was pretty good at making movies go viral through edits, so after that period, I went straight into starting Viral Cartel,\" Mohamed said.\n\nHe said he initially struggled to get the attention of potential clients due to his small portfolio.\n\n\"I started trying to reach out to studios, but I didn't get any responses,\" Mohamed said. \"Nobody looks at a 16-year-old and trusts him with IP, so I had to build up a case study. \"\n\nHe began working with companies and creating film edits for free as a way to build credibility. He soon began connecting with agencies that looked to capitalize on the popularity of edits.\n\n\"A studio hires a big agency, and then that agency hires the gunpowder — the guys who actually make things trend,\" Mohamed said.\n\nViral Cartel has amassed a network of over 2,000 creators who receive commission for designing edits. Mohamed finds potential creators through social media and often reaches out via DMs.\n\n\"I pay them commission after I see they posted deliverables,\" Mohamed said.\n\nHe typically accepts projects that pay around five figures. A recent social media campaign completed by Viral Cartel paid $20,000. Business Insider verified the related documents.\n\nThrough these efforts, Mohamed also recognized the opportunity to create an online editing community. So, he developed Loopgate, an international editing competition for creators.\n\n\"To put it simply, it's editing as a sport,\" Mohamed.\n\nLoopgate's most recent competition began in December, when creators were encouraged to make edits based on \"Kill Bill.\"\n\nThe winner, chosen by the community of creators on Discord, receives the Viral Award.\n\nViral Cartel Inc. is just a year old, but Mohamed already has dreams of expanding his reach and services. That includes building up Loopgate.\n\n\"I see it going very far,\" Mohamed said.",

    "description": "Amazon, YouTube TV, and Netflix dominate US sports streaming, accounting for 65% of the $6.5 billion spent by streamers on sports rights.",
    "fullText": "The NFL is giving sports fans a triple header for Christmas this year, starting with the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, plus a Snoop Dogg halftime performance. But you have to \n\nThe tech giants have eaten the entertainment world, and now they're coming for sports.\n\nTogether, Amazon and YouTube TV account for 65% of the $6.5 billion that streamers will spend on sports rights for US audiences in 2025 (34.4% and 30.6%, respectively), according to Ampere Analysis. The third biggest share went to Netflix, with 11.3%. Disney's ESPN+ and Comcast's Peacock held a distant fourth and fifth place.\n\nAmazon and YouTube have actively pursued significant deals for sports rights in recent years, with Amazon paying $11 billion for the NFL's Thursday Night Football and $19.8 billion for NBA rights, and YouTube paying $14 billion to secure NFL \"Sunday Ticket\" rights.\n\nNetflix has also been active, scooping up NFL Christmas Day games and the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, although it prefers to treat sports as part of a broader live events strategy that includes comedy specials and awards shows rather than \"renting\" full seasons of sports rights. A person familiar with Netflix's spending said they pegged it at about $600 million versus Ampere's calculation of $738 million.\n\nAmpere's data comes with a few caveats. Its measurements of eight platforms exclude spending for rights distributed internationally — such as Amazon's spending on NFL rights outside the US, or on the UEFA Men's Champions League within the UK — and for DAZN's acquisition of the global FIFA Club World Cup 2025 rights for $1 billion.\n\nBroadcasters remain the largest buyers of sports rights in the US, although streamers are making inroads.\n\nNearly half (47%) of US broadcasters' content spending — $24 billion — went to sports rights in 2025, per Ampere. Most of US streamers' content budgets still go to TV shows and films. This year, 10% of their content budgets overall went to sports in 2025, up from 6% in 2024. Even for Amazon, sports were about 19% of its spending on content, approaching the amount it spends on movies.\n\nSports can help streamers grow engagement and keep audiences subscribed. However, the rising cost of sports means less money for an already stagnating entertainment TV ecosystem that has been producing fewer shows since the end of Peak TV in 2022.\n\nDisney said in its fourth quarter earnings call that it would spend $24 billion in the next fiscal year, driven in large part by sports rights. CFO Hugh Johnston justified paying a more than 73% step up for NBA rights in its 2024 deal by pointing to their value to audiences and advertisers, despite the cost creating \"a little bit of bumpiness during the course of the year.\"\n\nNetflix compared its recent NFL deal to the cost of its movies, which it's been making fewer of. Asked about the cost of the deal at an investor conference last year, Netflix exec Spencer Wang said he would characterize each game as \"roughly the size of one of our medium-sized original films.\"\n\nThe shift of sports to streaming platforms looks likely to continue.\n\nAmpere forecasts global spending on sports rights to increase by 20% to $78 billion worldwide by 2030. Spending will be driven by the US, where new NBA and MLB rights will be up for grabs in the coming years. Talks for the next round of NFL negotiations could start as early as 2026, as the league seeks to maximize the value of its media rights.\n\nYouTube TV is also expanding its play for sports fans, announcing a new sports bundle along with other niche packages that cost less than its regular $83-per-month service.",

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook bought $3 million in Nike shares, nearly doubling his stake in the company.",
    "fullText": "Nike has Tim Cook to thank for its warm, festive glow this Christmas.\n\nThe sneaker giant disclosed in a filing that Cook, a longtime member of Nike's board and its lead independent director, bought shares in Nike worth about $3 million.\n\nCook's purchase of 50,000 shares almost doubled his holdings in the company to just over 105,000 shares, or about $6 million.\n\nNike's stock jumped 4.64% at the close of trading on Wednesday.\n\nCook's investment sends a signal of support to Nike CEO Elliott Hill, who is in the middle of a plan to turn around the struggling sportswear giant.\n\n\"You buy with your own personal wealth, you put your money where your mouth is, you're making a point,\" said Simeon Siegel, equities research analyst at Guggenheim, in an interview on CNBC on Wednesday. \"Whether it's intended as an investment or as a signal, it's there.\"\n\nThe company also disclosed that another board member, Robert Swan, the chair of its audit committee, bought shares worth about $500,000 this week.\n\nHill rejoined Nike as CEO in October last year, inheriting a company facing heightened competition from smaller players. Nike was also trying to regain its mojo after its attempt to sell directly to consumers instead of through marketplace retailers stumbled. The company had also become, in Hill's words, \"far too promotional.\"\n\nHill's \"win now\" strategy involves focusing on five key areas: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and in-person presence. The plan has reset the company's focus on sports, including running, basketball, football, and training. Nike's management team has undergone a revamp, with several key leaders receiving promotions.\n\nNike's road to recovery under Hill has been hit with obstacles. The company's shares tumbled last week after it reported a big drop in sales in China during its second-quarter earnings. Nike's profits have also been hit by tariffs this year, which the company has said it hopes to offset by raising prices for customers in the US. Nike's stock is down 18.5% in the year-to-date.\n\nCook has been a member of Nike's board of directors since 2005. Apple and Nike have often collaborated on products over the years, including fitness apps and Nike variations of the Apple Watch.\n\nCook isn't just an Apple investor — he's also shown his support for Nike on his feet. Earlier this year, Cook was spotted wearing a pair of custom Nike Vomero Plus sneakers at the reopening of an Apple store in Tokyo. The kicks were designed by Sashiko Gals, an artisan division of the Japanese brand Kuon, the designers told Business Insider's Jordan Hart. Cook also wore a different pair of one-of-a-kind Nike sneakers when he launched a new iPad lineup at an Apple event in 2024.",

He said he went to every electrician company in town. Many of them required a two-year technical or trade school degree — just to offer $15 an hour starting pay. Even the much-hyped unions weren't the solution: \"Bro, just go Union!\" someone inevitably says. But as he pointed out, \"Unions are backed up for ages.\"\n\nTrending: Missed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n\nIn the replies, commenters on the thread echoed the frustration, not just in trades but across careers. One user noted the same tired cycle shows up everywhere: \"Every market and everyone and their mom will have a ‘just learn to code' variant,\" referencing how each field gets touted as a magic bullet but doesn't deliver.\n\nAnother joked that for a while the answer across industries was \"just go to law school,\" and healthcare workers shared their own instability, with one saying they nearly faced furlough because Medicare reimbursements dried up.\n\nSome in IT said they face similar barriers even with in‑demand tech skills, and one pharmacist described multiple layoffs in a short period. Another commenter pointed out that even jobs in healthcare and administration can be hard to secure, with employers citing distance from the workplace as a reason to reject candidates.\n\nThe broader job market helps explain some of this dissonance. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were roughly 7.7 million job openings in October — a high number overall, but not evenly distributed across industries, and not always meaningfully reachable for applicants without specialized credentials or connections.  At the same time, unemployment has hovered near historic lows but ticked up slightly as the labor market shows signs of softness, with broad averages masking pockets of intense competition and stagnant hiring processes for some roles.\n\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nIn trades specifically, demand data tells a mixed story. Many sectors like HVAC, electrical, and plumbing are projected to grow over the next decade as infrastructure work and retirements create openings.  But that growth doesn't automatically translate to accessible entry points for every applicant. Employers often list openings that go unfilled for reasons ranging from credential requirements to slow hiring pipelines. Moreover, job openings across the U.S. still outnumber hires, suggesting that getting a foot in the door is harder than the headlines imply.\n\nKnowing how to wire a panel and having experience doesn't guarantee a shot at a job. Despite the traditional message that the trades are a stable path with apprenticeships and union routes, his experience showed that many companies still prefer paperwork, screens, and gatekeeping over actually bringing in and mentoring new talent.\n\nIn a job market that feels unpredictable and uneven, what looks like opportunity on the surface can turn out, for many applicants, to be another maze of forms, filters, and dead ends — even in fields people are told are desperate for workers.\n\nRead Next: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "description": "At a time when many companies are rolling back flexible work arrangements and scrutinizing productivity, Duolingo's approach stands out.",
    "fullText": "Duolingo may be a publicly traded tech company with nearly 1,000 employees, but every winter it does something many corporate leaders would consider unthinkable: it gives staff a two-week break at the same time.\n\nThis is a policy that has been in place since day one, CEO and cofounder of the language-learning app, Luis von Ahn, said.\n\nAt a time when many companies are laying off tens of thousands of staff, tightening their budgets, rolling back flexible work arrangements, and scrutinizing productivity, Duolingo's approach stands out.\n\nThis year, even after growing head count by 14% to about 950 employees, von Ahn said Duolingo kept the tradition intact, giving every employee the same two weeks off.\n\n\"For a public company, it probably sounds… unconventional,\" von Ahn wrote in a recent LinkedIn post.\n\nBut he said the benefits far outweigh the costs.\n\nVon Ahn's core argument is that most time off isn't designed for real rest.\n\nWhen employees take individual vacations, work continues without them. Slack messages pile up. Emails go unanswered. Even while away, there's a persistent sense of missing out — and an inevitable scramble to catch up afterward, he said.\n\nDuolingo avoids that by having everyone step away at the same time. Aside from a small rotating \"skeleton\" crew that keeps the app running, most work pauses, he added.\n\n\"When you return, there's no pile to dig out from,\" von Ahn said. That, he said, is essential for people to truly disconnect and spend quality time with family or focus on life outside work.\n\nThe policy also reflects the reality of Duolingo's international team.\n\nWhile some employees can visit their families with a short flight or weekend trip, many others live thousands of miles away from home. For them, a standard weekend off barely justifies a 10-hour flight each way, von Ahn said.\n\nThe two-week winter break gives employees enough buffer to travel overseas and spend quality time with their families, he added.\n\nVon Ahn also said that extended time off gives employees space to reflect on how their personal goals align with their work — and with the rest of their lives.\n\nDuolingo's mission is to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available.\n\nThat kind of reflection is harder to achieve with shorter, fragmented vacations.\n\nThis policy is a cost to the company largely because employees are being paid while not working their usual hours. However, von Ahn said the tradeoff is worthwhile.\n\n\"Building a company that lasts means protecting the things that matter,\" he said.",

He added, though, that his second choice for a stock to gift this year would be Palantir.\n\nPro: Ross Gerber, Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management\n\nCommentary: Ross Gerber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, is known for his bearish views on Tesla stock. But as he recently revealed that Google parent Alphabet is the one stock he would gift this year, primarily due to its vast resources and long list of investments in other pioneering tech firms.\n\nGerber added that Alphabet isn't just his firm's top holding; it's his top pick among stocks to buy for 2026 in general. He told Business Insider that he thinks its subsidiary gives it a key advantage over Tesla in the self-driving car market.\n\nCommentary: Darius Dale, founder and CEO of market research and intelligence firm 42 Macro, says he wouldn't gift a stock this year so much as a share in this high-growth exchange-traded fund (ETF) that lets investors track the price of gold bullion.\n\n\"If I could gift someone one stock this holiday season, it would be the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (expense ratio: 10bps),\" he told Business Insider. \"As we communicated when we replaced the 30% target allocation to bonds with gold in our core asset allocation in October 2024, gold remains the gift that is likely to keep on giving over the next several years.\"\n\nPro: Eric M. Clark, Accuvest Global Advisors\n\nCommentary: Clark, CIO at investment advisory firm Accuvest Global Advisors, named popular eyewear company Warby Parker as his top pick among retail stocks for 2026, one that he would gift this year.\n\n\"You get paid best in names with strong unit store growth, and Warby & Five Below have the best store growth profiles in retail,\" he told Business Insider. \"As we spend more time on devices, we pull forward the need to get glasses, so there's a secular growth theme here.\"\n\nClark also touted Warby Parker's intelligent eyewear collaboration with Google as a likely catalyst that could push the stock higher.\n\nPro: Alexander Wah, Prince Capital\n\nCommentary: This under-the-radar tech stock has enjoyed a strong year. Wah, the founder and CIO of small-mid cap hedge fund Prince Capital, named Legence as his firm's top pick among the best stocks to gift in 2025.\n\n\"We believe the operational excellence, growing sector exposure, and disproportionate amount of access to a key labor force in the specialized plumbing for datacenter division make it a highly compelling opportunity,\" he stated.\n\nPro: Daniel Newman, The Futurum Group\n\nCommentary: Daniel Newman, CEO of research and advisory firm Futurum Group, also named Google as his top pick for a stock to gift this Christmas.\n\n\"While I like many names across the AI trade, I believe Google provides a mix of significant upside with deep moats that will be difficult to disrupt, but also doesn't come with massive downside risk,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nPro: Greg Halter, Carnegie Investment Counsel\n\nCommentary: Greg Halter, director of research at the Carnegie Investment Counsel, a wealth management firm with $7 billion in assets under management, thinks tech leader Amazon is the best stock to gift in 2025 due to its highly attractive valuation and growth potential.\n\n\"Amazon is now cheaper than Walmart on a valuation basis, with potential for margin growth in retail due to AI and the use of robots in the warehouses,\" he said. \"Strength should continue in advertising and cloud.\"\n\nPro: Marcus Sturdivant Sr., The ABC Squared\n\nCommentary: Marcus Sturdivant Sr., managing member of advisory The ABC Squared, thinks one of the tech sector's most beaten-down names would be a great stock to gift before it rebounds later on in 2026 and benefits from a shifting tech landscape. He isn't worried about Oracle's recent earnings-driven volatility.\n\n\"The stock may be dead for a couple quarters but check its price 12 months from now,\" he stated. \"I think the Mag Seven will shrink from 40ish percent of SP to 20-25% and the market rotates to other adjacent plays in AI.\"\n\nPro: Michael Ashley Schulman CFA, Running Point Capital\n\nCommentary: The CIO of financial services firm Running Point Capital, Schulman shares the popular perspective that the Google parent is the best stock to give as a gift in 2025.\n\n\"Part megacorp, part mad scientist, and somehow, still your homepage, Alphabet (GOOGL) is the ultimate holiday stock stuffer,\" he told Business Insider. \"It's a sprawling empire of businesses (a trillion-dollar fusion of reliable cash-flow machines) including a global ad giant, a cloud contender, one of the largest streaming services, a globally used smartphone OS, and an AI research leader.\"\n\nPro: Vince Stanzione, First Information\n\nCommentary: Vince Stanzione, a veteran trader and founder of market research and education platform First Information, is also bullish on gold. He named Equinox Gold Corp, a Canadian gold mining stock, as his top choice for a stock to gift.\n\n\"The stock is up +190% YTD yet is still very undervalued and even if Gold stays around current levels it will do very well in 2026. It also has a strong management team,\" he stated.",

    "title": "Mouse Study Suggests Nose-Picking Has a Surprising Link With Alzheimer's",
    "description": "Do you really need to pick it?",
    "fullText": "A study published in 2022 found a tenuous but plausible link between picking your nose and an increased risk of developing dementia.\n\nIn cases where picking at your nose causes internal tissue damage, critical species of bacteria have a clearer path to the brain, which responds to their presence in ways that resemble signs of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThere are numerous caveats here, not the least of which is that the supporting research so far is in mice rather than humans, but the findings are definitely worth further investigation – and could improve our understanding of how Alzheimer's disease starts, which remains something of a mystery.\n\nA team of researchers led by scientists from Griffith University in Australia ran tests with a bacterium called Chlamydia pneumoniae, which can infect humans and cause pneumonia.\n\nC. pneumoniae has also been discovered in the majority of human brains affected by late-onset dementia.\n\nThe video below has a summary of the study's findings:\n\nIt was demonstrated that in mice, the bacteria could travel up the olfactory nerve (joining the nasal cavity and the brain).\n\nWhat's more, when there was damage to the nasal epithelium (the thin tissue along the roof of the nasal cavity), nerve infections got worse.\n\nThis led to the mouse brains depositing more of the amyloid-beta protein – a protein that is released in response to infections.\n\nPlaques (or clumps) of this protein are also found in significant concentrations in people with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"We're the first to show that Chlamydia pneumoniae can go directly up the nose and into the brain where it can set off pathologies that look like Alzheimer's disease,\" said neuroscientist James St John from Griffith University in Australia, when the study was published in October 2022.\n\n\"We saw this happen in a mouse model, and the evidence is potentially scary for humans as well.\"\n\nThe scientists were surprised by the speed at which C. pneumoniae took hold in the central nervous system of the mice, with infection happening within 24 to 72 hours. It's thought that bacteria and viruses see the nose as a quick route to the brain.\n\nWhile it's not certain that the effects will be the same in humans, or even that amyloid-beta plaques are a cause of Alzheimer's, it's nevertheless important to follow up promising leads in the fight to understand this common neurodegenerative condition.\n\n\"We need to do this study in humans and confirm whether the same pathway operates in the same way,\" said St John.\n\n\"It's research that has been proposed by many people, but not yet completed. What we do know is that these same bacteria are present in humans, but we haven't worked out how they get there.\"\n\nNose picking isn't exactly a rare thing. In fact, it's possible as many as 9 out of 10 people do it… not to mention a bunch of other species (some a little more adept than others).\n\nWhile the benefits aren't clear, studies like this one should give us pause before picking.\n\nFuture studies into the same processes in humans are planned – but until then, St John and his colleagues suggest that picking your nose and plucking your nose hair is \"not a good idea\" because of the potential damage it does to protective nose tissue.\n\n\"We don't want to damage the inside of our nose and picking and plucking can do that,\" warned St John.\n\n\"If you damage the lining of the nose, you can increase how many bacteria can go up into your brain.\"\n\nOne outstanding question that the team will be looking to answer is whether or not the increased amyloid-beta protein deposits are a natural, healthy immune response that can be reversed when the infection is fought off.\n\nA 2024 review further advanced the hypothesis that nose picking could play a role in increasing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease – revealing more about how the process could unfold.\n\nAlzheimer's is an incredibly complicated disease, as is clear from the sheer number of studies into it and the many different angles scientists are taking in trying to understand it – but each piece of research brings us a little bit closer to finding a way to stop it.\n\n\"Once you get over 65 years old, your risk factor goes right up, but we're looking at other causes as well, because it's not just age – it is environmental exposure as well,\" said St John.\n\n\"And we think that bacteria and viruses are critical.\"\n\nThe research was published in Scientific Reports.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in November 2022.\n\nHolidays Can Break Your Routine: Here's How to Keep Exercising\n\nScientists Released Caged Mice Into The Wild, And an Incredible Thing Happened\n\nAn Anatomy Professor Explains The Bizarre Biology of Elves",

    "description": "Gig work for Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and others has become widespread — and tricky to do profitably, gig workers have said.",
    "fullText": "Gig work has never been more widespread — and more challenging.\n\nOver the past decade and a half, millions of workers have become ride-hailing drivers for Uber or delivered groceries for Instacart. For some, it's a side-hustle, while others rely on it as their primary source of income.\n\nThe model is also expanding to new professions and types of work, as evidenced by Uber's AI training efforts.\n\nBut as more people have entered the fray, pay for many gigs has fallen over the last several years, some gig workers have told Business Insider. That's made it more important for workers to manage their time and be selective about the work they take on, they said.\n\nSome have turned to third-party apps that advise workers on which rides or deliveries are the most profitable — a trick that companies Uber and Lyft have said violates their terms of service.\n\nOthers are trying to cut out the established apps entirely in favor of upstart versions, such as local cooperatives run by ride-hailing drivers themselves. Some have even launched their own black-car services.\n\nOver the last several months, however, a new challenge to conventional gig work has emerged: self-driving cars developed by Tesla and Waymo.\n\nWhile some drivers say they're waiting to see if robotaxis actually roll out as widely as advertised, others are considering whether owning self-driving taxis themselves might be an option when human drivers are no longer needed.\n\nBusiness Insider has spoken with drivers, delivery workers, executives, and others in the world of gig work.

    "description": "Justin Pines, the CEO of the Jewish Broadcasting Service, initially took a \"safe\" career path in corporate law, before becoming a rabbi.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Justin Pines, 42, the CEO of the Jewish Broadcasting Service, who lives in New Jersey. His education and former and current employment have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI always wanted my job to involve sharing Jewish ideas with a large audience, but I also felt I needed a safety net. So, I took the \"safe\" career path of becoming a corporate attorney.\n\nAfter about three years as an attorney, I left law to train as a rabbi. It led to me becoming the director of character development at a Jewish middle school, which I did for three years between 2016 and 2019.\n\nI loved it, but I pivoted again at 40 when I realized how hard it was to support my family that way. Now, I'm the CEO of the Jewish Broadcasting Service, a role that enables me to do what I'd always hoped.\n\nWith all of these changes, I learned about how to find a job that's the perfect fit.\n\nWhen I was 13, around the time of my Bar Mitzvah, I became very taken with Judaism. I started observing Shabbat and became interested in learning more about the religion. The more involved I became, the happier I felt.\n\nTo try to bring Judaism to the world, ideally through making movies, I studied communications for my undergraduate degree.\n\nToward the end of my degree, which I started in 2001, making it in Hollywood felt overwhelming and unrealistic. So, I went to Harvard Law School, deferring for a year to study at a Jewish educational institution in Israel. People assured me law school would set me up for any job I wanted.\n\nI began the program in 2006 and remember thinking a 30-year-old legal case in one of my first criminal law classes felt a little empty in comparison to the 2,000-year-old texts I had been reading, which felt divine and inspired.\n\nOverall, though, studying for my JD law degree was great. It made my brain feel super sharp, I made some amazing friends, and it set me up well for my legal career.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, the year before I graduated from Harvard, I interned at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. The company was full of excellent, smart, and kind people, so I accepted a full-time position that would start after I graduated.\n\nFrom 2009, I spent two years on rotation across different corporate departments at the firm. I had the opportunity to work on interesting projects and do some impactful pro bono work.\n\nIn the short term, it was great: I worked hard and played hard, could afford my own apartment in New York City, and liked my colleagues. But, I struggled with my long-term prospects.\n\nAs is the case at many corporate law firms, everything felt like an emergency, and partners would often receive work at the worst possible times, like on Friday afternoons or right before Thanksgiving weekend. It became clear that's what would be waiting for me if I ever made partner.\n\nI also had questions over whether it was meaningful work or the type of job where, no matter how senior you are, you'd be at the whim of others. I thought it might be time for something new.\n\nIn my third year at the law firm, when I was 29, I considered my career options. I made a chart with a list of six potential industries, including venture capital, real estate, Jewish non-profits, and becoming a rabbi. I interviewed people in each career about what their job was like and listed the pros and cons.\n\nI decided that more than anything else, I wanted to learn about Judaism. I was already studying the Talmud — the central text of Rabbinic Judaism — multiple times a week on the way to work. But I felt that I couldn't leave my high-paying job in law to study for the pursuit of knowledge and nothing more. I concluded that I needed another piece of paper, in addition to my BA and JD, which led me to a three-year vocational course at rabbinical school.\n\nAt the time, I thought I could make do with the significant pay cut I'd take if I became a rabbi.\n\nShortly after I became a rabbi at 33 in 2016, I became the head of character development at a Jewish middle school in New York's Upper East Side.\n\nIn a perfect world, I'd teach kids about Judaism all day, every day, forever. It breaks my heart to say, but it's hard to support a family doing that, and I have a wife and children.\n\nI wish educators were paid better, so more people felt inspired to get into the field. I have the utmost respect for those making it work, because it was a struggle. Personally, I needed a shift.\n\nAfter three years in Jewish education, I went to work at a Jewish think tank. Through that job, I was a guest on the Jewish Broadcasting Service, a broadcast network available through US TV providers and streaming services. In late 2023, they told me they were looking for a new CEO.\n\nI had studied communications at college, I wanted to share Judaism far and wide, and I had corporate experience: it felt like the role was the perfect fusion of my skills and interests. I joined as CEO at the start of 2024, at age 40.\n\nAt JBS, we broadcast shows that feature rabbis, artists, writers, and academics of all political and religious persuasions.\n\nI have a show where I typically interview leading Jewish thinkers. I can hardly believe it's my job to sit with my heroes for an hour, asking them whatever I want. I'm constantly pinching myself.\n\nPeople often treat their careers as ladders to climb rather than journeys with a North Star and lots to learn along the way. There was certainly a version of my life where I chose to stay in a lucrative career, in which I could have drawn meaning from things outside of work, like family or my volleyball team.\n\nFor much of my career, the challenge was achieving a balance between finding meaning, but not only from my job, and financial stability while doing something I love, among other things.\n\nI think I have found balance now. I feel blessed to love what I'm doing.",

    "fullText": "It has already been an eventful winter when it comes to winter weather, and it sounds like some parts of the country are expected to get hit hard by some heavy snow and dangerous winds this week.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, Dec. 24, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a series of \"urgent\" Winter Weather warnings for a few regions of the country, warning of incoming snow and wind over the next few hours and days.\n\nThe warnings are especially pertinent for those planning holiday ski trips or hiking trips in some mountain regions.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the NWS issued a winter weather warning for south central, southwest, and western Maine, as well as northern New Hampshire, predicting that those areas could get snowfall reaching up to 14 inches by Wednesday afternoon.\n\n“Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine with low visibility to create dangerous driving conditions,” the NWS warned in its advisory. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning commute as well as holiday travel.”\n\nThe advisory goes through Wednesday at 1 p.m., and the NWS warns that this could impact holiday travel.\n\n\"If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency,\" the NWS warned.\n\nParts of California, especially those in high elevations in the Yosemite National Park region, are expected to see some heavy snowfall over the next few days, combined with some strong winds.\n\nThe NWS warns that some areas could get between 4 and 8 feet of snow and 60 mph winds, lasting until Friday night, which could cause \"whiteout conditions.\"\n\nOther areas, like the Greater Lake Tahoe area, could get up to two feet of snow (with up to five feet expected above 5,000 feet) and 50 mph winds. Winds up to 100 mph are likely along the top ridges until Friday morning.\n\n“The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power outages,” the NWS warned in its advisory. “Whiteout conditions are expected and will make travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening. Travel could be very difficult to impossible.”\n\nParts of Idaho are expected to see some heavy winter weather this week, especially those at higher elevations. The NWS warns of several feet of snow and wind gusts of up to 35 miles per hour in some areas of the state through Thursday.\n\n\"Heavy snow expected,\" the NWS wrote in its advisory. \"Total snow accumulations of around 5 inches to 1 foot at elevations 6500 feet to 8000 feet. Above 8000 feet expect 1 to 2 feet of snow. For highest peaks, up to 3 feet of snow is likely. For Galena Summit about 1 foot of snow is expected. Accumulations in Ketchum and Sun Valley will be much lower at 2 inches or less. Winds gusting as high as 35 MPH.\"\n\nObviously, this could make travel difficult during the holiday season.\n\n\"Travel could be very difficult to impossible, mainlyover Galena Summit and in backcountry areas. Expect blowing and drifting snow,\" the NWS warned.",

    "description": "Macy's, Kroger, and Carter's are leading 2026 US retail store closures, citing long-term strategy and shifting consumer habits.",
    "fullText": "Retailers are gearing up for another wave of store closures.\n\nIt's shaping up to be the continuation of a retail pullback that Business Insider tracked in 2024 and 2025. Major chains, from department store Macy's to grocery chain Kroger, have already announced multiyear closure plans that extend into 2026, as have some niche stores.\n\nMany companies, such as Macy's, are closing their physical stores to invest more resources into their online businesses.\n\nIn 2025, Business Insider tracked around 4,100 closures as of late December. Retail data and consultant firm Coresight Research predicted earlier in the year that roughly 15,000 retail locations would close in the year.\n\nSo far for 2026, Business Insider has identified roughly 270 planned closures.\n\nSee the list of major closures below.\n\nCarter's, one of North America's biggest children's and baby apparel retailers, said in October that it plans to close 150 stores across the region over the next three years as leases expire, including about 100 by the end of 2026.\n\nIn January 2025, Macy's said it planned to close 150 locations through 2026, allowing it to focus on its best-performing locations and online experience. After the closures are complete, there will be about 350 Macy's stores left. Macy's closed at least 66 stores in 2025.\n\nGrocery giant Kroger said in June 2025 that it planned to close 60 \"unprofitable\" stores across the US over the next 18 months. The company said in September that it had begun that process.\n\nThe company said in its last annual report that it operated 2,731 supermarkets in 35 states and Washington, DC, as of February 2025.\n\nNewell Brands said in December 2025 that it would close 20 Yankee Candle stores in the US and Canada beginning in January 2026. The closures were announced alongside the reduction of its workforce by over 900 employees.\n\n\"This productivity plan is about taking the next, disciplined step to enhance efficiency, sharpen our strategic focus, and deliver stronger, more consistent performance,\" CEO Chris Peterson said in a press release.\n\nSaks Off 5th, a luxury outlet retailer offering discounted designer brands, told Business Insider that it plans to close select stores in early 2026. The closures include stores in nine locations.\n\n\"We are confident this will better position the Saks Off 5th business for long-term success and look forward to continuing to deliver for our customers,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nREI confirmed to Business Insider that it plans to close three stores, starting with a location in New Jersey, in the first quarter of 2026. Its stores in New York City's SoHo neighborhood and Boston are set to follow in late 2026.\n\n\"As markets and customer needs evolve, we must adapt to position the co-op for long-term success,\" the company said in a statement.",

    "title": "Here's what big bank CEOs have said about AI's impact on head count",
    "description": "If you're one of the nearly 2 million bank staff in the US, here's what your industry leaders are saying about how generative AI may impact your job.",
    "fullText": "When bank CEOs start talking about AI, the financial world lights up — from meme accounts to markets. Their predictions about how generative AI will change work can move stocks, reshape strategy, and set the tone for the rest of corporate America.\n\nBanks' plans, and increasingly, actions, around generative AI give a glimpse into how the technology will enhance and replace human workers.\n\nBut you know who else is listening? Their employees. Many of the largest bulge-bracket banks employ over 100,000 employees each, and the FDIC-insured commercial banking sector, more broadly, employs nearly 2 million people.\n\nThese can range from bank tellers to dealmakers making multi-billion-dollar salaries, as well as a veritable army of software engineers who will turn this generative AI dream into a reality.\n\nIn order to get a better understanding of what they're thinking, we've highlighted some of the most revealing statements about bank head count in the age of AI below.\n\nJamie Dimon's penchant for straight talk means that Dimon is willing to admit that job cuts are coming.\n\n\"It will eliminate jobs,\" Dimon said at a Fortune-hosted conference earlier this month. \"People should stop sticking their heads in the sand.\"\n\nThe comments echoed those Dimon made at a town hall for the firm's employees in Columbus, Ohio, earlier this year, where he said that AI will \"change some of your jobs,\" whether as a \"copilot,\" a solution for \"drudgery,\" or by eliminating them.\n\nMore immediately for JPMorgan, according to an interview on CNN earlier this month, Dimon sees head count remaining steady, or even rising, as AI continues to roll out, \"if we do a good job.\"\n\nCore to JPMorgan's promise is increased efficiency, which Dimon explored during the 2024 Alliance Bernstein conference.\n\n\"It will affect every job, every application, every database, and it will make people highly more efficient,\" Dimon said. \"Like a lot of you clicking away, taking notes. You won't have to do that because it will — you can just summarize what Jamie said. You push a button, and you don't have to waste all that time.\"\n\nHe also explained how increased efficiency could also create more jobs in cybersecurity.\n\n\"We use it for risk and fraud recognition, and bad guys are going to use it,\" Dimon said. \"So, we have to use it to counter the bad guys. We have to use it to get better and better in cyber.\"\n\nOther executives at the firm are even more explicit about how headcount at the firm is changing now.\n\nAt the Goldman Sachs financial services conference in early December, she said that operations staff are on track to be 40% to 50% more productive over five years, but stressed that this doesn't translate into mass layoffs, but rather slower net head count growth, as each employee can handle far more work through automation, digital assistants, and self-service tools.\n\nJeremy Barnum, the firm's CFO, said they're \"asking people to resist head count growth where possible and increase their focus on efficiency.\"\n\nWhile a more efficient future with an equal number of working and non-working weekdays may exist in the coming decades, according to Dimon, for now, hiring may slow.\n\nDavid Solomon's most definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman actually came from a memo he released earlier this year alongside the firm's president, John Waldron, and CFO Denis Coleman.\n\nThe memo, announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS, explains that AI will drive efficiency at the firm. Driving efficiency will mean slowing hiring and reducing roles at the firm, which is no stranger to job cuts, with a yearly culling of some employees.\n\n\"We're asking people to resist head count growth where possible and increase their focus on efficiency,\" the memo said. This will be part of a broader initiative to find the \"right team structure\" and to gain \"more agility.\"\n\nWhen Business Insider obtained the memo and reported on it, a spokesperson for the bank told us that the firm anticipates an increased head count at the end of 2025, and in the third quarter of 2025, it announced it had grown its global workforce 5% to about 48,000 positions.\n\nSlowing hiring and increasing head count don't need to be contradictory; instead, the firm is focusing its hiring on the right talent.\n\n\"We need more high-value people,\" Solomon told Axios in October. \"We can afford more high-value people to expand our footprint and continue to grow and broaden our business.\"\n\nSolomon continues to believe that AI will grow the firm's head count over the next 10 years.\n\n\"There are obviously things where we're going to have a lot fewer people — but I'd love to have the capacity to go get more people to spend time with clients,\" Solomon said at a conference last month, noting that AI will have its most immediate impact on software development.\n\nSpeaking more generally earlier this month, he said that \"disruption\" will happen, but \"our economy is very nimble, very flexible.\"\n\n\"And when you look at the technology that has flooded over hundreds of years into our society, we adapt,\" Solomon said. \"We find new businesses. We find new jobs. I don't believe it will be different this time.\"\n\nThe adoption may come quicker than previous changes, like the creation of the internet or the rollout of electricity. And Solomon shares the views of others that professional workers may take the hardest hit.\n\n\"The need for some white-collar office jobs will be diminished, but they'll be picked up in other parts of the economy,\" said Solomon.\n\nBack in 2023, Jane Fraser wrote a LinkedIn post walking through her big picture thoughts about AI at the bank. She, like her peers at the bulge brackets, saw big-time transformation ahead.\n\n\"In the near term, generative AI will drastically improve productivity,\" she wrote. \"Over the long term, it has the potential to revolutionize all functions across our bank and the industry — changing how we write code, onboard clients, service customers, detect fraud, develop market research and strengthen compliance and controls.\"\n\nOn a recent earnings call, Fraser explained how it was already increasing productivity.\n\n\"AI-driven automated code reviews have exceeded 1 million so far this year and are dramatically improving our developers' productivity,\" Fraser said. \"This innovation alone saves considerable time and creates around 100,000 hours of weekly capacity.\"\n\nFraser also highlighted how AI is helping their customer service teams resolve client inquiries faster, their wealth advisors provide more personalized advice, and the firm is launching an agent-based AI pilot to tackle more complex tasks.\n\nWhen she was asked by CNBC this month if productivity increases from AI will lead to layoffs, Fraser said her \"fear\" is that AI might \"pinch\" the job market \"before it pays.\" \n\nBut, with adoption only at 10% globally, she said, it's a long way before adoption is widespread enough to see what it will do for layoffs. Fraser said adoption will need to be closer to 50%. \n\n\"It's not there yet, and we don't know how quickly,\" Fraser said.\n\nWells Fargo has already shrunk its headcount by nearly a quarter since Charles Scharf joined in 2019, and he expects that trend to continue.\n\n\"It's likely we'll have less headcount as we look forward ... we'd like to do much of it through attrition as possible,\" Scharf told Reuters this month.\n\nHe said the lower headcount is an \"outcome\" of the firm's focus on areas where it's \"way too inefficient\" and \"way too bureaucratic.\" From 2018 to June of this year, the firm had a $1.95 trillion asset cap, hindering its ability to grow.\n\nIn the same interview, Scharf called out those who are saying that AI won't reduce jobs.\n\n\"The opportunities that exist in AI are very significant, and anyone who sits here today and says that they don't think they'll have less head count because of AI either doesn't know what they're talking about or is just not being totally honest about it,\" he said.\n\nFollowing up on those comments in early December he clarified that most people do know \" but they're afraid to say it, because no one wants to stand up and say that we should have — we're going to have lower head count in the future. It's a difficult thing to say.\"\n\nHe said that generative AI tools have already made Wells Fargo's engineers 30% to 35% more productive. While the bank hasn't cut coding jobs yet, the technology will eventually allow it to do more with fewer people across various functions, including compliance and legal, as well as call centers and even banking teams.\n\nBank of America has set a new industry standard, with a minimum wage of $25 an hour across the company. And while CEO Brian Moynihan conceded on a September Bloomberg TV interview that generative AI adoption has shrunk the size of some departments, the bank is focusing on training employees to do what LLMs cannot.\n\n\"The key to that is really redeploying people and re-skilling them,\" he said. \"We have to be more mindful about training them along multiple dimensions than we might have been two or three years ago.\"\n\nAt the Goldman financial services conference in earlier this month, Moynihan said the bank is managing flat overall staffing levels by redeploying employees rather than hiring more, with AI playing a central role in absorbing the additional workload. He pointed to Erica, Bank of America's consumer-facing AI assistant, as a clear example of how that is playing out in practice.\n\nHe said in November, the bank had 1.4 billion digital connections with its customers. \"We think it saves, today, about 11,000 FT equivalents,\" he said.",

    "description": "Christina Cassotis went from consulting to the CEO of a major airport. Here's how she got there and what passengers don't see.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Christina Cassotis, CEO of the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which operates Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI never thought of working at an airport ever.\n\nMy dad was a military fighter pilot in the Vietnam War and then got recruited by Pan Am World Airways, so he would be flying to really exciting places around the world while my friend's parents were coming home from dinner every night. My dad was in Dhaka, or Buenos Aires, or Tokyo. So, in a very small New Hampshire town, I had this big view of the world.\n\nI come from a PR background and ended up working at Boston's Logan Airport early in my career for almost five years. Through a project, I met the owner of a consulting company who recruited me, and I spent the next 17 years consulting for airports around the world. In the US, I was very focused on how airports could help attract more airlines and the right airlines, and in Europe, I was really focused on doing due diligence for infrastructure investors.\n\nIn 2014, I got recruited to see if I'd be interested in running Pittsburgh International Airport. I initially said no. I had recently gotten an MBA from MIT, and even though I loved consulting, I really wanted an operational role. And I really wanted a place where I could prove the thesis that you can run a really good public utility like a business.\n\nWhen I took the job, I really didn't come to run the airport. I came to change the industry in the US.\n\nThere are no average days. This job is great for people who are really comfortable with a lot of uncertainty. Things happen every day. We have to operate 24/7, 365. People count on us for that.\n\nI would say 50% of my job is reactive and 50% is proactive. I have meetings with my staff and one-on-ones with my direct reports on a regular basis. We cover what everyone needs to know is happening. The coordination and dependencies are no joke.\n\nDuring the busy holiday travel season, we pay a lot of attention to prepping for winter operations, prepping our snow crews, making sure we have the right amount of chemicals for plowing runways, and taking care of roadways and pedestrian areas.\n\nOn any given day, you could have a security incident, and that changes the tone and tenor of the day. We are prepared for lots of uncertainty, and we train for it, we drill for it, and we have communications ready to go for it.\n\nThere are plans and systems in place so we are ready for every scenario. We have our own fire department on our team. They respond every day to probably three or four incidents that could be lifesaving incidents in the terminal. It's almost like we're a small city. There's an incredible network of individuals who are ready every day for something to go sideways.\n\nThere's a lot that goes on that passengers don't see or notice. In some ways, I think that's a credit to the teams that make it look easy.\n\nWe're running an entire baggage system, and that baggage system has to work. When it breaks down, then our field maintenance crews have to go and put bags on carts and help the airlines move them because the volume is too big.\n\nWe're responsible for plowing the runways and keeping the roadways clear, and making sure that the grass is cut in the spring and summer so that we don't attract wildlife. We have a wildlife administrator, because you can't have wildlife in an airport. We don't want birds. We don't want people feeding stray cats. We have a cybersecurity team.\n\nThe hardest part of my job is honestly people making assumptions because they don't know how the airport operates or what we're getting done every day. I think a common thing that is overlooked is that the airport is actually separate from the airlines. It's its own entity. Airport employees don't get to fly for free.\n\nThere are things we have to fix, but not everything is up to us. We actually don't deliver a lot of the services directed to the passengers. We don't fly the plane. We don't even get to tell the plane where to fly.\n\nA lot of people say, \"Why can't you just get a flight to a specific destination?\" To which I think, \"Do you have 150 friends who want to go every day?\" That's what it's going to take. We actually have to sell our community to the airlines, and so we spend a lot of time evaluating the air transportation market for our community and everybody we compete with to see how we stack up.\n\nI love my job, and I like thinking about my job. Of course, it's stressful, but it's the kind of stress I'm built for. I am very good at managing lots of complexity. I really love understanding stakeholders and what they need and how to communicate with them.\n\nWe're constantly looking for better ways to do things. I care a lot about making sure our staff feels engaged. Airports are fun places to work. And these are the jobs I don't see AI replacing anytime soon.",

    "description": "Over 10,000 travelers have been disrupted by drone sightings near airports in recent months. Russia's hybrid warfare could be testing the limit.",
    "fullText": "It started in Copenhagen. Around 8:30 p.m. on a Monday in late September, a few large drones were spotted flying near the airport.\n\nAll takeoffs and landings were halted for almost four hours. More than 50 flights were diverted, and over 100 more were canceled.\n\nOn the same day, 30 flights were disrupted at Oslo Airport in Norway due to another suspected drone sighting.\n\nIn the past few months, several more European cities have seen nearby drones temporarily shut down their airports. It happened twice within 24 hours in Munich in early October. Over 10,000 people have had their travel plans disrupted.\n\nIn one sense, this is a nuisance for travelers. However, analysts and political leaders say it's an example of Russia's hybrid warfare.\n\nThis strategy involves using plausible deniability to undermine a society and can also include disinformation and cyberattacks.\n\nAs Blaise Metreweli, the chief of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, said in her inaugural speech on December 15: \"The new frontline is everywhere.\"\n\nDrones have also been spotted near air bases, but the impact has been most palpable in Lithuania, the Baltic nation of less than 3 million people, whose eastern border is less than 70 miles as the crow flies from Russia's westernmost edge.\n\nOver the past 10 weeks, the airport in Vilnius, the capital, has been shut down 15 times. And not due to drones, but balloons smuggling crates of cheap cigarettes over the border from Belarus.\n\n\"They are also difficult to detect because they're not big aircraft or drones,\" said Sean Patrick, senior aviation security analyst at Osprey Flight Solutions.\n\n\"It is quite clever exploiting this from the Russian side to use these systems, and they've pushed Lithuania to declare this emergency.\"\n\nThirteen days before the Scandinavia incidents, around 20 Russian drones flew across the border into Poland. The airspace over four Polish airports was closed while NATO forces scrambled jets, shooting down up to four of the drones.\n\nPoland also invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which calls for consultation over an urgent situation — its first usage since the start of the Ukraine War in 2022.\n\nThen, a Russia-linked ship was located off the Danish coast during the Copenhagen incident. The French military later boarded the oil tanker, and the captain, a Chinese national, was charged with one count of refusing to follow instructions from the French navy.\n\n\"A lot of these ships have changed their names quite recently,\" Patrick said. \"They've got new flags. It makes it very hard to follow who's doing what, who's working for who.\"\n\nHowever, at other points, links to Russia have been less clear. Police in Norway closed their investigation into the Oslo incident, saying there wasn't enough evidence that there were actually any drones.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has denied the country's involvement.\n\nIn an analyst report earlier this month, Osprey Flight Solutions said: \"It remains unconfirmed whether any/all of the … incidents are directly linked.\"\n\n\"Osprey assesses that some of the drone sightings are likely to be false identifications — i.e. not drones.\"\n\nIn July 2024, a package exploded in a DHL freight center in Leipzig, Germany. The head of the country's domestic intelligence service said it was \"only a lucky coincidence\" that the delayed package caught fire on the ground, rather than during flight.\n\nSimilar fires occurred at depots in Poland and the UK. Then, this September, Lithuanian prosecutors charged 15 people with terrorism offences, the BBC reported.\n\nThey said the individuals, with links to Russian intelligence, put explosive devices in vibrating massage pillows, which were set off with electronic timers. The parcels were all shipped from Lithuania.\n\nInvestigators have also said they believe these were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada.\n\n\"You can't see Europe going to war with Russia over some balloons in Lithuania,\" Patrick told Business Insider. \"And then it's where do you get to the limit? Does Europe want to find out what the limit is?\"\n\n\"So that's the concern,\" he added. \"If they do blow up a railway or set off an incendiary device on a transatlantic flight, what's the next step? Do people want to find out that next step?\"\n\nThe incidents highlight how Europeans face a new reality since the war in Ukraine began in 2022.\n\nEven Dublin Airport — over 1,500 miles from Kyiv — experienced a drone incident. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had arrived in the Irish capital ahead of schedule earlier this month, before the drones were spotted nearby.\n\nSome European leaders have called for building a drone wall — a system of air defenses in the east of the continent to stop drones launched from Russia.\n\nWhile discussions continue over a peace deal in Ukraine, tensions are likely to remain high.\n\n\"Even if the Ukraine war comes to some sort of hold, ceasefire, peace agreement, I think we can expect Russia to continue these,\" Patrick said. \"They've got a taste for it now.\"",

    "title": "Researchers sound alarm on Chinese EV batteries after studying them in 'real-world practice': 'Extremely high failure rates'",
    "description": "\"They know exactly what they're ordering.\"",
    "fullText": "A European electric vehicle battery repair shop is warning that certain Chinese packs in popular Tesla models do not hold up to the rigors of use.\n\nEV Clinic reported that Model 3 and Y vehicles with LG NCM811 batteries from the LGES Nanjing factory \"show extremely high failure rates.\" It noted that while cells made in China are often touted as \"the best,\" this assertion \"has never been confirmed in real-world practice.\"\n\nIt compared the batteries to American Panasonic NCA packs, which last noticeably longer and even start their lifespans on a better footing. EV Clinic said that most of the LG models it tested had multiple cell failures that were not repairable. This happens at around 250,000 kilometers (155,343 miles) of use. The Panasonic models featured repairable single-cell failures after 400,000 km (248,548 mi).\n\n\"For reference, a healthy Panasonic cell typically shows ~10 megaohms, while a new LG Nanjing cell starts around 28 mΩ. A failing Panasonic cell reaches ~28 mΩ, which is what LG cells measure when brand new,\" EV Clinic stated.\n\nIn a conversation on the social platform X about the news, users wondered whether the \"bad\" batteries were in their EVs and how many makes and models were affected. The part number in question is 17000012-00-B.\n\nThe company added that it had tested more than 40 units across three shops and that because Tesla's first produced pack was such a \"disaster,\" the \"failure rate will be even more present\" over the next two years.\n\nThis is, of course, unwelcome information for people who have EVs with LG batteries. It may also give potential buyers pause, even though EVs save drivers money by eliminating the cost of gas and reducing maintenance requirements. While EVs feature battery warranties, no one wants to go through the hassle of replacing such an important component relatively soon after buying a vehicle.\n\nLG, which is based in South Korea, has a history of similar problems, too. In 2021, it had to pay General Motors $1.9 billion for defective batteries in the Chevrolet Bolt. This year, it recalled half a million stoves, also because of fire risk.\n\nIn its report, the Croatia-based EV Clinic said the best lithium-ion cells are made in the United States and Europe, naming Panasonic, LG Chem, and Samsung SDI. It noted that customers could get a repair check for 1,200 euros ($1,412), while a repair would cost 5,500 euros ($6,473). It recommended swapping in a used Panasonic battery as the optimal solution for a faulty pack, which costs 8,000 euros ($9,415).\n\nOn X, plenty of folks implored the institute for details, with one asking: \"How can you drop a bomb like this and don't explain with extreme precision which cars are concerned (model, version, year and factory)? Every 3/Y long range and perf owners are now worried and don't even know which battery pack they have. Please help us understand.\"\n\nDo you worry about the longevity of EV batteries?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSomeone else pointed out that Chinese batteries bring to mind domestic manufacturers such as CATL and BYD rather than LG. \"BYD Blade battery packs have shown to be superior in Giga Berlin-made Model Ys,\" they wrote.\n\nAnother X user wrote: \"People will blame LG when it's Tesla that deserves the hate. They know exactly what they're ordering. If Apple had failure rates or lower quality like this, they would cut it off nearly immediately.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it disabled a Russian surveillance plane at an airfield before launching its claimed drone strike on a Kilo-class submarine.\n\nThe SBU last week released footage of what it claimed to be a hit on a Kilo-class submarine in the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk using a Sub Sea Baby underwater drone.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the agency published a new video of what it said was an aerial drone strike on an Il-38N anti-submarine aircraft at the Yeysk air base in Russia’s southern Krasnodar Krai region.\n\nThe Il-38N would have be used to wipe out Ukrainian sea drones to protect Russian vessels.\n\nThe SBU said: “This aircraft is designed for maritime reconnaissance, search for submarines, control of water areas, and laying minefields and launching torpedo strikes.\n\n“The disabled aircraft actively interfered with the operation of the SBU’s marine drones.”\n\nThe footage shared by the SBU showed a generic image of an Il-38N in flight before cutting to satellite imagery of the aircraft sitting on the tarmac at Yeysk.\n\nThe video then shows what appears to be the feed from a Ukrainian first-person view drone hovering over a similar-looking aircraft.\n\nThe Telegraph could not independently confirm the SBU’s claimed strikes.\n\nAccording to the SBU, Russia had one operational Il-38N, valued at roughly $24m (£18m). It said the agency’s strike on the anti-submarine plane was crucial to attacking the Russian sub in Novorossiysk.\n\nLast week’s footage showed the Kilo-class 636.3 Varshavyanka being engulfed in an explosion while docked at Russia’s southern naval hub. The SBU said it has been “put out of action”.\n\nKilo-class submarines cost about $400m (£296m). The one said to have been hit last week is likely to have been armed with Kalibr cruise missiles, which Moscow has used in long-range strikes.\n\nThe attack, which was the first of its kind, was seen as important symbolically because it took place at Novorossiysk, a naval hub that has taken on greater strategic importance for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet after it was forced to relocate there.\n\nUkraine had driven the naval fleet from its original home port in Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea with a series of marine drone strikes.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "The NFL post-season may be without Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow, but what went wrong for the star quarterbacks, and who is most likely to bounce back?",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs are out of contention for this season's NFL play-offs and so too are their conference rivals Cincinnati.\n\nI just don't see the Baltimore Ravens getting in either. They need to win their last two games to have a chance, so in terms of quarterbacks, that would be a three-headed monster missing from the AFC - Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes.\n\nAll three having injuries this season is just wild, and Jackson went off with another in Sunday's loss to New England. He's already missed three games and in each of the past six weeks has missed at least one day of practice.\n\nI don't think he's ever fully recovered from the main hamstring injured he had. There was one game where it was like \"hey, he's back. He's moving like the Lamar Jackson that we're used to\".\n\nBut if you look at his other injuries - toe, ankle, knee, and now his back - I feel like he's a bit more fragile at the moment, after all the hits he's taken. He's had injuries adding up over the years, so is his style of play sustainable?\n\nI really hope his Super Bowl window hasn't closed because he's so wonderful to watch.\n\nI just think there needs to be a bit of a shake-up at Baltimore because there were some odd moments in Sunday's game, with the play calling and top players making big mistakes in big moments. At the end of the season, someone's got to take responsibility.\n\nThe two main things they've struggled with is Lamar not being healthy and having zero pass rush. I just don't understand it - defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike went down early in the season, so why you wouldn't find an impact player from a pass-rush perspective?\n\nThe Ravens used to have this attitude. Teams used to be scared of that pass rush, that defensive line, and they've kind of lost that.\n\nIt's the same with the Bengals and Chiefs. Although you keep winning, and that means you don't have high draft picks, you've got to be able to build depth in those moments.\n\nIf you're investing on one side of the ball, you've got to draft on the other side. You've got to find ways to strengthen an already elite team - the team that's done it best is the Philadelphia Eagles and their general manager Howie Roseman.",

Meghan Ellis\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nA raucous debut by indie studio à la mode games, Sorry We’re Closed is a survival horror where the monster is love and the dungeon is a dingy London neighbourhood. Fight demons, fend off unwanted admirers and survive work shifts in this queer, neon homage to 1990s PlayStation-era horror. ME\n\nWeb browser\nThe trick of this daily logic puzzle is that you can’t guess, or make wrong answers. Presented with a grid of characters, you must identify the “innocent” and the “criminal” based on clues revealed with each correct answer. But the game will only accept an answer if it’s sure you know it for a fact. An idealistic vision of a criminal justice system. Duncan Fyfe\n\nSwitch, Playdate, PC\nBlippo+ is a channel surfing simulator that rides the line between video game and absurd cable subscription service. Experienced entirely by trawling through the interface of a virtual TV guide, you can tune into intergalactic music videos, curious cooking shows, and psychic weather reports, learning an alien culture through charming live-action skits that evoke the sketch comedy of Tim and Eric. Sarah Thwaites\n\nSwitch, PC\nA sequel in all but name to Love-de-Lic’s 1997 role-playing game satire Moon, Stray Children is a monster-taming adventure where you whisper away the worries of troubled “Olders” that have come to dominate the inhabitants of an unfinished video game.

It’s an intriguing mix: combined with a heartfelt story full of painful human emotions and some fantastic audio, it’s a tense yet warming tale, guaranteed to coil its way around your heart. Graeme Mason\n\nXbox, PC\nWhile the combat mechanics are familiar, it’s South of Midnight’s evocative backdrop that marks it apart.

Beautiful and engaging, its soundtrack is also wonderful, perfectly complementing the uncanny scenery.

The execution is anything but as you crouch in vents, pull glass from your feet, and deploy sneezing powder and slippery soap bars to incapacitate your foes.

Matthew Castle\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nShakespearean dialogue, bruising boss battles and a tale steeped in class struggle make this a refreshingly different Final Fantasy. As you command a troupe of society’s most downtrodden, excellent voice acting lends this once silent PlayStation 1 game new life. As rewarding to play as it is affecting, in 2025, Yasumi Matsuno’s tale of inequality and division has never felt more relevant.

There are no puzzles and not much in the way of scoring, just you and your ever-developing eye. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nA football game that’s closer to the likes of Rocket League than it is Fifa, Rematch has you feeling as if you’re playing an actual match of five-a-side: developer Sloclap have utterly mastered the sensation and pace of charging up a field and passing between your mates before knocking the ball into the back of the net. Daniella Lucas\n\nPS5, PC\nProof that love and hate can be two sides of the same coin, this ridiculous adventure has you taking control of a grown man in a onesie trying to remember how to walk. You have to separately control each of your legs over a series of obstacles that lead to some absurdly funny moments, but equally has you kneeling in despair as you fall, yet again, off a wooden plank while trying to get a stupid hat. Worth it though. DL\n\nSwitch, PC\nA game all about slowing life down, While Waiting takes mundane situations – from breaking down in your car to waiting for a delayed train – and gives you multiple choices on how to handle them. Due to the way it rewards experimentation, and squeezing the fun out of everyday moments, While Waiting has taught me how to be more patient – and that wasting time by fiddling around with things is the key to a healthy life-balance. Thomas Hobbs\n\nSwitch, PC\nOne for the Halloween-loving girlies and ghoulies, this companion to Strange Horticulture has you dealing in occult objects rather than plants.

Its puzzles are cosy, relaxing and never frustrating. Bex April May\n\nPC\nWhat if your friendly neighbourhood turned into a waking nightmare? That’s the premise of this RPG-style survival horror set in an apartment complex where unspeakable horrors are going on right outside your window – but whatever you do, you mustn’t look at them, or you risk mutating like your poor, revolting neighbours. Best enjoyed with the curtains drawn. BAM\n\nPS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nFrom its tongue-in-cheek writing to its ridiculous creatures, Toby Fox’s episodic role-playing game is charming and witty. Like Undertale before it, Deltarune flips the genre on its head with humour and heart, leaving you itching for more. (The game’s next chapter isn’t until the second half of 2026 at the earliest.) We dare you not to crack a smile at this one. Vic Hood\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nThis psychological horror immediately tells you what to expect: “This is a story about death.” As Sam, you attempt to escape your home, an increasingly twisted labyrinth of puzzles and memories.

    "fullText": "Packers’ Christian Watson provides Jordan Love update while QB can’t talk appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Green Bay Packers are preparing for a high-powered Saturday night matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, but much of the focus this week has centered on quarterback Jordan Love’s availability.\n\nLove remains in the NFL’s concussion protocol following a hard hit in last week’s 22-16 loss to the Chicago Bears, which means he is not allowed to speak publicly. In his absence, teammates have helped fill in the picture of where things stand.\n\nWide receiver Christian Watson offered the clearest update after Wednesday’s practice, sharing optimism about Love’s progress while also acknowledging the uncertainty that comes with the league’s strict return-to-play rules.\n\n“He’s looked really good,” Watson said via The Athletic. “From everything that I’ve talked to him about, he feels like he’s in a good spot. Obviously, he’s gotta clear everything. I think he’s just approaching it like a normal week in terms of how he’s going about everything, and then, obviously, he’ll just let the medical staff take care of the rest..He’s looked like J-Love out there, so, obviously, if he does get the opportunity to play on Saturday, I know he’ll be ready to go.”\n\nLove suffered the injury in the second quarter against Chicago after a helmet-to-helmet collision with Bears defensive end Austin Booker. Although he was able to leave the field under his own power, he did not return and was later placed in concussion protocol, immediately casting doubt on his Week 17 status.\n\nEncouragingly for Green Bay, Love was a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice. During the portion open to reporters, he reportedly appeared to take his normal workload, and completing passes. These observations, combined with Watson’s comments, suggest Love is progressing as expected.\n\nStill, nothing is guaranteed. NFL concussion protocol prohibits media access to players until they are fully cleared, and head coach Matt LaFleur has admitted even he doesn’t have every step of the process memorized. Love must pass a series of evaluations before being allowed back on the field.\n\nFor the Packers, who are chasing a playoff berth, the coming days will be very critical. If Love continues trending upward and earns medical clearance, Green Bay could enter Saturday night with renewed confidence.\n\nIf not, the team will need to adjust quickly — but either way, the situation underscores how much hinges on Love’s health as the postseason push intensifies.",

    "fullText": "Minnesota Timberwolves at Denver Nuggets\nDate: December 25th, 2025\nTime: 9:30 PM CST\nLocation: Ball Arena\nTelevision Coverage: ABC, ESPN\nRadio Coverage: Wolves App, iHeart Radio\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves delivered some early holiday cheer to the Target Center crowd on Tuesday evening, notching their first victory over Karl-Anthony Towns since the legendary fall-2024 trade. Yes, it came against a Knicks team missing Jalen Brunson, OG Anunoby, and half their rotation. And yes, it was a little surreal watching KAT torch his old team for 40 points while Wolves fans were forced to clap politely through clenched teeth. But context aside, the Wolves took care of business, beat a +.500 team, and continued to quietly stack real wins.\n\nIt wasn’t clean, because, let’s face it, it’s never clean with this team. Minnesota built a comfortable lead, then immediately got comfortable. New York ripped off two 10-0 runs as well as a 17-3 run during the course of the game. During the third quarter the game felt like it might slip away… until Anthony Edwards woke up and decided he wasn’t interested in that storyline. Ant matched KAT nearly bucket for bucket, finishing with 38, and then Julius Randle finally arrived in the fourth quarter like the cavalry, pouring in 17 points, including 15 straight Wolves points at one stretch. On a night when Towns was missing his co-star, Minnesota’s own duo, Edwards and Randle, closed the door.\n\nThat win capped off something much bigger: the Wolves have now gone 3-0 in this brutal holiday homestand against the Thunder, Bucks, and Knicks. One game of this Christmas Week gauntlet remains. And it happens to be one of the biggest regular-season games this franchise will play all year.\n\nChristmas Night.\nIn Denver.\nAgainst Nikola Jokic.\n\nMinnesota’s surge has vaulted them into fifth place, leapfrogging Houston, with the Lakers barely ahead. A win in Denver puts the Wolves within half a game of the Nuggets for third in the West, which is a stunning place to be considering the chaos of the first 30 games: Ant’s hamstring injury, multiple blown games, and long stretches where this team looked like it was trying to solve calculus without knowing multiplication.\n\nThe Wolves dominated this matchup last season, pulling off a four-game season sweep. But 2025-26 has flipped the script: Denver has already beaten Minnesota twice at Target Center. If the Wolves want to restore balance, they’ll need to do something they’ve proven they can do — win in Mile High.\n\nWith the entire league watching, the Wolves have a chance to deliver a real contender’s statement.\n\nNikola Jokic is the best player on the planet. There is no stopping him. There is only survival.\n\nMinnesota’s formula remains the same: Rudy Gobert, Naz Reid, and Julius Randle take turns leaning on him, making every touch exhausting, forcing him into facilitator mode, and controlling the glass. Denver added Jonas Valančiūnas, giving them more frontcourt depth than last year, so the Wolves’ size advantage only matters if they use it aggressively. Second-chance points cannot tilt this game.\n\nWear him down. Make him pass. Make the other Nuggets beat you.\n\nWhen Murray ignites, the Nuggets become terrifying. The Wolves have the personnel to prevent that.\n\nIf Jaden McDaniels can go, he’s the first option. If not, Anthony Edwards and Jaylen Clark must shoulder the responsibility. Murray cannot get comfortable. He cannot get clean looks. He cannot start that rhythmic pull-up nonsense that makes Denver impossible to deal with.\n\nSlow Murray, and the math of this game changes immediately.\n\nThe Wolves must play sharp, disciplined basketball: no careless passes, no lazy dribbles into traffic, no self-inflicted wounds that fuel Nuggets runs. Crisp movement, smart decisions, full commitment to winning the possession game.\n\nThis is not the night for sloppiness.\n\nAfter a sluggish stretch, Minnesota’s shooting finally ticked upward against New York. That momentum must continue.\n\nThis only works if the Wolves avoid ISO-ball. Make Denver rotate, use Ant and Randle’s gravity, find Naz, Donte, Jaden, and Conley in rhythm.\n\nThis offense is deadly when it flows.\n\nEdwards and Randle just finished dismantling New York’s defense in crunch time. They must do it again, together. Not forcing shots. Not hunting hero moments. Just relentlessly attacking, creating, and letting the offense breathe.\n\nGiven the plethora of injuries that the Nuggets are dealing with, whichever duo wins this matchup likely wins the game.\n\nThis is the game that transforms a hot streak into a statement.\nThis is the game that tells the West the Wolves are not just back — they are for real.\n\nTime to put on the Grinch costume and ruin Denver’s evening, while giving Timberwolves Nation the gift we’ve all been waiting for.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEvan Mobley sustained a calf injury a couple of weeks ago, but it looks like he is ready to return. Ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers' Christmas Day game against the New York Knicks, Mobley is listed as \"Questionable\", which could mean he might be able to play.\n\nWithout Mobley, the Cavaliers lost to the Charlotte Hornets and lost twice against the Chicago Bulls. While the Cavs got payback against the Hornets and blew out the New Orleans Pelicans, they still need a healthy lineup, which is why Mobley's potential return will be significant.\n\nAfter missing the last five games for the Cavs, Mobley was initially set to miss two to four weeks. Christmas Day will be 13 days since the calf tightness popped up, so Mobley is way ahead of schedule.\n\nWhile he is listed as questionable, many Cavs fans are a bit uneasy with his quick return. Calf injuries have been a problem in recent years in the NBA because they are the injury that could lead to a torn Achilles tendon.\n\nMore: Donovan Mitchell gives credit to Sam Merrill as the Cavaliers offense shines\n\nAcross Mobley's career, he has beaten the typical return-to-play timelines. The Inside Shot's Danny Cunningham noted that Mobley is a fast healer, and this potential return from his calf injury is a good example of this.\n\nThe Cavaliers are playing against the Knicks on Christmas Day, which will be one of the biggest games of the season. Cleveland and New York were the favorites ahead of the season, but only the latter has met expectations.\n\nWith Mobley possibly joining the team on Christmas Day, the Cavaliers could pull off a surprise upset against the second-seeded Knicks. The Cavaliers are sitting in the seventh seed, but they could be a much better team if they start on a huge run by beating the Knicks.\n\nNew report provides insight into Kenny Atkinson's job security with Cavaliers\n\nMost games played on Christmas: Where LeBron James, Kobe Bryant rank on all time list\n\nJalen Williams believes more reps will help solve the Thunder's back-to-back issues\n\nBam Adebayo is going with the flow with his recent slump for the Miami Heat\n\nNick Nurse laments the lack of athletes in the 76ers' shocking loss to the Nets",

McIvor hadn’t played since Oct 14, when he suffered a left shoulder injury. In his return, he completed 12 of 19 pass attempts for 199 passing yards and recorded a rushing touchdown.

    "fullText": "Packers’ Adam Stenavich hits offense with blunt reality check appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Green Bay Packers are on a two-game losing skid, and while their chances to make the NFL playoffs remain favorable, they have some issues to address if they are to make a deep postseason run.\n\nAmong which concerns their offense that hasn’t been up to par of late, especially in one particular area.\n\nPackers offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich touched on that subject while speaking to the media on Wednesday.\n\n“It hasn’t been good enough. Flat out. We’ve been bad,” Stenavich said of Green Bay’s offense in the red zone, via Matt Schneidman of The Athletic.\n\nOver the last two games, the Packers have gone just 1-for-9 on touchdown conversions when inside the opponents’ 20-yard line. In Week 15’s 34-26 road loss to the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, the Packers scored just one touchdown in four trips to the red zone.\n\nFor what it’s worth, they were 6-for-13 on third downs and 1-for-3 on fourth downs in that contest. In the following game, versus the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field in Chicago, Green Bay missed out on all five of its chances to score a touchdown in the red zone.\n\nGranted that the Packers lost quarterback Jordan Love to injury in the first half of the Bears game, the Packers still could have done better offensively.\n\nThe Packers can turn things around in that area this coming Saturday, when they host the Baltimore Ravens at Lambeau Field in Green Bay. However, that could be easier said than done, as the Ravens are sixth-best in the league so far in the 2025 season with a 50.88 percent success rate against touchdown scoring in the red zone.",

    "fullText": "No, not Arnold Schwarzenegger, but the other guy that plays basketball for that team in LA.\n\nThe LA Clippers just came off their best win of the season against the Houston Rockets 128-108. The victory came behind Leonard’s 41 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists and his insane shooting splits of 69/80/100. Despite his performance, much like his character Leonard remains focused on the mission.\n\n“It’s a long season, so anytime we put on this jersey, you go to compete and try to win a basketball game. And that’s what I’m taking priority in. I think everyone else is too. Leonard said after the game.\n\nKAWHI LEONARD TONIGHT:\n\n41 POINTS\n8 REBOUNDS\n5 ASSISTS\n13/23 FG\n4/5 3P\n\n🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/haMQcjRw0b\n\n— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) December 24, 2025\n\nIt has been a rough season for the Clippers who are right now 8-21, and are in the 14th seed in the Western conference, but surprisingly there are quite a few things the Clippers should feel encouraged about.\n\nKawhi Leonard is fully healthy.\n\nThroughout his six year tenure with the Clippers, it seems as if the stigma “when healthy” has followed Leonard even when he's perfectly fine. For the season, Leonard is averaging 26.1 ppg, 6.2 rpg, and 2.0 spg. He is tied for his career high in steals per game, as well as his free throw percentage at 97.8% for the season! However his production exceeds the stat sheet.\n\nMuch of the time Leonard was on the court, he took the initiative to guard Rockets All-Star Forward Kevin Durant. Not an easy task by any means, but Leonard was up for the challenge.\n\n“I mean they got two hall of famer players. Durant said. I think they’ve been playing at an elite level the last few years, so Kawhi and James (Harden) they can win any night. And tonight, they came out and did that.”\n\nThe Rockets did everything they could to try and get Leonard out of rhythm. They switched coverage's, they brought double teams wherever he had the ball, even Rockets Forward Tari Eason tried to get physical with Leonard. It simply wasn’t enough.\n\nKawhi Leonard’s mentality mirrors “The Terminator”\n\nComing into the season, many expected for the Clippers to be a top notch team mainly because of their best player’s presence. However, due to a combination of injuries, minutes restrictions, and strength of schedule it's been a rough 30 game stretch. However, there is a lot to look forward to with the Clippers still much in the playoff hunt, despite their bad record.\n\nFor a long 82 game season, where emotions tend to be up and down surrounding the team it is beneficial to have your best player maintain a level of calmness. The name “The Terminator” for Leonard fits like a glove.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStephen Curry is one of this generation's best players, and that is evident in his influence. Nowadays, the league is filled with teams playing a three-point-centric system because Curry pioneered it in the 2010s.\n\nOf course, the three-point shot has been around for decades at that point, but no one ever utilized it as well as the Golden State Warriors and Curry. Now that he is in his late-30s, many people still appreciate how well Curry is playing, including his NBA peers like Cameron Johnson and Trey Murphy III.\n\nThroughout NBA history, there have been many players who have stood out. The likes of Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Shaquille O'Neal were game-changers. It is not hyperbolic to say that Curry is one of the players who changed the game of basketball.\n\nWith his excellence as a three-point shooter, most young players wanted to be like him. They wanted to be as effective as him as a shooter because that is the optimal way to play and win games.\n\nMore: Steph Curry trade idea sends Warriors legend home to finish his career\n\nAs players who grew up during a time when Curry was breaking out as a superstar, Johnson and Murphy became top players in the high school and college ranks with Curry as an influence. Now that they are veterans in the NBA, they appreciate Curry even more since they have played against him.\n\n\"I think it takes a lot for a coach to allow you to do that, right? You know, it just seems unlikely that he's that special as a shooting talent. I don't think that we'll ever see again. To do it at the level Steph does it to win championships, to consistently do it for 15, 16, 17 years, we'll never see it again,\" Johnson said on The Old Man And The Three with him and Murphy.\n\nCurry continues to be one of the special players in the league today. Many players would want to be as effective as him, but he is still the league's best shooter even when he's in his late 30s. He will retire someday, but he is still playing at an elite level, and other players are still chasing him as the unique superstar.\n\nThis Draymond Green stat is atrocious for Warriors legend\n\nNew Stephen Curry video has Warriors fans convinced he has the worst whistle in the NBA\n\nWarriors linked to stunning Draymond Green trade with division rival\n\nEvan Mobley could make another quick return to the Cavaliers lineup amid calf issue\n\nJalen Williams believes more reps will help solve the Thunder's back-to-back issues",

We joke about it, but he’s started and played a lot of games, seen a lot of football. But I think he’s continued to learn, understand and develop, he’s gotten better each day, and he’s been durable and available. The more that you’re out there, usually the better that you get.”\n\nThe Patriots selected Woodson in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. During his five seasons at California, he played in 46 games. Although Woodson is just a rookie, the experience he gained in many college games can significantly contribute to his development as a player.\n\nIn 15 games this season, Woodson has recorded 74 combined tackles, four tackles for loss and two fumble recoveries.\n\nIf the Patriots want to make a postseason run, Woodson will need to deliver an outstanding performance along with the rest of the secondary to take down some of the best quarterbacks in the AFC.\n\nPatriots Clinching Scenarios For Week 17",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — The four Sioux Falls public high schools are set to compete in the third annual Presidents Bowl basketball classic at the Sanford Pentagon on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nEach day of the event will feature two girls games and two boys games for a total of eight games among crosstown rivals over the two days.\n\n“They know each other really well, so they like to winning against each other so they can have bragging rights – east side, west side, whatever you want to talk about,” Jefferson head coach Tim Reck said. “It’s always fun to see those guys compete, and then afterwards, they’re laughing and joking about the game and things like that. So that’s always fun as well.”\n\nThe action begins each day at 11 a.m. with a new game tipping off every two hours. With the girls games opening the action for each session and the boys following, it creates an opportunity to draw more eye balls to the competition.\n\n“It has, like a really good crowd for us, especially with the girls games,” Washington senior forward Rylan Kennett said. “Like when there’s all the guys games going on two, it brings more people to our game. So it’s kind of nice to be able to play in an atmosphere where we can maybe get more viewers and bring more attention to girls basketball in general.”\n\nOne of the biggest draws for the players is the chance to play at the Pentagon, which is recognized as one of the best venues in the country.\n\n“The court’s very cool,” Lincoln junior guard Brody Schafer said. “It’s like a heritage look. It’s like an old style look. It’s very cool. And then it’s just the atmosphere around it – the smoke, the view board, all that stuff is stuff you don’t always get. So it’s just when you get it, you got to embrace it and take in the moment.\n\n“When they leave high school, they talk about the state tournaments, and they’re fun memories, but this is also one that they talk about as well,” Roosevelt head coach Mitch Begeman said. “They got to play on Heritage Court and in the Sanford Pentagon, and they were treated very, very well. So, I think it’s just a special two days that we get to do this. And we’re very, very appreciative of that.”\n\nThe schedule for the two days is as follows: Lincoln and Roosevelt meet in the first two games of the Presidents Bowl on Dec. 29 with Washington and Jefferson squaring off later in the day. On Dec. 30, Jefferson and Lincoln battle in the early window, and Roosevelt and Washington close out the event.",

    "fullText": "Steve Kerr admits the Warriors are a 'fading dynasty' amidst all the team's struggles originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are one of the most successful teams of the 21st century. They have four championships with Steve Kerr as the head coach and Stephen Curry as the superstar. Of course, they also had Draymond Green and Klay Thompson across all championships, which made them a modern NBA dynasty.\n\nUnfortunately, the Warriors' core has aged, as they are in their mid-to-late 30s now. Kerr admits that the Warriors are not at their best anymore, which is an inevitability, considering Father Time is undefeated.\n\nIn today's NBA, the Warriors are one of the teams that are stuck in limbo. They want to be successful, as seen with the quality of players they have on the roster. Unfortunately, their core might be too old to compete against the younger teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nKerr wants his team to remain competitive, but it might not happen anymore because the Warriors' time has passed. They were once a dynasty that almost every other NBA team feared, but now, they are not seen as a title contender anymore.\n\nMore: Cam Johnson and Trey Murphy believe Steph Curry is the most unique player ever\n\nThis is a new look at the Warriors because many have seen them as a perennial contender for almost a decade. Today, they are eighth in the Western Conference standings with a 15-15 record. This is not what people are used to seeing, which is why Kerr is a bit tentative with his current roster.\n\n\"I feel really good about where our team is on the floor, where we're heading, I see the potential in doing exactly what we did last year, to really go on a run, and give ourselves a chance... Most importantly for me, is that there is beauty in the struggle. We are no longer the '17 Warriors dominating the league, we are a fading dynasty, we know that,\" Kerr said about his team and their chances this season.\n\nHe wants his team to play well, as he believes in his players. However, that might not be enough because the Warriors are not the same team they once were during their dynasty era with Curry, Green, Thompson, and Kevin Durant.\n\nMoving forward, the Warriors will work hard to become a top team again, but it is looking unlikely, considering the core's age and how well the rest of the NBA has improved at beating the Warriors.\n\nJalen Williams believes more reps will help solve the Thunder's back-to-back issues\n\nThis Draymond Green stat is atrocious for Warriors legend\n\nNew Stephen Curry video has Warriors fans convinced he has the worst whistle in the NBA\n\nJames Harden blasted as 'foul baiter' by opposing head coach\n\nKevin Durant reacts to being benched for 4th quarter of Rockets loss",

    "description": "The Reds must add another outfielder this offseason.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Reds' left field situation is up in the air, so they should acquire a new player at that position as a Christmas gift to their fanbase. Unfortunately for the Reds, former NL MVP Cody Bellinger is considered \"a long shot to land in Cincinnati,\" per MLB.com's Mark Sheldon.\n\n\"Corner outfielders on the free-agent market include Cody Bellinger and Ryan O'Hearn, although O'Hearn played more at first base last season. A former National League MVP, Bellinger would seem more of a long shot to land in Cincinnati,\" he wrote. \"Trade Deadline acquisition Miguel Andujar, who finished the season with the Reds while burnishing his reputation for beating up left-handed pitchers, also remains on the market.\"\n\n\"The spot could also be filled by an internal option,\" he continued.\n\nO'Hearn has since signed a two-year deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates, per MLB.com.\n\nAnother high-profile free agent at the position is Kyle Tucker, but he'll be expensive. The 28-year-old has a market value of 10 years, $401.7 million ($40.2 million average annual salary). Plus, teams like the Toronto Blue Jays are interested and have extra incentive to pursue him, via FanSided's Brandon Glick..\n\n“This conversation will really become timely if the Blue Jays sign Kyle Tucker, who would immediately displace [Anthony] Santander in right field,” Glick wrote. “With George Springer taking up all of the at-bats at DH and Daulton Varsho locked into the starting spot in center field, Tucker’s presence would effectively mean that there’s one open spot for all of the aforementioned players.”\n\nHowever, there's a more attainable option on the open market who is also a familiar face.\n\nJesse Winker could be a cost-effective and reliable player to add to the outfield group. The veteran slashed just .226/.309/.400 with one homer and 10 RBI over 26 games for the New York Mets last season, but had a .764 OPS across 145 games in 2024 and an .800-plus OPS each year from 2017-2021 with the Reds. Additionally, he has just a one-year, $5.4 million market value, per Spotrac.\n\nCincinnati drafted Winker No. 49 overall in 2012, and he made his big-league debut in 2017. The club then traded him along with Eugenio Suarez to the Seattle Mariners in March 2022, who then traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers that December. He then signed with the Washington Nationals in February 2024, who traded him to the Mets that July.\n\nWinker could slot in Cincinnati's left field spot next to TJ Friedl in center and Noelvi Marte in right.",

    "description": "The Pittsburgh Penguins may be struggling at the NHL level, but they have two promising goaltending prospects waiting in the wings and dominating the AHL",
    "fullText": "It was yet another successful slate of games last weekend for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton (WBS) Penguins, who can't seem to stop collecting points.\n\nAnd two young Pittsburgh Penguins' goaltending prospects have been leading the way for the WBS Penguins - as well as the AHL as a whole.\n\nYoung netminder Sergei Murashov earned wins on Friday and Sunday, while Joel Blomqvist was the standout in a 3-2 loss to the Hartford Wolf Pack on Saturday, as he stopped 32 of 35 Hartford shots on goal. Murashov and Blomqvist have combined to make a formidable tandem for WBS this season, and their play has elevated an already-talented team.\n\nMurashov, 21, has simply continued to dominate the AHL level. He leads the AHL in both save percentage (.943) and goals-against average (1.55), and he is 10-2-0 with two shutouts. His latest performance on Sunday - a 3-1 win over the Hershey Bears - featured 26 saves on 27 shots, including 14 in the first period alone.\n\nAnd back on Dec. 10, Murashov made 20 saves in the first period en route to a 3-0 shutout victory against the Hartford Wolf Pack.\n\nAs has been mentioned many times before, the 6-foot-2, 185-pound netminder has dominated every level of professional hockey he's played at, and his video game-esque numbers this season are showing that his full-time NHL arrival is not far off. He does have five NHL games under his belt this season, posting a 1-1-2 record with an .897 save percentage and a 2.56 goals-against average.\n\nCrosby Reaches Milestone For Second Consecutive Game The big milestone may have come for <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/pittsburgh-penguins\">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>' captain Sidney Crosby on Sunday against the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/montreal-canadiens\">Montreal Canadiens</a>, when he surpassed Mario Lemieux <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/pittsburgh-penguins/latest-news/breaking-sidney-crosby-breaks-mario-lemieux-s-franchise-record-to-become-penguins-all-time-leader-in-points\">to become the Penguins' all-time leader in points</a>.&nbsp;\n\nAs for Blomqvist? Well, after an injury caused him to miss most of training camp and the first month and a half of the AHL season, he has gotten off to a great start.\n\nIn eight games, he is 5-2-1 with a .935 save percentage and a 1.81 goals-against average. Aside from one start on Nov. 29 - when he allowed four goals on 12 shots - he has only had a save percentage below .930 in a game one time.\n\nThis is impressive stuff from the 23-year-old, who debuted with the Penguins last season to some mixed results. He started off well in his first stint with the NHL club, posting a .903 save percentage across eight appearances, but his second stint didn't go nearly as well. Overall, he had an .885 save percentage and a 3.81 goals-against average.\n\nThe results that the Penguins are getting from these two youngsters in WBS is a very encouraging sign, especially for a team that just traded its No. 1 goaltender to the Edmonton Oilers in Tristan Jarry. The NHL club is giving Stuart Skinner - who the Penguins acquired in that trade - and Arturs Silovs some runway to prove themselves, but with the team in freefall, it stands to reason that at least one of them could have a relatively short leash.\n\nPenguins Prospect Makes Team USA World Junior Team Pittsburgh Penguins prospect Will Horcoff has made the Team USA World Junior team.\n\nSilovs has struggled in recent games, posting an .815 save percentage over his last six appearances. Skinner has an .831 save percentage in three starts with the Penguins so far. In other words, neither has done a particularly stellar job up to this point to suggest that they can become starters at the NHL level.\n\nMurashov has the quickness, athleticism, calmness, and confidence for a pretty high NHL ceiling, and many believe he can be a solution going foward for the Penguins. Blomqvist also has some pedigree, even if he has struggled to stay healthy over the last several years.\n\nAll in all, it will be interesting to see how the Penguins handle their goaltending situation for the rest of the season, especially since the team has only won one game in its last 10 after a remarkable 8-2-2 start to the season in the month of October. Both Murashov and Blomqvist figure to be key parts of the Penguins' future, and the future may just get here a little faster than anyone could have anticipated.\n\nTakeaways: Penguins' Push Comes Up Short, Maple Leafs' Stars Come Up Big After a dramatic 4-3 shootout win against the Montreal Canadiens on Sunday, the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/pittsburgh-penguins\">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> hoped to carry some of that momentum into their final game before the holiday break on Tuesday against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nBookmark THN - Pittsburgh Penguins on your Google News tab to follow the latest Penguins news, roster moves, player features, and more!",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants had a mediocre season in 2025, finishing 81-81. Now, this offseason, they should focus on upgrading their pitching, but there is one place they could upgrade in the field.\n\nThat place is the last outfield slot, as Heliot Ramos and Jung Hoo Lee occupy the other spots. Fansided’s Chris Landers proposes the Giants fill that spot by trading for Chicago White Sox All-Star Luis Robert Jr.\n\nMORE: Guardians predicted to sign $65 million three-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger to upgrade from Kyle Manzardo\n\n“The Giants are an outfielder short right now, with very little reliable depth behind Jung Hoo Lee and Heliot Ramos. That needs to change if this team wants to finally get back to the postseason in year two of Buster Posey's reign, and while a miracle run at Tucker can't be ruled out entirely, history suggests it's not in the cards…A Robert trade (surrounding someone like Landon Roupp or Carson Whisenhunt, maybe?) would shift Lee to right and give San Francisco and perfectly solid starting trio. He'd excel defensively in the spacious confines of Oracle Park, and the offensive question marks don't loom quite as large for a team currently staring at replacement-level options in his stead,” Landers wrote.\n\nRobert slashed .223/.297/.364/.661 with 12 doubles, 14 home runs, and 53 RBI in 110 games played. However, a change in scenery may be the spark he needs to have a bounce-back season.\n\nMORE: Reds predicted to sign $70.5 million three-time All-Star, two-time batting champ as upgrade over Matt McLain\n\nRobert would also be a short-term option. He has a year left on his current contract, with a club option for 2027. If the Giants like what they see, they could sign him to a long-term contract.\n\nIf the Giants don’t want to go for Kyle Tucker, they definitely should consider Robert as a cost-effective option. Hopefully, they decide soon, as Robert is one of the hottest names on the trade market.\n\nProposed Dodgers trade sees L.A. land $50 million All-Star, Gold Glove to complete star outfield trio with Teoscar Hernandez, Andy Pages\n\nProposed Yankees trade sees New York land $50 million All-Star, Gold Glove to be cost-effective replacement for Cody Bellinger\n\nGiants predicted to sign $31 million All-Star, former Cy Young candidate to create 1-2-3 punch with Logan Webb, Robbie Ray",

Hall attempted to appeal the decision after it became clear that the incident could be seen as accidental to some, but the suspension was upheld.\n\nEven though the result of the situation was unfortunate, as it resulted in Dotson suffering a sprained right ankle and having to be carted off the field, it should be looked upon as a wasted appeal, because it does not look as if Hall was intending to injure Dotson purposely.\n\nMore: Seahawks get bad news from NFL on Derick Hall's suspension\n\nSeahawks head coach Mike Macdonald would agree with that statement, and he made it clear how he feels about the suspension being upheld when asked about the situation during a media session on Wednesday.\n\n\"We accept the decision, even if we don't agree with it.

    "description": "Here are players to start and sit in fantasy football from the Washington Commanders and Dallas Cowboys Week 17 matchup.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders will face the Dallas Cowboys at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, in one of three Christmas Day NFL games.\n\nThe Commanders will be without backup quarterback Marcus Mariota, leaving Josh Johnson to start with Jeff Driskel as the backup. Without Mariota, the Commanders' offense becomes one-dimensional and easy to defend.\n\nThis is a game for bragging rights at this point, as both teams have been eliminated from the playoffs. It's a divisional matchup, though, and both teams want the win. Anything can happen in a divisional game, and this one is no exception, which is why there are still players with value in fantasy football leagues.\n\nIf you've made it this far into the fantasy football season, congratulations. If you roster any of the players on either of these teams, here are some players to start and sit in Week 17.\n\nThe Commanders allow the 2nd-most fantasy points to quarterbacks in the entire league. Prescott is a solid quarterback with decent receivers, and he'll be facing a Commanders secondary that is missing some key pieces. Prescott is likely to feast against the Commanders on Christmas Day, making him a must-start in this game.\n\nTreylon Burks has seen an increased number of targets in recent weeks, but he's not reliable enough to have fantasy value against the Cowboys this week. If Marcus Mariota plays, he will target Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel. If Josh Johnson starts, he could target Burks, but they didn't have a lot of success last week. Don't expect much out of Burks in Week 17.\n\nWilliams is currently questionable with a neck injury, and with the playoffs out of reach for the Cowboys, he might not suit up, so keep an eye on that. He did practice in a limited capacity on Tuesday, and if he suits up on Thursday, he will face a Commanders defense that ranks 28th in the league and allows the 4th-most fantasy points to running backs. He is a must-start if he is healthy enough to play.\n\nDespite the Commanders' current reliance on the ground game, McNichols isn't a viable option at running back this week. Chris Rodriguez Jr. and Jacory Croskey-Merritt are the top two running backs for the Commanders, and while McNichols has dual ground and air abilities, he isn't getting the same touches as the other two backs, and he rarely finds the end zone.\n\nThe Cowboys actually allow more points to wide receivers than running backs, but they still allow the 6th-most points to running backs in the NFL. The only way the Commanders' wide receivers have any fantasy value is if Marcus Mariota plays. If he doesn't, the Commanders will rely heavily on the ground game. This means that Wild Bill and Chris Rodriguez Jr. will get plenty of touches. Croskey-Merritt has scored in each of the last two games and could have a big game if the Commanders are forced to keep the ball on the ground.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Week 17 fantasy start/sit vs. Dallas Cowboys",

    "fullText": "HONOLULU (AP) — Backup quarterback Drew Weaver threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Nick Cenacle with 10 seconds left, and Hawaii rallied for a 35-31 victory over California in a thrilling Hawaii Bowl on Wednesday night.\n\nWeaver entered the game after Micah Alejado took a hard hit on the previous play. With the Rainbow Warriors (9-4) in range for a tying field goal, coach Timmy Chang took a shot at the end zone, and Cenacle got between two defensive backs and made the contested catch.\n\nChang, Hawaii’s fourth-year coach who had a record-setting career as the Rainbow Warriors’ quarterback from 2000-04, led his program to its first nine-win season since 2019 — when Nick Rolovich, currently Cal’s interim coach, guided Hawaii to a 10-5 record.\n\nAlejado finished 32 of 46 for 274 yards and three touchdowns, helping Hawaii rally from an early 21-0 deficit. Pofele Ashlock had 14 catches for 123 yards and two TDs for the Rainbow Warriors, who scored 22 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nCal (7-6) pulled ahead 31-28 with 1:57 left on a 1-yard touchdown run by Hawaii-born freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, who finished with 343 yards passing and a touchdown.\n\nAlejado’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Brandon White with 7:19 left gave Hawaii a 28-24 lead. The Rainbow Warriors tied it early in the fourth quarter when Alejado connected with Ashlock for their second TD and then completed a 2-point conversion pass to Cam Barfield.\n\nCal took a 21-0 lead early in the second quarter on Anthony League’s 8-yard TD run.\n\nCal was picked to finish third-to-last in the Atlantic Coast Conference preseason media poll, but finished the season tied for seventh in the ACC. Coach Justin Wilcox was fired last month and will be replaced next season by Oregon defensive coordinator Tosh Lupoi. Sagapolutele has committed to staying with the program in 2026.\n\nHawaii has plenty to build on as it enters Chang’s fifth season. Although leading receiver Jackson Harris announced his intention to transfer and did not play Wednesday, Alejado and Ashlock have said they plan to return.\n\nCal will host UCLA on Sept. 5, 2026.\n\nHawaii will also begin next season in the Bay Area when it visits Stanford on Aug. 29.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nComing into the 2024 NFL draft, all the hype was around QB Caleb Williams out of USC. As is the case with most highly touted prospects, the team that lands them loves them, and the rest can't stand them.\n\nCaleb Williams has been on a tear throughout his 2nd season with Chicago, and over the last few weeks in particular, folks around the league are starting to take notice.\n\nMore: Caleb Williams' OT throw to DJ Moore wasn't just the play of the game; PFF views it as much more.\n\nAmong all those who are jumping on the Caleb Williams train, San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan was one of them.\n\nWhen speaking to the media prior to his team's Week 17 matchup with the Chicago Bears, Shanahan had incredibly high praise for Williams.\n\nThere are a handful of NFL coaches who are known to just understand the QB position at a higher level. Kyle Shanahan is one of those offensive-minded coaches.\n\nHe's consistently gotten the best out of his QBs during his tenure in San Francisco, with his latest project being turning 'Mr Irrelevant' Brock Purdy into a legitimate starting-caliber QB.\n\nWhen he was asked about Caleb Williams leading up to facing off against him on Sunday, Shanahan had nothing but the utmost praise.\n\n49ers HC Kyle Shanahan with very high praise for Bears QB Caleb Williams:\n\n“Caleb is one of the best throwers and athletic quarterbacks I’ve ever seen. He makes some big-time throws. Extremely scary on the perimeter. It makes sense why he’s playing at such a high level.” 👀\n\n🎥:… pic.twitter.com/acO3r6A9P7\n\n— Bearsszn (@bearszn) December 25, 2025\n\nShanahan said, \" Caleb is one of the best throwers and most athletic QBs I've ever seen in terms of his height, weight, and speed. He makes some big-time throws. Extremely scary on the perimeter. He can hold onto the ball for a while — not in a bad way, but by creating stuff, which makes coverages have to hold out forever.\"\n\nHe sees greatness in Williams and rightfully so, as he's looked fantastic over these last few weeks.\n\nWhen the two teams play each other on Sunday, the 49ers will be fighting for their playoff lives. Unfortunately for San Francisco, I'm not sure Kyle Shanahan's kind words will be enough to stop Caleb Williams from putting on another incredible performance.\n\nCaleb Williams' OT throw to DJ Moore wasn't just the play of the game; PFF views it as much more.\n\nCaleb Williams' Iceman' celebration has hidden ASL meaning. Did Williams plan this?\n\nCaleb Williams spreads Christmas cheer while simultaneously rubbing salt in the Packers' wounds\n\nAre the Bears the most clutch team in NFL history? The numbers say yes.",

    "description": "Beyond our wildest dreams? A taste of things to come? Our writers have their say on our 2025/26 campaign so far!",
    "fullText": "It’s been a season like no other in my lifetime — not just a season, actually, but a year that’s gone beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nThe storyline of 2025 for Sunderland has been like no other — and it genuinely could’ve been the script of a movie. The way we’ve won big games would’ve been perfect for a Netflix series but alas, they didn’t have the foresight to stick around for the real glory years on Wearside.\n\nI didn’t think we’d struggle this season, but I didn’t think we’d be sixth at Christmas either. Nobody could’ve expected us to have achieved what we’ve achieved, so it’s a credit to everyone at the club for managing to get as far as we have, but the hard work hasn’t ended yet and if anything, the season is only really just starting.\n\nI heard Alan Pardew on the radio last week talking about how as a player and manager, you don’t really take notice of the table until after Christmas, as it’s at about that point where you can see what you’re capable of achieving and what it’s going to take to get there.\n\nWe’re sixth, but we can’t take that for granted or rest on our laurels.\n\nWe’ve got to be proactive in the transfer market; we’ve got to make sure that our squad is ready to challenge for a top eight finish, and then who knows what might happen — we could be sitting here at the end of the season having qualified for Europe for the first time in over fifty years, which would be the cherry on top of what is already a delicious-looking cake.\n\nOur festive fixtures are really tough.\n\nLeeds are in great form and are a better team than people will probably give them credit for, and then we’ve got Manchester City who are the best side we’ve faced this season and are probably going to win the league.\n\nIf we can get through those with some positive results, the belief that we can achieve something great this season will only grow — and that would be perfect as we look to start our charge towards FA Cup glory.\n\nDepending on one’s age of course, for many fans this will be one of the most satisfying and happy Christmases from a Sunderland point of view for a very long time — and in my own mind, only the Peter Reid days can challenge it\n\nIt’s easy to get greedy and want more but I think the vast majority of supporters will be overjoyed at our position and performances this calendar year as a whole.\n\nI’m usually a positive person and I always knew the good times would return — I just didn’t know when. The arrival of Kyril Louis-Dreyfus was the spark that made me start believing the good times were on the horizon again, and although we achieved a long-awaited promotion back to the top flight, I didn’t expect us to perform so well this season.\n\nWhat a lift and what a boost to all fans and to the region! Our long term history has always been that of a top club, but our recent history of fixtures against Cheltenham, Accrington, Shrewsbury really does hit home — not only how aboutbdark those days were, but how far we’ve come.\n\nI’d hope we can continue on this trajectory by beating Leeds to reach thirty points by the new year, and then push on for Europe. Some might think this would be too soon but just like teams scrapping to get out of the Championship, you can’t choose when an opportunity may arise that puts your club in a favourable position.\n\nEuropean fixtures would require a deeper and bigger squad to cope with the rigours of midweek games, but I have every faith in our backroom staff and management. I think I would be a tad disappointed if we didn’t get a top eight spot this season, and an announcement about a ground capacity extension before the end of 2026.\n\nWell, that’s what I’ve written to Father Christmas for, anyway!\n\nReflecting on the first half of the season, it has to be classed as a massive achievement and way beyond the expectations and even the dreams of many.\n\nSixth at Christmas is nothing short of incredible for a side who finished the previous Championship season as we did, and came up via the playoffs. Absolutely amazing — and superlatives are nowhere near enough.\n\nIf we’d been asked what we hoped for when we lifted the playoff trophy at Wembley, I doubt anyone would’ve asked for a top six Premier League berth by Christmas, and those who did would’ve been laughed at vigorously by red and white pals almost as much as by the black and white ones.\n\nThat Tommy Watson goal went in only seven months ago. The progress since then has been incredible, and hats off to the owners and all the club employees working around them for getting us to this point.\n\nThe thing that stands out for me is the pre-planning and then execution of the strategy, and the size of the balls of the club’s owners to go for it as they have.\n\nIt’s like chalk and cheese compared to the sad recent past; these people are serious operators who want our club to succeed and are not here to make a quick buck.\n\nNobody would’ve guessed we would spend £155 million on fourteen players or that we’d replace the core of the team that got us up with such high-quality footballers, retaining the select few that clearly had enough to make it already.\n\nEven if some fans did hope for that, could they expect the club to bring in such amazing bargains who clicked with the club as they have — players who “get what we’re about” and gel as solidly as they have? I don’t think anyone expected how this has panned out at all, and it’s bloody marvellous.\n\nGone are the days of the payday piss-takers. These lads would dive on a live grenade to stop a goal for Sunderland and how they’ve established this atmosphere, camaraderie, team spirit and collective positive attitude is way beyond me.\n\nDuring the coming weeks, we need to stay grounded, gathering all the points we can despite the temporary impact on the starting eleven from AFCON and using this as a spell where we look at wider squad options and allow fringe players to prove they can play at this level and compete with those who’ve usurped them since August.\n\nIt’s a time for understanding if we lose a couple of games; a time to be literally fans come what may, and to avoid any poor results distracting us from where we are.\n\nBefore all of that, we can tuck into our turkey and trimmings with a big fat smile on our faces. As a fan base, we deserve that after all the crap we’ve been through.\n\nNobody deserves that right more than my Sunderland AFC family.",

    "fullText": "Shedeur Sanders speaks on how his rookie season has went originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor the Cleveland Browns, this season has felt different from the others, not in terms of team success; they are still among the league's bottom with a 3-12 record, but there is a different vibe around the team.\n\nA significant reason for that has been the drama surrounding the team at the quarterback position, and that all started at last April's NFL draft, where the top draft prospect, Shedeur Sanders was not drafted until the fifth round by the Browns and the team also went on to draft Heisman finalist, Dillion Gabriel as well to add to a QB room that already had veteran Joe Flacco and former first round pick, Kenny Pickett.\n\nWith that many signal callers on the roster, Sanders started out getting the short end of the stick, being listed as QB4 on the depth chart. Since then, the quarterback has climbed his way up and been the starter for the team since Week 12, and when discussing his journey thus far, Sanders had this to say.\n\nMORE: Trade Myles Garrett? Media calling for Browns to deal star\n\n\"I'm super appreciative that everything happened how it happened...If I were to look back from the Ravens game to now, I would say I improved in experience,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders also later acknowledged that the way things went for him allowed him to learn more about the way of life.\n\nSanders' responses truly show how well he handles adversity, which should be a welcoming sight for Browns fans.\n\nHowever, the season is not over just yet for Sanders and the Browns, as they will host the Pittsburgh Steelers for their last home game of the season in Week 16, then close out the 2025 season on the road against Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nBrowns' Carson Schwesinger voted best defensive rookie by panel of NFL execs\n\nBrowns make final decision on Deshaun Watson for 2025 season\n\nBrowns get devastating injury news on rookie RB Quinshon Judkins\n\nBrowns tabbed as top HC opening if they part ways with Kevin Stefanski\n\nDeion Sanders pushes back on false Shedeur Sanders narrative\n\nBrowns' mock draft predicted to keep explosive Buckeye star in Ohio",

    "description": "Len Duns stole the show in this Christmas friendly at Roker Park",
    "fullText": "The breakout of war in the early 1940s ultimately put a halt to any competitive football in England at this time. This meant that regional leagues and friendlies were the only games in which any club in the country could participate, with the funds raised from these friendly games going towards the war effort.\n\nFor the 1940-41 season, Bill Murray’s team opted against playing any regional games with other teams in the area like they had done the season before, because heavy travel restrictions had meant that people could only travel within a five-mile radius of their home. This clearly would have put a huge limit on the amount of people that could attend in such dangerous circumstances.\n\nGenerally, football had taken a back seat with much more pressing matters on the minds of the entire population, and according to the fantastic Sunderland AFC: The Absolute Record book, Bill Murray was also focusing more on organising fitness drills for troops stationed in Durham rather than the football club.\n\nOn this day, the team did play a friendly match against the Sunderland Police at Roker Park, and it certainly didn’t disappoint as Sunderland outside-right Len Duns played a starring role in an 11-5 victory. Duns scored four goals and created many of the rest in an entertaining friendly match that was akin to a rugby union scoreline.\n\nWith many footballers enrolling with the police force as part of their duty during wartime, the police outfit had a reasonably decent team on show; however, just before kick-off their goalkeeper cried off, with outside-right Frank Coulthard having to go in goal.\n\nCoulthard’s presence in goal made it easier for the Sunderland side and led to the huge scoreline that they put up for the game.\n\nIn another interesting point from this game, Oxford University captain James McFarlane made a guest appearance for the home side as he was home for the holidays visiting his family.\n\nIn what was an incredibly entertaining game, it is safe to say that any spectators that turned up for the game certainly got value for their money.",

    "description": "Merry Christmas, Lads and Lasses - let’s hope that 2026 gives us as much as 2025 did.",
    "fullText": "A very merry Christmas to one and all. A yuletide fact for everyone: did you know Santa’s outfit is red and white because he’s a massive Lads fan?\n\nThere may be truth in that; there may not. But if he has a Sky Sports package (or IPTV for those of you on the naughty list – the elves disapprove) he surely will have had a front-row seat up there in Lapland to a calendar year that, even for Sunderland AFC, you could describe as unfettered carnage.\n\nThis time, however, it’s not because we’ve just borne witness to 12 months strewn with the bodies of defeats, failed objectives, board protests, managerial sackings, and fan unrest. Not to say this was the case then, but if 2024 was very much Sunderland pulling itself from the slurry that was Michael Beale’s tenure, 2025 was a real – as the Americans might say – banner year. The last 12 months have been a vintage of Romanée-Conti Pinot Noir proportions, which I’m reliably informed by Google AI retails for a healthy five-figure sum.\n\nTalking of alcohol, rumour has it in Sunderland there is a new drinking game taking the city’s drinking establishments by storm. It’s called “If you’d said a year ago” in which all the participants must each begin by saying the phrase and then coming up with an iconic SAFC moment from 2025. The last person to fail to name one has to drink.\n\nApparently it’s the longest drinking game in the world.\n\nThe list is endless: the play-off win, the Tommy Watson 95th-minute winner, the Dan Ballard goal, riding high in the Premier League, beating the Visitors, the awesome tifos, breaking the Coventry hoodoo, winning at ’Boro, being a place and a couple of points behind Liverpool… at Christmas. Winning in the last minute at Stamford Bridge, swatting aside West Ham on the opening day, coming back from two down at home for the first time in 40-odd years in the top flight, signing Granit Xhaka, breaking our transfer record many times over…\n\nYou can feel the huge sense of pride in the city, which football aside is very clearly a place on the up. And that is hugely satisfying.\n\nOf course at Christmas there is the annual tradition of naming the turkey. Last year Régis cooked up an absolute storm in the Bendelow household. But who gets the title this year? Some may say it’s a one-bird contest with Sunderland’s man-of-steel Granit Xhaka, who turned up at the Stadium of Light in July basted and pre-stuffed and giblets removed. However, I’m tempted to give it to someone who has had a year which could only arguably be better in 2026 if he won the World Cup with Northern Ireland: Dan Ballard.\n\nI’m told Wearside’s favourite talisman has had to start bringing a bag-for-life to matches because he’s run out of pockets to put all of the division’s leading attackers in. He’s a man of such dependability and substance you’d think that Newton’s third law was based on one of his tackles. The man would head a tank trap away if you asked him to. Would you like any more metaphors? No? Well, all I’ll say is rumour has it there’s a Hollywood blockbuster in the works about Big Dan Ballard. Still, if that doesn’t happen he can content himself with having my turkey named after him.\n\nThe message this year is, though, one of pride. About, as Régis would probably say, connection. Good connection. We’re talking full fibre. Because the connection between the club, the fans, and the city has arguably never been stronger. Both figuratively and physically, as we saw in October with the opening of the new Keel Crossing – something which has been an absolute revelation.\n\nWho knows what the future will hold, but what has transpired over the last few months has resulted in a club transformed. The hierarchy has hacked its way through arguably two seasons’ worth of redevelopment in one short summer, and the results have been remarkable. What might this mean for the rest of the campaign? Who knows, but it should hopefully ensure a bright future.\n\nAnd doesn’t it feel good – life – when your football team is doing well? I’m trying to bottle this feeling, but also appreciate it now – because these are the good days.\n\nI must end with a couple of lines on a Sunderland legend: Gary Rowell. He wasn’t someone who jetted in from elsewhere, without being able to differentiate his pink slices from his Lambton Worms. No, a local lad who lived the dream so many thousands of us would wish for. Put simply, if you were to design your football career and the moments that defined it, you would create in your mind the one Gary had with this club – his club.\n\nHe was a man whose achievements and legend transcend generations of Sunderland fans, his greatest hits being passed down from old to young. But what a hit – that hat-trick – of Bohemian Rhapsody proportions. And that, in essence, is football fandom. He contributed an immense amount to the legend of this football club, and it is without doubt that many of us will be raising a glass to Lord Rowell of Seaham when the big day arrives. If anyone deserves it, he does, because we all owe him thanks many times over. What a legacy to leave.\n\nHave a fantastic Christmas all you Sunderland fans – and all the best for 2026.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have quite the dilemma on their hands with regards to the future of midfield general Casemiro.\n\nAfter a difficult time initially under Ruben Amorim, the Brazilian has fought back to win over the head coach and is currently one of the first names on the team sheet.\n\nHowever, he is 33, and that shows on the pitch with the former Real Madrid superstar completing 90 minutes only three times this season.\n\nHis contract ends next summer, but the club have the option of triggering a one-year extension clause included in his deal.\n\nBut since the Brazil international is the highest-paid player in the squad, INEOS have no intention of paying the same wages.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\nWhile Amorim prefers to keep the five-time Champions League winner, the co-owners remain keen on reducing the wage bill.\n\nHence, new contract talks have involved a massive wage reduction. Multiple clubs are ready to offer him a much larger pay packet, including long-term admirers in the Saudi Pro League.\n\nHowever, a move across the Atlantic to the MLS seems to be the likeliest next destination, with three clubs eager to recruit a leader like Casemiro.\n\nTeamtalk have named New York City FC, Austin FC, and Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami as potential options.\n\n“Multiple MLS clubs are actively working to lure the midfielder stateside, viewing him as a marquee signing capable of elevating the league’s profile further.\n\n“Sources highlight interest from sides like New York City FC, Austin FC, and Inter Miami, who see Casemiro’s winning mentality as ideal for mentoring emerging talent in a less physically demanding environment.\n\n“The appeal of life in the US, combined with competitive salaries under Designated Player rules, makes MLS the “most likely” next step if United’s proposal falls short of his expectations.”\n\nWhether the defensive midfielder will agree to United’s proposal at this stage of his career or choose to move to pastures new will be interesting to see.\n\nFeature image Julian Finney via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Chelsea captain Reece James has enjoyed a year that felt like a fresh chapter, given his frustrating record with recurring injuries.\n\nAfter taking time to recover and reset earlier in the year, James has worked his way back to full fitness and is operating at a level that has restored his status as one of the best players in the world.\n\nThe 26-year-old has been one of the most consistent players in the Chelsea squad this year and has put in world-class shifts in key games, notably against Arsenal and Newcastle United.\n\nJames’ bounce back from injury has been one for the history books, reminding everyone of his quality and shutting down comparisons that hardly do justice to his brilliance.\n\nHe has adapted seamlessly to his midfield transition while being able to slot back into his more natural right-back role without any drop in quality.\n\nJames’ availability has helped Chelsea in the ongoing top-four race, and he’s gearing up to hit a personal milestone when the Blues take on the high-flying Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge this weekend.\n\nBarring any unforeseen setback, the England international will make his 50th appearance of the calendar year against Unai Emery’s troops.\n\nIt will be the first time since 2021 that he has managed to accumulate such a consistent run of games.\n\nJames marked his return to Premier League action with a last-gasp free-kick against Bournemouth in January and hasn’t looked back since.\n\nAfter featuring in 28 of Chelsea’s 35 games in all competitions in the second half of last season, he has played in all but one Premier League fixture this term.\n\nHe has notched two goals and three assists while creating five big chances in the league, and his consistency helped him cross the 200-game milestone for Chelsea back in October.\n\n“It’s a dream for me to play 200 games for the club I’ve supported since I was a little boy,” James said (via Chelsea’s official website). “Hopefully, I can continue to get many more.”",

    "fullText": "On-loan Barcelona forward Marcus Rashford has made it clear that he wants to make his move to Spotify Camp Nou permanent at the end of the season.\n\nThis isn’t the first time the Manchester United loanee has been vocal about his long-term future, although Barcelona are still weighing their options.\n\nRashford has described a permanent move to Barcelona as his “ultimate goal” after a strong start to life in Spain.\n\nThe 28-year-old joined Barcelona last summer after falling out with Ruben Amorim and slipping down the pecking order at Old Trafford.\n\nRashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, but his summer move to Barcelona is proving to be a shrewd decision.\n\nThe England international has racked up seven goals and 11 assists in 24 games for Barcelona.\n\nHe has only managed two goals in 17 La Liga games, although he has only been named in the starting line-up 11 times.\n\nNevertheless, his tally could be significantly higher if he hadn’t spurned seven big chances so far.\n\nWhile his goalscoring tally in the league may be uninspiring, Rashford has made up for it by unlocking his creative abilities.\n\nHe has chipped in with eight assists in La Liga, creating four big chances while averaging 1.6 key passes per 90 minutes.\n\nRashford’s role at Barcelona has reduced since Raphinha returned from injury, but he has managed to win over the fans by adding fresh goal threat to the club’s star-studded attacking line-up.\n\nRashford has always made it clear that Barcelona is his dream destination, and that hasn’t changed.\n\nThe winger, who has previously been hailed as a “fantastic” player by manager Hansi Flick, has once again been clear about his desire to remain at Barcelona.\n\n“What I want is to stay at Barca,” Rashford said during an interview with SPORT.\n\n“It’s the ultimate goal, but it’s not the reason I’m training hard and giving my all. The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.”\n\nRashford’s loan move to Barcelona includes an optional purchase clause worth £26 million. It remains to be seen if the Blaugranas are willing to keep him beyond this summer.",

reviewing drafts.\n\nJoin us on Discord if you want to discuss the guide or CLI design.\n\nIn the 1980s, if you wanted a personal computer to do something for you, you needed to know what to type when confronted with C:\\> or ~$.\nHelp came in the form of thick, spiral-bound manuals.\nError messages were opaque.\nThere was no Stack Overflow to save you.\nBut if you were lucky enough to have internet access, you could get help from Usenet—an early internet community filled with other people who were just as frustrated as you were.\nThey could either help you solve your problem, or at least provide some moral support and camaraderie.\n\nForty years later, computers have become so much more accessible to everyone, often at the expense of low-level end user control.\nOn many devices, there is no command-line access at all, in part because it goes against the corporate interests of walled gardens and app stores.\n\nMost people today don’t know what the command line is, much less why they would want to bother with it.\nAs computing pioneer Alan Kay said in a 2017 interview, “Because people don’t understand what computing is about, they think they have it in the iPhone, and that illusion is as bad as the illusion that ‘Guitar Hero’ is the same as a real guitar.”\n\nKay’s “real guitar” isn’t the CLI—not exactly.\nHe was talking about ways of programming computers that offer the power of the CLI and that transcend writing software in text files.\nThere is a belief among Kay’s disciples that we need to break out of a text-based local maximum that we’ve been living in for decades.\n\nIt’s exciting to imagine a future where we program computers very differently.\nEven today, spreadsheets are by far the most popular programming language, and the no-code movement is taking off quickly as it attempts to replace some of the intense demand for talented programmers.\n\nYet with its creaky, decades-old constraints and inexplicable quirks, the command line is still the most versatile corner of the computer.\nIt lets you pull back the curtain, see what’s really going on, and creatively interact with the machine at a level of sophistication and depth that GUIs cannot afford.\nIt’s available on almost any laptop, for anyone who wants to learn it.\nIt can be used interactively, or it can be automated.\nAnd, it doesn’t change as fast as other parts of the system.\nThere is creative value in its stability.\n\nSo, while we still have it, we should try to maximize its utility and accessibility.\n\nA lot has changed about how we program computers since those early days.\nThe command line of the past was machine-first: little more than a REPL on top of a scripting platform.\nBut as general-purpose interpreted languages have flourished, the role of the shell script has shrunk.\nToday’s command line is human-first: a text-based UI that affords access to all kinds of tools, systems and platforms.\nIn the past, the editor was inside the terminal—today, the terminal is just as often a feature of the editor.\nAnd there’s been a proliferation of git-like multi-tool commands.\nCommands within commands, and high-level commands that perform entire workflows rather than atomic functions.\n\nInspired by traditional UNIX philosophy, driven by an interest in encouraging a more delightful and accessible CLI environment, and guided by our experiences as programmers, we decided it was time to revisit the best practices and design principles for building command-line programs.\n\nThis document covers both high-level design philosophy, and concrete guidelines.\nIt’s heavier on the guidelines because our philosophy as practitioners is not to philosophize too much.\nWe believe in learning by example, so we’ve provided plenty of those.\n\nThis guide doesn’t cover full-screen terminal programs like emacs and vim.\nFull-screen programs are niche projects—very few of us will ever be in the position to design one.\n\nThis guide is also agnostic about programming languages and tooling in general.\n\nThese are what we consider to be the fundamental principles of good CLI design.\n\nTraditionally, UNIX commands were written under the assumption they were going to be used primarily by other programs.\nThey had \n\nToday, even though many CLI programs are used primarily (or even exclusively) by humans, a lot of their interaction design still carries the baggage of the past.\nIt’s time to shed some of this baggage: if a command is going to be used primarily by humans, it should be designed for humans first.\n\nA core tenet of the original UNIX philosophy is the idea that small, simple programs with clean interfaces can be combined to build larger systems.\nRather than stuff more and more features into those programs, you make programs that are modular enough to be recombined as needed.\n\nIn the old days, pipes and shell scripts played a crucial role in the process of composing programs together.\nTheir role might have diminished with the rise of general-purpose interpreted languages, but they certainly haven’t gone away.\nWhat’s more, large-scale automation—in the form of CI/CD, orchestration and configuration management—has flourished.\nMaking programs composable is just as important as ever.\n\nFortunately, the long-established conventions of the UNIX environment, designed for this exact purpose, still help us today.\nStandard in/out/err, signals, exit codes and other mechanisms ensure that different programs click together nicely.\nPlain, line-based text is easy to pipe between commands.\nJSON, a much more recent invention, affords us more structure when we need it, and lets us more easily integrate command-line tools with the web.\n\nWhatever software you’re building, you can be absolutely certain that people will use it in ways you didn’t anticipate.\nYour software will become a part in a larger system—your only choice is over whether it will be a well-behaved part.\n\nMost importantly, designing for composability does not need to be at odds with designing for humans first.\nMuch of the advice in this document is about how to achieve both.\n\nThe terminal’s conventions are hardwired into our fingers.\nWe had to pay an upfront cost by learning about command line syntax, flags, environment variables and so on, but it pays off in long-term efficiency… as long as programs are consistent.\n\nWhere possible, a CLI should follow patterns that already exist.\nThat’s what makes CLIs intuitive and guessable; that’s what makes users efficient.\n\nThat being said, sometimes consistency conflicts with ease of use.\nFor example, many long-established UNIX commands don’t output much information by default, which can cause confusion or worry for people less familiar with the command line.\n\nWhen following convention would compromise a program’s usability, it might be time to break with it—but such a decision should be made with care.\n\nThe terminal is a world of pure information.\nYou could make an argument that information is the interface—and that, just like with any interface, there’s often too much or too little of it.\n\nA command is saying too little when it hangs for several minutes and the user starts to wonder if it’s broken.\nA command is saying too much when it dumps pages and pages of debugging output, drowning what’s truly important in an ocean of loose detritus.\nThe end result is the same: a lack of clarity, leaving the user confused and irritated.\n\nIt can be very difficult to get this balance right, but it’s absolutely crucial if software is to empower and serve its users.\n\nWhen it comes to making functionality discoverable, GUIs have the upper hand.\nEverything you can do is laid out in front of you on the screen, so you can find what you need without having to learn anything, and perhaps even discover things you didn’t know were possible.\n\nIt is assumed that command-line interfaces are the opposite of this—that you have to remember how to do everything.\nThe original Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines, published in 1987, recommend “See-and-point (instead of remember-and-type),” as if you could only choose one or the other.\n\nThese things needn’t be mutually exclusive.\nThe efficiency of using the command-line comes from remembering commands, but there’s no reason the commands can’t help you learn and remember.\n\nDiscoverable CLIs have comprehensive help texts, provide lots of examples, suggest what command to run next, suggest what to do when there is an error.\nThere are lots of ideas that can be stolen from GUIs to make CLIs easier to learn and use, even for power users.\n\nCitation: The Design of Everyday Things (Don Norman), Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines\n\nGUI design, particularly in its early days, made heavy use of metaphor: desktops, files, folders, recycle bins.\nIt made a lot of sense, because computers were still trying to bootstrap themselves into legitimacy.\nThe ease of implementation of metaphors was one of the huge advantages GUIs wielded over CLIs.\nIronically, though, the CLI has embodied an accidental metaphor all along: it’s a conversation.\n\nBeyond the most utterly simple commands, running a program usually involves more than one invocation.\nUsually, this is because it’s hard to get it right the first time: the user types a command, gets an error, changes the command, gets a different error, and so on, until it works.\nThis mode of learning through repeated failure is like a conversation the user is having with the program.\n\nTrial-and-error isn’t the only type of conversational interaction, though.\nThere are others:\n\nAcknowledging the conversational nature of command-line interaction means you can bring relevant techniques to bear on its design.\nYou can suggest possible corrections when user input is invalid, you can make the intermediate state clear when the user is going through a multi-step process, you can confirm for them that everything looks good before they do something scary.\n\nThe user is conversing with your software, whether you intended it or not.\nAt worst, it’s a hostile conversation which makes them feel stupid and resentful.\nAt best, it’s a pleasant exchange that speeds them on their way with newfound knowledge and a feeling of achievement.\n\nFurther reading: The Anti-Mac User Interface (Don Gentner and Jakob Nielsen)\n\nRobustness is both an objective and a subjective property.\nSoftware should be robust, of course: unexpected input should be handled gracefully, operations should be idempotent where possible, and so on.\nBut it should also feel robust.\n\nYou want your software to feel like it isn’t going to fall apart.\nYou want it to feel immediate and responsive, as if it were a big mechanical machine, not a flimsy plastic “soft switch.”\n\nSubjective robustness requires attention to detail and thinking hard about what can go wrong.\nIt’s lots of little things: keeping the user informed about what’s happening, explaining what common errors mean, not printing scary-looking stack traces.\n\nAs a general rule, robustness can also come from keeping it simple.\nLots of special cases and complex code tend to make a program fragile.\n\nCommand-line tools are a programmer’s creative toolkit, so they should be enjoyable to use.\nThis doesn’t mean turning them into a video game, or using lots of emoji (though there’s nothing inherently wrong with emoji 😉).\nIt means giving the user the feeling that you are on their side, that you want them to succeed, that you have thought carefully about their problems and how to solve them.\n\nThere’s no list of actions you can take that will ensure they feel this way, although we hope that following our advice will take you some of the way there.\nDelighting the user means exceeding their expectations at every turn, and that starts with empathy.\n\nThe world of the terminal is a mess.\nInconsistencies are everywhere, slowing us down and making us second-guess ourselves.\n\nYet it’s undeniable that this chaos has been a source of power.\nThe terminal, like the UNIX-descended computing environment in general, places very few constraints on what you can build.\nIn that space, all manner of invention has bloomed.\n\nIt’s ironic that this document implores you to follow existing patterns, right alongside advice that contradicts decades of command-line tradition.\nWe’re just as guilty of breaking the rules as anyone.\n\nThe time might come when you, too, have to break the rules.\nDo so with intention and clarity of purpose.\n\n“Abandon a standard when it is demonstrably harmful to productivity or user satisfaction.” — Jef Raskin, The Humane Interface\n\nThis is a collection of specific things you can do to make your command-line program better.\n\nThe first section contains the essential things you need to follow.\nGet these wrong, and your program will be either hard to use or a bad CLI citizen.\n\nThe rest are nice-to-haves.\nIf you have the time and energy to add these things, your program will be a lot better than the average program.\n\nThe idea is that, if you don’t want to think too hard about the design of your program, you don’t have to: just follow these rules and your program will probably be good.\nOn the other hand, if you’ve thought about it and determined that a rule is wrong for your program, that’s fine.\n(There’s no central authority that will reject your program for not following arbitrary rules.)\n\nAlso—these rules aren’t written in stone.\nIf you disagree with a general rule for good reason, we hope you’ll propose a change.\n\nThere are a few basic rules you need to follow.\nGet these wrong, and your program will be either very hard to use, or flat-out broken.\n\nUse a command-line argument parsing library where you can.\nEither your language’s built-in one, or a good third-party one.\nThey will normally handle arguments, flag parsing, help text, and even spelling suggestions in a sensible way.\n\nReturn zero exit code on success, non-zero on failure.\nExit codes are how scripts determine whether a program succeeded or failed, so you should report this correctly.\nMap the non-zero exit codes to the most important failure modes.\n\nSend output to stdout.\nThe primary output for your command should go to stdout.\nAnything that is machine readable should also go to stdout—this is where piping sends things by default.\n\nSend messaging to stderr.\nLog messages, errors, and so on should all be sent to stderr.\nThis means that when commands are piped together, these messages are displayed to the user and not fed into the next command.\n\nDisplay extensive help text when asked.\nDisplay help when passed -h or --help flags.\nThis also applies to subcommands which might have their own help text.\n\nDisplay concise help text by default.\nWhen myapp or myapp subcommand requires arguments to function,\nand is run with no arguments,\ndisplay concise help text.\n\nYou can ignore this guideline\nif your program is interactive by default (e.g. npm init).\n\nThe concise help text should only include:\n\njq does this well.\nWhen you type jq, it displays an introductory description and an example, then prompts you to pass jq --help for the full listing of flags:\n\nShow full help when -h and --help is passed.\nAll of these should show help:\n\nIgnore any other flags and arguments that are passed—you should be able to add -h to the end of anything and it should show help.\nDon’t overload -h.\n\nIf your program is git-like, the following should also offer help:\n\nProvide a support path for feedback and issues.\nA website or GitHub link in the top-level help text is common.\n\nIn help text, link to the web version of the documentation.\nIf you have a specific page or anchor for a subcommand, link directly to that.\nThis is particularly useful if there is more detailed documentation on the web, or further reading that might explain the behavior of something.\n\nLead with examples.\nUsers tend to use examples over other forms of documentation, so show them first in the help page, particularly the common complex uses.\nIf it helps explain what it’s doing and it isn’t too long, show the actual output too.\n\nYou can tell a story with a series of examples, building your way toward complex uses.\n\nIf you’ve got loads of examples, put them somewhere else, in a cheat sheet command or a web page.\nIt’s useful to have exhaustive, advanced examples, but you don’t want to make your help text really long.\n\nFor more complex use cases, e.g. when integrating with another tool, it might be appropriate to write a fully-fledged tutorial.\n\nDisplay the most common flags and commands at the start of the help text.\nIt’s fine to have lots of flags, but if you’ve got some really common ones, display them first.\nFor example, the Git command displays the commands for getting started and the most commonly used subcommands first:\n\nUse formatting in your help text.\nBold headings make it much easier to scan.\nBut, try to do it in a terminal-independent way so that your users aren’t staring down a wall of escape characters.\n\nNote: When heroku apps --help is piped through a pager, the command emits no escape characters.\n\nIf the user did something wrong and you can guess what they meant, suggest it.\nFor example, brew update jq tells you that you should run brew upgrade jq.\n\nYou can ask if they want to run the suggested command, but don’t force it on them.\nFor example:\n\nRather than suggesting the corrected syntax, you might be tempted to just run it for them, as if they’d typed it right in the first place.\nSometimes this is the right thing to do, but not always.\n\nFirstly, invalid input doesn’t necessarily imply a simple typo—it can often mean the user has made a logical mistake, or misused a shell variable.\nAssuming what they meant can be dangerous, especially if the resulting action modifies state.\n\nSecondly, be aware that if you change what the user typed, they won’t learn the correct syntax.\nIn effect, you’re ruling that the way they typed it is valid and correct, and you’re committing to supporting that indefinitely.\nBe intentional in making that decision, and document both syntaxes.\n\nFurther reading: “Do What I Mean”\n\nIf your command is expecting to have something piped to it and stdin is an interactive terminal, display help immediately and quit.\nThis means it doesn’t just hang, like cat.\nAlternatively, you could print a log message to stderr.\n\nThe purpose of help text is to give a brief, immediate sense of what your tool is, what options are available, and how to perform the most common tasks.\nDocumentation, on the other hand, is where you go into full detail.\nIt’s where people go to understand what your tool is for, what it isn’t for, how it works and how to do everything they might need to do.\n\nProvide web-based documentation.\nPeople need to be able to search online for your tool’s documentation, and to link other people to specific parts.\nThe web is the most inclusive documentation format available.\n\nProvide terminal-based documentation.\nDocumentation in the terminal has several nice properties: it’s fast to access, it stays in sync with the specific installed version of the tool, and it works without an internet connection.\n\nConsider providing man pages.\nman pages, Unix’s original system of documentation, are still in use today, and many users will reflexively check man mycmd as a first step when trying to learn about your tool.\nTo make them easier to generate, you can use a tool like ronn (which can also generate your web docs).\n\nHowever, not everyone knows about man, and it doesn’t run on all platforms, so you should also make sure your terminal docs are accessible via your tool itself.\nFor example, git and npm make their man pages accessible via the help subcommand, so npm help ls is equivalent to man npm-ls.\n\nHuman-readable output is paramount.\nHumans come first, machines second.\nThe most simple and straightforward heuristic for whether a particular output stream (stdout or stderr) is being read by a human is whether or not it’s a TTY.\nWhatever language you’re using, it will have a utility or library for doing this (e.g. Python, Node, Go).\n\nFurther reading on what a TTY is.\n\nHave machine-readable output where it does not impact usability.\nStreams of text is the universal interface in UNIX.\nPrograms typically output lines of text, and programs typically expect lines of text as input,\ntherefore you can compose multiple programs together.\nThis is normally done to make it possible to write scripts,\nbut it can also help the usability for humans using programs.\nFor example, a user should be able to pipe output to grep and it should do what they expect.\n\n“Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.”\n— Doug McIlroy\n\nIf human-readable output breaks machine-readable output, use --plain to display output in plain, tabular text format for integration with tools like grep or awk.\nIn some cases, you might need to output information in a different way to make it human-readable.\n\nFor example, if you are displaying a line-based table, you might choose to split a cell into multiple lines, fitting in more information while keeping it within the width of the screen.\nThis breaks the expected behavior of there being one piece of data per line, so you should provide a --plain flag for scripts, which disables all such manipulation and outputs one record per line.\n\nDisplay output as formatted JSON if --json is passed.\nJSON allows for more structure than plain text, so it makes it much easier to output and handle complex data structures.\njq is a common tool for working with JSON on the command-line, and there is now a whole ecosystem of tools that output and manipulate JSON.\n\nIt is also widely used on the web, so by using JSON as the input and output of programs, you can pipe directly to and from web services using curl.\n\nDisplay output on success, but keep it brief.\nTraditionally, when nothing is wrong, UNIX commands display no output to the user.\nThis makes sense when they’re being used in scripts, but can make commands appear to be hanging or broken when used by humans.\nFor example, cp will not print anything, even if it takes a long time.\n\nIt’s rare that printing nothing at all is the best default behavior, but it’s usually best to err on the side of less.\n\nFor instances where you do want no output (for example, when used in shell scripts), to avoid clumsy redirection of stderr to /dev/null, you can provide a -q option to suppress all non-essential output.\n\nIf you change state, tell the user.\nWhen a command changes the state of a system, it’s especially valuable to explain what has just happened, so the user can model the state of the system in their head—particularly if the result doesn’t directly map to what the user requested.\n\nFor example, git push tells you exactly what it is doing, and what the new state of the remote branch is:\n\nMake it easy to see the current state of the system.\nIf your program does a lot of complex state changes and it is not immediately visible in the filesystem, make sure you make this easy to view.\n\nFor example, git status tells you as much information as possible about the current state of your Git repository, and some hints at how to modify the state:\n\nSuggest commands the user should run.\nWhen several commands form a workflow, suggesting to the user commands they can run next helps them learn how to use your program and discover new functionality.\nFor example, in the git status output above, it suggests commands you can run to modify the state you are viewing.\n\nActions crossing the boundary of the program’s internal world should usually be explicit.\nThis includes things like:\n\nIncrease information density—with ASCII art!\nFor example, ls shows permissions in a scannable way.\nWhen you first see it, you can ignore most of the information.\nThen, as you learn how it works, you pick out more patterns over time.\n\nUse color with intention.\nFor example, you might want to highlight some text so the user notices it, or use red to indicate an error.\nDon’t overuse it—if everything is a different color, then the color means nothing and only makes it harder to read.\n\nDisable color if your program is not in a terminal or the user requested it.\nThese things should disable colors:\n\nFurther reading: no-color.org, 12 Factor CLI Apps\n\nIf stdout is not an interactive terminal, don’t display any animations.\nThis will stop progress bars turning into Christmas trees in CI log output.\n\nUse symbols and emoji where it makes things clearer.\nPictures can be better than words if you need to make several things distinct, catch the user’s attention, or just add a bit of character.\nBe careful, though—it can be easy to overdo it and make your program look cluttered or feel like a toy.\n\nFor example, yubikey-agent uses emoji to add structure to the output so it isn’t just a wall of text, and a ❌ to draw your attention to an important piece of information:\n\nIf a piece of output serves only to help you (the developer) understand what your software is doing, it almost certainly shouldn’t be displayed to normal users by default—only in verbose mode.\n\nInvite usability feedback from outsiders and people who are new to your project.\nThey’ll help you see important issues that you are too close to the code to notice.\n\nDon’t treat stderr like a log file, at least not by default.\nDon’t print log level labels (ERR, WARN, etc.) or extraneous contextual information, unless in verbose mode.\n\nUse a pager (e.g. less) if you are outputting a lot of text.\nFor example, git diff does this by default.\nUsing a pager can be error-prone, so be careful with your implementation such that you don’t make the experience worse for the user.\nUse a pager only if stdin or stdout is an interactive terminal.\n\nA good sensible set of options to use for less is less -FIRX.\nThis does not page if the content fills one screen, ignores case when you search, enables color and formatting, and leaves the contents on the screen when less quits.\n\nThere might be libraries in your language that are more robust than piping to less.\nFor example, pypager in Python.\n\nOne of the most common reasons to consult documentation is to fix errors.\nIf you can make errors into documentation, then this will save the user loads of time.\n\nCatch errors and rewrite them for humans.\nIf you’re expecting an error to happen, catch it and rewrite the error message to be useful.\nThink of it like a conversation, where the user has done something wrong and the program is guiding them in the right direction.\nExample: “Can’t write to file.txt. You might need to make it writable by running ‘chmod +w file.txt’.”\n\nSignal-to-noise ratio is crucial.\nThe more irrelevant output you produce, the longer it’s going to take the user to figure out what they did wrong.\nIf your program produces multiple errors of the same type, consider grouping them under a single explanatory header instead of printing many similar-looking lines.\n\nConsider where the user will look first.\nPut the most important information at the end of the output.\nThe eye will be drawn to red text, so use it intentionally and sparingly.\n\nIf there is an unexpected or unexplainable error, provide debug and traceback information, and instructions on how to submit a bug.\nThat said, don’t forget about the signal-to-noise ratio: you don’t want to overwhelm the user with information they don’t understand.\nConsider writing the debug log to a file instead of printing it to the terminal.\n\nMake it effortless to submit bug reports.\nOne nice thing you can do is provide a URL and have it pre-populate as much information as possible.\n\nFurther reading: Google: Writing Helpful Error Messages, Nielsen Norman Group: Error-Message Guidelines\n\nPrefer flags to args.\nIt’s a bit more typing, but it makes it much clearer what is going on.\nIt also makes it easier to make changes to how you accept input in the future.\nSometimes when using args, it’s impossible to add new input without breaking existing behavior or creating ambiguity.\n\nHave full-length versions of all flags.\nFor example, have both -h and --help.\nHaving the full version is useful in scripts where you want to be verbose and descriptive, and you don’t have to look up the meaning of flags everywhere.\n\nCitation: GNU Coding Standards.\n\nOnly use one-letter flags for commonly used flags, particularly at the top-level when using subcommands.\nThat way you don’t “pollute” your namespace of short flags, forcing you to use convoluted letters and cases for flags you add in the future.\n\nMultiple arguments are fine for simple actions against multiple files.\nFor example, rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt.\nThis also makes it work with globbing: rm *.txt.\n\nIf you’ve got two or more arguments for different things, you’re probably doing something wrong.\nThe exception is a common, primary action, where the brevity is worth memorizing.\nFor example, cp <source> <destination>.\n\nUse standard names for flags, if there is a standard.\nIf another commonly used command uses a flag name, it’s best to follow that existing pattern.\nThat way, a user doesn’t have to remember two different options (and which command it applies to), and users can even guess an option without having to look at the help text.\n\nHere’s a list of commonly used options:\n\nMake the default the right thing for most users.\nMaking things configurable is good, but most users are not going to find the right flag and remember to use it all the time (or alias it).\nIf it’s not the default, you’re making the experience worse for most of your users.\n\nFor example, ls has terse default output to optimize for scripts and other historical reasons, but if it were designed today, it would probably default to ls -lhF.\n\nPrompt for user input.\nIf a user doesn’t pass an argument or flag, prompt for it.\n(See also: Interactivity)\n\nNever require a prompt.\nAlways provide a way of passing input with flags or arguments.\nIf stdin is not an interactive terminal, skip prompting and just require those flags/args.\n\nConfirm before doing anything dangerous.\nA common convention is to prompt for the user to type y or yes if running interactively, or requiring them to pass -f or --force otherwise.\n\n“Dangerous” is a subjective term, and there are differing levels of danger:\n\nConsider whether there are non-obvious ways to accidentally destroy things.\nFor example, imagine a situation where changing a number in a configuration file from 10 to 1 means that 9 things will be implicitly deleted—this should be considered a severe risk, and should be difficult to do by accident.\n\nIf input or output is a file, support - to read from stdin or write to stdout.\nThis lets the output of another command be the input of your command and vice versa, without using a temporary file.\nFor example, tar can extract files from stdin:\n\nIf a flag can accept an optional value, allow a special word like “none”.\nFor example, ssh -F takes an optional filename of an alternative ssh_config file, and ssh -F none runs SSH with no config file. Don’t just use a blank value—this can make it ambiguous whether arguments are flag values or arguments.\n\nIf possible, make arguments, flags and subcommands order-independent.\nA lot of CLIs, especially those with subcommands, have unspoken rules on where you can put various arguments.\nFor example a command might have a --foo flag that only works if you put it before the subcommand:\n\nThis can be very confusing for the user—especially given that one of the most common things users do when trying to get a command to work is to hit the up arrow to get the last invocation, stick another option on the end, and run it again.\nIf possible, try to make both forms equivalent, although you might run up against the limitations of your argument parser.\n\nDo not read secrets directly from flags.\nWhen a command accepts a secret, e.g. via a --password flag,\nthe flag value will leak the secret into ps output and potentially shell history.\nAnd, this sort of flag encourages the use of insecure environment variables for secrets.\n(Environment variables are insecure because they can often be read by other users, their values end up in debug logs, etc.)\n\nConsider accepting sensitive data only via files, e.g. with a --password-file flag, or via stdin.\nA --password-file flag allows a secret to be passed in discreetly, in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n(It’s possible to pass a file’s contents into a flag in Bash by using --password $(< password.txt).\nThis approach has the same security problems mentioned above.\nIt’s best avoided.)\n\nOnly use prompts or interactive elements if stdin is an interactive terminal (a TTY).\nThis is a pretty reliable way to tell whether you’re piping data into a command or whether it’s being run in a script, in which case a prompt won’t work and you should throw an error telling the user what flag to pass.\n\nIf --no-input is passed, don’t prompt or do anything interactive.\nThis allows users an explicit way to disable all prompts in commands.\nIf the command requires input, fail and tell the user how to pass the information as a flag.\n\nIf you’re prompting for a password, don’t print it as the user types.\nThis is done by turning off echo in the terminal.\nYour language should have helpers for this.\n\nLet the user escape.\nMake it clear how to get out.\n(Don’t do what vim does.)\nIf your program hangs on network I/O etc, always make Ctrl-C still work.\nIf it’s a wrapper around program execution where Ctrl-C can’t quit (SSH, tmux, telnet, etc), make it clear how to do that.\nFor example, SSH allows escape sequences with the ~ escape character.\n\nIf you’ve got a tool that’s sufficiently complex, you can reduce its complexity by making a set of subcommands.\nIf you have several tools that are very closely related, you can make them easier to use and discover by combining them into a single command (for example, RCS vs. Git).\n\nThey’re useful for sharing stuff—global flags, help text, configuration, storage mechanisms.\n\nBe consistent across subcommands.\nUse the same flag names for the same things, have similar output formatting, etc.\n\nUse consistent names for multiple levels of subcommand.\nIf a complex piece of software has lots of objects and operations that can be performed on those objects, it is a common pattern to use two levels of subcommand for this, where one is a noun and one is a verb.\nFor example, docker container create.\nBe consistent with the verbs you use across different types of objects.\n\nEither noun verb or verb noun ordering works, but noun verb seems to be more common.\n\nFurther reading: User experience, CLIs, and breaking the world, by John Starich.\n\nDon’t have ambiguous or similarly-named commands.\nFor example, having two subcommands called “update” and “upgrade” is quite confusing.\nYou might want to use different words, or disambiguate with extra words.\n\nValidate user input.\nEverywhere your program accepts data from the user, it will eventually be given bad data.\nCheck early and bail out before anything bad happens, and make the errors understandable.\n\nResponsive is more important than fast.\nPrint something to the user in <100ms.\nIf you’re making a network request, print something before you do it so it doesn’t hang and look broken.\n\nShow progress if something takes a long time.\nIf your program displays no output for a while, it will look broken.\nA good spinner or progress indicator can make a program appear to be faster than it is.\n\nUbuntu 20.04 has a nice progress bar that sticks to the bottom of the terminal.\n\nIf the progress bar gets stuck in one place for a long time, the user won’t know if stuff is still happening or if the program’s crashed.\nIt’s good to show estimated time remaining, or even just have an animated component, to reassure them that you’re still working on it.\n\nThere are many good libraries for generating progress bars.\nFor example, tqdm for Python, schollz/progressbar for Go, and node-progress for Node.js.\n\nDo stuff in parallel where you can, but be thoughtful about it.\nIt’s already difficult to report progress in the shell; doing it for parallel processes is ten times harder.\nMake sure it’s robust, and that the output isn’t confusingly interleaved.\nIf you can use a library, do so—this is code you don’t want to write yourself.\nLibraries like tqdm for Python and schollz/progressbar for Go support multiple progress bars natively.\n\nThe upside is that it can be a huge usability gain.\nFor example, docker pull’s multiple progress bars offer crucial insight into what’s going on.\n\nOne thing to be aware of: hiding logs behind progress bars when things go well makes it much easier for the user to understand what’s going on, but if there is an error, make sure you print out the logs.\nOtherwise, it will be very hard to debug.\n\nMake things time out.\nAllow network timeouts to be configured, and have a reasonable default so it doesn’t hang forever.\n\nMake it recoverable.\nIf the program fails for some transient reason (e.g. the internet connection went down), you should be able to hit <up> and <enter> and it should pick up from where it left off.\n\nMake it crash-only.\nThis is the next step up from idempotence.\nIf you can avoid needing to do any cleanup after operations, or you can defer that cleanup to the next run, your program can exit immediately on failure or interruption.\nThis makes it both more robust and more responsive.\n\nCitation: Crash-only software: More than meets the eye.\n\nPeople are going to misuse your program.\nBe prepared for that.\nThey will wrap it in scripts, use it on bad internet connections, run many instances of it at once, and use it in environments you haven’t tested in, with quirks you didn’t anticipate.\n(Did you know macOS filesystems are case-insensitive but also case-preserving?)\n\nIn software of any kind, it’s crucial that interfaces don’t change without a lengthy and well-documented deprecation process.\nSubcommands, arguments, flags, configuration files, environment variables: these are all interfaces, and you’re committing to keeping them working.\n(Semantic versioning can only excuse so much change; if you’re putting out a major version bump every month, it’s meaningless.)\n\nKeep changes additive where you can.\nRather than modify the behavior of a flag in a backwards-incompatible way, maybe you can add a new flag—as long as it doesn’t bloat the interface too much.\n(See also: Prefer flags to args.)\n\nWarn before you make a non-additive change.\nEventually, you’ll find that you can’t avoid breaking an interface.\nBefore you do, forewarn your users in the program itself: when they pass the flag you’re looking to deprecate, tell them it’s going to change soon.\nMake sure there’s a way they can modify their usage today to make it future-proof, and tell them how to do it.\n\nIf possible, you should detect when they’ve changed their usage and not show the warning any more: now they won’t notice a thing when you finally roll out the change.\n\nChanging output for humans is usually OK.\nThe only way to make an interface easy to use is to iterate on it, and if the output is considered an interface, then you can’t iterate on it.\nEncourage your users to use --plain or --json in scripts to keep output stable (see Output).\n\nDon’t have a catch-all subcommand.\nIf you have a subcommand that’s likely to be the most-used one, you might be tempted to let people omit it entirely for brevity’s sake.\nFor example, say you have a run command that wraps an arbitrary shell command:\n\nYou could make it so that if the first argument to mycmd isn’t the name of an existing subcommand, you assume the user means run, so they can just type this:\n\nThis has a serious drawback, though: now you can never add a subcommand named echo—or anything at all—without risking breaking existing usages.\nIf there’s a script out there that uses mycmd echo, it will do something entirely different after that user upgrades to the new version of your tool.\n\nDon’t allow arbitrary abbreviations of subcommands.\nFor example, say your command has an install subcommand.\nWhen you added it, you wanted to save users some typing, so you allowed them to type any non-ambiguous prefix, like mycmd ins, or even just mycmd i, and have it be an alias for mycmd install.\nNow you’re stuck: you can’t add any more commands beginning with i, because there are scripts out there that assume i means install.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with aliases—saving on typing is good—but they should be explicit and remain stable.\n\nDon’t create a “time bomb.”\nImagine it’s 20 years from now.\nWill your command still run the same as it does today, or will it stop working because some external dependency on the internet has changed or is no longer maintained?\nThe server most likely to not exist in 20 years is the one that you are maintaining right now.\n(But don’t build in a blocking call to Google Analytics either.)\n\nIf a user hits Ctrl-C (the INT signal), exit as soon as possible.\nSay something immediately, before you start clean-up.\nAdd a timeout to any clean-up code so it can’t hang forever.\n\nIf a user hits Ctrl-C during clean-up operations that might take a long time, skip them.\nTell the user what will happen when they hit Ctrl-C again, in case it is a destructive action.\n\nFor example, when quitting Docker Compose, you can hit Ctrl-C a second time to force your containers to stop immediately instead of shutting them down gracefully.\n\nYour program should expect to be started in a situation where clean-up has not been run.\n(See Crash-only software: More than meets the eye.)\n\nCommand-line tools have lots of different types of configuration, and lots of different ways to supply it (flags, environment variables, project-level config files).\nThe best way to supply each piece of configuration depends on a few factors, chief among them specificity, stability and complexity.\n\nConfiguration generally falls into a few categories:\n\nLikely to vary from one invocation of the command to the next.\n\nRecommendation: Use flags.\nEnvironment variables may or may not be useful as well.\n\nGenerally stable from one invocation to the next, but not always.\nMight vary between projects.\nDefinitely varies between different users working on the same project.\n\nThis type of configuration is often specific to an individual computer.\n\nRecommendation: Use flags and probably environment variables too.\nUsers may want to set the variables in their shell profile so they apply globally, or in .env for a particular project.\n\nIf this configuration is sufficiently complex, it may warrant a configuration file of its own, but environment variables are usually good enough.\n\nStable within a project, for all users.\n\nThis is the type of configuration that belongs in version control.\nFiles like Makefile, package.json and docker-compose.yml are all examples of this.\n\nRecommendation: Use a command-specific, version-controlled file.\n\nFollow the XDG-spec.\nIn 2010 the X Desktop Group, now freedesktop.org, developed a specification for the location of base directories where config files may be located.\nOne goal was to limit the proliferation of dotfiles in a user’s home directory by supporting a general-purpose ~/.config folder.\nThe XDG Base Directory Specification (full spec, summary) is supported by yarn, fish, wireshark, emacs, neovim, tmux, and many other projects you know and love.\n\nIf you automatically modify configuration that is not your program’s, ask the user for consent and tell them exactly what you’re doing.\nPrefer creating a new config file (e.g. /etc/cron.d/myapp) rather than appending to an existing config file (e.g. /etc/crontab).\nIf you have to append or modify to a system-wide config file, use a dated comment in that file to delineate your additions.\n\nApply configuration parameters in order of precedence.\nHere is the precedence for config parameters, from highest to lowest:\n\nEnvironment variables are for behavior that varies with the context in which a command is run.\nThe “environment” of an environment variable is the terminal session—the context in which the command is running.\nSo, an env var might change each time a command runs, or between terminal sessions on one machine, or between instantiations of one project across several machines.\n\nEnvironment variables may duplicate the functionality of flags or configuration parameters, or they may be distinct from those things.\nSee Configuration for a breakdown of common types of configuration and recommendations on when environment variables are most appropriate.\n\nFor maximum portability, environment variable names must only contain uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (and mustn’t start with a number).\nWhich means O_O and OWO are the only emoticons that are also valid environment variable names.\n\nAim for single-line environment variable values.\nWhile multi-line values are possible, they create usability issues with the env command.\n\nAvoid commandeering widely used names.\nHere’s a list of POSIX standard env vars.\n\nCheck general-purpose environment variables for configuration values when possible:\n\nRead environment variables from .env where appropriate.\nIf a command defines environment variables that are unlikely to change as long as the user is working in a particular directory,\nthen it should also read them from a local .env file so users can configure it differently for different projects without having to specify them every time.\nMany languages have libraries for reading .env files (Rust, Node, Ruby).\n\nDon’t use .env as a substitute for a proper configuration file.\n.env files have a lot of limitations:\n\nIf it seems like these limitations will hamper usability or security, then a dedicated config file might be more appropriate.\n\nDo not read secrets from environment variables.\nWhile environment variables may be convenient for storing secrets, they have proven too prone to leakage:\n\nSecrets should only be accepted via credential files, pipes, AF_UNIX sockets, secret management services, or another IPC mechanism.\n\n“Note the obsessive use of abbreviations and avoidance of capital letters; [Unix] is a system invented by people to whom repetitive stress disorder is what black lung is to miners.\nLong names get worn down to three-letter nubbins, like stones smoothed by a river.”\n— Neal Stephenson, In the Beginning was the Command Line\n\nThe name of your program is particularly important on the CLI: your users will be typing it all the time, and it needs to be easy to remember and type.\n\nMake it a simple, memorable word.\nBut not too generic, or you’ll step on the toes of other commands and confuse users.\nFor example, both ImageMagick and Windows used the command convert.\n\nUse only lowercase letters, and dashes if you really need to.\ncurl is a good name, DownloadURL is not.\n\nKeep it short.\nUsers will be typing it all the time.\nDon’t make it too short: the very shortest commands are best reserved for the common utilities used all the time, such as cd, ls, ps.\n\nMake it easy to type.\nIf you expect people to type your command name all day, make it easy on their hands.\n\nA real-world example: long before Docker Compose was docker compose, it was plum.\nThis turned out to be such an awkward, one-handed hopscotch that it was immediately renamed to fig, which – as well as being shorter – flows much more easily.\n\nFurther reading: The Poetics of CLI Command Names\n\nIf possible, distribute as a single binary.\nIf your language doesn’t compile to binary executables as standard, see if it has something like PyInstaller.\nIf you really can’t distribute as a single binary, use the platform’s native package installer so you aren’t scattering things on disk that can’t easily be removed.\nTread lightly on the user’s computer.\n\nIf you’re making a language-specific tool, such as a code linter, then this rule doesn’t apply—it’s safe to assume the user has an interpreter for that language installed on their computer.\n\nMake it easy to uninstall.\nIf it needs instructions, put them at the bottom of the install instructions—one of the most common times people want to uninstall software is right after installing it.\n\nUsage metrics can be helpful to understand how users are using your program, how to make it better, and where to focus effort.\nBut, unlike websites, users of the command-line expect to be in control of their environment, and it is surprising when programs do things in the background without telling them.\n\nDo not phone home usage or crash data without consent.\nUsers will find out, and they will be angry.\nBe very explicit about what you collect, why you collect it, how anonymous it is and how you go about anonymizing it, and how long you retain it for.\n\nIdeally, ask users whether they want to contribute data (“opt-in”).\nIf you choose to do it by default (“opt-out”), then clearly tell users about it on your website or first run, and make it easy to disable.\n\nExamples of projects that collect usage statistics:\n\nConsider alternatives to collecting analytics.\n\nFurther reading: Open Source Metrics",

    "description": "Learn why AI agents hallucinate, the real costs of ignoring this problem, and how to automatically detect and prevent hallucinations in production using advanced evaluation scorers and root cause analysis.",
    "fullText": "Your new AI customer service agent just confidently told a user that your product is compatible with a competitor's—when it isn't. Your research agent just cited a non-existent academic paper in its summary. Your internal knowledge base agent just invented a company policy that doesn't exist.\n\nThese are not just bugs; they are AI hallucinations. And they are one of the most dangerous and insidious problems facing production AI agents today. They erode user trust, create compliance risks, and can cause direct financial damage.\n\nThis article explains why agents hallucinate and how you can automatically detect and prevent it before your customers do.\n\nAn AI hallucination occurs when a large language model (LLM) generates information that is plausible but factually incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical in the given context. It's not a bug in the traditional sense—the model is functioning as designed, but its internal patterns have led it to an incorrect conclusion which it presents with complete confidence.\n\nFor AI agents, which are often designed to take action based on information, hallucinations are particularly dangerous. An agent that hallucinates can:\n\nThe Dangerous Part: Unlike traditional software bugs that crash or throw errors, hallucinations appear as normal, confident responses. There's no error message—just wrong information delivered with certainty.\n\nThere are several root causes for agent hallucinations, but they often fall into a few key categories:\n\nThe agent generates information that is not supported by the context it was given. This is the most common cause of hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.\n\nExample: A customer asks about your return policy. The RAG system retrieves a document about shipping policies instead. The agent \"fills in the gaps\" by inventing a plausible-sounding return policy.\n\nThe agent makes a logical leap that is incorrect, leading it to a false conclusion. Even with correct information, the model's reasoning process can go astray.\n\nExample: An agent is told \"Product A costs 100\"and\"ProductBcosts100\" and \"Product B costs 150.\" When asked which is cheaper, it might occasionally claim Product B is cheaper due to reasoning errors.\n\nThe model's training data is old, and it provides information that is no longer accurate. This is especially problematic for rapidly changing domains.\n\nExample: An agent trained on 2023 data confidently states a library version that has since been deprecated and replaced.\n\nThe user's prompt is unclear, and the agent makes an incorrect assumption to fill in the gaps rather than asking for clarification.\n\nExample: A user asks \"What's the price?\" without specifying which product. The agent picks one arbitrarily and states its price confidently.\n\nLong conversations or documents can exceed the model's context window, causing it to \"forget\" or misremember earlier information.\n\nThe model may have learned incorrect patterns from its training data, leading to systematic hallucinations on certain topics.\n\nIgnoring hallucinations is not an option. The consequences can be severe:\n\nTraditional methods for detecting hallucinations rely on manual review and fact-checking, which are slow, expensive, and reactive. You find out about a hallucination after it has already happened—often from an angry customer.\n\nNoveum.ai offers a radically different approach: automated, real-time hallucination detection using the agent's own system prompt and context as the ground truth.\n\nOur platform uses a suite of 68+ specialized evaluation scorers to analyze every single agent response. Here are the key scorers for hallucination detection:\n\nThe faithfulness_scorer checks if the agent's answer is factually consistent with the retrieved context. It directly measures whether the agent is \"making things up.\" When a response contradicts the provided documents, it gets flagged with detailed reasoning explaining the inconsistency.\n\nThe groundedness_scorer evaluates whether the agent's responses are based on the provided context or conversation history. It penalizes the model for inventing information not supported by the facts at hand—like citing studies, statistics, or sources that don't exist in the context.\n\nInstead of requiring a manually labeled dataset of \"correct\" answers, Noveum.ai uses the agent's system prompt and the context it was given as the source of truth.\n\nThe evaluation engine automatically checks:\n\nThis allows for fully automated, real-time evaluation without the bottleneck of manual labeling.\n\nDetecting a hallucination is the first step. Understanding why it happened is the key to preventing it. This is where NovaPilot, our AI-powered root cause analysis engine, comes in.\n\nWhen a hallucination is detected, NovaPilot analyzes the entire agent trace and the scores from all 68+ evaluators to identify the root cause. It might find that:\n\nPoor Retrieval Quality — Low context_relevance score indicates the RAG system retrieved wrong documents. The agent didn't have the right information to begin with.\n\nAmbiguous System Prompt — The prompt doesn't explicitly instruct the agent to say \"I don't know.\" Missing guardrails for handling uncertainty.\n\nModel Tendency — Certain models are more prone to hallucination for specific task types. May need to switch models or add verification steps.\n\nContext Window Issues — Important information was truncated due to token limits. Need to optimize context selection.\n\nMissing Verification Steps — No fact-checking layer before response delivery. Consider adding a verification agent to the pipeline.\n\nBased on its diagnosis, NovaPilot suggests specific, actionable fixes:\n\nLet's walk through a complete example of how Noveum.ai catches and diagnoses a hallucination:\n\nA financial services chatbot is asked about the interest rate on a specific savings account. The RAG system retrieves a document about a similar but different account.\n\nThe agent confidently states the interest rate from the wrong document:\n\nUser: \"What's the interest rate on the Premium Savings Account?\"\n\nAgent: \"The Premium Savings Account offers a 2.5% APY.\" ❌\n\n(Actual rate: 3.2% APY — the agent cited the Standard Savings rate)\n\nThe evaluation engine runs automatically on this interaction:\n\nNovaPilot analyzes the trace and identifies the pattern:\n\nRoot Cause: The retrieval system, not the LLM. The wrong document was retrieved, so even a perfect LLM would give the wrong answer.\n\n\"Improve the retrieval system to be more precise. Consider using product-specific embeddings or adding metadata filtering to ensure the correct account type is retrieved. Current retrieval is matching on general 'savings account' terms rather than specific product names.\"\n\nHere's how to add hallucination detection to your existing agent:\n\nIn your Noveum.ai dashboard, select the scorers you want to apply:\n\nSet your thresholds (we recommend 7/10 for production) and configure your alert channels.\n\nConfigure real-time alerts for hallucination detection:\n\nAdd clear instructions to your system prompt:\n\nMonitor your RAG pipeline's context relevance scores. Poor retrieval is the #1 cause of hallucinations.\n\nAdd a verification step before delivering responses. Noveum.ai automatically evaluates every response against its context using our suite of 68+ scorers—no manual verification code needed. Simply enable hallucination detection in your dashboard and get instant alerts when responses don't match the provided context.\n\nHallucination patterns change over time. Monitor trends and adjust your prompts and retrieval strategies accordingly.\n\nStudies suggest that LLMs hallucinate between 3-27% of the time depending on the task and model. For RAG systems with poor retrieval, rates can be even higher.\n\nNo current technology can guarantee zero hallucinations. The goal is to detect them before they reach users and continuously reduce their frequency through better prompts, retrieval, and model selection.\n\nFaithfulness measures whether the response contradicts the provided context. Groundedness measures whether claims are supported by the context at all. A response can be faithful (not contradicting) but not grounded (adding unsupported information).\n\nEvery trace is evaluated automatically as it's captured. Scores are computed in near-real-time, and alerts are triggered immediately when thresholds are crossed.\n\nGenerally, smaller and faster models hallucinate more than larger ones. However, even GPT-4 hallucinates. The key is detection and mitigation, not model selection alone.\n\nHallucinations are a serious threat to the reliability and trustworthiness of AI agents. Relying on manual detection is a losing battle—you'll always be reacting to problems after they've damaged user trust.\n\nThe only scalable solution is to automate the process.\n\nNoveum.ai provides the industry's most advanced platform for automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing hallucinations in production agents.

    "fullText": "Vanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\n\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\n\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\n\nVanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\n\nMany retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\n\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\n\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Days after Ghislaine Maxwell asked a judge to immediately free her from a 20-year prison sentence, the public release of grand jury transcripts from her sex trafficking case returned the spotlight to victims whose allegations helped land her behind bars.\n\nThe disclosure of the transcripts as part of the Justice Department’s ongoing release of its investigative files on Maxwell and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein exposed how an FBI agent told grand jurors about Maxwell's critical role in Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of girls and young women.\n\nMaxwell, a British socialite and publishing heir, was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 after four women told a federal jury in New York City about how she and Epstein abused them in the 1990s and early 2000s. Epstein never went to trial. He was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges and killed himself a month later in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail.\n\nTwo weeks ago, as the Justice Department prepared to begin releasing what are commonly known as the Epstein files, Maxwell filed a habeas petition, asking a federal judge to free her on grounds that “substantial new evidence” has emerged proving that constitutional violations spoiled her trial.\n\nMaxwell claimed exonerating information was withheld and that witnesses lied in their testimony. She filed the petition on her own, without the assistance of a lawyer.\n\nThis week, the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, scolded Maxwell for failing to remove victim names and other identifying information from her court papers. He said future filings must be kept sealed and out of public view until they have been reviewed and redacted to protect victims' identities.\n\nVictims fear Maxwell will be pardoned\n\nEpstein accuser Danielle Bensky said the release of records has only sharpened the focus on Maxwell’s crimes among their victims. Bensky said she's been involved in daily discussions with about two dozen other victims that make clear Maxwell “is a criminal who was 1,000% engaged in sexual acts.\"\n\n“I’ve heard things that would make your blood curdle. I just had a conversation with a survivor last night who said she was the puppeteer,” Bensky said.\n\nBensky said she was sexually abused by Epstein two decades ago. She said she was never personally abused by Maxwell.\n\nDelayed and heavily redacted files\n\nThe transcripts of grand jury proceedings that resulted in Maxwell's indictment were released this week in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law enacted last month after months of public and political pressure.\n\nThe Justice Department has been periodically posting records after acknowledging it would miss last Friday’s congressionally mandated deadline to release all records. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring victims’ names and other identifying information.\n\nOn Wednesday, the department said it may need a “few more weeks” to release the full trove after suddenly discovering more than a million potentially relevant documents. It was a stunning development after department officials suggested months ago that they'd already accounted for the vast universe of Epstein-related materials.\n\nSome of the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury records were initially released with heavy redactions — A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY” — was entirely blacked out. Updated versions were posted over the weekend.\n\nFBI agent testifies Maxwell manipulated young girl\n\nAn FBI agent’s grand jury testimony, describing interviews conducted with Epstein victims, foreshadowed trial testimony a year later from four women who described Maxwell's role in their sexual abuse from 1994 to 2004.\n\nThe agent told of a woman who described meeting Maxwell and Epstein as a 14-year-old attending a Michigan summer arts camp in 1994. Flight logs showed Epstein and Maxwell went to the school sponsoring the camp because Epstein was a donor.\n\nAccording to the agent, whose name was redacted from the transcript, the girl had a chance encounter with Epstein and Maxwell one day. After learning that the girl was from Palm Beach, Florida, Epstein mentioned that he sometimes gave scholarships to students and they requested her phone number, the agent said.\n\nOnce home, the girl visited Epstein's estate with her mother for tea and the mother was impressed when Epstein said he provided scholarships, enough so that the mother said Epstein was like a “godfather,” the agent said.\n\nThe agent said the girl began regularly going to the estate as Epstein and Maxwell “groomed” her with gifts and trips to the movies, and Epstein began paying for voice lessons and giving her money that he said she should give to her struggling mother.\n\nThe agent said the girl thought her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell was strange, “but Maxwell normalized it for her. She was like a cool, older sister and made comments like, ‘This is what grownups do.’”\n\nEventually, the agent testified, the girl saw Maxwell topless at the pool. After she revealed that she hoped to be an actor and a model, Epstein told her he was best friends with the owner of Victoria's Secret and that she'll have to learn to be comfortable in her underwear and not be a prude, the agent said.\n\nThen, the agent said, the girl asked Epstein what he meant by that and the financier pulled her into his lap and masturbated. After that, the agent added, the girl's encounters with Epstein began to include sexual contact, particularly in his massage room.\n\nMaxwell was sometimes there with other girls, the agent said. One of the girls would begin massaging Epstein and Maxwell would tease the girls, the agent said.\n\n“She’d grab the girl’s breasts, and she would direct the girls on what to do,” the agent said, relaying the girl’s account.

    "title": "Endocrinologists Warn Against This Popular Breakfast Combo if You’re Trying To Balance Blood Sugar",
    "description": "Find out how this common food pairing can negatively impact your health.",
    "fullText": "Whether you’re at risk for type 2 diabetes or just trying to keep your energy levels steady, there are many reasons why it’s beneficial to keep your blood sugar levels balanced. Breakfast is the first opportunity of the day to do that. \n\nFood combinations are an important part of maintaining steady blood sugar levels. For example, a bagel can lead to an increase in blood sugar after eating it, but if you pair it with eggs or an avocado (both good sources of unsaturated fats), it slows sugar absorption from the carbohydrates and the increase will be less dramatic.\n\nSimilar to how some pairings can be beneficial for blood sugar, other pairings can be detrimental, causing even more of a blood sugar spike. There’s one particularly popular breakfast food and drink combination that can do this, according to endocrinologists.\n\nMaybe you thought that maintaining stable blood sugar was only important for people with diabetes. However, Dr. Fady Hannah-Shmouni, MD, an endocrinologist and the medical director at Eli Health, emphasizes that it’s essential for everyone’s health.\n\n“Even without diabetes, steady blood sugar helps keep energy stable, supports clear thinking, reduces cravings and protects long-term metabolic health,” Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says, adding that frequent spikes can contribute to inflammation, weight gain and insulin resistance over time.\n\n🩺\nUnstable blood sugar levels impact health both in the short term and long term. Short-term, Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says it can lead to fatigue, brain fog, irritability, headaches, shakiness and intense food cravings. “These rapid swings can also disrupt concentration and mood as your body releases stress hormones to rebalance itself,” he adds.\n\nWhat happens when your blood sugar levels are all over the place long-term? Dr. Hannah-Shmouni explains repeated highs and lows can make energy and appetite harder to regulate and that, over time, it increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, weight gain, heart disease and fatty liver disease, among other metabolic conditions.\n\nDr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, MD, an endocrinologist with NYU Langone Health, adds to this, saying, “Complications can occur from long-term unstable blood sugar, including an increased risk for heart attacks, kidney and nerve damage, high cholesterol and blood pressure.”\n\nKnowing how riding the blood sugar rollercoaster can impact health, you’re likely inspired to do what you can to keep it balanced, starting with what you eat for breakfast. After all, how we spend our mornings sets the tone for the rest of the day.\n\nOne breakfast combination that all three endocrinologists we talked to say can majorly spike blood sugar is a pastry paired with fruit juice. Many people pour a glass of OJ or grapefruit juice to have with their breakfast for the vitamin C boost, but this combination can negatively impact blood sugar.\n\n“Pastries and fruit juice are both forms of fast-acting carbohydrates without good nutrients and as a result will significantly increase your glucose levels, especially if you have underlying type 2 diabetes,” Dr. Pessah-Pollack says.\n\nDr. Florence Comite, MD, an endocrinologist, founder of the Comite Center for Precision Medicine and Healthy Longevity and author of the forthcoming book, Invincible: Defy Your Genetic Destiny to Live Better, Longer, explains that pastries and fruit juice are both high in carbohydrates that can cause a rapid glucose spike and equally quick drop, followed by an insulin spike which results in jitteriness and cravings for more quick energy. “That rollercoaster ride of dramatic glucose spikes and dips is unhealthy and will lead to insulin resistance,” she says.\n\nWhile a pastry and fruit juice aren’t exactly a great pairing as far as your blood sugar is concerned, that doesn't mean you can’t ever enjoy either one. If you’re going to have either a pastry or fruit juice for breakfast, all three experts recommend pairing it with a food high in protein, fiber or unsaturated fats. Some examples include nuts, eggs or avocado. This will mitigate the blood sugar spike, especially if you eat the nutrient-dense food first.\n\nDr. Pessah-Pollack recommends having a whole fruit instead of fruit juice, sharing, “Whole fruit has fiber, which is beneficial and slows digestion. Fruit juice lacks this fiber to slow sugar absorption.\"\n\nUnless you’re really craving that pastry, Dr. Pessah-Pollack recommends having oatmeal instead, which is a great source of fiber, compared to the pastry, which doesn’t provide any nutritional benefits. To naturally sweeten your oatmeal without spiking your blood sugar, add cinnamon and top it with fruit.\n\nIn general, whenever you’re craving something sweet (whether it’s for breakfast, a snack or dessert) but you don’t want to spike your blood sugar, Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says to choose sweets that come with protein, fiber or healthy fats, or to pair them with those nutrients. “These [nutrients] slow digestion and help keep glucose steadier. Good options include fruit with nut butter, Greek yogurt with berries, a square of dark chocolate after a balanced meal, chia pudding or a small portion of your favorite dessert eaten after protein rather than on an empty stomach,” he explains.\n\nDr. Fady Hannah-Shmouni, MD, endocrinologist and the medical director at Eli Health\n\nDr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, MD, endocrinologist with NYU Langone Health\n\nDr. Florence Comite, MD, endocrinologist, founder of the Comite Center for Precision Medicine and Healthy Longevity and author of the forthcoming book, Invincible: Defy Your Genetic Destiny to Live Better, Longer\n\nMa, X., Nan, F., Liang, H., et al.

    "fullText": "A video of a driver struggling to make their way through the iconic Shrine Drive Thru Tree in California has drawn ire online.\n\nTikToker Kbeautymom75 (@kbeautymom75) shared a video of a driver who had managed to get stuck while driving along the Avenue of the Giants in Humboldt County.\n\nThe video shows the driver trying to maneuver their massive SUV through the tree, a naturally split sequoia that has a small road through it. The Shrine Tree is an iconic tourist attraction, but not one that every vehicle is small enough to make it through.\n\nYou can hear the crack of wood as the driver attempts to maneuver their way through the tree, having misjudged their placement on the road in relation to the tree on either side. After about 10 seconds of maneuvering, the driver makes it through, but not before damaging the roughly 3,000-year-old tree via their hubris.\n\nThis video is emblematic of a recurring issue in national parks across the country, namely a lack of respect for the beauty of the scenery around them. From graffiti at Rocky Mountain National Park to YouTubers defacing the Grand Canyon, there are more and more examples of people treating these landmarks with far less respect than they deserve.\n\nIt also illustrates an issue with the rate at which American cars have grown in size; while the SUV is large, it's hardly the largest model on the road, and it can barely fit through the massive tree. Smaller, more fuel-efficient cars would have a much easier time traversing the narrow pass.\n\nCommenters were quick to pile on the driver.\n\n\"They should be fined tbh,\" one said.\n\nAnother TikTok user wrote: \"I'm boiling over angry right now. The sequoias are my second home, and this hurts.\"\n\n\"They should be liable for any damage done to that tree,\" a third added.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "DENVER (AP) — Former Colorado elections clerk Tina Peters is asking the state appeals court to recognize President Donald Trump's pardon of her state convictions as valid.\n\nIn a motion Tuesday, Peters' lawyers said the Colorado appeals court no longer has jurisdiction over her case because of a Dec. 5 pardon issued by Trump. They also asked the court to release her from prison because of the pardon.\n\nPeters, the former Mesa County, Colorado clerk, was convicted of state crimes there for orchestrating a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race. Trump’s pardon power does not extend to state crimes.\n\nIn the court filing, Peters' lawyers argued that President George Washington issued pardons to people convicted of both state and federal crimes in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1795. They urged the state appeals court to issue a ruling quickly. The court is set to hear arguments from lawyers in Peters' appeal of her conviction on Jan. 14.\n\nThe appeals court ruled Wednesday that lawyers from the state attorney general's office, which is defending the conviction, could respond to Peters’ arguments by Jan. 8.\n\nThe office of Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser declined to comment. Weiser previously dismissed it when Trump announced it Dec. 11.\n\n“The idea that a president could pardon someone tried and convicted in state court has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up,” he said in statement then.\n\nIf the appeals court rules the pardon isn't valid, one of Peters' attorneys, Peter Ticktin, said she could appeal that issue to the U.S. Supreme Court while the state court continues to consider Peters' appeal of her conviction.\n\nAnother Peters attorney, John Case, has asked the state prison system to release Peters based on Trump's pardon but the state refused, according to an email included in the appeals court filing.\n\nEarlier this month, Peters lost a bid in federal court to be released from prison while her state appeal is considered.\n\nPeters claims that the state judge who sentenced her to nine years behind bars violated her First Amendment rights by punishing her for making allegations about election fraud.\n\nDuring Peters’ October 2024 sentencing, Judge Matthew Barrett called Peters a “charlatan” and said she posed a danger to the community for spreading lies about voting and undermining the democratic process.\n\nPeters was unapologetic and insisted that everything she did was geared toward trying to uproot what she believed was fraud. She claimed her actions were done for the greater good.\n\nPeters was convicted of allowing a man to misuse a security card to access the election system and being deceptive about that person’s identity. The man was affiliated with MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election from Trump.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this year, Southwest Airlines made a groundbreaking change as the airline ended its longstanding \"bags fly free\" policy and began charging passengers for checked luggage. The move came as the struggling airline looked to boost overall profits. However, that did not happen this year.\n\nDespite Southwest's decision to begin charging passengers for checked luggage, the airline still saw a massive slump in profits throughout the year.\n\nFor decades, Southwest allowed all of its customers to travel with up to two checked bags, free of charge. However, back in May, the airline officially ended that policy.\n\nIn May, Southwest Airlines officially instituted checked baggage fees, adding a $35 charge for the first bag and $45 for each additional checked bag.\n\nIt was the most high-profile in a series of high-profile changes that Southwest made this year as it undergoes a major brand overhaul.\n\nThough Southwest ditched free bags in an attempt to boost profits, those profits have not come through the first nine months of the year.\n\nAs CNBC reports, Southwest Airlines announced that its profits have actually fallen by 42 percent throughout the first nine months of the year.\n\nThe latest reported profit slumps come after Southwest reported no noticeable boost in revenue from checked bags charges back in August. In fact, executives admitted that basic economy sales slumped immediately following the checked bag charges, indicating that customers were turned off by the new charges.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan has continually expressed optimism about the hypothetical revenue these new bag fees are expected to bring in, but the numbers simply have not backed up that reality.\n\nIt's worth noting that despite the slumping profits, Southwest's stock has been soaring thanks in large part to the changes the airline continues to make, like assigned seating and premium seating options that will officially roll out next year.\n\n“Because the assigned seating, the extra legroom, kicks in and there’s a lot of value in that, of course, [results are] going to be better year over year,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC earlier this month. “The bookings that we’re seeing reflect the business case for assigned seating and extra legroom.”\n\nHowever, even if Southwest's future outlook does look promising to investors, one expert points out that the bag fees aren't exactly the reason for that, no matter what the executives say.\n\n“One month of selling a ‘basic economy’ product they saw their revenue per available seat mile decline by .5 percentage point, and that’s with charging for bags,” Katy Nastro, travel expert at Going, told Customer Experience Dive back in August. “While they say bag fees are looking healthy, with softer demand, they’ve likely had to discount base fares which means they aren’t making pure profit from bag fees.”",

    "description": "Ana Fedina made the art for Critical Role's \"The Armory of Heroes,\" a guide to artifacts and weapons from the crew's \"Dungeons & Dragons\" stream.",
    "fullText": "The name Ana Fedina may not ring a bell, but if you've played games like \"Diablo IV,\" you've seen her work.\n\nFor more than seven years, Fedina has been working as a professional artist and has contributed illustrations to games like \"Raid: Shadow Legends\" as well.\n\nMost recently, she was the illustrator for \"The Armory of Heroes,\" a full-art compendium of weapons and character art released by the gaming and media company Critical Role in July.\n\nFedina didn't start out as a game artist.\n\n\"I didn't know that you could make a living doing what I do now. These cool comic artists seemed pretty unreachable when I was younger, so I thought I would study design and become a graphic designer,\" Fedina told Business Insider.\n\nBut in college, she discovered that drawing for games was a viable career and went all in on making concept art.\n\nFedina, who worked on \"The Armory of Heroes\" alongside writer Martin Cahill, was a fan of Critical Role before landing the book gig.\n\n\"Back in the day, I spent too much time on Tumblr and one day I started to see some interesting-looking characters on my feed,\" Fedina said. Those characters were from the crew's second Twitch-streamed \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaign, which has now been written into an Amazon-backed animated series on Prime Video.\n\n\"I wanted to work with Critical Role for a while, and I may have had some opportunities in the past, but they didn't work out,\" Fedina said. \"So it was pretty cool to try something, but I didn't expect this project to end up being this big.\"\n\nYears later, an editor working with CR's publishing arm contacted her and asked to contribute to the book. That kicked off a yearlong gig that began in January 2024, in which Fedina illustrated around 120 pieces for the book, which spans 216 full-color pages.\n\nFedina's illustration process for \"The Armory of Heroes\" involved everything from research to drafting, then getting several rounds of notes from the Critical Role co-founders.\n\n\"There were some notes, like, 'The character wielding this sharp weapon might hurt themselves.' Or, 'let's make it more functional,' or, 'Let's make changes to suit the armor and weapons to the wearer, make it more personal,'\" she said.\n\nShe said she also relied on notes she'd taken from the Twitch stream. Fedina also said that she included some personal touches in the character art. The cleric Pike Trickfoot was one of her favorites to draw, and Fedina produced her own version of the character's armor.\n\nFedina's top tip for artists who want to secure a role with companies like Critical Role is to branch out and create more than just fan art.\n\n\"If you want to work on a wider variety of gigs, you should learn character design, learn more complex illustration,\" Fedina said. \"Analyze the market and what it needs, not only popular fan work.\"\n\nShe added that many artists who have worked with Critical Role have an \"original touch and vision\" that they can add to the project.\n\nOn the portfolio front, Fedina said market analysis will help budding creatives get gigs.\n\n\"Analyze the artworks of the artists who already worked with that particular client, and try to understand: What are their needs?\" Fedina said.\n\n\"For all the gigs I was hired for, I had something in my portfolio that aligned with their needs,\" Fedina added. \"I think I was hired by Critical Role because I had weapons in my portfolio, not just character art.\"\n\nFedina added, too, that some good old in-person networking doesn't hurt.\n\n\"For some gigs, you will be recommended by an artist, or other people from the industry who know that you are a good person to work with, not just a great artist,\" Fedina said.\n\n\"It's about having soft skills, and knowing that it won't be a problem for people to work with you,\" Fedina said. \"Try to not only get the likes on social media, but also, just make friends, have thoughtful discussions, and make great connections.\"\n\nDo you work on the Critical Role franchise and have a story to share?

    "title": "I left my university in Milan to study in a much smaller town. I loved the lower cost of living and slower pace.",
    "description": "I thought I would enjoy attending a private university in Milan. I quickly learned I had made the wrong choice.",
    "fullText": "I crossed the street near where I was living in Milan on the verge of tears. I had had enough of feeling sad, lonely, and hopeless.\n\nThat surely wasn't how I expected to feel in my first year of university.\n\nThe previous spring, I had thought about which undergraduate degree I wanted to pursue for months, reading about courses, tuition, and life in a new place. Since I loved writing and dreamed of becoming a journalist, studying communication seemed like the best bet. I chose to pursue a degree at a private university in Milan because the classes seemed fascinating and useful, and the idea of living in Milan was thrilling.\n\nUnfortunately, I soon realized I had made the wrong choice.\n\nThe majority of the courses I was taking were engaging, but we occasionally experienced last-minute schedule changes and disorganized lecturers, and that didn't sit right with me.\n\nMore importantly, I began to feel guilty about the expenses my parents were covering for me. They assured me they could afford it and that my education was worthwhile to them; nonetheless, the tuition and rent were expensive. And, if I wasn't loving it, should they be spending so much?\n\nLiving in Milan was way more exciting in my dreams than it was in reality. While this metropolis had a lot to offer, like cultural exhibitions, sports events, and a lively nightlife, it was also chaotic and hectic. I often felt agitated and restless.\n\nIn my first months there, my sleep was severely affected. It was extremely challenging to find accommodation near the university, and I ended up in a small apartment with a shared bedroom. I struggled to adapt to that living situation and to the noisy neighborhood we lived in.\n\nThe following summer, I applied to the University of Urbino. The living costs and slower rhythms of Urbino, a 15,000-inhabitant town located a short distance from where I grew up in San Marino, were way more appealing to me.\n\nThere, I could attend classes just three days a week, so finding an accommodation wasn't an urgent matter anymore. It was manageable to go back and forth by car from my family home in the first month.\n\nAfter that period, I rented a single room with a stunning view, at a walkable distance from my lecture halls. The morning walk in Urbino's historical center to class became a pleasurable part of my day.\n\nI felt relieved because the public university tuition and accommodation in Urbino were much cheaper than what I was paying in Milan. Given the flexibility of my new arrangement and the saved money, I signed up for a fitness course with training branches in Urbino and San Marino, as well as a mindfulness program in Rimini. I was brighter and more serene.\n\nUnfortunately, this period in Urbino didn't last long, because COVID-19 hit and universities implemented online lessons, and I eventually ended up moving back home.\n\nLooking back, those few months in Urbino were the best period of my early 20s, and I'm glad I was courageous enough to know that something wasn't right and that I could do something about it, and that's a lesson that still sticks with me today.",

    "description": "A new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley as Nvidia reaches a non-exclusive deal with a chip startup and hires its top engineers.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia is forging ahead with another bet on the AI boom, agreeing to a licensing deal with AI hardware startup Groq.\n\nGroq said Wednesday that some of its executives, including its founder and CEO, will join Nvidia as part of the deal. Groq is expected to continue operating independently following what it described as a non-exclusive licensing deal.\n\nGroq is known for its Language Processing Unit, which is a custom chip designed for AI inference, namely, the process by which a trained AI model makes predictions or decisions. The startup was valued at about $6.9 billion as of three months ago and raised around $750 million in its latest funding round.\n\nJonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other members of its team are expected to join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market cap north of $4.5 trillion.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told Business Insider on Wednesday that Nvidia is not acquiring the chip startup.\n\nNeither Nvidia nor Groq disclosed financial terms of the agreement.\n\nRoss and Douglas Wightman were engineers at Google who started the project that became Google's first TPU chips, before leaving to found Groq. The TPUs are custom-made to accelerate large-scale machine-learning tasks designed to handle AI workloads, and are a major rival to Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThe deal between the two companies comes as a new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley. Whereas traditional startups either aim to go public or be acquired, new acqui-hire deals could leave some startup employees behind, only benefiting a small percentage of staff members with desirable AI skills and the founders.\n\nFor instance, in 2024, Google agreed to pay $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology but only hired its two superstar cofounders and 20% of the startup's employees. In the same year, AI developers Adept and Inflection also made similar deals with Amazon and Microsoft, respectively.\n\nMore recently, Meta's acqui-hire of Scale AI became one of the biggest bets on talent after the company agreed to invest roughly $14 billion for a 49% stake and to bring its CEO, Alexandr Wang, into the fold to lead the Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\nThese acqui-hires don't always end well. Windsurf employees were left in limbo after the AI coding startup was nearly aquired by OpenAI for $3 billion, only for the deal to fall apart and the company to be split. Google spent billions to hire Windsurf's CEO and top engineers, while the remaining hundreds of employees were acquired by another startup, Cognition.",

    "description": "Ayumi Nakajima said she values candidates who talk about their failures without spinning stories to make themselves look good.",
    "fullText": "A Pinterest executive who worked at Meta said there's one thing she looks for in potential hires: how they talk about failure.\n\nAyumi Nakajima began her career at Nielsen before taking on a leadership role at Meta — then Facebook — in 2013. She joined Pinterest in 2015, where she's now a senior director in Singapore, heading its Asia-Pacific content partnerships.\n\nShe leads a team of about 20 people across APAC and has interviewed several hundred candidates throughout her career.\n\nNakajima said she pays close attention to how potential hires respond to the interview question: \"What are some failures you have experienced?\"\n\nShe said some candidates tell stories about failures in which they ultimately look good.\n\n\"I'm sure they've prepped in a way to not look too bad, but I actually appreciate it when someone says, 'Actually, this was a failure,'\" she said. \"When they say, 'This was when I messed up,' instead of blaming others.\"\n\n\"Those are some of the soft signals that I look for, when the person can accept when things are not working, or can accept that there was a mistake, and evolve and learn from that,\" Nakajima said.\n\nShe said the tech landscape is changing rapidly, so while there are certain skills she needs in a candidate, she values adaptability and receptiveness to criticism over all else.\n\n\"When I interview candidates, I always look for people who are more flexible and versatile rather than having specific experiences and ticking off a box,\" she said. \"I'd prefer to have someone who's really dynamic and has a growth mindset, because six months down the line, the scope might change.\"\n\nOn the flip side, Nakajima also has a piece of advice for hirers: Don't rush into it.\n\nNakajima said she likes to take her time during the hiring process, with the mindset that the person will stay in the role for four to five years, rather than just one to two.\n\n\"If you think of them as staying for five plus years, then a month delay in the hiring process is not going to ruin things,\" she said. She added that being shortsighted and hiring someone to rush through a project is how employers often pick someone who might not be the best fit.\n\nShe said that she had changed her mind about candidates who were close to being confirmed, after giving it more thought.\n\n\"The recruiting team was obviously not so happy with me, but I think those are just some of the trade-offs that you can make to make the right hiring decision,\" she said.",

If you're looking for a cozier setup, check out our best couch co-op games list.\n\nPlayed online with friends, Divinity: Original Sin 2 becomes less about obsessively optimizing builds and more about reacting together to a world that’s constantly responding to your choices. It sounds cheesy, but if you want a game where you can create actual shared stories and feel like your actions impact an entire world, get your mates downloading Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nThe game’s strength lies in how much freedom it gives you all. Quests rarely have a single solution, and disagreements about what to do next are only a sign that you're properly invested. Whatever you do, the game adapts, and the group adapts with it. Combat is turn-based, which gives everyone time to think and discuss/argue over the best plan. Outside of combat, exploration also feels pretty communal if you lean into it, with players splitting up to investigate different areas and then regrouping with new ideas. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a long game, but one that rewards groups willing to commit to a shared adventure--one of you can even be the Game Master if you'd like. There's a new Divinity game coming out at some point, too, so keep your eyes peeled and dig deep into the lore so you don't get left behind.\n\nValheim is one of those games that is almost always better in co-op than played alone. Fans make a lot of noise about the deep exploration and survival mechanics (rightly so), but its base building is another example of where online co-op really shines. Building a settlement together turns the game into a long-term group project, where everyone contributes in their own way. Watching a base slowly grow from a rough shelter into a functioning village is deeply satisfying, and who doesn't want to build a massive Viking longhouse?\n\nThere’s also a comforting rhythm to games like Valheim. Log in, check what needs fixing, expand a wall, add a roof, and then head out together for the next goal. The game supports both focused teamwork and casual hanging out, making it ideal for groups that want something flexible but meaningful. Why not grab some Valheim mods while you're at it?\n\nPhasmophobia is half co-op, half creepy chaos, and by far one of the best horror games on Xbox. It’s a game where communication isn’t just helpful, it might just save your life. Playing with friends transforms what could be a terrifying solo experience into a tense but often hilarious group effort. Just seeing how your nearest and dearest react to jumpscares in real-time is always a treat.\n\nThe aim of the game is to investigate paranormal activity using a selection of tools and finding evidence. Each investigation in Phasmophobia becomes a shared puzzle between four minds, as you split tasks, compare evidence, and constantly relay information over voice chat. Successes and failures feel communal, and the stakes only get higher as the hauntings get more intense. On the up side, shared responsibility makes it easier to laugh about afterward, even if you were shrieking with very real fear in the moment.\n\nGreen Hell is the survival game you recommend to both your novice and veteran friends. Accessible and challenging all at once, the more support you have, the more manageable the challenges become. Green Hell's online co-op turns the jungle from an overwhelming threat into a shared challenge.\n\nSure, you can go out with weapons and stake a claim to the ground, focusing on combat and conquest, or you can raise animals in wooden holding pens, nurture crops, and build--dare we say, cozy--shelters for you and your comrades. Despite including a number of real-world survival techniques and some genuinely challenging hostile encounters, Green Hell isn't too punishing when you've got a group around you to scout, scavenge, defend, and farm your new home.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWebfishing is a little different than most games on this list, but a worthy addition nonetheless. It's a low-key, low-stakes, low-poly chill out zone, where you and your friends can customize animal avatars, go fishing, chat about life, and explore. It's a space for conversation and de-stressing, a great alternative to a group chat, especially if you don't mind periods of silence and relaxation.\n\nOver time you acquire better equipment, new threads, and the ability to catch better fish. Show off your catches, sell them, or merely explore. There are a few secrets hidden in the game that might cause a spark of excitement, but we'll not spoil too much here.\n\nDon’t Starve Together is the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, a game full of harsh wildernesses, strange creatures, and deep mysteries. The game’s uncompromising world is much easier to navigate when mistakes are made--and learned from--together, either with friends in a private server, or with strangers online.\n\nThis one should be an easy sell to friends who aren't sure about survival horror, as Don't Starve is also a game like Minecraft in that you can mine, craft, explore, and gather resources to make a communal base. Just don't mention what happens in the dark.\n\nFactorio is co-op at its most collaborative. It’s a game about building systems, and playing online turns those systems into group efforts that constantly evolve--it's like getting a job in a factory, except you don't get paid and it's actually fun.\n\nEach player can take ownership of part of the factory, but nothing exists in isolation. Changes ripple outward, encouraging constant communication and coordination. Planning becomes a shared activity, often involving diagrams, discussions, and occasional redesigns. Only enlist your smartest, most strategic friends.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic is a great gateway horror game for when you don't want something too scary, easing you and your friends into a slightly spooky experience that requires focus and commitment to survive. Missions are designed so that players naturally rely on each other’s strengths, making co-op feel purposeful and fun, despite the horrors that persist.\n\nEach class contributes something unique, encouraging loose communication without forcing strict coordination. Deep Rock Galactic strikes a balance between structure and flexibility, letting groups play casually or strategically, and employs its light-hearted tone to keep things flowing even when the going gets tough.\n\nTerraria in co-op feels like a shared sandbox adventure, a story only you and your friends could have written. Online play turns simple exploration and building into group projects that evolve organically, battles that require backup, and bases worthy of Terraria's most elaborate decor.\n\nYou'll naturally split tasks--some of you can explore, some can build, some can fight--and then regroup to share the spoils with everyone. The procedurally generated world feels more alive the more people live in it, reflecting the collective efforts of everyone involved and growing at a pace alongside you. Depending on your ability and playstyle, you can choose to go the offensive route, battling your way through the wilds, or become a homebody, creating a comforting environment for everyone to come back to once they're done fighting. There's a role for everyone. If you're needing some inspiration, check out our extensive Terraria guidesto get you started.\n\nAstroneer turns the realities of brutal and isolated space exploration into a cooperative, rewarding process, which is why it's one of the best survival games you can play online. Online co-op encourages players to plan, experiment, and adapt together as they reshape alien worlds and make it through another night. The tactile feel of the game's crafting system and potential for laid-back exploration and terraforming means you can (as long as you're willing to carry some of the survival responsibility) play it with just about anyone.\n\nWhen your oxygen level is on the line, tasks feel lighter when shared. It's not a punishing survival game, but it expects you to keep an eye on many moving parts at once for your colonization efforts to be effective. For creative groups who enjoy a bit of focus and tranquility, Astroneer might just hit the spot\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a light-hearted and silly online co-op game where every action requires coordination, and success depends on players communicating constantly, despite being in stitches.\n\nRunning a spaceship together (especially when you're just lil' guys) means juggling roles on the fly. Shields, weapons, navigation--it all requires cooperation, often under pressure and with heavy doses of chaos. It's an easy game to pick up and a fun party game for breaking the ice, we've even rated it one of the best couch co-op games to play together.",

    "fullText": "Luka Dončić set to play his first Christmas Day game as a Laker. Is he enough to pull out a win? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have been in a bit of a slump as of late. Despite being 19-9 and the 4th seed in the Western Conference, they're 4-5 in December.\n\nThis does coincide with some injuries, which makes sense. Of the nine games played in December, the Lakers have been without Austin Reaves for three games and Luka Dončić for three and a half, amid many other role players missing time.\n\nThis, along with the obvious deficiencies on the roster, has led the team to where they are now.\n\nMore: Here are the two ways the Lakers can fix their biggest issues\n\nAustin Reaves made his return on Tuesday night, coming off the bench against the Suns, who absolutely thrashed LA. It was a decent first showing back, as he scored 17 points on 6/11 shooting.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the Lakers are set to take on the Houston Rockets at Crypto.com Arena, and from the sounds of it, they'll be getting their other star back as Luka Dončić is set to make his return.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the month of December has not been kind to the Lakers. Not only are they currently below .500 for the month, but it's the way they've looked in these losses that's concerning.\n\nOf the five games they've lost, they've averaged an 18-point deficit in those losses and have had some abysmal shooting nights, shooting below 20% in two of their last four.\n\nWe can’t play defense and we can’t shoot 3s\n\n-Lakers now rank 23rd in defense\n-Lakers are 28th in 3 point shooting\n\nNot a contender pic.twitter.com/nNKJF9BVpv\n\n— The Lakers Chip (@Lakerschipp) December 24, 2025\n\nObviously, this is a much different team without Luka Dončić, but are these problems too large for him alone to solve?\n\nThe Houston Rockets, while not as good as most expected them to be, are still a problem. They have length, shooting, and depth that will absolutely punish the Lakers on their home court if they're not careful.\n\nHopefully, for Lakers fans, Luka Dončić's return to the lineup, paired with playing on Christmas, gives the team the jolt needed to break out of this slump and deliver a gift to Los Angeles.\n\nLuka Dončić playing Santa in Los Angeles this holiday season\n\nWhat's behind the NBA's best bromance between Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves?\n\nJJ Redick saw the All-Star writing on the wall on day one with Austin Reaves.\n\nThe Lakers reportedly have a 6'7 trade pivot out of Cleveland",

    "fullText": "James Harden blasted as 'foul baiter' by opposing head coach originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHouston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka wasn’t happy with the undisciplined way that his team defended Los Angeles Clippers guard James Harden during L.A.’s 128-108 win over the Rockets on Tuesday night.\n\nAfter the game, Udoka put Harden on blast for intentional foul-seeking and simultaneously admonished his own troops for falling into the veteran guard’s well-established traps.\n\nHarden finished the game against Houston with 29 points and 13 free throw attempts, 12 of which he converted.\n\n“The undisciplined things of reaching in and fouling,” Udoka said. “Fouled him on three jump shots and then slap down. He’s a foul-baiter, and you don’t stay disciplined, show your hands, and reach in. And so, prime example of the things we did well last game or that we need to do against certain guys, and obviously didn’t come out with that tonight.”\n\nUdoka is far from the first person to call Harden out for fishing for fouls, but it is a little surprising to hear a coach be so blunt and critical about an opposing player.\n\nHarden has led the league in free throw attempts and makes on a whopping seven separate occasions, so there's no denying that he has a certain knack for drawing contact. While some would classify that as a skill, others like Udoka, might label it differently.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Harden isn’t the only guard in the league currently facing foul-baiting accusations. New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson recently responded to similar claims about his style of play by denying them and challenging his defenders to be more disciplined.\n\n“I play by the rules. I’m not a foul baiter,” Brunson said. “I just play by the rules. Be disciplined on defense. Don’t reach.”\n\nReigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander also recently defended himself against claims that he receives a favorable whistle.\n\n\"I don't care, not one bit. I can't control how the refs blow the whistle ever,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I've never been able to. Never been a ref. All I can do is play basketball, and that's all I focus on.”\n\nSo again, it’s not just Harden. Players today are very smart, and many have figured out how to exploit certain rules to their advantage. That might not always lead to the most aesthetically-pleasing brand of basketball, but it has proven to be effective given the way the game is officiated today.",

    "fullText": "An especially introspective Steve Kerr told reporters Wednesday that there's beauty in the struggle while he reflected on the state of his Golden State Warriors and the blowup he had with Draymond Green during the third quarter of a 120-97 win over the Orlando Magic two days earlier.\n\nKerr and Green were seen in a heated discussion during a timeout Monday night. After an animated exchange, Green decided to remove himself and left for the Chase Center locker rooms.\n\nAlthough he eventually returned to the bench, he didn't check back into the game.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nKerr said he and his do-it-all forward had a \"great chat\" Wednesday. The longtime Warriors head coach said he and Green apologized to each other as well as to the team.\n\nKerr explained that it was not his finest hour, nor was it a good look for his group.\n\n\"That was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange,\" Kerr said Wednesday.\n\n\"These things, they happen, especially when you get two incredibly competitive people like Dray and me. So over the 12 years we've been together, this has happened occasionally, and I'm not proud of it.\"\n\nKerr added: \"I care so much about Draymond, and the relationship we have is like family. And like family, you go through ups and downs. And my No. 1 goal honestly is for him to finish his career as a Warrior with us fighting — metaphorically, not literally — and competing together until we're both gone. And I believe that's going to happen because I believe in Draymond, and I believe in myself and I believe in everything we've built for 12 years.\"\n\nFull soundbite of Steve Kerr on the heated exchange with Draymond Green:\n\n“I regret my actions in that exchange and I apologized to Dray, he apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\nKerr reflected on their 12 years of winning together, expressing his belief in Green. pic.twitter.com/xpWhHFwZoA\n\n— Kenzo Fukuda (@kenzofuku) December 24, 2025\n\nThe Warriors famously selected Green out of Michigan State with the 35th overall pick in the second round of the 2012 draft. Kerr has coached him from the 2014-15 season on. Since, Green has emerged as a four-time All-Star, one-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. Together, Kerr and Green have won four NBA championships.\n\nWhile Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and then Kevin Durant, consistently shot the lights out, Green has left his own mark on the organization: with defensive tenacity, heady court vision and physical rebounding, plus timely scoring.\n\n\"We have four banners out there, and obviously a lot of people have played important roles in that, but I've said this before, and I truly believe it. I don't think we have any without Draymond. That's how much he impacts winning.\n\n\"So his ability to channel that passion, that emotion, that raw rage that he has is a key component to what makes us successful. And what I said about the other night, I didn't channel my own raw emotion and rage, of which there is plenty. We are far more alike than anyone would ever realize.\"\n\nKerr cited a long history of turning negative moments into positive momentum during his relationship with Green, who Kerr described as \"very complex.\" While Green has racked up technical fouls and served his fair share of suspensions for outbursts during a 14-season NBA career, he's also known for his basketball acumen and his contemplative commentary.\n\n\"We've always, always found a way to not only bounce back, but to make strides as a result,\" Kerr said, via Warriors reporter Kenzo Fukuda.\n\nWith the win over the Magic, the Warriors improved to 15-15. They've won back-to-back games for the fifth time this season. But they've still yet to string together more than three victories in a row.\n\nThis version of Golden State is spearheaded by Curry, Green and Jimmy Butler III. They're all at least 35 years old. Butler is a Warriors transplant who helped spark a second-half run last season, which ended in the Western Conference semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in the first game of the series.\n\n\"Where we are as a team, as an organization, the most important thing for me is for guys to recognize that there's beauty in the struggle. There's beauty in what we're trying to accomplish right now,\" Kerr said Wednesday, via The San Francisco Standard's Danny Emerman.\n\n\"We are no longer the '17 Warriors, dominating the league. We are a fading dynasty. We know that. Everyone knows that. So what is up to us? How do we carry ourselves night to night? How connected are we? And can we give ourselves another swing at the plate? We did that last year. I was really proud of the team last year. Despite the loss to Minnesota, injury to Steph. Who knows how long we would've gone? But we gave ourselves a chance. That's the goal here.\n\n\"We know where we are. We've got to know who we are, we've got to know what's possible, and we've got to take pride in the struggle, because this is part of life.\"\n\nKerr said he believes sorting out the tiff with Green has been a major step in this Warriors team working through its issues.\n\nHe sees an opportunity for Golden State to make another run like last year's.\n\nAs for Green, Kerr wants him to finish his career in a Warriors uniform.\n\n\"He's undyingly loyal and passionate, and I will go to bat for him as long as I'm coaching him here,\" Kerr said, per Emerman. \"Honestly, I'd go to bat for him 20 years from now when we haven't been together. That's how strongly I feel about him. And that's how I want this thing to end with us, whenever that is.\"",

    "fullText": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (WGN) — While Caleb Williams, DJ Moore and the Chicago Bears’ offense received most of the praise for last weekend’s dramatic, come-from-behind victory over the Green Bay Packers, it would have never happened had it not been for kicker Cairo Santos.\n\nIn a press release on Wednesday, the NFL announced Santos was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for Week 16 after his efforts in the Bears’ 22-16 overtime win versus the Packers.\n\nHow improbable was the Chicago Bears’ OT win over the Green Bay Packers?\n\n“Cairo navigating the wind … It was just unbelievable with the gusty conditions out there. You guys saw all of the paper cups and all of the things flying and floating all over the field,” Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower said. “For him to have the mental fortitude to stay focused and play the conditions is what we talk about doing.\n\n“Not trying to beat the conditions, not being upset about the conditions, but play the conditions. I thought he did an excellent job of that and struck the ball really well … It helped us a ton.”\n\nSantos converted all three of his field goal attempts in a driving wind—from 46, 51 and 43 yards—and his lone point-after attempt. He was also the only NFC kicker to score at least 10 points and make 100% of his kicks, including one from 50 yards or longer.\n\n“It was super gusty. It was a tough day today,” Santos said after the game. “My first 46-yarder was against the wind, and all the other ones were with the wind. IN the fourth quarter, we were kicking with the wind, but it was more of a crosswind. So, we just had to play a perfect ball and trust it.”\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, wind gusts reached as high as 25-30 mph on Saturday at Soldier Field.\n\nOn top of his ten points scored, he also helped Chicago’s special teams unit recover an onside kick with 1:59 remaining in regulation against Green Bay.\n\n“Cairo’s done so much work on campus here, and he’s done it in the offseason too—I’m talking about all different types of kicks,” Hightower said. “I’ve tried to stop him at times from kicking onside kicks so much, like, ‘Hey, it’s time to go in.’ And he keeps doing it. There’s so much work that’s been put in from that standpoint that it’s not an accident.\n\n“He put work in for it and he hit a really good ball.”\n\nHis one make from 50+, a 51-yarder in the fourth quarter, was his 25th made field goal of 50-plus yards as a member of the Bears, the most by any kicker in franchise history.\n\n“I don’t have many words, man. It’s special to do this with you guys—coaches, players,” Santos said after receiving a game ball from Ben Johnson in the postgame locker room.\n\nOver the last two seasons, under Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower, the Bears have earned five Special Teams Player of the Week awards, tied with the Denver Broncos for the most in the NFL.",

    "fullText": "Everyone knows that the LSU Tigers are going to be in the market for a quarterback this offseason, the only question is which one.\n\nMatt Mascona, of LouisianaSports.net, reported that the Tigers have made contact with the reps of former Florida Gators star DJ Lagway. That immediately solidifies Lagway’s position on the list of possibilities for next year.\n\nLane Kiffin and his staff must come away with a new option at quarterback next year. The only scholarship player at the position on the roster is Michael Van Buren Jr.\n\nWhile Van Buren showed flashes over the last few weeks when he took over for Garrett Nussmeier, but not enough to warrant going into next season with him as the only option.\n\nKiffin is likely to go big game hunting for one of the top names available.\n\nThe most obvious observation to make is bringing over Trinidad Chambliss from the Ole Miss Rebels, but he’s not guaranteed another year of eligibility.\n\nArizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt was another top option, coming off a down year but still carrying hopes of having an NFL career. Working with Kiffin could secure that.\n\nIf it does come down to Lagway as the choice, it would be an exciting outcome for LSU. He may not have had the best start to his career with the Gators, but he’s still a high potential player.\n\nLagway was the top high school passer in a class that included stars like Julian Sayin, Dylan Raiola and CJ Carr. He’s now one of the top options in the portal.\n\nThe Texas native has completed 63.2% of his passes for 4,179 yards with 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions over his two seasons in Florida.\n\nHe’ll have great games and make impressive throws, but no consistency has been developed. It wouldn’t be crazy to think that Kiffin and his staff could unlock something that the failed Gators crew couldn’t.",

To do that for 19 seasons is incredible. You want that in your leader…He’s a Hall of Famer in my view, and I’m just really happy for him to see him recognized properly.”\n\nTomlin has received a good amount of praise and respect over the last few days just weeks after many fans and media members were calling for the Steelers to fire him. Such is life in the NFL.\n\nThe veteran coach has helped turn his team around and get them back on track after a midseason swoon that nearly derailed their playoff hopes. They’ve won three straight games, playing their best football during the biggest games of the year.\n\nIf Pittsburgh keeps it up, Tomlin has a good chance to earn his first playoff win in nearly a decade next month.\n\nMore Steelers: Mike McCarthy Reveals Steelers-Themed Christmas Wish\n\nThe post Steelers’ Mike Tomlin Earns Lofty Praise From Former Rival appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles issued their first official injury report in advance of their Week 17 road game against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe Eagles listed four players under DID NOT PARTICIPATE: Lane Johnson, A.J. Brown, Nakobe Dean, and Landon Dickerson.\n\nFor the second week in a row, there was a report about Johnson returning to practice but it’s yet to happen. Unless Lane Johnson returns to practice on Thursday, he’s probably out again this week.\n\nBrown is listed with “teeth” as his injury designation. More context below. Guessing he should be able to play.\n\nA.J. Brown said yesterday that he was getting his wisdom teeth out this week, so that could be the reason for his absence. #Eagles https://t.co/W9TILDfNuu\n\n— Jeff McLane (@Jeff_McLane) December 24, 2025\n\nVic Fangio suggested that Dean is unlikely to play on Sunday. Don’t want to rush him back from his hamstring injury, especially with Jihaad Campbell as a more than capable starting linebacker option.\n\nDickerson missed Wednesday’s practice due to illness. He’s been missing some practice sessions in recent weeks due to rest reasons.\n\nThe Eagles listed seven players under FULL PARTICIPATION: Jalen Carter, DeVonta Smith, Zack Baun, Jihaad Campbell, Fred Johnson, Cameron Latu, and Cameron Williams.\n\nCarter told reporters he plans on returning to action on Sunday. It remains to be seen just how much the time off helped him.\n\nJalen Carter said he expects to play on Sunday. He had some shots in his shoulders before missing the last three weeks and is already feeling the benefits.\n\n— Dave Zangaro (@DZangaroNBCS) December 24, 2025\n\nJalen Carter said he got multiple shots in both shoulders. He’s probably not going to feel 100% during this stretch run and will likely have to revisit the injury in the offseason.\n\n— Jeff Neiburg (@Jeff_Neiburg) December 24, 2025\n\nDeVonta, Baun, Campbell, and Fred Johnson were never in doubt.\n\nLatu missed Week 16 due to a stinger. Seems like he might be able to return in Week 17.\n\nWilliams is still in his 21-day practice window to return from injured reserve but the Eagles don’t seem to be in a rush to replace him.\n\nWR A.J.

It remains to be seen if this is a new hamstring injury or if it’s related to his previous one. Something to monitor.\n\nJones has previously been getting rest in practice so perhaps the Bills are taking it easy with him.\n\nPoyer picked up a hammy injury during the Bills’ Week 16 win. We’ll see if the former Eagles UDFA signing is able to play.\n\nKnox is a new addition to the Bills’ injury report. If neither him nor Kincaid can play, the Bills will be without two of their top three tight ends.\n\nBills kicker Matt Prater is still hurt so Michael Badgley might have to kick in place of him again.\n\nThe Bills listed four players under LIMITED PARTICIPATION: starting quarterback Josh Allen, linebacker Shaq Thompson, starting nickel cornerback Taron Johnson, and backup nickel cornerback Cam Lewis.\n\nAll indications point to Allen playing but he might be less than 100%.

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

I apologized to Dray. He apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\n— Joseph Dycus (@joseph_dycus) December 24, 2025\n\nGreen, a four-time champion in 13 seasons with the Warriors, said after Monday's game to reporters that \"tempers spilled over\".\n\n\"I just thought it was best that I get out of there,\" Green said. \"I don't think it was a situation where it was going to get better, so it was best to remove myself.\"\n\nThe cause of the argument Green said was basketball.\n\n\"It's what we do,\" he said. \"We play basketball. It's an emotional game. People lose their emotions sometimes, it happens. It is what it is. We've been at this now for a long time. Sometimes you're with people for a long time there's a level of comfort and it happens. We move forward.\"\n\nReporters on Monday asked if it was something that would linger on, but Green dismissed it saying they would \"move forward\".\n\n\"We'll move forward, we're alright,\" Green said regarding his spat with Kerr.\n\nThe Warriors are currently have a .500 record after 30 games, sitting at the eighth spot in the Western Conference. They have a Christmas Day game Thursday against the Dallas Mavericks and their rookie sensation Cooper Flagg at Chase Center in San Francisco.\n\n\"I think we're headed in the right direction,\" Green said to reporters Monday. \"No one's happy about being 15-15.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have a chance to clinch the AFC East in Week 17, but may be shorthanded.\n\nThe Patriots listed 15 players on Wednesday’s injury report. Of those 15 players, eight did not participate at all. The following players did not participate in practice:\n\nTreVeyon Henderson, DeMario Douglas, Morgan Moses, Thayer Munford Jr., Milton Williams, Anfernee Jennings and Charles Woods were listed as limited participants. Williams’s 21-day practice window is open, and the Patriots can activate him at any point.\n\nNot only is the Patriots’ Wednesday injury report long, but it also features some of the most important players on the team. With Hollins, Boutte and Douglas all on the injury report, the Patriots could be thin in the wide receiver room for their game against the New York Jets.\n\nThe Patriots could lean on rookie wide receiver Kyle Williams more this week. He has proven he can make big plays this season, and needs just one more 30-plus yard touchdown to tie Randy Moss’s franchise record for 30-plus yard touchdowns in a single season.\n\nIf Wilson is unable to play, Ben Brown figures to draw another start. Spillane has not played since Dec. 1 against the New York Giants. Williams is unlikely to be activated this week, but his limited participation is a good sign that he will be ready to go when the playoffs start.\n\nThe Patriots can clinch the division and at least one home playoff game with a win and a Buffalo Bills loss or tie. The Patriots can also clinch the division if they tie and the Bills lose.\n\nTom Brady Makes Shocking Patriots Decision In Latest NFL Power Rankings",

    "description": "Our FIU vs. UTSA predictions expect the battle-tested Roadrunners to rise to the occasion in the First Responder Bowl.",
    "fullText": "We should be in for an entertaining matchup on Friday night when the Florida International Panthers meet the UTSA Roadrunners in the First Responder Bowl.\n\nThe Panthers are playing in their first bowl game in six years, and just their sixth since the program’s inception in 2002, but getting their third bowl victory ever will be difficult against this Roadrunners offense.\n\nSee why I like the Roadrunners to get the job done in my Florida International vs. UTSA predictions and college football picks for Friday night’s First Responder Bowl!\n\nUTSA is the better team, with the better quarterback and the more effective defense. The Roadrunners will utilize their ground game and limit FIU’s scoring opportunities en route to a win.\n\nIt makes sense to look at the 7-5 record for the Florida International Panthers, compared to the UTSA Roadrunners' mark of 6-6, and assume they might be a bit better.\n\nHowever, according to Jeff Sagarin, the Panthers played a weaker strength of schedule this season than Illinois State and North Dakota.\n\nAnd if you’re thinking neither of those is an FBS school, then you’d be correct.\n\nDespite facing such a weak schedule, the Panthers rank 104th in offensive EPA, 103rd in rushing success, and 105th in rushing defense success rate. They also allow 3.77 points per quality drive, ranking 94th in FBS.\n\nThat’s what happens when you get dominated at the line of scrimmage on defense. The Panthers allow the third-most yards before contact of any FBS team, giving up 2.87 line yards. They also generate little pressure without blitzing heavily.\n\nThat’s great news for a UTSA offensive line that ranks 29th in line yards and 34th in pressure rate allowed. Their backs also rank 20th in yards after contact in the ground game, which is why they’re 43rd in EPA/rush.\n\nOwen McCown is the better quarterback in this game, and he threw for 370 yards and four touchdowns as he led the Roadrunners to an upset win over Tulane. That’s by far a better win than any FIU posted this season.\n\nThe FIU defense ranks in the 100s in explosive run rate allowed, early down EPA, and stuff rate. Its offense posts very few explosive pass plays, struggles on third down, and is among the most penalized in college football.\n\nUTSA played a tougher schedule, and yet still posted far better metrics on offense and defense. I’ll take the team with the better roster, even with some defections, laying less than a touchdown.\n\nThe UTSA offense can put up explosive plays, especially against this FIU defense. It’s a big reason why the Over is 6-1 in the last seven games for the Roadrunners as they’ve averaged 37 points over that span.\n\nAnd while FIU’s not as good as UTSA, that’s not to say the Panthers won’t light up the scoreboard themselves. The Over has cashed in three of their last four as they’ve scored 34+ in all three of those contests.\n\nAs good as UTSA plays on the whole, the Roadrunners have allowed 34 plays of at least 30 yards this season. FIU has shown an ability to hit big runs, despite the iffy line play, and USF rushed for 7.4 yards a pop against UTSA earlier this season.\n\nIt might take some garbage-time offense, but even at 59.5, I think the total is a bit lower than it should be.\n\nMoneyline: FIU +200 | UTSA -250\n\nOver/Under: Over 59.5 | Under 59.5\n\nUTSA has cashed the first-half Over in six of their last seven games for +4.90 units and a 62% ROI.

    "title": "Investors Warn of 'Rot in Private Equity' as Funds Strike Circular Deals",
    "description": "Buyout firms have struggled to sell companies they own and have instead found a workaround to get cash back to clients: Selling the companies to themselves.",
    "fullText": "In May 2022, clients of the private equity firm Clearlake Capital gathered at a California resort with dazzling views of the Pacific Ocean, where champagne and shrimp flowed freely.\n\nPerhaps even more dazzling than the setting at the Monarch Beach Resort & Club was Clearlake’s recent performance, which had blown through almost every imaginable benchmark, with one fund generating average annual returns of 50 percent.\n\nOne reason for the firm’s success, according to one attendee and documents shared at the gathering: Clearlake was selling the companies it owned from one set of investment funds to another set of funds it also managed called “continuation vehicles.”\n\nContinuation funds are meant as a temporary fix for a serious problem that has been bedeviling firms like Clearlake.\n\nPrivate equity firms have been struggling to deliver on their core business model of taking on debt, buying companies and selling them for a profit. Several years of high interest rates have made it too expensive for many would-be buyers to purchase companies with debt, and private equity firms are contending with a backlog of more than 31,000 unsold companies, a record amount. Deal activity picked up toward the end of this year, but not enough to make a significant dent in the backlog.\n\nContinuation vehicles are providing a short-term solution by allowing firms to sell the companies to themselves, book a paper gain and wait for interest rates to improve.\n\nPrivate equity firms have been turning to this strategy more frequently. The dollar value of continuation vehicles across the industry is expected to total $100 billion or more by the end of 2025, up from about $35 billion in 2019, according to the investment bank Evercore.\n\nPrivate equity is one of the biggest parts of the global economy, with more than $7 trillion in investors’ money, and some of those investors are getting increasingly worried that strategies like continuation vehicles are putting off a painful reckoning.\n\nPrivate equity firms say they are selling only their best-performing companies to continuation vehicles, which would yield big profits when the companies can eventually be sold to outside buyers.\n\nThe risk, investors say, is that the insular nature of these sales — where the private equity firm is both the buyer and seller — is leading to questionable valuations and unrealistic projections, leaving investors vulnerable to painful surprises.\n\nAt the gathering of pension managers and other Clearlake clients at the Monarch Hotel in 2022, the firm boasted about the success of Wheel Pros, an auto accessories retailer that it had sold to one of its continuation funds.\n\nThe company sells flashy hubcaps and other accessories for wheels, which were popular during the pandemic when consumers were flush with stimulus money and had time for do-it-yourself projects.\n\nTwo years after that gathering, in September 2024, Wheel Pros declared bankruptcy, because sales slowed after the pandemic. The company couldn’t keep up with its ballooning debt payments. Every investor, including public employees’ pension funds from New York, Connecticut and Nevada, was wiped out. (Connecticut and Nevada had previously sold out of some of their Wheel Pros stake.)\n\nClearlake Capital declined to make their executives available for an interview. In a 2023 podcast interview, José E. Feliciano, a founder of the firm, said it used continuation vehicles for “companies that were A-plus assets that we wouldn’t mind owning for a long time, maybe forever.” He added that it was also for companies that would need more time and investment to realize their full potential.\n\nPlatinum Equity, another firm, has struggled with its investment in United Site Services, which makes portable toilets. In 2021, Platinum Equity executives described the sale of United Site Services to a continuation fund it created as a “win-win.” Now, United Site Services is in the process of turning the company over to its lenders, and its investors are expected to lose all their money.\n\n“Continuation vehicles are indicative of rot in private equity,’’ said Marcus Frampton, chief investment officer of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, which manages $83 billion of the state’s money that is derived from oil revenues and distributed annually to Alaskans.\n\nThe increased use of these funds, he said, is one of the reasons the Alaska fund has scaled back investments with private equity firms. Mr. Frampton said the firms were shirking their purpose to create value through buying and selling companies. In 2021, the Alaska fund held 22 percent of its dollars in private equity firms. Now it holds about 17 percent.\n\nScott Ramsower, who oversees the private equity investments of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, a pension fund that manages roughly $229 billion, said there were inherent conflicts in continuation funds because a private equity firm is typically involved on both sides of the deal.\n\n“We’d be happier if a private equity firm never did any of these,” Mr. Ramsower said about continuation funds.\n\nThe private equity industry says there are no conflicts because the deals are independently vetted. First, a private equity firm’s largest investors must consent to selling a portfolio company to a continuation vehicle. Then, existing and new investors have a chance to scrutinize the company’s financials and decide whether to buy into a deal at a specific price tag. If the investors don’t see the upside for future returns for a specific company when it is finally sold to an outside buyer, the deal won’t move forward.\n\nBut some investors say this vetting process is not always transparent.\n\nThis month, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery claiming that Energy & Minerals Group, a private equity firm, was seeking to “reap a massive benefit for themselves” at the expense of their investors by selling a company into a continuation vehicle.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the firm tried to force the sovereign wealth funds and other investors to vote on the sale on short notice, provided different data to different investors and would not allow the investors to confer with each other about the deal.\n\nEnergy & Minerals Group did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNigel Dawn, global head of private capital advisory at Evercore, said that so far continuation fund bankruptcies were below the rates of traditional buyout funds, which hover between 5 and 10 percent.\n\nBut he said it was far too soon to say what returns will ultimately look like more broadly for these funds. “It’s still the early days,” he said.\n\nClearlake is one of the most frequent users of continuation funds, creating six of them since 2020.\n\nClearlake, which was founded by Mr. Feliciano and Behdad Eghbali, both billionaires, in 2006 and initially managed $182 million. Now they manage roughly $90 billion of investor money and recently said they would double that amount by buying another fund.\n\nClearlake bought Wheel Pros for about $420 million in 2018. As its new owners, Clearlake wanted to go big, pushing executives to buy up almost every competitor that made accessories for the wheels of cars and trucks, according to two people familiar with the firm’s thinking. By 2021, profits had jumped to over $200 million from about $50 million in 2018.\n\nEven though the I.P.O. market was strong in 2021, private equity firms often have to wait a few years after a company goes public to collect all their gains. Clearlake figured it could book an even bigger and immediate gain by putting Wheel Pros into a continuation vehicle that valued the business at $2.3 billion, more than four times the price Clearlake had paid just three years earlier, the two people said. As is typical in continuation funds, Clearlake gave its existing investors the chance to either cash out or roll their investment into the new fund.\n\nPennsylvania State Employees’ Retirement System was among the sellers, while state pensions for Connecticut and Nevada rolled some of their commitment into the new fund and New York rolled all of it.\n\nClearlake also brought in a new batch of investors, including other large private equity firms like Blackstone, Pantheon and ICG.\n\nWheel Pros’ senior managers took their own stock options — worth about $100 million — and put them into the new fund, the people said. Clearlake invested about $50 million of its partners’ profits, too, said another person familiar with the matter.\n\nOnce Clearlake moved Wheel Pros into the continuation vehicle and booked a profit, it added substantially more debt to the company, ratcheting up the financial pressure, according to internal company documents reviewed by The New York Times. The move came not long before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. Wheel Pros had some debt with an interest rate tied to government bond yields, and that also increased the company’s debt costs.\n\nClearlake’s continuation vehicles, known as Icon Partners I and II, reported strong annual returns of 49 percent and 56 percent on average through March 2025 since they were created in 2020 and 2021.\n\nBut Icon Partners III, which held Wheel Pros, was a total loss, and Icon Partners IV and V reported annualized returns of 2.7 percent and 10.1 percent from their creation in 2021 through the end of March.\n\nClearlake hasn’t yet sold or taken public any of the companies in the continuation funds, making a true measure of returns difficult to discern.\n\n“Private equity walks so much in the shadows,” said Yaron Nili, a professor of corporate law at Duke Law School who wrote a paper recently on continuation funds.\n\nBecause so many deals involve private equity firms buying from each other or from themselves, “it will be hard to distinguish between value-generating activities and just collecting and recollecting fees,’’ Mr. Nili said.\n\nSome firms are pushing out the sales timeline even further. This year, private equity firms including Accel-KKR have started selling their companies from one continuation vehicle to another.\n\nThe industry calls these new funds “CV-squared.”",

    "description": "With astonishing speed, the administration has toppled the most cherished pillars of a free society. And the experts agree: It’s all going to get much, much worse.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s assault on the city of Chicago began in September, and it claimed its first casualty quickly. As Reuters would later report, on September 12, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez dropped his kids off at their school in the suburb of Franklin Park on his way to his job at a diner on the northwest side. Villegas-Gonzalez had come to the United States in 2007 to flee the violence in his home state of Michoacán, Mexico—violence wrought by the Mexican government’s militarization of its drug war, a policy encouraged and funded by the United States. (In November, the mayor of the city of Uruapan was assassinated after calling for a crackdown on organized crime.)\n\nDescribed by friends and co-workers as kind and soft-spoken, Villegas-Gonzalez had two sons and met a woman from his hometown as he worked long hours in kitchens around the city.\n\nAfter he dropped off his sons on the morning of September 12, two Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers approached the 38-year-old in his car. He put the vehicle in reverse and attempted to flee. One officer continued to chase him on foot and eventually fired his weapon, striking Villegas-Gonzalez, who crashed into a delivery truck and was pronounced dead an hour later. Officials of the Department of Homeland Security would later say that Villegas-Gonzalez “drove his car at law enforcement officers,” a claim clearly refuted by surveillance video. DHS also claimed the officer who killed Villegas-Gonzalez had been struck and dragged by the car and feared for his life. That allegation is more difficult to confirm or refute—the officer is obscured by the car in the video. The officer was later treated for “minor” injuries.\n\nVillegas-Gonzalez had no criminal record. Over eight years, he had only a series of traffic citations for offenses like a broken taillight and driving without insurance. His most serious citation was for driving 30 miles per hour over the speed limit. In its press release laying out the ICE agents’ version of events, DHS referred to him as “a criminal illegal alien with a history of reckless driving.” The release included the striking line, “The illegal alien was pronounced dead.”\n\nIn the weeks that followed, immigration agents continued to arrest parents and nannies as they dropped off and picked up children from school, a tactic unheard of in prior administrations.\n\nVideos posted to social media showed ICE and Border Patrol agents pointing their guns at unarmed protesters, unnecessarily tackling children and elderly people, and shutting down streets and intersections as they extracted people from their cars. Agents tear-gassed entire neighborhoods, in some cases enveloping schools and even Chicago Police Department officers in clouds of chemical irritant. Videos showed federal officers engaging in Precision Immobilization Technique, or PIT, maneuvers to cut off fleeing vehicles, a dangerous tactic banned or limited by the Chicago Police Department and many other police agencies in the country. On at least three occasions, ICE officers violently pulled U.S. citizens from their cars and detained them, claiming the drivers had deliberately crashed into agents—despite video and witness accounts contradicting the officers’ narrative.\n\nAs October dragged on, the raids intensified. Toward the end of the month, immigration officers gassed a neighborhood just hours before a scheduled Halloween parade for children. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker asked the administration to pause the raids on Halloween night so Chicago kids could go trick-or-treating without fear of being gassed, witnessing traumatic arrests, or seeing their parents or caretakers apprehended and detained. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem refused, calling the request “shameful.” Activists in Los Angeles would later photograph immigration officers, in an especially galling display of cruelty, wearing Halloween masks depicting horror movie villains while conducting immigration raids. When the citizen journalism site L.A. Taco asked DHS for comment, a spokesperson replied, “Happy Halloween.”\n\nTrump has launched similar federal crackdowns in Los Angeles, Washington, Charlotte, Memphis, Minneapolis, and New Orleans, and threatened them in Baltimore, San Francisco, New York, and other cities. He has sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles and Memphis, and has promised to send more to other cities, along with active-duty troops. With astonishing speed, the administration has toppled the most cherished pillars of a free society. Masked secret police now tear-gas entire city streets, jump out from unmarked vehicles to abduct and detain suspected undocumented people, and demand that foreign-looking people (mostly Latino) produce papers on demand. These deportation forces have been told by the president and his advisers to cast a wide net, that immigrants are “animals,” that the activists defending them are “domestic terrorists,” and that the officers themselves have “immunity” from any form of accountability. Meanwhile, administration lawyers have brazenly lied to federal judges to supplement those deportation forces by deploying U.S. troops to the streets of American cities—seeking to break this country’s healthy antipathy toward domestic use of the military policing that dates back to the founding.\n\n“They’re assaulting basic democratic ideals on all fronts,” said Dana Marks, an immigration judge who retired in 2021. “It’s really just classic authoritarianism. It always starts with the minorities. It always starts with the immigrants. If we don’t stop them, it will be American citizens. Congress, the courts, the people, we should all be jumping up and down and screaming about this. We need to be screaming that this isn’t America—that this isn’t who we are.”\n\nI’ve been writing and reporting on policing in the United States for more than 20 years. I’ve spent much of that time writing about the effects of police militarization, or the way military weapons, training, uniforms, and culture have infiltrated domestic law enforcement agencies. But I’ve never seen anything quite like the last six months.\n\nWe’ve seen rapid normalization of abuses we once associated with authoritarian regimes or the old Iron Curtain countries. It’s now routine for masked, unidentifiable government agents to sweep people off the street and whisk them away in unmarked vehicles. Some of those arrested have been quickly shuttled off to detention facilities in other parts of the country without any notification to their families or attorneys. Others have been sent to a third country, often a country in the developing world to which they have no connection. Still others have been explicitly targeted for their political opinions, their activism, or their journalism.\n\nThe phrase “your papers, please” has historically been the sort of demand we associated with Hitler’s SS or the East German Stasi. Immigration officers now routinely stop people who simply “look like” immigrants and demand they prove their citizenship or legal residency. Legal residents who fail to produce documentation on demand have been fined, and flustered immigrants who fail to produce sufficient records or recall a Social Security number have been arrested.\n\nThe administration is also shredding due process. The United States government has extradited immigrants to a torture prison in a foreign country after lying to a judge, then falsely claimed it was helpless to get them back. Immigrants are now stacked in detention centers under already inhumane conditions that appear to be deteriorating. And in a brazen contravention of a principle ingrained in the American founding, the president and his aides have claimed the power to deploy active-duty troops in cities they allege have been overrun with migrants, crime, or homeless people—or merely those overseen by mayors or governors the administration dislikes.\n\nMost alarmingly, the administration no longer feels obligated to even pretend that it’s observing norms and constitutional restrictions. “They just don’t care when judges or the public says they’re violating the law,” one longtime immigration judge, now retired, told me. “That’s unheard of in my lifetime.”\n\nOver the last year, I’ve spoken to and met with immigration attorneys and advocates all over the country. Many who openly spoke with me prior to the 2024 election are no longer willing to be quoted, fearing retaliation against their organizations or their funders, or even against them personally.\n\nIn more recent months, I’ve also interviewed former ICE and Customs and Border Protection officials, and former Immigration Court judges who served across multiple administrations of both parties. Career legal and law enforcement officials tend to be circumspect in their critiques of fellow law enforcement officers. They tend to avoid casual references to police states, or comparing U.S. police agencies to those in authoritarian countries. That’s no longer the case. These career police executives and prosecutors now use language I’ve rarely heard from current or former government officials in my career.\n\n“What we’re seeing is a disgrace to policing,” said Reneé Hall, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, or NOBLE. Hall compares the tactics used by ICE and Border Protection officers to the worst abuses of the civil rights era. “We’ve made a lot of progress in policing,” she said. “They’ve wiped it out in months.… We’re back to letting police target people because of their skin color. We’re letting them kidnap people and take them to undisclosed locations. They’re barging into homes with no warrant. We saw them zip-tie young Black children—U.S. citizens—in Chicago. We’ve seen them use unnecessary force, slam people on the concrete. If I were just watching these incidents on television, I would think that we were not in the United States of America. Back then they wore hoods. Today they wear masks.”\n\n“I’m horrified by what I’ve seen,” said Chris Magnus, who served both as Joe Biden’s CBP commissioner and as police chief of Tucson, Fargo, and Richmond, California. “I wish the public had a better understanding of the harm they’re doing. Because it’s going to take a very long time to undo.”\n\n“I wish I had something better to say than that it’s really bad,” another former senior Department of Justice official told me. “But it’s really fucking bad.”\n\nThe new federal budget Trump recently signed into law will triple the ICE budget and significantly increase the budgets both for Border Protection and for the construction of new detention centers. Trump’s deportation force will be larger than all but a handful of foreign militaries. According to the Brennan Center, the 2025 budget for immigration enforcement already exceeds that of every other federal law enforcement agency combined. And going forward, spending from the “Big Beautiful Bill” on immigration alone will exceed total spending by every state and local police agency in the country.\n\nAnd if there’s one thing this administration has made clear, it’s this: What happened in Chicago will soon be happening in cities around the country.\n\nOne of the more maddening patterns playing out in the federal courts right now is the administration’s exploitation of a legal principle called “the presumption of regularity.” The legal doctrine instructs courts to presume that government lawyers argue in good faith and don’t deliberately misrepresent facts. The doctrine has rarely been a problem, because most administrations have argued in good faith, even when making bad arguments.\n\nThis administration is different. As of this writing, in the months since Trump’s second inauguration, the site Just Security has documented more than 60 instances in which federal courts have ruled that Justice Department attorneys misrepresented the facts or the law. Some judges have done so with unusually frank language, including accusing the administration of outright lying. One judge wrote, “Trust that had been earned over generations has been lost in weeks.”\n\nMany of Trump’s power grabs are grounded in “emergency powers” exceptions that Congress or the courts have built into constitutional or statutory restraints on executive power. These powers have always been a glitch in the system. Dozens of emergencies declared with good intentions at the time have lingered over the years, as new administrations simply renew them without much oversight from Congress. Many concern sanctions against international figures involved in crime, drug smuggling, or weapons trafficking.\n\nBut the current administration has exploited those exceptions like none before. Trump has declared nine new emergencies since January. His tariffs, for example, are based on a law allowing the president to temporarily impose tariffs in response to an emergency. But he has threatened and imposed tariffs for clearly illegal reasons, such as slapping sanctions on Brazil for prosecuting former President Jair Bolsonaro for an attempted coup, or on Canada for accurately using footage of former President Ronald Reagan in a TV commercial.\n\nThe presumption of regularity and the enormous deference the Supreme Court demands courts show to the executive branch mean that any challenge to one of these declarations faces an uphill battle to prove that the administration is misrepresenting the facts or acting in bad faith in each individual case, even though it has shown an almost routine willingness to lie in other cases. And nowhere is this disconnect more striking than in Trump’s obsession with putting troops in American cities.\n\nThe norm against using troops for routine law enforcement is one of America’s most important contributions to democratic governance. It’s a principle we came by honestly, from firsthand experience. Prior to the American Revolution, the British crown stationed soldiers in the streets of Boston to enforce tariffs and import taxes. The soldiers were armed with general warrants that gave them carte blanche to force their way into homes in search of contraband. The abuse of those powers sowed anger and ignited revolutionary fervor.\n\nLessons from Boston lingered after the Revolution and instilled in the Founders a deep distrust of standing armies. “A large standing Army in time of Peace hath ever been considered dangerous to the liberties of a Country,” George Washington wrote in 1783. Four years later, at the Constitutional Convention, James Madison cautioned, “A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty.”\n\nAfter fierce debate, the Framers of the Constitution reluctantly concluded that the threats posed to the new republic still demanded an army at the ready. But to guard against abuses, they divided control of the military between the executive and legislative branches. Still, the fears about domestically deployed troops spilled into the Bill of Rights debates the following year. It’s why we have a Second Amendment (the purpose of the state militia “is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty,” Elbridge Gerry declared), as well as the Third Amendment protection against the forced quartering of soldiers, and the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThis fear of domestically deployed troops has become ingrained in America’s DNA. Presidents have deployed active-duty troops within U.S. borders only sporadically, and almost always temporarily. The most common reason for doing so early in the republic was to put down labor uprisings, rebellions, and riots, and while there are legitimate reasons to question the motivations and propriety of those deployments, they were at least temporary and narrowly defined. The one exception was Reconstruction, which saw federal troops in Southern states for a decade. But that came after a bloody and destructive Civil War.\n\nIn fact, one of the healthier and most encouraging characteristics of American democracy is that this norm has only become more robust over time. One big reason—also a sign of a healthy democracy—is that the principle has become ingrained in the military itself.\n\nIn the late 1980s, for example, the Reagan administration wanted to deploy active-duty troops to fight the drug war on American streets. The plan was thwarted by opposition from the Pentagon. “One of [America’s] great strengths is that ... we do not allow the Army, Navy, and the Marines and Air Force to be a police force,” Marine Lt. Gen. Stephen Olmstead told Congress in 1989. “History is replete with countries that allowed that to happen. Disaster is the result.”\n\nPrior to Trump’s deployment of 700 Marines in Los Angeles in June, no president had deployed active-duty troops to a U.S. city since the Los Angeles riots in 1992. And no president had deployed the military over the objections of a state governor since Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to desegregate Little Rock’s public schools in 1957.\n\nThe deployment of National Guard troops is much more common. But that’s nearly always done by governors calling up their own Guard troops, sometimes to put down riots or protests, but more typically to aid with disaster response after hurricanes and tornadoes. Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles is the first time a president has deployed the Guard over the objections of a state governor since 1965.\n\nTrump is a well-documented admirer of dictators and strongmen and has made clear that he harbors little reverence for this firewall between the military and domestic policing. In his first term, Trump wanted to deploy troops to put down the George Floyd protests, if possible by “shooting them in the legs.” He was thwarted by more levelheaded senior staff, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley. Trump and his second term advisers have made clear that they won’t tolerate that sort of dissent this time around. To fully implement his vision for the country, they’d need to purge the federal government of institutionalists and those who put democratic values and the rule of law over subservience to the president. As JD Vance put it in a 2021 podcast interview, “Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.”\n\nTrump found his enforcer in Pete Hegseth, a man who is not only the least-qualified person ever nominated for secretary of defense, but whose record—which includes allegations of alcohol abuse and sexual assault and running two veterans’ nonprofits into the ground—should have been disqualifying. Trump really only had two prerequisites for the position. He wanted someone who loathed Pentagon institutionalists like Milley and Esper, and someone he could count on to be loyal. Here, Hegseth was more than qualified—embarrassingly so.\n\nHegseth has also echoed Trump’s contempt for the Pentagon’s healthier, democratically grounded principles. In his book, he has argued for enlisting the military in a modern-day crusade. And prior to 2025, other than his weekend co-hosting duties on Fox News, Hegseth was probably best known for lobbying Trump to pardon troops convicted of conscience-shocking war crimes.\n\nAfter his confirmation, Hegseth dutifully began purging the Pentagon of its Milleys and Espers. He dismissed dozens of senior officials with centuries of experience (particularly those who weren’t male and weren’t white). Importantly, he also purged senior-level Judge Advocate General’s Corps, or JAG, officers, the attorneys who provide legal guidance on critical issues like rules of engagement or, say, the legality of deploying troops in U.S. cities.\n\nThe administration has since been caught brazenly lying to federal courts to justify Trump’s military interventions. In Portland, Oregon, a Trump-appointed Federal District Court judge wrote that Trump and the DOJ’s claims that the city was “war ravaged” and “under siege” were “simply untethered to the facts.” The administration was later found to have vastly overstated to the court the number of federal officers it had sent to Portland to protect federal facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, in Chicago, a federal judge rejected the administration’s claims that the city was under “coordinated assault” by unnamed “violent groups … actively aligned with designated domestic terror organizations.” The judge chided the administration for its “lack of candor,” which, she wrote, “calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” and noted a “troubling trend” of DOJ officials “equating protests with riots.”\n\nThe most alarming images to emerge from the first year of Trump’s second term are those of immigration officers in balaclavas, gaiters, and ski masks stopping immigrants on sidewalks and demanding proof of citizenship, chasing day laborers and landscapers through parking lots and city streets, or emerging from unmarked vehicles, snatching people off the streets, then quickly carrying them away.\n\nThose unmarked vehicles are often rented, and officers have been caught swapping out license plates to prevent themselves from being identified—or just not bothering with license plates at all. “The agency clearly wants to appear like a ghost,” one former Baltimore ICE official told NPR. “I have never experienced this.”\n\n“When law enforcement officers of any kind wear masks and withhold their identity, it smacks of tactics that are consistent with an authoritarian government,” said Magnus, the ex-police chief and former head of Border Patrol.\n\n“We’ve had police here for two centuries,” said George Pappas, an immigration judge whom Trump’s Justice Department fired in July. “They didn’t need masks. You use masks when you’re looking to carry out an illegal, extrajudicial operation. This is straight from the fascist playbook.”\n\nThe images and videos of masked agents have provoked alarm in law enforcement and legal communities. They’ve been criticized by groups ranging from the New York City Bar Association to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Even the FBI has asked DHS to remove the masks, pointing out that criminals have committed robberies and sexual assaults while impersonating immigration officers.\n\nBut more to the point, masked secret police jumping out of vans to snatch people up and whisk them away isn’t supposed to happen in a free society. It’s the sort of thing we’ve cited to distinguish ourselves from military juntas or, more recently, from countries like Brazil or the Philippines, where masked officers have carried out horrific extrajudicial killings by the thousands. Or from Russia, where the spectacle of masked police carrying out illegal and undemocratic orders is common enough to have birthed the term “mask show.”\n\nThose distinctions are getting harder and harder to make. Trump has lavished praise on the current and former authoritarian leaders of all three countries, often specifically for their despotism. He praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte explicitly for his drug war policies, which even then were known to include sending masked police teams to execute thousands of drug offenders. Because of those killings, Duterte is now facing trial at the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nAnya Bidwell heads up the Project on Immunity and Accountability for the Institute for Justice, a libertarian law firm. IJ is currently representing two U.S. citizens who were wrongly arrested and detained by immigration officers. “I was born in what was part of the Soviet Union at the time,” she said. “So seeing these kinds of things chills me to the bone. It brings bad memories.”\n\nDHS officials have dismissed such comparisons as hysterical and hyperbolic. They say masking is necessary to prevent activists from “doxing” immigration officers and claim there has been an alarming surge in assaults on those officers. In June, they put the increase in assaults at 413 percent; by July, it was over 700 percent; and by October, it was over 1,000 percent.\n\nThose figures are deceptive. The 2024 baseline figure against which the administration is making these calculations is 10, according to Fox News. That is, there were 10 alleged assaults on ICE officers between January and June 2024. There were 79 in 2025. Meanwhile, over the same period, the number of federal agents participating in deportations and removals has swelled from 6,000 to over 30,000. That puts the assault rate on federal immigration officials (0.23 per 100) exponentially lower than the assault rate on police officers more generally (13.5).\n\nGiven the ramped-up immigration enforcement and the exceptionally violent and aggressive tactics, we’d expect to see an increase in assaults on agents. More interactions, and more violent interactions, mean more opportunities for those interactions to escalate. We also know from surveillance and cell phone videos that agents have arrested and charged people with assault either on little evidence or for defending themselves when assaulted by police. After an ICE officer shot a Chicago woman named Marimar Martinez five times, for example, the administration claimed she had intentionally boxed agents in with her car and fired a gun at them. She was arrested and charged with assault. After that account was contradicted by witnesses and video, Martinez was released without charges.\n\n“The mask issue really burns my biscuits,” said Reneé Hall. “I patrolled in the city of Detroit for nearly 20 years. I lived in the place that I policed. I didn’t get to hide my face. And you know what? Every other police officer across this country arresting people for drugs, for violent criminal acts, for gang violence, show their faces, too. My father was a police officer who was killed on duty. He never would have dreamed of hiding his face from the people he served. These federal officers are coming into these communities from other places, hiding their faces, using unnecessary force and violence, and then just walking away. That isn’t how it works. Hell no to that.”\n\nThere are, of course, limited circumstances in which it may be justified for police officers to shield their identities—officers who investigate organized crime, for example, or who frequently work undercover. So there are no federal laws that prohibit it. But the most important reason U.S. police don’t wear masks isn’t grounded in the law, but in democratic values. “I find the masking absolutely fucking horrific,” said “Bryan,” a former high-ranking official in the DOJ. “It’s not something we do in a free society. It’s what they do under regimes we should never be emulating. It’s about intimidating and terrorizing.”\n\nThat shared understanding has broken down under an administration that seems to emulate those regimes, and that has made clear that it wants to instill fear and terror in immigrant communities. They aren’t letting federal immigration agents terrorize neighborhoods like Chicago’s Little Village because terrifying these places makes them safer. They’re doing it because they don’t believe neighborhoods like Little Village should exist. “The president’s goal is to create fear and anxiety,” said Michael Rodriguez, an alderman whose district includes the heavily Mexican American neighborhood. “It’s a sinister agenda to relitigate the Civil War. I don’t think that’s vitriol. This country is becoming majority minority, and they can’t handle that. So they’re turning to xenophobia to reverse the trend.”\n\nOne needn’t look far to validate Rodriguez’s fears. Stephen Miller, who has been traipsing about the fever swamps of white nationalism for years, has made it no secret that he wants to reduce immigration from nonwhite countries to zero. Trump has echoed the sentiment, bemoaning at one point why so many immigrants come from “shithole countries” (the countries he’s named have all been predominantly Black and brown), and so few from countries like Norway or Switzerland. It’s now been widely reported that by the end of Trump’s second term, the bulk of the country’s refugee program will be redirected to aid white farmers from South Africa.\n\nThe most basic definition of a police state is a society in which the police themselves are above the law. In 2024, Donald Trump campaigned on promises to make police officers completely immune from both criminal prosecution and civil liability. Whether a president could actually do that isn’t as important as the fact that a major party’s nominee for president was, quite literally, promising to turn the country into a police state. And then he won.\n\nThe United States has long had a problem with holding bad cops accountable, and, to be fair, much of that problem predates Donald Trump. The George Floyd protests in 2020 provoked public discussion about qualified immunity, a legal doctrine wholly invented by the Supreme Court in 1967 that makes it extremely difficult to sue state and local police for abuses that violate the Constitution.\n\nLess discussed is that it’s even more difficult—all but impossible, really—to sue federal law enforcement officers. For years, the only real avenue to do so was through the precedent set in the 1971 Supreme Court case Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents. But the court has been gradually chipping away at that case ever since and all but overturned it in 2022. There is one remaining, far more complicated law, the Federal Tort Claims Act, which lets people sue federal police officers, but to sue under that law is an immensely complicated process. The law also bars punitive damages, and it, too, is being eroded by the federal courts.\n\n“People ask me questions like ‘Is it constitutional for them to wear masks?’ or ‘Can they really detain U.S. citizens incommunicado?’ or ‘Is it really legal for them to scare children like that?’” said Bidwell, the IJ attorney. “The answer is that it doesn’t matter if what they do is legal. Because they know that fundamentally they can’t be sued, either as the government itself or individually.”\n\nSo while the administration sets arrest and deportation quotas, attacks immigrants with dehumanizing rhetoric, and tells immigration officers that they’ve been “unleashed,” Bidwell said, there’s nothing pushing back to keep deportation forces in line. “There’s no incentive for these officers to act in a cautious manner that’s compliant with the Constitution.”\n\n“Back when I worked for ICE, there would occasionally be times when they’d inadvertently arrest or detain an American citizen or legal resident,” said Javad Khazaeli, who was an immigration prosecutor during the Obama administration and now works as an immigration defense attorney. (Disclosure: Khazaeli is also a friend.) “When that happened, it would be all hands on deck. It was like, OK, what went wrong here and how do we fix it? Now there’s nothing like that. Now they just don’t care.”\n\nThe immunity problem pervades the chain of command from top to bottom. Thanks to a spate of Supreme Court rulings from the case that all but killed Bivens, to rulings protecting political appointees for policy decisions, to the Supreme Court’s infamous ruling on presidential immunity, everyone is protected, from the Border Patrol officer who abandons a baby in the back seat of a car after detaining his immigrant parents (as happened in a suburb of Chicago) to the Border Patrol commander who tear-gasses elementary schools, to the president who says immigrants are “poisoning the blood of the country.”\n\nThat leaves only criminal liability. It seems unlikely that Trump’s DOJ would ever prosecute an immigration officer, even for egregious abuses. Some have suggested that local police and prosecutors arrest and charge Border Patrol agents caught committing clear crimes, or that states pass laws prohibiting masking by law enforcement, and then arrest officers who violate it. But state and local charges against federal police are almost always removed to federal court, at which point the Trump administration would presumably take over the prosecution and drop the charges. There may be some value in bringing charges anyway to force the issue and draw public attention to these abuses. But they aren’t likely to bring much accountability. It’s yet another policy that, while in place over multiple administrations, could be particularly destructive in the hands of an administration so averse to the rule of law.\n\nIn the end, this administration has exposed how the Supreme Court has made the Bill of Rights almost entirely reliant on the executive branch’s willingness to police itself. If federal police officers can violate constitutional rights with impunity, those rights may as well not exist.\n\nTrump’s immigration agents are erasing accountability in other ways, too. They’re specifically targeting journalists who report on their actions. In Chicago, they tackled and arrested a WGN producer, claiming she threw something at ICE officers—an allegation that was disputed by witnesses. She was later released without charges. In June, the administration arrested an immigrant journalist in Georgia who had been reporting on immigration raids. At his deportation hearing, DOJ lawyers explicitly argued that his journalism was a threat to public safety. He has since been deported. In Los Angeles, immigration officers shot a citizen journalist who had built an online following for streaming ICE raids. They claim he rammed his vehicle into theirs. He was arrested for assaulting a federal officer. In Texas, another freelance journalist and DACA recipient had his status revoked and was arrested for “glorifying terrorism” over social media posts after he advocated at a city council meeting for a Muslim man who had recently been detained.\n\nShortly after the raids on Home Depot parking lots and car washes began in L.A., civil and immigration rights groups filed a lawsuit accusing the administration of racially profiling Latino people. Notably, a federal judge ordered the government to stop, and arrests dropped dramatically. The Supreme Court eventually ordered a pause on that temporary restraining order, allowing raids and stops based on skin color, language, and presence in areas where immigrants live and work to continue.\n\nThere was no majority opinion, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that people who are in the country illegally have no right not to be racially profiled. As for U.S. citizens or legal residents, Kavanaugh wrote, once immigration officials establish legal status, “they promptly let the individual go.”\n\nIn a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that Kavanaugh’s “concurrence improperly shifts the burden onto an entire class of citizens to carry enough documentation to prove that they deserve to walk freely.” It effectively made anyone who “looks immigrant” into a second-class citizen.\n\nKavanaugh added that if immigration officers violate other rights of citizens or legal residents, such as by using excessive force or not “promptly letting that individual go,” those people could always sue. It had been just three years since Kavanaugh joined the majority in all but overturning Bivens, effectively shutting down the right to sue federal law enforcement.\n\nKavanaugh’s claim that citizens and legal residents would simply be “let go” hasn’t held up. About a month after the ruling on racial profiling, ProPublica published a report documenting 170 cases in which immigration officers had detained U.S. citizens. The publication found 130 cases in which U.S. citizens had been arrested for allegedly interfering with immigration operations or assaulting officers but were often never charged. It found over 20 cases in which U.S. citizens were held for more than a day without being permitted to contact an attorney or their families. “Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents,” the publication wrote. “They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem watched.” More recently, immigration officers stopped a Latino U.S. citizen in Los Angeles during a raid on a Home Depot. They arrested the man for an alleged assault and weapons violation, then drove off in his vehicle with the man’s one-year-old daughter still in the back seat. All of this in just the first 10 months of the new administration.\n\n“This version of the Trump administration is a stress test for the United States,” said Bidwell. “They’re very good at identifying cracks in the system, then working at those cracks to widen them. These gaps in accountability for federal police have been around for a long time. We’re going to see how bad it can get when those gaps are exploited by an administration with no respect for constitutional restraints.”\n\nIn a different world, immigration judges might be a check on all this abuse by immigration officers. But that isn’t the world we’re inhabiting. Despite their name, immigration courts have always operated within the executive branch, not the judicial, so they lack the independence of federal courts. Still, previous administrations mostly just tinkered with these courts at the margins, replacing judges as necessary with judges \n\nThe following month, the firings began. Since February, DOJ has fired at least 98 immigration judges, and another 55 or so left voluntarily after seeing the writing on the wall. “Amanda” was one of the first judges fired in February. “I was never told why I was let go,” she said. “A lot of people were shocked. I don’t think anyone would have described me as a liberal judge. I’m a former immigration prosecutor. The feeling was that if they’d fire someone like me, no one was safe. Which is probably the message DOJ wanted to send.”\n\nAmanda said there was one incident in her record, when she worked for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, that may have flagged Trump’s DOJ. “I was once reported for engaging in ‘illegal DEI,’” she said. “One of the individuals I supervised moved the seating arrangements for African American staff to the same undesirable hallway, causing staff to refer to that hall as ‘Jim Crow Row.’ I told her she had to stop doing that. When this new administration called for reporting of ‘illegal DEI,’ the staff member forwarded an email to me to notify me that she had reported me. Maybe that’s why I was fired. But my termination notice was a few sentences long. So who knows.”\n\nIn October, the DOJ announced that it would begin appointing military lawyers from the JAG Corps to serve as temporary immigration judges—the officers who had survived Hegseth’s purge. The move has been widely derided in the legal community as an effort to turn the courts into little more than a rubber stamp for the administration. “Immigration law is incredibly complicated,” Pappas said. “There’s just no way you’re going to be able to pick it up in a matter of weeks and treat these cases with the judgment and care they require.”\n\nThe most immediate effect of the administration’s politicization of immigration courts will be in denials of asylum claims and in expedited removal orders and deportations. “Immigration courts are like litigating death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” said Marks, the longtime immigration judge who retired in 2021. “When you deny asylum to someone, there’s a real possibility that person will turn up dead after they’re deported.”\n\nTrump has also purged the board that hears immigration appeals and replaced those members with his own appointees. The new, Trump-friendly version of the board then announced that judges could no longer order bond for anyone in the country illegally. That decision—which has been roundly rejected when challenged in federal courts—potentially means millions more people in federal detention, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating.\n\nThis, too, is all part of the plan. Miller, Tom Homan, and the architects of the child separation policy during Trump’s first term have made clear that one goal of their immigration policy is to disincentivize people from coming to the United States by inflicting suffering on those who do. One way to make people suffer is to take away their children. Another is to stuff them into overcrowded cells, deny them access to a shower, medication, and clean food and water, and make it all but impossible for them to contact their families or attorneys. Human rights groups have already documented these and other inhumane conditions at detention facilities all over the country, including at brand new centers like “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida.\n\nWhen Trump took office in January 2025, there were 39,000 people in ICE custody. By September, there were more than 60,000, and there will be capacity for around 107,000 by January 2026. As of this writing, 23 people have died this year in ICE custody. That’s the most since 2005, and more than the previous three years combined. The conditions faced by those in custody are only likely to get worse as deportation efforts continue to ramp up.\n\nAt the same time, the administration has hollowed out the offices within DHS and DOJ that oversee detention facilities. “There’s no oversight. There’s no reporting. There’s no access,” said “Dan,” a longtime former DHS employee and immigration prosecutor. “Until this administration, if a lawyer or an NGO complained about inhumane conditions, that was something we took very seriously. Now they just don’t care. It’s fully part of the plan. They’re open about it. You put people in detention, deny them access to a lawyer, and just continue to squeeze them until they’re so miserable that they give up their rights.”\n\nIn the midst of all of this, the Pentagon began engaging in this administration’s most egregious and brazen breach of due process to date: bombing boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, off the coasts of Colombia and Venezuela. The Pentagon claimed the occupants of the boats were “narco-terrorists,” but provided no evidence to support the accusation—nor would it be justified to kill them if they were. Smuggling drugs is not a capital crime in the United States. It also seems unlikely that most of the boats were bound for the United States, and neither Colombia nor Venezuela produces or exports significant quantities of fentanyl, the drug most responsible for overdose deaths in America.\n\nThe strikes are illegal, under both domestic and international law. The United States is not engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels, drug cartels are not terrorists or enemy combatants, and the administration has provided no evidence beyond its say-so that the people it has killed fit into any of those categories. The administration later conceded that it doesn’t actually know the identities of the people it is killing, but that it would be legally justified to kill anyone who is “as much as three hops away from a known member” of a designated terrorist organization. Setting aside the fact that, again, drug cartels are not terrorist groups, sociological studies estimate that the average person knows about 600 people. This means that under the “three-hop rule,” which allows authorities to pursue individuals three “hops” away from the target, each member of a terrorist group would make about 216 million people eligible for legal assassination by the U.S. government.\n\nAs of publication, the administration had killed more than 83 people in 21 strikes. The strikes embody Trump’s most authoritarian instincts—unchecked and unreviewable executive power; crass imperialism; a feverish, 1980s-era approach to illicit drugs (Trump has frequently said that drug dealers should be executed); and xenophobic bigotry, particularly toward the developing world. Both Trump and Vice President Vance have even joked about the possibility that the strikes may have killed innocent people, delivering wry bons mots about how Caribbean fishermen probably don’t go out on the water much anymore.\n\nThe strikes are abominable, reckless acts of violence in and of themselves. But it isn’t difficult to envision how an administration with so little regard for law, human life, and due process might make the leap to think it can also carry out extrajudicial executions inside the United States, particularly one run by a president who equates criticism of him with treason, likens immigrants to vermin, and calls his opponents “the enemy within.” This, after all, is an administration already trying to legally define peaceful protesters and their supporters as “terrorists,” the same term it uses to justify those extrajudicial killings.\n\nThere would certainly be far more popular and political backlash to such strikes within U.S. borders, or against U.S. citizens. But public opinion isn’t a dependable bulwark against an administration that has anointed itself judge, jury, and executioner. It’s of little comfort in the throes of an administration that believes it can kill on demand, regardless of domestic or international law, and feels no obligation to justify its decision to do so to Congress, the courts, or the public.\n\nPerhaps that sounds overwrought. But if you had suggested in 2024 that if elected, the Republican candidate for president would instruct federal police to sweep immigrants off the street—some of whom were here legally, and most of whom had no prior criminal record—put them on airplanes, and send them to a Central American gulag, all without ever letting them speak to a judge, you’d also have been called overwrought. But it is happening.\n\nIf you had suggested 10 years ago that federal agencies would use Nazi, fascist, and white nationalist iconography and allude to explicitly white supremacist literature in their social media posts, or that the Department of Homeland Security would use nativist, blood-and-soil messaging about preserving Western heritage in its outreach to recruit new immigration officers, you’d also have been called overwrought. But this, too, is happening.\n\nIf you had suggested during the Obama era that a U.S. president would encourage a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol in order to prevent his successor from taking office, that said president would then be reelected, would pardon all of the insurrectionists, and then go about erasing that history from official records, you’d also have been called overwrought. But Trump has done all these things.\n\nDuring the week I finished this story, a federal judge ruled that the conditions at the main immigration detention facility in Chicago were “inhumane.” U.S. District Court Judge Robert Gettleman found that prisoners were being forced to sleep on top of one another, slept next to overflowing toilets, were provided with no beds or access to showers, didn’t have adequate food or medicine, and were forced to drink water that “tasted like sewer.”\n\nThe following day, in a separate lawsuit, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis ruled that federal immigration officers in the city were using levels of force that “shocks the conscience.” She found that Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and other government agents had lied to her in court proceedings. In an impassioned opinion, Ellis mounted an eloquent defense of both the city of Chicago and American values, quoting Carl Sandburg and John Adams. She also ruled that federal forces were deliberately undermining free speech by detaining and beating protesters. “The freedom of speech is a principal pillar in a free Government,” she wrote, quoting Benjamin Franklin, “when this support is taken away the Constitution is dissolved, and Tyranny is erected on its Ruins.”\n\nThe next day, Bovino and his agents were back in Little Village, clashing with protesters. In the days that followed, they dragged a day care teacher out of her school as she screamed, used tear gas on large groups of protesters, and pepper-sprayed a one-year-old (they denied at least the pepper-spraying of the infant). Later, Bovino and his agents posed in front of Cloud Gate, the iconic sculpture more commonly called the Bean. According to local reports, the officers shouted out “Little Village!” as they mugged for a group selfie.\n\nJust a few days before Ellis’s ruling, in a prime-time interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, President Trump was asked if in tear-gassing entire neighborhoods, beating U.S. citizens, terrorizing children, and lying to federal courts—if given all of that—he thought that perhaps his deportation force in Chicago may have gone too far.\n\nHe answered, “I don’t think they’ve gone far enough.”",

    "description": "Why powerful AI might arrive sooner than we think",
    "fullText": "Dwarkesh Patel recently published a compelling essay arguing that today's AI systems are still many years away from AGI. His core view is that they are missing key components of cognition, most importantly true continual learning. Despite impressive benchmark performance, current models aren't yet economically transformative because they can't learn on the job the way humans do. Instead, labs are \"pre-baking\" skills into models using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), constructing bespoke training environments for coding, Excel, browser navigation, and countless other narrow tasks. To Dwarkesh, this reveals a fundamental limitation. As he puts it, \"Human workers are valuable precisely because we don't need to build schleppy training loops for every small part of their job.\"\n\nIt's a persuasive argument. But the question I keep coming back to is: is the elegant solution a hard requirement or can we sort of duct tape our way to AGI?\n\nConsider Deep Blue. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in a six-game chess match that captivated the world. Deep Blue did not understand chess in any human sense. It had no intuition, no internalized strategy, no aesthetic judgment. It simply evaluated millions of positions per second and searched deeper than any human could. One move in Game 2 unsettled Kasparov so badly that he accused IBM of cheating; it felt too creative, too human. But it was nothing of the sort. It was brute force, systematically exploring the possibility space. Twenty years later, AlphaZero learned through self-play, developing a fluid, intuitive style that grandmasters described as alien yet beautiful. AlphaZero played chess the \"right\" way. Both systems accomplished the goal of playing chess better than humans, but Deep Blue got there first. The ugly solution won.\n\nAre we in a similar situation today?\n\nDwarkesh looks at the current AI landscape and sees missing categories of cognition. Labs are painstakingly constructing verification environments for individual skills, and to him this is evidence that models lack genuine generalization. Real jobs, he argues, consist of hundreds of small, shifting tasks that vary from day to day, even for the same person. You can't automate them with predefined skill sets. In a way he's recapitulating the old expert systems vs learning systems debate. Manually coding how to behave was too brittle, so it never worked.\n\nInterestingly, his view does stand in contrast to many lab leaders. A skeptical reader will surely argue that's because they have a strong incentive to exaggerate the pace of progress, but for the purposes of this discussion, let's take their statements at face value. Dario Amodei believes the current paradigm will get us there, predicting powerful AI as early as 2026. Sam Altman and Jakub Pachocki have offered concrete timelines, an intern-level AI researcher by late 2026 and a fully automated one by 2028, backed by over a trillion dollars in infrastructure commitments. Mark Chen, OpenAI's Chief Research Officer, has pushed back on the idea that scaling is exhausted, hinting that they have made some important breakthroughs in pretraining specifically.\n\nThis perspective is not unanimous. Demis Hassabis believes additional breakthroughs are needed on the level of the transformer, and Andrej Karpathy estimates something like a decade. This camp tends to be more neuroscience-inspired, believing the current architectures are missing something fundamental.\n\nSo what's the actual bottleneck?\n\nDwarkesh's argument largely boils down to three problems all related to memory. First, current models are sample inefficient—they need far more examples to learn something than a human would. Second, what they learn isn't general enough to transfer across contexts. Third, they can't continue to learn on the job the way humans do.\n\nThis last problem is intrinsic to how gradient descent works. When a model learns, it adjusts billions of parameters at once, a global update that touches the entire network. This makes the system brittle; new information can overwrite old information, a problem called catastrophic forgetting. So today’s models come with a frozen pretrained brain and rely on stuffing relevant information into each prompt, called a context window. These are crude substitutes. Everything must be reprocessed with every response. There's no dynamic working memory, no graceful fading of irrelevant information, no seamless integration with long-term storage.\n\nThis matters for a number of reasons. Without the ability to integrate new information into its world model, it can only grasp new tasks superficially. It can't build on what it learned yesterday. Models struggle to navigate complex software because they can't track things the way you do. Photoshop is intuitive to an experienced user, but to a model with fragmented memory, every menu is half-familiar, every action a guess. These aren't signs of low intelligence. They're signs of a specific limitation, not dissimilar to a human disability. Blindness or deafness will make some tasks virtually impossible, but this says nothing about their underlying intelligence. Similarly, a model can be extraordinarily capable and still fail at tasks that require persistent memory.\n\nAll of this is accurate. The open question is whether it represents a hard scientific boundary or is just a matter of iterative engineering.\n\nHuman memory itself is not a single, elegant system. It's a collection of specialized mechanisms layered together by evolution. Most day-to-day learning does not instantly integrate deeply into the brain. It involves holding information in working memory, encoding episodes, retrieving associations, and slowly consolidating over time.\n\nSeen this way, perhaps the models aren't so far from functional equivalence after all. Retrieval over long interaction histories so a system remembers what you discussed weeks ago. Persistent preference and project files injected into context. Lightweight fine-tuning methods like LoRA applied periodically rather than continuously. External memory via tool use, where models write notes to themselves and read them back. Better working-memory mechanisms layered on top of existing architectures. None of this requires brand-new science, and much of it already exists in partial form.\n\nThese solutions are undeniably schleppy. They are brittle and can fail in surprising ways. Skeptics rightly point out that unlike chess, which is a closed system with perfect information, the real world is an open environment where errors can compound. That's all true, but we are no longer discussing hypotheticals. People are already using these systems for real work. Coding agents are writing and debugging software semi-autonomously. Customer service systems are starting to handle basic help desk queries. Legal research can often be handled end to end by an extended thinking model. There's still a capability gap, but it is shrinking.\n\nIt's important to recognize that 2025 was less a year of huge new models than one of bringing the frontier to everyone at a reasonable cost. That infrastructure buildout absorbed resources that might otherwise have gone toward pushing capabilities. If progress has felt slower than expected, this is part of the reason. It's easy to anchor on the current pace and assume it's the new normal. That would be a mistake.\n\nThe hardware trajectory is significant. Nvidia’s GB300 NVL72 racks use 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs acting as a single massive unit. Microsoft has announced the first large-scale production cluster with over 4,600 of these racks, claiming it will enable training models with hundreds of trillions of parameters and reduce training times from months to weeks. Depending on workload, this represents anywhere from a 4x improvement in training speed to a 10x reduction in inference costs compared to the previous generation. When you can throw an order of magnitude more compute at context management, retrieval, and verification, many of today's clumsy workarounds start to look far more viable.\n\nWe do need solutions to memory and some degree of continual learning, but Dwarkesh may also be understating how much current models already generalize. No one built a special training pipeline for GeoGuessr, yet general models can perform at a borderline superhuman level. This requires inferring the geographic location of pictures from subtle cues like vegetation, signage, architecture, and sun angle. And long before job-specific reinforcement learning was used, models already showed remarkable capability across many professions, just from compressing the internet.\n\nThe labs' heavy investment in RLVR could be viewed less like a confession of architectural inadequacy and more like a pragmatic choice. RLVR improves effectiveness on tasks that matter commercially. It simply juices the value of current models.\n\nThe benchmark, OSWorld, provides a useful case in point of my argument. This benchmark tests models on everyday computer tasks in a virtual machine: adding page numbers to a document, exporting a CSV from a spreadsheet, configuring browser settings. Over the past year, success rates have climbed from under 10% to over 60%, approaching the human baseline of 72%. But a closer look reveals something interesting: much of this progress comes from models finding workarounds. About 15% of tasks can be completed using only terminal commands, no GUI required. Another 30% can be largely solved with Python scripts instead of clicking through menus. The benchmark was designed to measure GUI manipulation, something models are known to struggle with, but instead of failing, they just found a workaround.\n\nThis discussion largely hinges on how far these workarounds can ultimately go. The debate isn't about whether human-like continual learning would be powerful. It would be. It's about what exactly is required to cross the human threshold of reliable knowledge work. History suggests that inelegant, resource-intensive solutions arrive first, especially when the incentives are overwhelming.\n\nRay Kurzweil's long-running prediction of human-level AI by 2029 is relevant here. Kurzweil's track record on specific technologies is mixed, but he has been remarkably prescient about the pace and magnitude of technological progress. His law of accelerating returns is all about markets. Computing power compounds due to incentives and what’s allowed by physics. Capital, talent, and institutional effort then develop new technologies enabled by that compute.\n\nHumans are best understood as what E.O. Wilson called a “superorganism,” similar to ants or termites. We cooperate at an unprecedented scale. And this global superorganism has slowly been turning itself toward the production of machine intelligence ever since ChatGPT arrived in late 2022. Nation-states, corporations, supply chains, research communities, and capital markets are all aligning around the same attractor. This applies immense pressure to each barrier to progress.\n\nIf the current paradigm fails to reach AGI, it will be because continual learning turns out to be a hard scientific barrier rather than an engineering challenge. But given the scale of investment, the pace of hardware progress, and the growing stack of workable approximations, I'd bet on the engineers.\n\nIt's unclear when we will get the elegant, human-like mind we are waiting for. But if history is any guide, that distinction may not matter much. When Deep Blue won, Kasparov felt it was a trick. He sensed a human creativity that simply wasn't there and accused IBM of cheating. We are likely walking into the same psychological trap. We will look at these schleppy, duct-taped systems and insist they are just parroting data or faking reasoning. We will call it a parlor trick right up until the moment it outperforms us. At that point, like Kasparov, we will have to accept that the mechanism matters less than the move.",

    "description": "AI chatbots are generating fake titles that people insist are real.",
    "fullText": "Everyone knows that AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini can often hallucinate sources. But for the folks tasked with helping the public find books and journal articles, the fake AI bullshit is really taking its toll. Librarians sound absolutely exhausted by the requests for titles that don’t exist, according to a new post from Scientific American.\n\nThe magazine spoke with Sarah Falls, the chief of researcher engagement at the Library of Virginia, who estimates that about 15% of all emailed reference questions that they receive are generated by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. And the requests often include questions about fake citations.\n\nWhat’s more, Falls suggests that people don’t seem to believe librarians when they explain that a given record doesn’t exist, a trend that’s been reported elsewhere like 404 Media. Many people really believe their stupid chatbot over a human who specializes in finding reliable information day in and day out.\n\nA recent post from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) titled, “Important notice: AI generated archival reference,” provides more evidence that librarians are just exhausted with it all.\n\n“If a reference cannot be found, this does not mean that the ICRC is withholding information. Various situations may explain this, including incomplete citations, documents preserved in other institutions, or— increasingly—AI-generated hallucinations,” the organization said. “In such cases, you may need to look into the administrative history of the reference to determine whether it corresponds to a genuine archival source.”\n\nYes it happened to me 🫠, I went to a bookstore for a totally plausible old French metaphor book mentioned by ChatGPT a year ago, only to discover that it does not exist.\n\n— Joanne Boisson (@joanneboisson.bsky.social) December 9, 2025 at 4:31 AM\n\nThe year seems to have been filled with examples of fake books and journal articles created with AI. A freelance writer for the Chicago Sun-Times generated a summer reading list for the newspaper with 15 books to recommend. But ten of the books didn’t exist. The first report from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s so-called Make America Healthy Again commission was released in May. A week later, reporters at NOTUS published their findings after going through all of the citations. At least seven didn’t exist.\n\nYou can’t blame everything on AI. Papers have been retracted for giving fake citations since long before ChatGPT or any other chatbot came on the scene. Back in 2017, a professor at Middlesex University found at least 400 papers citing a non-existent research paper that was essentially the equivalent of filler text.\n\nVan der Geer, J., Hanraads, J.A.J., Lupton, R.A., 2010. The art of writing a scientific article. J Sci. Commun. 163 (2) 51-59.\n\nIt’s gibberish, of course. The citation seems to have been included in many lower quality papers—likely due to laziness and sloppiness rather than an intent to deceive. But it’s a safe bet that any authors of those pre-AI papers would have probably been embarrassed about their inclusion. The thing about AI tools is that too many humans have come to believe our chatbots are more trustworthy than humans.\n\nAs someone who gets lots of local history queries, can confirm there’s been a big increase in people starting their history research with GenAI/LLM (which just spews out fake facts and hallucinated rubbish) who then wonder why they can’t find anything at all to corroborate it.\n\n— Huddersfield Exposed (@huddersfield.exposed) December 9, 2025 at 2:28 AM\n\nWhy might users trust their AI over humans? For one thing, part of the magic trick that AI pulls is speaking in an authoritative voice. Who are you going to believe, the chatbot you’re using all day or some random librarian on the phone? The other problem might have something to do with the fact that people develop what they believe are reliable tricks for making AI more reliable.\n\nSome people even think that adding things like “don’t hallucinate” and “write clean code” to their prompt will make sure their AI only gives the highest quality output. If that actually worked, we imagine companies like Google and OpenAI would just add that to every prompt for you. If it does work, boy, have we got a lifehack for all the tech companies currently terrified of the AI bubble bursting.",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI - Japanese-themed manga and anime have been barred from one of China's largest comic conventions about a week before the show begins in late December, Hong Kong media reported, amid a continuing diplomatic row between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe decision was notified to participants last Friday ahead of the two-day Comicup convention scheduled to be held next weekend in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou near Shanghai, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nExhibitors and visitors were informed by the event's organizers that there would be a \"full-scale adjustment\" of content toward \"a new Chinese style\" theme across the venue due to the \"current social environment and our cultural obligations,\" the Hong Kong newspaper said Tuesday.\n\nThe exhibition areas themed around American and European content did not seem to be affected at the event featuring some 7,000 booths, which has become a massive marketplace for creators of derivative works based on various anime, comics, and game fan groups, according to the report.\n\nWhile the notification did not name Japan, several dozen exhibitors featuring Japanese anime and other themed content said on social media that their booths had been cancelled for reasons \"well-known to all\" and \"factors beyond control,\" the SCMP said.\n\nA similar comic convention held in Shanghai in October drew hundreds of thousands of visitors. The paper quoted a woman whose booth was supposed to have featured artwork of the Japanese manga \"Let's Go Karaoke!\" as saying, \"I am feeling utterly helpless and sad.\"\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the two Asian neighbors stems from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's parliamentary remarks last month that suggested an attack on Taiwan could constitute a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Japan, prompting possible involvement of the Self-Defense Forces.\n\nBeijing has since ramped up its retaliatory measures, including urging its citizens not to visit Japan, suspending seafood imports from the neighboring country and canceling cultural events featuring Japanese artists.\n\nMeanwhile, manga and animation events scheduled for January in such Chinese cities as Shenzhen in Guangdong Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were postponed due to \"force majeure,\" according to organizers.",

U.S. District Judge Anne M.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

    "fullText": "Bernice King, the daughter of late civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., is pushing back against Vice President JD Vance’s comments surrounding white privilege in the U.S.\n\nKing sounded off on social media, writing, “@ JDVance Help me with this. In my 62 years, I don’t recall white people ever having to apologize for being white in America. The courage to tell the truth about the advantages white people have had in this country is the real issue.”\n\n“It’s time to stop reframing accountability as injury and start reckoning honestly with history, power, and responsibility—so we can move toward repair justice, and a shared future where dignity is not selective,” she added.\n\nVance: In the United States of America, you don't have to apologize for being white anymore. pic.twitter.com/QikIDkXNy5\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 21, 2025\n\nOver the weekend, Turning Point USA, or AmFest 2025, took place for the first time since Charlie Kirk‘s assassination on Sept. 10, 2025. In his speech, Vance encouraged people to join ICE, but it’s his comments about white privilege that folks can’t stop talking about.\n\n“In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore,” Vance told the crowd.\n\nUnsurprisingly, countless people, including rapper Ice Cube’s son, O’Shea Jackson Jr., who co-hosts the No Contest Wrestling podcast, slammed Vance for his remarks.\n\n“When the f**k did you have to?” Jackson wrote on X.\n\n“When JD Vance declares that white people no longer have to apologize for being white, what he’s truly signaling is a license for them to embrace open racism without remorse—emboldening them to spout bigoted rhetoric with brazen impunity, just as he and Trump do,” another person wrote on X. “This isn’t about pride in identity; it’s a dog whistle for unchecked prejudice, freeing supporters to echo their leaders’ divisive slurs against immigrants, minorities, and anyone who challenges the status quo.”\n\n“If being white is the only thing going for you I really feel sorry for you,” someone else added.\n\nOn the other hand, some argued there’s no such thing as white privilege: “I know plenty of white Americans living the exact same struggle as people in the Black community same wages, same bills, same stress, same lack of opportunity,” they commented under The Jasmine Brand’s Facebook post.\n\nAs Blavity reported, Vance took shots at Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett at the Turning Point USA America Fest.\n\n“The record speaks for itself. She wants to be a senator, though her street girl persona is about as real as her nails,” Vance said.\n\nCrockett was quick to fire back at Vance during her appearance on MS NOW’s The Weekend: Primetime.\n\n“When they can tell me about their policies that are helping Texas, then we can have a conversation, until then, take whatever shots you want to take at me, because I have been a Black woman my entire life,” she said.\n\nCrockett, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Texas, also called out the fact that Vance should be more concerned about the real reason why he’s Trump’s VP.\n\n“Baby, let’s talk about your record, because the only reason you’re the vice president is because the current President tried to have his last [vice] president killed,” she said, referencing the January 6 Capitol attack in which Trump supporters chanted “Hang Mike Pence” following Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe post MLK’s Daughter Bernice Claps Back At JD Vance Saying White People Don’t Have To Apologize For Being White appeared first on Blavity.",

    "description": "It's an indication of a broader trend.",
    "fullText": "A fishing competition off the coast of Libya took an odd turn when an angler hooked a species a long way from its natural range.\n\nThe Libya Observer reported that a Red Sea pennant fish was spotted for the first time in Libyan coastal waters. As the name suggests, the fish is a native of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden but has since spread across the Indo-Pacific region. The unusual discovery has prompted concerns by the competition's organizers, the Benghazi Scout Commission, over the potential harm the pennant fish could inflict outside of its native range.\n\nIt's also another indication that the Mediterranean is heating up. The UN's Environment Programme notes the region is warming about 20% faster than the global average. Among the consequences is the migration of invasive species. The Mediterranean has been dealing with interlopers ever since the Suez Canal opened in 1869, a phenomenon known as the Lessepsian migration.\n\nIt's not yet clear if the Red Sea pennant will establish itself in Libyan waters or if it will do significant harm, as not every uninvited guest from the Suez has been a problem. However, once an invasive species does take hold, the consequences are alarming for native fauna and flora.\n\nBecause they have no natural system of control, nothing is stopping their populations from getting out of hand. Invasive species outcompete natives for resources and disrupt the food web. When an invasive predator shows up in a new area, its prey is utterly helpless against it. For example, the UK's water vole population dropped 94% because of North American minks imported for fur.\n\nPrevention is the preferred course of action for invasive species, but in this case, that horse has long since bolted. Aside from occasional mishaps by ships, the Suez Canal is going to stay open, and Libya is much too close to Egypt to realistically stem the tide of invasive marine species.\n\nSo it's a question of raising awareness about the risks of invasive species and working with local stakeholders to form effective measures to manage them. If that fails, if the species is safe to consume, they can always grab a fork.\n\nDo you think humans are doing enough to protect endangered animals?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor bargain hunters, Costco has long been a go-to destination. The warehouse giant famously still sells its hot dog and soda combo for $1.50 — the same price it launched with back in the mid-1980s. But not every Costco item has held its price as stubbornly as the hot dog combo.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco began selling 1-ounce gold bars. At the time, shoppers could choose between two types: the PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan bar and the Rand Refinery bar, priced at $1,979.99 and $1,949.99, respectively, according to Business Insider. Despite the hefty price tag, both quickly became hot sellers (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nFast forward to today, and not much has changed — except the price.\n\nAs of December 2025, the Pamp Suisse bar sells for $4,119.99, an increase of 108% (2).\n\nThe jump in price is in line with the broader gold market, which has surged roughly 65% over the course of 2025. What’s more surprising is the continued demand.\n\nCustomers are now restricted to “one transaction per membership, with a maximum of 4 units per 24 hours”, according to the Costco website (3).\n\nGold has long been viewed as a way to preserve purchasing power. Unlike fiat currencies, it can’t be printed at will by central banks.\n\nIt’s also considered a classic safe haven. Gold isn’t tied to any one country, currency or economy, and in times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to it — driving prices higher.\n\nThat’s exactly what appears to be happening now. Markets are getting whipsawed by tariff uncertainty, rising deficits and global tensions — and gold has emerged as a rare bright spot.\n\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, also highlighted gold’s importance as part of a resilient portfolio.\n\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he told CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier (4).”\n\nGold hit a peak price of $4,371.78 per ounce in October, and many experts expect it to continue to rise as stock market outlooks get shaky (5).",

    "description": "Copper prices have rallied over 35% so far this year amid supply shortages, surging global demand, and tariff uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMetals have had a record year with recent surges in gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) prices, but there’s a third metal hitting its own record highs. Copper prices have rallied by more than 35% this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009, driven higher by rising tech demand, supply constraints, and tariff uncertainty.\n\nGlobal copper (HG=F) prices officially surpassed $12,000 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday for the first time ever and continued to march higher on Wednesday.\n\nEach type of metal reacts slightly differently to economic conditions, and copper is no exception. However, unlike gold and silver, copper isn’t so directly influenced by investor sentiment or economic expectations. Its price movements can typically be attributed to physical growth and expansion.\n\nCopper is often viewed as a barometer for the economy. It plays a central role in power grids, construction, industrial machinery, and more. When there’s a demand for those types of goods or services, it’s typically a good sign that the economy has a clean bill of health — giving copper its nickname: Doctor Copper.\n\nRising copper prices often signal strong industrial demand and a rapidly growing economy, while falling prices may indicate an economic slowdown, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Copper is “a major beneficiary of investments in grid and power infrastructure globally, as AI and defence heighten the need for robust and secure energy networks,” wrote Goldman Sachs Research analyst Eoin Dinsmore in a note.\n\nGold is seen as more of a “safe-haven” asset and a hedge against inflation. Silver straddles the line between gold and copper and has both investment and industrial purposes. Copper, however, is predominantly industrial. It’s not typically purchased to be stored like gold or silver but meant to be used, which is why it’s usually the strongest indicator, of the three metals, that the economy is moving in the right direction.\n\nThere are a few key reasons that copper is experiencing a surge right now. Major copper-producing regions such as Chile and Indonesia have faced supply challenges and environmental disasters that have contributed to a global copper shortage and a tighter market.\n\n“After essentially flat mine supply growth expected this year, our 2026 mine supply growth estimates have fallen to only around +1.4%, or about 500 kmt lower than our estimates at the beginning of the year,” said Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, in a statement.\n\nA dip in supply isn’t the only factor that’s pushing prices higher. In July, the Trump administration issued tariffs on several categories of copper imports, putting additional pressure on the market. At the same time, heavy investment in the AI sector is significantly boosting demand because of its reliance on copper for data centers.\n\nOne source estimates that hyperscale AI data centers can use up to 50,000 tons of copper per facility.\n\nAs far as where prices are headed, JPMorgan Global Research expects copper prices to reach $12,500 a ton in the second quarter of 2026, ultimately averaging around $12,075 a ton for the full year.\n\nWhile researchers are optimistic that copper prices will continue on an upward trend, experts say the long-term implications of recent price surges remain uncertain.\n\n“The intersection of tariffs and copper prices in July 2025 highlights the complex dynamics of global trade and commodity markets,” said David Koch, CFP and director of portfolio management at Halbert Hargrove. “While the immediate effect has been a sharp rise in copper prices, the long-term consequences will depend on how markets, governments, and industries adapt to this new trade environment.”\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nGold and silver prices have been on a tear, with silver prices increasing by more than 100% year to date.

    "fullText": "CBS News aired the Kennedy Center Honors on Tuesday using a sharply edited Donald Trump monologue and dodging his controversial “Trump Kennedy Center” rebrand.\n\nThe new Trump-appointed Kennedy Center board voted on Dec. 18 to rename the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” leading to almost immediate legal action.\n\nDespite the 79-year-old president trying to muscle the rebrand into the country’s living rooms while hosting what he called “THE TRUMP KENNEDY CENTER HONORS” on Tuesday evening, CBS aired the 48th Kennedy Center Honors with the institution’s long-standing name, noted The Washington Post.\n\nBehind the scenes, the paper said CBS News standards had circulated guidance telling staff to stick with “Kennedy Center,” noting the board’s vote alone doesn’t make the change official because Congress would have to approve it.\n\nThe network also trimmed Trump’s opening remarks from roughly 12 minutes to about two minutes for viewers at home, cutting out some of his freewheeling asides—including his crack at the laughing crowd as “miserable, horrible people.”\n\nThe on-air snub came as CBS’s relationship with Trump has taken repeated hits, often with 60 Minutes at the center.\n\nIn July, Paramount, the network’s parent company, agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s presidential library to settle his $20 billion lawsuit over what he claimed was deceptive editing of a Kamala Harris interview, a deal the company announced without an apology.\n\nSince then, Trump has continued his attack on the network, even as CBS has been accused of bending over backwards to placate him. In November, it aired a 28-minute version of a Trump 60 Minutes sit-down with Norah O’Donnell, as well as a separate 73-minute extended cut.\n\nYet it left out a tense exchange in which Trump expressed irritation over questions about a crypto mogul he pardoned amid reports of a $2 billion deal tied to a Trump family crypto venture. The edits also omitted Trump’s comment about CBS’s payout related to the settlement.\n\nThen came the network’s leadership turmoil. After Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, 42, installed Bari Weiss, 41, as CBS News editor-in-chief in October, the MAGA-curious boss spiked a 60 Minutes segment at the eleventh hour last weekend.\n\nIt featured interviews with deportees sent by the Trump administration to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador, with Weiss claiming the segment needed more work before it could air. Her last-minute decision sparked concerns of White House interference and triggered fury inside the newsroom.\n\nThe episode spiraled further when the segment surfaced anyway after a Canadian broadcaster aired it, and Paramount Skydance began issuing copyright takedowns to scrub reposts.\n\nSet against concerns over political pressure and corporate leverage, the network’s refusal to call the venue the “Trump Kennedy Center” on its biggest annual cultural broadcast—and cutting Trump’s screen time—has raised more than a few eyebrows.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted CBS and the Kennedy Center for comment.",

    "description": "This may have implications for humans.",
    "fullText": "Dozens of laboratory mice allowed to roam a large outdoor enclosure returned to a typical level of mouse anxiety after just one week, researchers observed, suggesting that 'rewilding' may prevent lab-induced fear responses from developing in the first place.\n\nThe researchers, from Cornell University in the US, say their findings raise questions about the best ways to run anxiety tests on animals in the lab. This could also teach us something about how anxieties first begin to form in animals, including ourselves.\n\n\"We put them in the field for a week, and they returned to their original levels of anxiety behavior,\" says biologist Matthew Zipple.\n\n\"Living in this naturalistic environment both blocks the formation of the initial fear response, and it can reset a fear response that's already been developed in these animals in the lab.\"\n\nResearchers typically induce and measure anxiety in mice using what's called an elevated plus maze or EPM. It has two arms: an enclosed arm, which makes the animals feel safer, and an exposed arm, where the mice are in a more open environment.\n\nIn a standard response to the EPM, mice tend to explore the maze before returning to the enclosed spaces. This is interpreted as a sign of fear triggered by a single exposure to the open areas, a behavior so persistent that it resists SSRI anti-anxiety drugs.\n\nWhen researchers freed 44 mice from their lab cages to explore a relatively vast space outdoors, to burrow and climb and experience a variety of different sensations and conditions, they found it acted like a reset button.\n\nMice that were returned to the EPM explored both the open and closed spaces equally, as if encountering the maze for the first time. The effects were observed across mice regardless of whether they were rewilded from birth or not.\n\nThe findings may have implications for how we understand anxiety and its relationship to our environment – something that may be true of people as well as mice. It's possible that a narrow set of experiences can drive anxiety.\n\n\"If you experience lots of different things that happen to you every day, you have a better way to calibrate whether or not something is scary or threatening,\" says neurobiologist Michael Sheehan.\n\n\"But if you've only had five experiences, you come across your sixth experience, and it's quite different from everything you've done before, that's going to invoke anxiety.\"\n\nThe researchers suggest a rethink might be needed about how anxiety is studied in the lab, and how applicable experiments with mice could be to humans. What we think of as anxiety in lab mice might be easily mitigated by their environment, rather than being hardwired into their biology.\n\nThis idea of a more sheltered life as a contributor to anxiety is something that's been explored in studies of people as well. Perhaps more varied and even more risky experiences could help reduce anxiety – though we also know that there are multiple factors involved.\n\n\"This opens a lot of possibilities for asking interesting questions about how our library of experiences shapes our response to novel experiences, because I think that's essentially what anxiety is – when you have an inappropriate response to something that isn't actually scary,\" says Sheehan.\n\nThe research has been published in Current Biology.\n\nAn Anatomy Professor Explains The Bizarre Biology of Elves\n\nTiny Molecule Made by Gut Bacteria Could Cut Type 2 Diabetes Risk\n\nNew Drug Stalls Alzheimer's Development in Breakthrough Trial",

    "description": "Democrats' approval of the Senate Minority Leader has collapsed from 76% to just 39% as Rep. Ro Khanna publicly calls for his replacement after healthcare subsidy failure.",
    "fullText": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) brought up the rear in a new poll asking Americans to assess the job performance of 13 U.S. leaders.\n\nGallup’s latest survey, conducted Dec. 1-15, found that 28% of Americans approve of how Schumer is handling his duties.\n\nHe was the only figure below 30%, a mark weighed down by an abysmal 39% approval rating among Democratic respondents. That represented a dramatic 37-point drop from January 2024, when 76% of Democrats approved of Schumer’s job performance, according to Gallup’s data.\n\nThe latest Gallup poll reflects fallout from a tumultuous year for Schumer.\n\nThe Minority Leader was roundly mocked by Republicans and upbraided by his own party after eight members of the Senate Democratic Caucus broke ranks to end the 43-day shutdown without securing an extension of enhanced health care subsidies.\n\nSchumer’s tactical misfire, coupled with his refusal to endorse New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, led some frustrated Democrats to call for new leadership.\n\n“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) posted on X. “If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?”\n\nBeyond Schumer, Gallup found that none of the 12 U.S. leaders from Congress, the Cabinet, the Supreme Court or the Federal Reserve earned majority-level approval.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell received the top mark with a 44% approval rating. He was followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio (41%), Vice President JD Vance (39%) and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (39%).\n\nHere is how the other leaders fared in Gallup’s final poll of the year:\n\nPresident Donald Trump: 36% approval\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts: 38%\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent: 37%\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.): 37%\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth: 36%\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi: 36%\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.): 35%\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.): 34%\n\nTrump told a Fox News host that the massive White House ballroom is ‘a monument to myself’\n\nTrump had a meltdown over a New York Times story on his bond with Epstein: ‘THEY ARE A TRUE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!’\n\nAmericans give Congress a giant lump of coal after a turbulent year: New poll",

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

    "description": "“Consumers are just in this, whatever the highest price is, is the price they're going to focus on,” Harvard professor Jason Furman said.",
    "fullText": "As President Donald Trump struggles to address Americans’ growing affordability concerns, he has gotten some sympathy from one of former President Barack Obama’s former top economists.\n\nJason Furman, Harvard Kennedy School of Government professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday pessimistic consumers have overlooked gas prices that have remained affordable, making Trump’s job of addressing the affordability crisis more challenging.\n\nGas prices in December marked the lowest they’ve been all year, according to data from motor club AAA, with unleaded gasoline $0.18 cheaper nationally this year compared to last. National average prices reached their cheapest on Monday, hitting $2.85 a gallon. That hasn’t stopped consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since April, and approval ratings indicating more Americans disagree with how Trump is handling the economy.\n\n“I’ve been puzzled,” Furman said. “When you’re in government, you’re told, politically, the one price that matters is the price of gasoline. That’s the one price that’s been great this year. And I sort of feel a tiny bit bad for President Trump that he doesn’t get any credit for that.”\n\nTrump has continued to offer his own mixed signals on the affordability crisis, including saying in a primetime address last week he inherited an economic “mess” from the Biden administration, offering to cut checks for millions of military personnel for housing supplements, while simultaneously calling the economy the strongest it’s been.\n\nAccording to Furman, Trump also has a bit of a tough crowd: Consumers have been concerned about inflation and the price of groceries, which have increased nearly 30% over the past five years, making it more difficult to assuage economic anxieties, even when there are other optimistic signals.\n\n“Consumers are just in this sort of, whatever the highest price is, is the price they’re going to focus on and be upset about,” he said. “And that’s a really hard problem to solve economically or politically.”\n\nConflicting economic indicators extend beyond prices, Furman said. The U.S. saw its strongest economic growth in two years last quarter with a 4.3% GDP growth, exceeding past analysts’ estimates. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate creeped up to 4.6% in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, markedly higher than last November’s 4.2% and above 4%, which is considered reasonable.",

    "title": "This millennial home designer spent 9 months building a replica of ‘The Holiday’ cottage—now it’s renting fast at $499 a night",
    "description": "Lucy Small, a Georgia-based home designer, had 4,000 fans lined up to rent her festive cottage years before it hit the market. She says the home is so special that its success can’t “be replicated.”",
    "fullText": "Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance. Before joining the Success desk, she co-authored Fortune’s CHRO Daily newsletter, extensively covering the workplace and the future of jobs. Emma has also written for publications including the Observer and The China Project, publishing long-form stories on culture, entertainment, and geopolitics. She has a joint-master’s degree from New York University in Global Journalism and East Asian Studies.\n\nEveryone has must-watch holiday movies that they binge during the festive season, from Love Actually to Home Alone. But few actually get the chance to step inside the world of their favorite comfort flicks—that is, until now. Superfans of The Holiday can now rent out a replica of the quaint English cottage where fictional Hollywood bigwig Amanda Woods (played by Cameron Diaz) was charmed by heartthrob British book editor Graham (played by Jude Law). They’ll have to wait four months, though, and make the trek to Georgia instead of the Cotswolds.\n\nHome designer Lucy Small put the Holiday Cottage up for short-term rentals this October after a nine-month build—and a fan frenzy quickly ensued. The 37-year-old has spent the past six years designing homes in the Blue Ridge Mountains; she’s worked on three dozen houses, from bathroom and kitchen rebuilds to hardcore construction projects. But nothing could have prepared her for the rush of attention that came with her latest project: replicating the cozy Rosehill Cottage featured in The Holiday, from the ground up. After all, nearly two decades after the movie’s release, it continues to be a top-watched festive flick: In 2023, The Holiday was streamed 2.3 million times, according to an analysis from Samba TV.\n\nAs it turns out, the house featured in the 2006 film—owned by Kate Winslet’s character, Iris, who home-swaps with Amanda, staying at her L.A. mansion for the Christmas season—never actually existed in real life. It was a big undertaking, but Small saw a potential hit on her hands.\n\n“The Holiday Cottage was really a fun thing. I was like, ‘Hey, why don’t I do this? I have everything at my disposal to be able to do it, I know how to build, and I can find land,’” Small tells Fortune, adding she’s a fan of the iconic movie. “Honestly, it was just one of those situations where I had this wacky idea, and everyone got excited about it, and no one stopped me.”\n\nBefore the foundation of the two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath home was even built, Small had attracted attention from thousands of customers. She first announced her plan to build the cottage in 2022, and fan fervor started pouring in. The entrepreneur says she only had digital renderings of the cottage at the time, but people were already sending her handwritten letters about how they couldn’t wait to stay there. Around 4,000 people left their email addresses on a website Small threw together to update the public on its availability. Now, just two months after going live on the market, the short-term stay is fully booked until March 2026.\n\n“People have really loved it, and every time I get one of those letters of, ‘This means so much to me, thank you so much for making it possible,’ that’s just way more worthwhile to me than anything else,” Small continues. “Anyone can build a house, have it be a good investment, and sell it to an investor. But this seems to really have meaning to people, and that makes it important.”\n\nIt’s no easy feat bringing a piece of cinema into the real world—especially when you’re up against a home that’s impossible to replicate. In truth, the Rosehill Cottage featured in The Holiday was just a bit of movie magic; the home’s weathered facade was built in an open field, while the interior was filmed on sets. Some designers might balk at the idea of building a fictional home—but Small was actually excited by the premise.\n\n“I found out that the house never actually existed in real life, which, for me, is a big deal. Because if you can actually go visit the Brady Bunch house, or the Home Alone house, me building another one is less interesting,” she explains. “But if it never existed, if it’s a set that was torn down 20 years ago, that’s a lot more interesting, because there is literally nothing else in the world like it.”\n\nSmall put the project into motion several years ago, but quickly ran into some time-consuming roadblocks. Georgia, a popular tourist getaway and filming location, was slow to issue more short-term rental licenses as temporary stays flooded the market. Heavy taxes and fees also had to be factored into the price, as counties wanted in on the industry’s growing success. Finding the right land to build on was a struggle—but once she settled on a plot in North Georgia, it was off to the races.\n\nIn total, it took nine months to build the Holiday Cottage, from breaking ground to putting in the final flourishes. Small worked with an architectural designer, watching the romcom together “1,000 times” to try and get it right. The first hurdle: They realized the house would never meet code. When trying to build at scale, they discovered the ceilings would be too low, standing at only seven feet tall, based on where the windows were positioned in the movie. The film version of the cottage had only two chimneys but featured three fireplaces; the bathroom floor was sloped; and, in reality, one window would cut halfway through the kitchen cabinet. Small and her team did everything to match the same aesthetic, even setting up fake walls and slopes.\n\nReplicating the home’s furnishings proved to be a bit pricey, too. Despite the quaint movie cottage, seemingly adorned with humble, secondhand furniture, the decor was beyond Small’s budget. Using Google image reverse searches, she tracked down antiques identical to the ones on set, which ran upwards of $30,000 each. The bamboo umbrella tree shown in the cottage entryway, for example, was priced at over $15,000. Eventually, Small was able to parallel the same warm, charming atmosphere with similar decor. She declines to share how much the entire build set her back, or even when she’ll recoup on costs. Small says she rents out the home at a modest price—$399 per night during the low season, and $499 during high season—and is adamant the Holiday Cottage has been a worthwhile investment.\n\n“It’s not like we were totally surprised and totally blew the budget. We knew what it would be; we don’t charge a stupid amount,” Small says. “And so it’s still been a good investment, given that we did not, like, cheap out on the build at all.”\n\nWith 4,000 eager renters already waiting in line, the Holiday Cottage’s instant success wasn’t a huge surprise. However, Small wasn’t used to her projects getting so much attention.\n\n“As someone who, frankly, does not know how to use social media at all, who doesn’t have it, who’s pretty private, I’m usually unable to get eyeballs on any of my projects,” she continues. “For this one, [attention has] just been pouring in completely, even though I haven’t gone out to seek it, which has been a very new position for me as a designer.”\n\nOnce the Holiday Cottage booking site went live on Oct. 4, Small says dates started filling up “immediately.” And media attention only riled up more interest; the millennial home designer says she “can’t think of a magazine” that hasn’t covered her new build. And just in time for the holidays, it’s proved to be the perfect place to get into the festive spirit. Currently, there is only one open day in March, a few available slots in April, and just one in May. The Holiday Cottage isn’t available for a multiday booking until June 2026—the house is nearly booked out for six straight months.\n\nSmall’s latest project has proved a huge success, and she says renters have so far been loving it. Travelers leave their stories in the home’s guest book; a trio of sisters brought their mother, a big fan of The Holiday, along for the ultimate dream stay; another visitor used to watch the movie with her mom every Christmas, and after her passing, rented the place with her dad. For the people who stay there, the short-term rental is more than a place to crash. It’s the chance to be immersed in romcom nostalgia and reconnect with loved ones.\n\nWhen asked if she is planning another movie-related build, Small says she’s perfectly happy being the owner of this one viral sensation. Right now, she has no other ideas—all she knows is she will only take on projects like this, where people are excited about the result. Plus, Small believes there’s no other home built that can replicate the same magic as the Holiday Cottage.\n\n“Honestly, I’m fine being a one-hit wonder,” Small says. “I don’t need it to be a big moneymaker or big success, because a lot of the things that make this house—the Holiday Cottage—so special, I don’t think can be replicated.”\n\nA version of this story originally appeared at Fortune.com on Nov. 28, 2025.",

    "description": "I've spent my holidays in Punta del Este since I was 2. From endless beaches to kid-friendly culture and great food, here's why I keep going back.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I was 2 years old, my family has been spending the holiday break at the same beach: Punta del Este, in Uruguay.\n\nThe beach town is hands down one of my favorite places in the world, not only because of our long-standing family tradition — which I've now kept up with my own kids — but because it's a hidden gem in South America that deserves to be visited at least once.\n\nUruguay has opposite seasons to the US, which means it's summer during our winter. For my family of five, that means it's the perfect place to take a break from the sub-zero temperatures of Maine during the holidays.\n\nPunta del Este has endless miles of beach, with options for everyone. If you like surfing, there's a popular beach where you can find people sitting on their boards waiting for the perfect wave. For families with young children, there's Playa Mansa, which rarely has waves, making it ideal for kids to wade around in the water. For more experienced swimmers, there's Playa Brava, which offers big waves and strong tides.\n\nYou can often find merchants walking around with towels, bikinis, dresses, ice cream, and coffee. Some beaches have beach restaurants where you can buy food and drinks, although they can get crowded during peak season.\n\nUruguayans are known for being incredibly kind to kids. You can expect priority lines for families with young children at airports and supermarkets. In my experience, people often go above and beyond at restaurants and shops to ensure kids are happy.\n\nBeyond that, there are endless activities to keep kids happy. From ice cream shops to try on every block downtown, to an extensive (and free!) playground called El Jaguel, where families can spend the day exploring the grounds, having lunch, and riding horses.\n\nMy kids also love the day camps at Portal del Bosque in La Barra, which cost $2,000 Uruguayan pesos, or about $50, where they spend half a day exploring activities such as art, stop-motion animation, soccer, and more. My kids also love visiting the downtown hippie market, getting temporary tattoos, and getting threaded braids.\n\nDespite having been coming here for 40 years, I still haven't tried all the restaurants that Punta del Este has to offer.\n\nThere are historical ones, like La Huella in Jose Ignacio, which is loved by both locals and tourists (although securing a table during peak season can be challenging). Highlights include grilled octopus and fish, as well as a dessert volcano of dulce de leche.\n\nLo de Tere in the port, which is so fun to spend New Year's Eve at, as people dance on the street once the clock hits midnight. On other days, you can enjoy food with an emphasis on local products.\n\nAnd for a quick, casual bite, Rex, which has the best chivitos in town, is excellent to go with kids because of its quick service and lively atmosphere. One year, my kids spent the entire meal petting the restaurant's dog, while my husband and I enjoyed the coldest beer I've ever had.\n\nWhile Uruguay is known for its excellent steak, there are restaurants for every palate. My kids love eating fondue at Bungalow Suizo. I always enjoy getting fresh, local fish, and anything with dulce de leche (a local caramel) is a hit with the whole family.\n\nBut these are just a few of the endless options for food. You really can find something for everyone's taste.\n\nSummer here runs from December to March, which is the ideal time to come to enjoy the beach, as well as when most restaurants are open.\n\nThat said, the weeks between Christmas and New Year's can be really expensive and hard to get reservations for. Another factor to consider is that while there are direct flights from Miami to Montevideo and from Buenos Aires to Punta del Este, these can be particularly expensive during high season. To get an idea, for my family of five, return tickets to the US for January 2nd were running at $18,000. We opted to fly on December 31st instead and spend New Year's in the air.\n\nI hope we can continue spending more family vacations in Punta del Este, as seeing my kids enjoy the things I used to do as a kid brings me so much joy.",

    "description": "Tahmina Watson's law firm assists with employment visas. She advises all visa holders with a valid stamp to return to the US immediately.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tahmina Watson, a business immigration lawyer in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Watson's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a business immigration lawyer, and in my day-to-day work with clients, I'm seeing immigration disruptions with immediate consequences, including H-1B visa holders who are outside the US being uncertain if they can return.\n\n​​My law firm, Watson Immigration Law, assists founders and businesses in navigating the employment visa application process. It appears that, at this time, the administration is coordinating the rescheduling and delay of immigration appointments.\n\nNon-immigrant visas generally must be scheduled at a US embassy or consulate in the person's country of nationality or residence. From my experience, many employees accrue their holiday time and schedule immigration appointments during this period because they're already planning to leave the country, allowing them to easily visit their designated US embassy or consulate.\n\nThese employees are now getting stuck, having already left the US, with their appointments getting rescheduled for June, July, or August 2026, and beyond.\n\nMajor tech companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft, sent memos out to their employees in the past week, warning visa-holding employees to avoid international travel amid long delays at US consulates. These policies are coming one after another, and they all intersect with each other.\n\nIf somebody is outside the country, what are employers supposed to do? Right now, my advice to clients outside the country is that if they have a valid visa stamp, they should return to the US as soon as possible.\n\nFor someone who has left the country to obtain a new visa stamp, I'm not sure there's a clear path to return. This includes individuals on F-1 student visas who traveled to visit family and were planning to re-enter the US. They will need that visa stamp from a consulate.\n\nEnsure your employment is still active and consider whether remote work is an option. If an employer decides they cannot keep someone on the books, even an appointment months from now will not help if there's no job waiting.\n\nIt's tough to know how things will unfold. What we're seeing is a confluence of policies coming in at the same time. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has just announced that it is replacing the lottery system for H-1B work visas, which randomly selects who receives a visa. The system is now set to prioritize higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.\n\nSocial media disclosure is being expanded from F-1 visa holders, which began during the student visa crisis, to now include H-1B workers. These applicants are required to change all social media privacy settings to public.\n\nIt could easily expand to other visa categories. The government has not provided clear guidance on what they are reviewing. By casting an overly broad net under the banner of national security, without clear standards or transparency, the administration is creating uncertainty that will ripple across families, employers, and the US economy.\n\nClients should limit what they post online.\n\nIn 2024, I was already anticipating these issues with traveling and returning to the US. We've also seen issues affecting green card holders with past criminal convictions.\n\nThere are many stories of people who have lived in the US for decades, suddenly facing deportation proceedings. This is a highly precarious time for immigrants, and limiting travel is critical.\n\nIt feels like a fire hose of policies. Everyone in the immigrant ecosystem is on high alert: Immigration lawyers, immigrants, employers, investors, founders, and employees.",

Sharyn Alfonsi, who reported the segment, wrote in note to colleagues that the decision was a \"political one,\" multiple outlets reported.\n\nWeiss said in her memo that she and other CBS News leaders are \"not out to score points with one side of the political spectrum or to win followers on social media.\"\n\nThe media world has heavily scrutinized Weiss' management since she was installed atop CBS News by Paramount CEO David Ellison in October. Paramount also acquired The Free Press, the conservative-friendly news site Weiss founded after leaving The New York Times' opinion section, for about $150 million.\n\nParamount is dueling with Netflix to buy Warner Bros.
