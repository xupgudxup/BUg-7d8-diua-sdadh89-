    "fullText": "Packers’ Christian Watson provides Jordan Love update while QB can’t talk appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Green Bay Packers are preparing for a high-powered Saturday night matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, but much of the focus this week has centered on quarterback Jordan Love’s availability.\n\nLove remains in the NFL’s concussion protocol following a hard hit in last week’s 22-16 loss to the Chicago Bears, which means he is not allowed to speak publicly. In his absence, teammates have helped fill in the picture of where things stand.\n\nWide receiver Christian Watson offered the clearest update after Wednesday’s practice, sharing optimism about Love’s progress while also acknowledging the uncertainty that comes with the league’s strict return-to-play rules.\n\n“He’s looked really good,” Watson said via The Athletic. “From everything that I’ve talked to him about, he feels like he’s in a good spot. Obviously, he’s gotta clear everything. I think he’s just approaching it like a normal week in terms of how he’s going about everything, and then, obviously, he’ll just let the medical staff take care of the rest..He’s looked like J-Love out there, so, obviously, if he does get the opportunity to play on Saturday, I know he’ll be ready to go.”\n\nLove suffered the injury in the second quarter against Chicago after a helmet-to-helmet collision with Bears defensive end Austin Booker. Although he was able to leave the field under his own power, he did not return and was later placed in concussion protocol, immediately casting doubt on his Week 17 status.\n\nEncouragingly for Green Bay, Love was a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice. During the portion open to reporters, he reportedly appeared to take his normal workload, and completing passes. These observations, combined with Watson’s comments, suggest Love is progressing as expected.\n\nStill, nothing is guaranteed. NFL concussion protocol prohibits media access to players until they are fully cleared, and head coach Matt LaFleur has admitted even he doesn’t have every step of the process memorized. Love must pass a series of evaluations before being allowed back on the field.\n\nFor the Packers, who are chasing a playoff berth, the coming days will be very critical. If Love continues trending upward and earns medical clearance, Green Bay could enter Saturday night with renewed confidence.\n\nIf not, the team will need to adjust quickly — but either way, the situation underscores how much hinges on Love’s health as the postseason push intensifies.",

    "fullText": "Minnesota Timberwolves at Denver Nuggets\nDate: December 25th, 2025\nTime: 9:30 PM CST\nLocation: Ball Arena\nTelevision Coverage: ABC, ESPN\nRadio Coverage: Wolves App, iHeart Radio\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves delivered some early holiday cheer to the Target Center crowd on Tuesday evening, notching their first victory over Karl-Anthony Towns since the legendary fall-2024 trade. Yes, it came against a Knicks team missing Jalen Brunson, OG Anunoby, and half their rotation. And yes, it was a little surreal watching KAT torch his old team for 40 points while Wolves fans were forced to clap politely through clenched teeth. But context aside, the Wolves took care of business, beat a +.500 team, and continued to quietly stack real wins.\n\nIt wasn’t clean, because, let’s face it, it’s never clean with this team. Minnesota built a comfortable lead, then immediately got comfortable. New York ripped off two 10-0 runs as well as a 17-3 run during the course of the game. During the third quarter the game felt like it might slip away… until Anthony Edwards woke up and decided he wasn’t interested in that storyline. Ant matched KAT nearly bucket for bucket, finishing with 38, and then Julius Randle finally arrived in the fourth quarter like the cavalry, pouring in 17 points, including 15 straight Wolves points at one stretch. On a night when Towns was missing his co-star, Minnesota’s own duo, Edwards and Randle, closed the door.\n\nThat win capped off something much bigger: the Wolves have now gone 3-0 in this brutal holiday homestand against the Thunder, Bucks, and Knicks. One game of this Christmas Week gauntlet remains. And it happens to be one of the biggest regular-season games this franchise will play all year.\n\nChristmas Night.\nIn Denver.\nAgainst Nikola Jokic.\n\nMinnesota’s surge has vaulted them into fifth place, leapfrogging Houston, with the Lakers barely ahead. A win in Denver puts the Wolves within half a game of the Nuggets for third in the West, which is a stunning place to be considering the chaos of the first 30 games: Ant’s hamstring injury, multiple blown games, and long stretches where this team looked like it was trying to solve calculus without knowing multiplication.\n\nThe Wolves dominated this matchup last season, pulling off a four-game season sweep. But 2025-26 has flipped the script: Denver has already beaten Minnesota twice at Target Center. If the Wolves want to restore balance, they’ll need to do something they’ve proven they can do — win in Mile High.\n\nWith the entire league watching, the Wolves have a chance to deliver a real contender’s statement.\n\nNikola Jokic is the best player on the planet. There is no stopping him. There is only survival.\n\nMinnesota’s formula remains the same: Rudy Gobert, Naz Reid, and Julius Randle take turns leaning on him, making every touch exhausting, forcing him into facilitator mode, and controlling the glass. Denver added Jonas Valančiūnas, giving them more frontcourt depth than last year, so the Wolves’ size advantage only matters if they use it aggressively. Second-chance points cannot tilt this game.\n\nWear him down. Make him pass. Make the other Nuggets beat you.\n\nWhen Murray ignites, the Nuggets become terrifying. The Wolves have the personnel to prevent that.\n\nIf Jaden McDaniels can go, he’s the first option. If not, Anthony Edwards and Jaylen Clark must shoulder the responsibility. Murray cannot get comfortable. He cannot get clean looks. He cannot start that rhythmic pull-up nonsense that makes Denver impossible to deal with.\n\nSlow Murray, and the math of this game changes immediately.\n\nThe Wolves must play sharp, disciplined basketball: no careless passes, no lazy dribbles into traffic, no self-inflicted wounds that fuel Nuggets runs. Crisp movement, smart decisions, full commitment to winning the possession game.\n\nThis is not the night for sloppiness.\n\nAfter a sluggish stretch, Minnesota’s shooting finally ticked upward against New York. That momentum must continue.\n\nThis only works if the Wolves avoid ISO-ball. Make Denver rotate, use Ant and Randle’s gravity, find Naz, Donte, Jaden, and Conley in rhythm.\n\nThis offense is deadly when it flows.\n\nEdwards and Randle just finished dismantling New York’s defense in crunch time. They must do it again, together. Not forcing shots. Not hunting hero moments. Just relentlessly attacking, creating, and letting the offense breathe.\n\nGiven the plethora of injuries that the Nuggets are dealing with, whichever duo wins this matchup likely wins the game.\n\nThis is the game that transforms a hot streak into a statement.\nThis is the game that tells the West the Wolves are not just back — they are for real.\n\nTime to put on the Grinch costume and ruin Denver’s evening, while giving Timberwolves Nation the gift we’ve all been waiting for.",

    "fullText": "Evan Mobley could make another quick return to the Cavaliers lineup amid calf issue originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEvan Mobley sustained a calf injury a couple of weeks ago, but it looks like he is ready to return. Ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers' Christmas Day game against the New York Knicks, Mobley is listed as \"Questionable\", which could mean he might be able to play.\n\nWithout Mobley, the Cavaliers lost to the Charlotte Hornets and lost twice against the Chicago Bulls. While the Cavs got payback against the Hornets and blew out the New Orleans Pelicans, they still need a healthy lineup, which is why Mobley's potential return will be significant.\n\nAfter missing the last five games for the Cavs, Mobley was initially set to miss two to four weeks. Christmas Day will be 13 days since the calf tightness popped up, so Mobley is way ahead of schedule.\n\nWhile he is listed as questionable, many Cavs fans are a bit uneasy with his quick return. Calf injuries have been a problem in recent years in the NBA because they are the injury that could lead to a torn Achilles tendon.\n\nMore: Donovan Mitchell gives credit to Sam Merrill as the Cavaliers offense shines\n\nAcross Mobley's career, he has beaten the typical return-to-play timelines. The Inside Shot's Danny Cunningham noted that Mobley is a fast healer, and this potential return from his calf injury is a good example of this.\n\nThe Cavaliers are playing against the Knicks on Christmas Day, which will be one of the biggest games of the season. Cleveland and New York were the favorites ahead of the season, but only the latter has met expectations.\n\nWith Mobley possibly joining the team on Christmas Day, the Cavaliers could pull off a surprise upset against the second-seeded Knicks. The Cavaliers are sitting in the seventh seed, but they could be a much better team if they start on a huge run by beating the Knicks.\n\nNew report provides insight into Kenny Atkinson's job security with Cavaliers\n\nMost games played on Christmas: Where LeBron James, Kobe Bryant rank on all time list\n\nJalen Williams believes more reps will help solve the Thunder's back-to-back issues\n\nBam Adebayo is going with the flow with his recent slump for the Miami Heat\n\nNick Nurse laments the lack of athletes in the 76ers' shocking loss to the Nets",

    "fullText": "Packers’ Adam Stenavich hits offense with blunt reality check appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Green Bay Packers are on a two-game losing skid, and while their chances to make the NFL playoffs remain favorable, they have some issues to address if they are to make a deep postseason run.\n\nAmong which concerns their offense that hasn’t been up to par of late, especially in one particular area.\n\nPackers offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich touched on that subject while speaking to the media on Wednesday.\n\n“It hasn’t been good enough. Flat out. We’ve been bad,” Stenavich said of Green Bay’s offense in the red zone, via Matt Schneidman of The Athletic.\n\nOver the last two games, the Packers have gone just 1-for-9 on touchdown conversions when inside the opponents’ 20-yard line. In Week 15’s 34-26 road loss to the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, the Packers scored just one touchdown in four trips to the red zone.\n\nFor what it’s worth, they were 6-for-13 on third downs and 1-for-3 on fourth downs in that contest. In the following game, versus the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field in Chicago, Green Bay missed out on all five of its chances to score a touchdown in the red zone.\n\nGranted that the Packers lost quarterback Jordan Love to injury in the first half of the Bears game, the Packers still could have done better offensively.\n\nThe Packers can turn things around in that area this coming Saturday, when they host the Baltimore Ravens at Lambeau Field in Green Bay. However, that could be easier said than done, as the Ravens are sixth-best in the league so far in the 2025 season with a 50.88 percent success rate against touchdown scoring in the red zone.",

The victory came behind Leonard’s 41 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists and his insane shooting splits of 69/80/100. Despite his performance, much like his character Leonard remains focused on the mission.\n\n“It’s a long season, so anytime we put on this jersey, you go to compete and try to win a basketball game. And that’s what I’m taking priority in. I think everyone else is too. Leonard said after the game.\n\nKAWHI LEONARD TONIGHT:\n\n41 POINTS\n8 REBOUNDS\n5 ASSISTS\n13/23 FG\n4/5 3P\n\n🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/haMQcjRw0b\n\n— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) December 24, 2025\n\nIt has been a rough season for the Clippers who are right now 8-21, and are in the 14th seed in the Western conference, but surprisingly there are quite a few things the Clippers should feel encouraged about.\n\nKawhi Leonard is fully healthy.\n\nThroughout his six year tenure with the Clippers, it seems as if the stigma “when healthy” has followed Leonard even when he's perfectly fine. For the season, Leonard is averaging 26.1 ppg, 6.2 rpg, and 2.0 spg. He is tied for his career high in steals per game, as well as his free throw percentage at 97.8% for the season! However his production exceeds the stat sheet.\n\nMuch of the time Leonard was on the court, he took the initiative to guard Rockets All-Star Forward Kevin Durant. Not an easy task by any means, but Leonard was up for the challenge.\n\n“I mean they got two hall of famer players. Durant said. I think they’ve been playing at an elite level the last few years, so Kawhi and James (Harden) they can win any night. And tonight, they came out and did that.”\n\nThe Rockets did everything they could to try and get Leonard out of rhythm. They switched coverage's, they brought double teams wherever he had the ball, even Rockets Forward Tari Eason tried to get physical with Leonard. It simply wasn’t enough.\n\nKawhi Leonard’s mentality mirrors “The Terminator”\n\nComing into the season, many expected for the Clippers to be a top notch team mainly because of their best player’s presence. However, due to a combination of injuries, minutes restrictions, and strength of schedule it's been a rough 30 game stretch. However, there is a lot to look forward to with the Clippers still much in the playoff hunt, despite their bad record.\n\nFor a long 82 game season, where emotions tend to be up and down surrounding the team it is beneficial to have your best player maintain a level of calmness. The name “The Terminator” for Leonard fits like a glove.",

    "fullText": "Cam Johnson and Trey Murphy believe Steph Curry is the most unique player ever originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStephen Curry is one of this generation's best players, and that is evident in his influence. Nowadays, the league is filled with teams playing a three-point-centric system because Curry pioneered it in the 2010s.\n\nOf course, the three-point shot has been around for decades at that point, but no one ever utilized it as well as the Golden State Warriors and Curry. Now that he is in his late-30s, many people still appreciate how well Curry is playing, including his NBA peers like Cameron Johnson and Trey Murphy III.\n\nThroughout NBA history, there have been many players who have stood out. The likes of Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Shaquille O'Neal were game-changers. It is not hyperbolic to say that Curry is one of the players who changed the game of basketball.\n\nWith his excellence as a three-point shooter, most young players wanted to be like him. They wanted to be as effective as him as a shooter because that is the optimal way to play and win games.\n\nMore: Steph Curry trade idea sends Warriors legend home to finish his career\n\nAs players who grew up during a time when Curry was breaking out as a superstar, Johnson and Murphy became top players in the high school and college ranks with Curry as an influence. Now that they are veterans in the NBA, they appreciate Curry even more since they have played against him.\n\n\"I think it takes a lot for a coach to allow you to do that, right? You know, it just seems unlikely that he's that special as a shooting talent. I don't think that we'll ever see again. To do it at the level Steph does it to win championships, to consistently do it for 15, 16, 17 years, we'll never see it again,\" Johnson said on The Old Man And The Three with him and Murphy.\n\nCurry continues to be one of the special players in the league today. Many players would want to be as effective as him, but he is still the league's best shooter even when he's in his late 30s. He will retire someday, but he is still playing at an elite level, and other players are still chasing him as the unique superstar.\n\nThis Draymond Green stat is atrocious for Warriors legend\n\nNew Stephen Curry video has Warriors fans convinced he has the worst whistle in the NBA\n\nWarriors linked to stunning Draymond Green trade with division rival\n\nEvan Mobley could make another quick return to the Cavaliers lineup amid calf issue\n\nJalen Williams believes more reps will help solve the Thunder's back-to-back issues",

We joke about it, but he’s started and played a lot of games, seen a lot of football. But I think he’s continued to learn, understand and develop, he’s gotten better each day, and he’s been durable and available. The more that you’re out there, usually the better that you get.”\n\nThe Patriots selected Woodson in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. During his five seasons at California, he played in 46 games. Although Woodson is just a rookie, the experience he gained in many college games can significantly contribute to his development as a player.\n\nIn 15 games this season, Woodson has recorded 74 combined tackles, four tackles for loss and two fumble recoveries.\n\nIf the Patriots want to make a postseason run, Woodson will need to deliver an outstanding performance along with the rest of the secondary to take down some of the best quarterbacks in the AFC.\n\nPatriots Clinching Scenarios For Week 17",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — The four Sioux Falls public high schools are set to compete in the third annual Presidents Bowl basketball classic at the Sanford Pentagon on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nEach day of the event will feature two girls games and two boys games for a total of eight games among crosstown rivals over the two days.\n\n“They know each other really well, so they like to winning against each other so they can have bragging rights – east side, west side, whatever you want to talk about,” Jefferson head coach Tim Reck said. “It’s always fun to see those guys compete, and then afterwards, they’re laughing and joking about the game and things like that. So that’s always fun as well.”\n\nThe action begins each day at 11 a.m. with a new game tipping off every two hours. With the girls games opening the action for each session and the boys following, it creates an opportunity to draw more eye balls to the competition.\n\n“It has, like a really good crowd for us, especially with the girls games,” Washington senior forward Rylan Kennett said. “Like when there’s all the guys games going on two, it brings more people to our game. So it’s kind of nice to be able to play in an atmosphere where we can maybe get more viewers and bring more attention to girls basketball in general.”\n\nOne of the biggest draws for the players is the chance to play at the Pentagon, which is recognized as one of the best venues in the country.\n\n“The court’s very cool,” Lincoln junior guard Brody Schafer said. “It’s like a heritage look. It’s like an old style look. It’s very cool. And then it’s just the atmosphere around it – the smoke, the view board, all that stuff is stuff you don’t always get. So it’s just when you get it, you got to embrace it and take in the moment.\n\n“When they leave high school, they talk about the state tournaments, and they’re fun memories, but this is also one that they talk about as well,” Roosevelt head coach Mitch Begeman said. “They got to play on Heritage Court and in the Sanford Pentagon, and they were treated very, very well. So, I think it’s just a special two days that we get to do this. And we’re very, very appreciative of that.”\n\nThe schedule for the two days is as follows: Lincoln and Roosevelt meet in the first two games of the Presidents Bowl on Dec. 29 with Washington and Jefferson squaring off later in the day. On Dec. 30, Jefferson and Lincoln battle in the early window, and Roosevelt and Washington close out the event.",

They have four championships with Steve Kerr as the head coach and Stephen Curry as the superstar.

Kerr admits that the Warriors are not at their best anymore, which is an inevitability, considering Father Time is undefeated.\n\nIn today's NBA, the Warriors are one of the teams that are stuck in limbo. They want to be successful, as seen with the quality of players they have on the roster. Unfortunately, their core might be too old to compete against the younger teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nKerr wants his team to remain competitive, but it might not happen anymore because the Warriors' time has passed. They were once a dynasty that almost every other NBA team feared, but now, they are not seen as a title contender anymore.\n\nMore: Cam Johnson and Trey Murphy believe Steph Curry is the most unique player ever\n\nThis is a new look at the Warriors because many have seen them as a perennial contender for almost a decade. Today, they are eighth in the Western Conference standings with a 15-15 record. This is not what people are used to seeing, which is why Kerr is a bit tentative with his current roster.\n\n\"I feel really good about where our team is on the floor, where we're heading, I see the potential in doing exactly what we did last year, to really go on a run, and give ourselves a chance... Most importantly for me, is that there is beauty in the struggle.

    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Reds' left field situation is up in the air, so they should acquire a new player at that position as a Christmas gift to their fanbase. Unfortunately for the Reds, former NL MVP Cody Bellinger is considered \"a long shot to land in Cincinnati,\" per MLB.com's Mark Sheldon.\n\n\"Corner outfielders on the free-agent market include Cody Bellinger and Ryan O'Hearn, although O'Hearn played more at first base last season. A former National League MVP, Bellinger would seem more of a long shot to land in Cincinnati,\" he wrote. \"Trade Deadline acquisition Miguel Andujar, who finished the season with the Reds while burnishing his reputation for beating up left-handed pitchers, also remains on the market.\"\n\n\"The spot could also be filled by an internal option,\" he continued.\n\nO'Hearn has since signed a two-year deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates, per MLB.com.\n\nAnother high-profile free agent at the position is Kyle Tucker, but he'll be expensive. The 28-year-old has a market value of 10 years, $401.7 million ($40.2 million average annual salary). Plus, teams like the Toronto Blue Jays are interested and have extra incentive to pursue him, via FanSided's Brandon Glick..\n\n“This conversation will really become timely if the Blue Jays sign Kyle Tucker, who would immediately displace [Anthony] Santander in right field,” Glick wrote. “With George Springer taking up all of the at-bats at DH and Daulton Varsho locked into the starting spot in center field, Tucker’s presence would effectively mean that there’s one open spot for all of the aforementioned players.”\n\nHowever, there's a more attainable option on the open market who is also a familiar face.\n\nJesse Winker could be a cost-effective and reliable player to add to the outfield group. The veteran slashed just .226/.309/.400 with one homer and 10 RBI over 26 games for the New York Mets last season, but had a .764 OPS across 145 games in 2024 and an .800-plus OPS each year from 2017-2021 with the Reds. Additionally, he has just a one-year, $5.4 million market value, per Spotrac.\n\nCincinnati drafted Winker No. 49 overall in 2012, and he made his big-league debut in 2017. The club then traded him along with Eugenio Suarez to the Seattle Mariners in March 2022, who then traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers that December. He then signed with the Washington Nationals in February 2024, who traded him to the Mets that July.\n\nWinker could slot in Cincinnati's left field spot next to TJ Friedl in center and Noelvi Marte in right.",

    "fullText": "It was yet another successful slate of games last weekend for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton (WBS) Penguins, who can't seem to stop collecting points.\n\nAnd two young Pittsburgh Penguins' goaltending prospects have been leading the way for the WBS Penguins - as well as the AHL as a whole.\n\nYoung netminder Sergei Murashov earned wins on Friday and Sunday, while Joel Blomqvist was the standout in a 3-2 loss to the Hartford Wolf Pack on Saturday, as he stopped 32 of 35 Hartford shots on goal. Murashov and Blomqvist have combined to make a formidable tandem for WBS this season, and their play has elevated an already-talented team.\n\nMurashov, 21, has simply continued to dominate the AHL level. He leads the AHL in both save percentage (.943) and goals-against average (1.55), and he is 10-2-0 with two shutouts. His latest performance on Sunday - a 3-1 win over the Hershey Bears - featured 26 saves on 27 shots, including 14 in the first period alone.\n\nAnd back on Dec. 10, Murashov made 20 saves in the first period en route to a 3-0 shutout victory against the Hartford Wolf Pack.\n\nAs has been mentioned many times before, the 6-foot-2, 185-pound netminder has dominated every level of professional hockey he's played at, and his video game-esque numbers this season are showing that his full-time NHL arrival is not far off. He does have five NHL games under his belt this season, posting a 1-1-2 record with an .897 save percentage and a 2.56 goals-against average.\n\nCrosby Reaches Milestone For Second Consecutive Game The big milestone may have come for <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/pittsburgh-penguins\">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>' captain Sidney Crosby on Sunday against the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/montreal-canadiens\">Montreal Canadiens</a>, when he surpassed Mario Lemieux <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/pittsburgh-penguins/latest-news/breaking-sidney-crosby-breaks-mario-lemieux-s-franchise-record-to-become-penguins-all-time-leader-in-points\">to become the Penguins' all-time leader in points</a>.&nbsp;\n\nAs for Blomqvist? Well, after an injury caused him to miss most of training camp and the first month and a half of the AHL season, he has gotten off to a great start.\n\nIn eight games, he is 5-2-1 with a .935 save percentage and a 1.81 goals-against average. Aside from one start on Nov. 29 - when he allowed four goals on 12 shots - he has only had a save percentage below .930 in a game one time.\n\nThis is impressive stuff from the 23-year-old, who debuted with the Penguins last season to some mixed results. He started off well in his first stint with the NHL club, posting a .903 save percentage across eight appearances, but his second stint didn't go nearly as well. Overall, he had an .885 save percentage and a 3.81 goals-against average.\n\nThe results that the Penguins are getting from these two youngsters in WBS is a very encouraging sign, especially for a team that just traded its No. 1 goaltender to the Edmonton Oilers in Tristan Jarry. The NHL club is giving Stuart Skinner - who the Penguins acquired in that trade - and Arturs Silovs some runway to prove themselves, but with the team in freefall, it stands to reason that at least one of them could have a relatively short leash.\n\nPenguins Prospect Makes Team USA World Junior Team Pittsburgh Penguins prospect Will Horcoff has made the Team USA World Junior team.\n\nSilovs has struggled in recent games, posting an .815 save percentage over his last six appearances. Skinner has an .831 save percentage in three starts with the Penguins so far. In other words, neither has done a particularly stellar job up to this point to suggest that they can become starters at the NHL level.\n\nMurashov has the quickness, athleticism, calmness, and confidence for a pretty high NHL ceiling, and many believe he can be a solution going foward for the Penguins. Blomqvist also has some pedigree, even if he has struggled to stay healthy over the last several years.\n\nAll in all, it will be interesting to see how the Penguins handle their goaltending situation for the rest of the season, especially since the team has only won one game in its last 10 after a remarkable 8-2-2 start to the season in the month of October. Both Murashov and Blomqvist figure to be key parts of the Penguins' future, and the future may just get here a little faster than anyone could have anticipated.\n\nTakeaways: Penguins' Push Comes Up Short, Maple Leafs' Stars Come Up Big After a dramatic 4-3 shootout win against the Montreal Canadiens on Sunday, the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/pittsburgh-penguins\">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> hoped to carry some of that momentum into their final game before the holiday break on Tuesday against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nBookmark THN - Pittsburgh Penguins on your Google News tab to follow the latest Penguins news, roster moves, player features, and more!",

Now, this offseason, they should focus on upgrading their pitching, but there is one place they could upgrade in the field.\n\nThat place is the last outfield slot, as Heliot Ramos and Jung Hoo Lee occupy the other spots. Fansided’s Chris Landers proposes the Giants fill that spot by trading for Chicago White Sox All-Star Luis Robert Jr.\n\nMORE: Guardians predicted to sign $65 million three-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger to upgrade from Kyle Manzardo\n\n“The Giants are an outfielder short right now, with very little reliable depth behind Jung Hoo Lee and Heliot Ramos. That needs to change if this team wants to finally get back to the postseason in year two of Buster Posey's reign, and while a miracle run at Tucker can't be ruled out entirely, history suggests it's not in the cards…A Robert trade (surrounding someone like Landon Roupp or Carson Whisenhunt, maybe?) would shift Lee to right and give San Francisco and perfectly solid starting trio. He'd excel defensively in the spacious confines of Oracle Park, and the offensive question marks don't loom quite as large for a team currently staring at replacement-level options in his stead,” Landers wrote.\n\nRobert slashed .223/.297/.364/.661 with 12 doubles, 14 home runs, and 53 RBI in 110 games played. However, a change in scenery may be the spark he needs to have a bounce-back season.\n\nMORE: Reds predicted to sign $70.5 million three-time All-Star, two-time batting champ as upgrade over Matt McLain\n\nRobert would also be a short-term option. He has a year left on his current contract, with a club option for 2027. If the Giants like what they see, they could sign him to a long-term contract.\n\nIf the Giants don’t want to go for Kyle Tucker, they definitely should consider Robert as a cost-effective option.

Hall attempted to appeal the decision after it became clear that the incident could be seen as accidental to some, but the suspension was upheld.\n\nEven though the result of the situation was unfortunate, as it resulted in Dotson suffering a sprained right ankle and having to be carted off the field, it should be looked upon as a wasted appeal, because it does not look as if Hall was intending to injure Dotson purposely.\n\nMore: Seahawks get bad news from NFL on Derick Hall's suspension\n\nSeahawks head coach Mike Macdonald would agree with that statement, and he made it clear how he feels about the suspension being upheld when asked about the situation during a media session on Wednesday.\n\n\"We accept the decision, even if we don't agree with it.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nChristmas Day is one of the biggest dates on the NBA calendar every year, and 2025 will be no different. There are a total of five NBA games on the holiday this year, with one of the games being an intriguing matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets.\n\nBoth the Lakers and Rockets are jockeying for playoff positioning in the competitive Western Conference. The Lakers are currently fourth in the conference standings at 19-9 while the Rockets are two spots behind them at 17-10.\n\nThe Christmas Day stage provides a platform for stars to shine, and luckily the Lakers will have one of the league’s biggest stars available for the game.\n\nAfter missing L.A.’s last game with a left calf contusion, Luka Doncic is expected to play against Houston, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania.\n\nThis is obviously good news for the Lakers and basketball fans alike, as Doncic is one of the most exiting – and productive – players in the league. On the season he’s averaging a league-leading 34.1 points per game to go along with 8.8 rebounds and 8.6 assists.\n\nMore Lakers news: LeBron James gets brutally honest about having to play on Christmas Day\n\nThere will be no shortage of star power in the game between L.A. and Houston. In addition to Doncic, LeBron James will be available for the Lakers, and he’ll face off against a familiar foe in Kevin Durant.\n\nThat duo will combine to make some NBA history when they take the floor on Christmas. The pair has scored a total of 73,630 points in the league, which represents the most combined points in a head-to-head matchup ever.\n\nThe holiday matchup between L.A. and Houston will be the first of three meetings between the two teams on the season. They'll meet again twice in March.",

    "description": "Here are players to start and sit in fantasy football from the Washington Commanders and Dallas Cowboys Week 17 matchup.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders will face the Dallas Cowboys at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, in one of three Christmas Day NFL games.\n\nThe Commanders will be without backup quarterback Marcus Mariota, leaving Josh Johnson to start with Jeff Driskel as the backup. Without Mariota, the Commanders' offense becomes one-dimensional and easy to defend.\n\nThis is a game for bragging rights at this point, as both teams have been eliminated from the playoffs. It's a divisional matchup, though, and both teams want the win. Anything can happen in a divisional game, and this one is no exception, which is why there are still players with value in fantasy football leagues.\n\nIf you've made it this far into the fantasy football season, congratulations. If you roster any of the players on either of these teams, here are some players to start and sit in Week 17.\n\nThe Commanders allow the 2nd-most fantasy points to quarterbacks in the entire league. Prescott is a solid quarterback with decent receivers, and he'll be facing a Commanders secondary that is missing some key pieces. Prescott is likely to feast against the Commanders on Christmas Day, making him a must-start in this game.\n\nTreylon Burks has seen an increased number of targets in recent weeks, but he's not reliable enough to have fantasy value against the Cowboys this week. If Marcus Mariota plays, he will target Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel. If Josh Johnson starts, he could target Burks, but they didn't have a lot of success last week. Don't expect much out of Burks in Week 17.\n\nWilliams is currently questionable with a neck injury, and with the playoffs out of reach for the Cowboys, he might not suit up, so keep an eye on that. He did practice in a limited capacity on Tuesday, and if he suits up on Thursday, he will face a Commanders defense that ranks 28th in the league and allows the 4th-most fantasy points to running backs. He is a must-start if he is healthy enough to play.\n\nDespite the Commanders' current reliance on the ground game, McNichols isn't a viable option at running back this week. Chris Rodriguez Jr. and Jacory Croskey-Merritt are the top two running backs for the Commanders, and while McNichols has dual ground and air abilities, he isn't getting the same touches as the other two backs, and he rarely finds the end zone.\n\nThe Cowboys actually allow more points to wide receivers than running backs, but they still allow the 6th-most points to running backs in the NFL. The only way the Commanders' wide receivers have any fantasy value is if Marcus Mariota plays. If he doesn't, the Commanders will rely heavily on the ground game. This means that Wild Bill and Chris Rodriguez Jr. will get plenty of touches. Croskey-Merritt has scored in each of the last two games and could have a big game if the Commanders are forced to keep the ball on the ground.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Week 17 fantasy start/sit vs. Dallas Cowboys",

    "fullText": "HONOLULU (AP) — Backup quarterback Drew Weaver threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Nick Cenacle with 10 seconds left, and Hawaii rallied for a 35-31 victory over California in a thrilling Hawaii Bowl on Wednesday night.\n\nWeaver entered the game after Micah Alejado took a hard hit on the previous play. With the Rainbow Warriors (9-4) in range for a tying field goal, coach Timmy Chang took a shot at the end zone, and Cenacle got between two defensive backs and made the contested catch.\n\nChang, Hawaii’s fourth-year coach who had a record-setting career as the Rainbow Warriors’ quarterback from 2000-04, led his program to its first nine-win season since 2019 — when Nick Rolovich, currently Cal’s interim coach, guided Hawaii to a 10-5 record.\n\nAlejado finished 32 of 46 for 274 yards and three touchdowns, helping Hawaii rally from an early 21-0 deficit. Pofele Ashlock had 14 catches for 123 yards and two TDs for the Rainbow Warriors, who scored 22 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nCal (7-6) pulled ahead 31-28 with 1:57 left on a 1-yard touchdown run by Hawaii-born freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, who finished with 343 yards passing and a touchdown.\n\nAlejado’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Brandon White with 7:19 left gave Hawaii a 28-24 lead. The Rainbow Warriors tied it early in the fourth quarter when Alejado connected with Ashlock for their second TD and then completed a 2-point conversion pass to Cam Barfield.\n\nCal took a 21-0 lead early in the second quarter on Anthony League’s 8-yard TD run.\n\nCal was picked to finish third-to-last in the Atlantic Coast Conference preseason media poll, but finished the season tied for seventh in the ACC. Coach Justin Wilcox was fired last month and will be replaced next season by Oregon defensive coordinator Tosh Lupoi. Sagapolutele has committed to staying with the program in 2026.\n\nHawaii has plenty to build on as it enters Chang’s fifth season. Although leading receiver Jackson Harris announced his intention to transfer and did not play Wednesday, Alejado and Ashlock have said they plan to return.\n\nCal will host UCLA on Sept. 5, 2026.\n\nHawaii will also begin next season in the Bay Area when it visits Stanford on Aug. 29.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nComing into the 2024 NFL draft, all the hype was around QB Caleb Williams out of USC. As is the case with most highly touted prospects, the team that lands them loves them, and the rest can't stand them.\n\nCaleb Williams has been on a tear throughout his 2nd season with Chicago, and over the last few weeks in particular, folks around the league are starting to take notice.\n\nMore: Caleb Williams' OT throw to DJ Moore wasn't just the play of the game; PFF views it as much more.\n\nAmong all those who are jumping on the Caleb Williams train, San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan was one of them.\n\nWhen speaking to the media prior to his team's Week 17 matchup with the Chicago Bears, Shanahan had incredibly high praise for Williams.\n\nThere are a handful of NFL coaches who are known to just understand the QB position at a higher level. Kyle Shanahan is one of those offensive-minded coaches.\n\nHe's consistently gotten the best out of his QBs during his tenure in San Francisco, with his latest project being turning 'Mr Irrelevant' Brock Purdy into a legitimate starting-caliber QB.\n\nWhen he was asked about Caleb Williams leading up to facing off against him on Sunday, Shanahan had nothing but the utmost praise.\n\n49ers HC Kyle Shanahan with very high praise for Bears QB Caleb Williams:\n\n“Caleb is one of the best throwers and athletic quarterbacks I’ve ever seen. He makes some big-time throws. Extremely scary on the perimeter. It makes sense why he’s playing at such a high level.” 👀\n\n🎥:… pic.twitter.com/acO3r6A9P7\n\n— Bearsszn (@bearszn) December 25, 2025\n\nShanahan said, \" Caleb is one of the best throwers and most athletic QBs I've ever seen in terms of his height, weight, and speed. He makes some big-time throws. Extremely scary on the perimeter. He can hold onto the ball for a while — not in a bad way, but by creating stuff, which makes coverages have to hold out forever.\"\n\nHe sees greatness in Williams and rightfully so, as he's looked fantastic over these last few weeks.\n\nWhen the two teams play each other on Sunday, the 49ers will be fighting for their playoff lives. Unfortunately for San Francisco, I'm not sure Kyle Shanahan's kind words will be enough to stop Caleb Williams from putting on another incredible performance.\n\nCaleb Williams' OT throw to DJ Moore wasn't just the play of the game; PFF views it as much more.\n\nCaleb Williams' Iceman' celebration has hidden ASL meaning.

    "fullText": "It’s been a season like no other in my lifetime — not just a season, actually, but a year that’s gone beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nThe storyline of 2025 for Sunderland has been like no other — and it genuinely could’ve been the script of a movie. The way we’ve won big games would’ve been perfect for a Netflix series but alas, they didn’t have the foresight to stick around for the real glory years on Wearside.\n\nI didn’t think we’d struggle this season, but I didn’t think we’d be sixth at Christmas either. Nobody could’ve expected us to have achieved what we’ve achieved, so it’s a credit to everyone at the club for managing to get as far as we have, but the hard work hasn’t ended yet and if anything, the season is only really just starting.\n\nI heard Alan Pardew on the radio last week talking about how as a player and manager, you don’t really take notice of the table until after Christmas, as it’s at about that point where you can see what you’re capable of achieving and what it’s going to take to get there.\n\nWe’re sixth, but we can’t take that for granted or rest on our laurels.\n\nWe’ve got to be proactive in the transfer market; we’ve got to make sure that our squad is ready to challenge for a top eight finish, and then who knows what might happen — we could be sitting here at the end of the season having qualified for Europe for the first time in over fifty years, which would be the cherry on top of what is already a delicious-looking cake.\n\nOur festive fixtures are really tough.\n\nLeeds are in great form and are a better team than people will probably give them credit for, and then we’ve got Manchester City who are the best side we’ve faced this season and are probably going to win the league.\n\nIf we can get through those with some positive results, the belief that we can achieve something great this season will only grow — and that would be perfect as we look to start our charge towards FA Cup glory.\n\nDepending on one’s age of course, for many fans this will be one of the most satisfying and happy Christmases from a Sunderland point of view for a very long time — and in my own mind, only the Peter Reid days can challenge it\n\nIt’s easy to get greedy and want more but I think the vast majority of supporters will be overjoyed at our position and performances this calendar year as a whole.\n\nI’m usually a positive person and I always knew the good times would return — I just didn’t know when. The arrival of Kyril Louis-Dreyfus was the spark that made me start believing the good times were on the horizon again, and although we achieved a long-awaited promotion back to the top flight, I didn’t expect us to perform so well this season.\n\nWhat a lift and what a boost to all fans and to the region! Our long term history has always been that of a top club, but our recent history of fixtures against Cheltenham, Accrington, Shrewsbury really does hit home — not only how aboutbdark those days were, but how far we’ve come.\n\nI’d hope we can continue on this trajectory by beating Leeds to reach thirty points by the new year, and then push on for Europe. Some might think this would be too soon but just like teams scrapping to get out of the Championship, you can’t choose when an opportunity may arise that puts your club in a favourable position.\n\nEuropean fixtures would require a deeper and bigger squad to cope with the rigours of midweek games, but I have every faith in our backroom staff and management. I think I would be a tad disappointed if we didn’t get a top eight spot this season, and an announcement about a ground capacity extension before the end of 2026.\n\nWell, that’s what I’ve written to Father Christmas for, anyway!\n\nReflecting on the first half of the season, it has to be classed as a massive achievement and way beyond the expectations and even the dreams of many.\n\nSixth at Christmas is nothing short of incredible for a side who finished the previous Championship season as we did, and came up via the playoffs. Absolutely amazing — and superlatives are nowhere near enough.\n\nIf we’d been asked what we hoped for when we lifted the playoff trophy at Wembley, I doubt anyone would’ve asked for a top six Premier League berth by Christmas, and those who did would’ve been laughed at vigorously by red and white pals almost as much as by the black and white ones.\n\nThat Tommy Watson goal went in only seven months ago. The progress since then has been incredible, and hats off to the owners and all the club employees working around them for getting us to this point.\n\nThe thing that stands out for me is the pre-planning and then execution of the strategy, and the size of the balls of the club’s owners to go for it as they have.\n\nIt’s like chalk and cheese compared to the sad recent past; these people are serious operators who want our club to succeed and are not here to make a quick buck.\n\nNobody would’ve guessed we would spend £155 million on fourteen players or that we’d replace the core of the team that got us up with such high-quality footballers, retaining the select few that clearly had enough to make it already.\n\nEven if some fans did hope for that, could they expect the club to bring in such amazing bargains who clicked with the club as they have — players who “get what we’re about” and gel as solidly as they have? I don’t think anyone expected how this has panned out at all, and it’s bloody marvellous.\n\nGone are the days of the payday piss-takers. These lads would dive on a live grenade to stop a goal for Sunderland and how they’ve established this atmosphere, camaraderie, team spirit and collective positive attitude is way beyond me.\n\nDuring the coming weeks, we need to stay grounded, gathering all the points we can despite the temporary impact on the starting eleven from AFCON and using this as a spell where we look at wider squad options and allow fringe players to prove they can play at this level and compete with those who’ve usurped them since August.\n\nIt’s a time for understanding if we lose a couple of games; a time to be literally fans come what may, and to avoid any poor results distracting us from where we are.\n\nBefore all of that, we can tuck into our turkey and trimmings with a big fat smile on our faces. As a fan base, we deserve that after all the crap we’ve been through.\n\nNobody deserves that right more than my Sunderland AFC family.",

Since then, the quarterback has climbed his way up and been the starter for the team since Week 12, and when discussing his journey thus far, Sanders had this to say.\n\nMORE: Trade Myles Garrett?

This meant that regional leagues and friendlies were the only games in which any club in the country could participate, with the funds raised from these friendly games going towards the war effort.\n\nFor the 1940-41 season, Bill Murray’s team opted against playing any regional games with other teams in the area like they had done the season before, because heavy travel restrictions had meant that people could only travel within a five-mile radius of their home. This clearly would have put a huge limit on the amount of people that could attend in such dangerous circumstances.\n\nGenerally, football had taken a back seat with much more pressing matters on the minds of the entire population, and according to the fantastic Sunderland AFC: The Absolute Record book, Bill Murray was also focusing more on organising fitness drills for troops stationed in Durham rather than the football club.\n\nOn this day, the team did play a friendly match against the Sunderland Police at Roker Park, and it certainly didn’t disappoint as Sunderland outside-right Len Duns played a starring role in an 11-5 victory. Duns scored four goals and created many of the rest in an entertaining friendly match that was akin to a rugby union scoreline.\n\nWith many footballers enrolling with the police force as part of their duty during wartime, the police outfit had a reasonably decent team on show; however, just before kick-off their goalkeeper cried off, with outside-right Frank Coulthard having to go in goal.\n\nCoulthard’s presence in goal made it easier for the Sunderland side and led to the huge scoreline that they put up for the game.\n\nIn another interesting point from this game, Oxford University captain James McFarlane made a guest appearance for the home side as he was home for the holidays visiting his family.\n\nIn what was an incredibly entertaining game, it is safe to say that any spectators that turned up for the game certainly got value for their money.",

    "title": "Roker Report’s Alternative Christmas Speech: 2025 Has Been A Year To Savour",
    "description": "Merry Christmas, Lads and Lasses - let’s hope that 2026 gives us as much as 2025 did.",
    "fullText": "A very merry Christmas to one and all. A yuletide fact for everyone: did you know Santa’s outfit is red and white because he’s a massive Lads fan?\n\nThere may be truth in that; there may not. But if he has a Sky Sports package (or IPTV for those of you on the naughty list – the elves disapprove) he surely will have had a front-row seat up there in Lapland to a calendar year that, even for Sunderland AFC, you could describe as unfettered carnage.\n\nThis time, however, it’s not because we’ve just borne witness to 12 months strewn with the bodies of defeats, failed objectives, board protests, managerial sackings, and fan unrest. Not to say this was the case then, but if 2024 was very much Sunderland pulling itself from the slurry that was Michael Beale’s tenure, 2025 was a real – as the Americans might say – banner year. The last 12 months have been a vintage of Romanée-Conti Pinot Noir proportions, which I’m reliably informed by Google AI retails for a healthy five-figure sum.\n\nTalking of alcohol, rumour has it in Sunderland there is a new drinking game taking the city’s drinking establishments by storm. It’s called “If you’d said a year ago” in which all the participants must each begin by saying the phrase and then coming up with an iconic SAFC moment from 2025. The last person to fail to name one has to drink.\n\nApparently it’s the longest drinking game in the world.\n\nThe list is endless: the play-off win, the Tommy Watson 95th-minute winner, the Dan Ballard goal, riding high in the Premier League, beating the Visitors, the awesome tifos, breaking the Coventry hoodoo, winning at ’Boro, being a place and a couple of points behind Liverpool… at Christmas. Winning in the last minute at Stamford Bridge, swatting aside West Ham on the opening day, coming back from two down at home for the first time in 40-odd years in the top flight, signing Granit Xhaka, breaking our transfer record many times over…\n\nYou can feel the huge sense of pride in the city, which football aside is very clearly a place on the up. And that is hugely satisfying.\n\nOf course at Christmas there is the annual tradition of naming the turkey. Last year Régis cooked up an absolute storm in the Bendelow household. But who gets the title this year? Some may say it’s a one-bird contest with Sunderland’s man-of-steel Granit Xhaka, who turned up at the Stadium of Light in July basted and pre-stuffed and giblets removed. However, I’m tempted to give it to someone who has had a year which could only arguably be better in 2026 if he won the World Cup with Northern Ireland: Dan Ballard.\n\nI’m told Wearside’s favourite talisman has had to start bringing a bag-for-life to matches because he’s run out of pockets to put all of the division’s leading attackers in. He’s a man of such dependability and substance you’d think that Newton’s third law was based on one of his tackles. The man would head a tank trap away if you asked him to. Would you like any more metaphors? No? Well, all I’ll say is rumour has it there’s a Hollywood blockbuster in the works about Big Dan Ballard. Still, if that doesn’t happen he can content himself with having my turkey named after him.\n\nThe message this year is, though, one of pride. About, as Régis would probably say, connection. Good connection. We’re talking full fibre. Because the connection between the club, the fans, and the city has arguably never been stronger. Both figuratively and physically, as we saw in October with the opening of the new Keel Crossing – something which has been an absolute revelation.\n\nWho knows what the future will hold, but what has transpired over the last few months has resulted in a club transformed. The hierarchy has hacked its way through arguably two seasons’ worth of redevelopment in one short summer, and the results have been remarkable. What might this mean for the rest of the campaign? Who knows, but it should hopefully ensure a bright future.\n\nAnd doesn’t it feel good – life – when your football team is doing well? I’m trying to bottle this feeling, but also appreciate it now – because these are the good days.\n\nI must end with a couple of lines on a Sunderland legend: Gary Rowell. He wasn’t someone who jetted in from elsewhere, without being able to differentiate his pink slices from his Lambton Worms. No, a local lad who lived the dream so many thousands of us would wish for. Put simply, if you were to design your football career and the moments that defined it, you would create in your mind the one Gary had with this club – his club.\n\nHe was a man whose achievements and legend transcend generations of Sunderland fans, his greatest hits being passed down from old to young. But what a hit – that hat-trick – of Bohemian Rhapsody proportions. And that, in essence, is football fandom. He contributed an immense amount to the legend of this football club, and it is without doubt that many of us will be raising a glass to Lord Rowell of Seaham when the big day arrives. If anyone deserves it, he does, because we all owe him thanks many times over. What a legacy to leave.\n\nHave a fantastic Christmas all you Sunderland fans – and all the best for 2026.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have quite the dilemma on their hands with regards to the future of midfield general Casemiro.\n\nAfter a difficult time initially under Ruben Amorim, the Brazilian has fought back to win over the head coach and is currently one of the first names on the team sheet.\n\nHowever, he is 33, and that shows on the pitch with the former Real Madrid superstar completing 90 minutes only three times this season.\n\nHis contract ends next summer, but the club have the option of triggering a one-year extension clause included in his deal.\n\nBut since the Brazil international is the highest-paid player in the squad, INEOS have no intention of paying the same wages.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\nWhile Amorim prefers to keep the five-time Champions League winner, the co-owners remain keen on reducing the wage bill.\n\nHence, new contract talks have involved a massive wage reduction. Multiple clubs are ready to offer him a much larger pay packet, including long-term admirers in the Saudi Pro League.\n\nHowever, a move across the Atlantic to the MLS seems to be the likeliest next destination, with three clubs eager to recruit a leader like Casemiro.\n\nTeamtalk have named New York City FC, Austin FC, and Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami as potential options.\n\n“Multiple MLS clubs are actively working to lure the midfielder stateside, viewing him as a marquee signing capable of elevating the league’s profile further.\n\n“Sources highlight interest from sides like New York City FC, Austin FC, and Inter Miami, who see Casemiro’s winning mentality as ideal for mentoring emerging talent in a less physically demanding environment.\n\n“The appeal of life in the US, combined with competitive salaries under Designated Player rules, makes MLS the “most likely” next step if United’s proposal falls short of his expectations.”\n\nWhether the defensive midfielder will agree to United’s proposal at this stage of his career or choose to move to pastures new will be interesting to see.\n\nFeature image Julian Finney via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Chelsea captain Reece James has enjoyed a year that felt like a fresh chapter, given his frustrating record with recurring injuries.\n\nAfter taking time to recover and reset earlier in the year, James has worked his way back to full fitness and is operating at a level that has restored his status as one of the best players in the world.\n\nThe 26-year-old has been one of the most consistent players in the Chelsea squad this year and has put in world-class shifts in key games, notably against Arsenal and Newcastle United.\n\nJames’ bounce back from injury has been one for the history books, reminding everyone of his quality and shutting down comparisons that hardly do justice to his brilliance.\n\nHe has adapted seamlessly to his midfield transition while being able to slot back into his more natural right-back role without any drop in quality.\n\nJames’ availability has helped Chelsea in the ongoing top-four race, and he’s gearing up to hit a personal milestone when the Blues take on the high-flying Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge this weekend.\n\nBarring any unforeseen setback, the England international will make his 50th appearance of the calendar year against Unai Emery’s troops.\n\nIt will be the first time since 2021 that he has managed to accumulate such a consistent run of games.\n\nJames marked his return to Premier League action with a last-gasp free-kick against Bournemouth in January and hasn’t looked back since.\n\nAfter featuring in 28 of Chelsea’s 35 games in all competitions in the second half of last season, he has played in all but one Premier League fixture this term.\n\nHe has notched two goals and three assists while creating five big chances in the league, and his consistency helped him cross the 200-game milestone for Chelsea back in October.\n\n“It’s a dream for me to play 200 games for the club I’ve supported since I was a little boy,” James said (via Chelsea’s official website). “Hopefully, I can continue to get many more.”",

The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.”\n\nRashford’s loan move to Barcelona includes an optional purchase clause worth £26 million.

confronted with C:\\> or ~$.\nHelp came in the form of thick, spiral-bound manuals.\nError messages were opaque.\nThere was no Stack Overflow to save you.\nBut if you were lucky enough to have internet access, you could get help from Usenet—an early internet community filled with other people who were just as frustrated as you were.\nThey could either help you solve your problem, or at least provide some moral support and camaraderie.\n\nForty years later, computers have become so much more accessible to everyone, often at the expense of low-level end user control.\nOn many devices, there is no command-line access at all, in part because it goes against the corporate interests of walled gardens and app stores.\n\nMost people today don’t know what the command line is, much less why they would want to bother with it.\nAs computing pioneer Alan Kay said in a 2017 interview, “Because people don’t understand what computing is about, they think they have it in the iPhone, and that illusion is as bad as the illusion that ‘Guitar Hero’ is the same as a real guitar.”\n\nKay’s “real guitar” isn’t the CLI—not exactly.\nHe was talking about ways of programming computers that offer the power of the CLI and that transcend writing software in text files.\nThere is a belief among Kay’s disciples that we need to break out of a text-based local maximum that we’ve been living in for decades.\n\nIt’s exciting to imagine a future where we program computers very differently.\nEven today, spreadsheets are by far the most popular programming language, and the no-code movement is taking off quickly as it attempts to replace some of the intense demand for talented programmers.\n\nYet with its creaky, decades-old constraints and inexplicable quirks, the command line is still the most versatile corner of the computer.\nIt lets you pull back the curtain, see what’s really going on, and creatively interact with the machine at a level of sophistication and depth that GUIs cannot afford.\nIt’s available on almost any laptop, for anyone who wants to learn it.\nIt can be used interactively, or it can be automated.\nAnd, it doesn’t change as fast as other parts of the system.\nThere is creative value in its stability.\n\nSo, while we still have it, we should try to maximize its utility and accessibility.\n\nA lot has changed about how we program computers since those early days.\nThe command line of the past was machine-first: little more than a REPL on top of a scripting platform.\nBut as general-purpose interpreted languages have flourished, the role of the shell script has shrunk.\nToday’s command line is human-first: a text-based UI that affords access to all kinds of tools, systems and platforms.\nIn the past, the editor was inside the terminal—today, the terminal is just as often a feature of the editor.\nAnd there’s been a proliferation of git-like multi-tool commands.\nCommands within commands, and high-level commands that perform entire workflows rather than atomic functions.\n\nInspired by traditional UNIX philosophy, driven by an interest in encouraging a more delightful and accessible CLI environment, and guided by our experiences as programmers, we decided it was time to revisit the best practices and design principles for building command-line programs.\n\nThis document covers both high-level design philosophy, and concrete guidelines.\nIt’s heavier on the guidelines because our philosophy as practitioners is not to philosophize too much.\nWe believe in learning by example, so we’ve provided plenty of those.\n\nThis guide doesn’t cover full-screen terminal programs like emacs and vim.\nFull-screen programs are niche projects—very few of us will ever be in the position to design one.\n\nThis guide is also agnostic about programming languages and tooling in general.\n\nThese are what we consider to be the fundamental principles of good CLI design.\n\nTraditionally, UNIX commands were written under the assumption they were going to be used primarily by other programs.\nThey had \n\nToday, even though many CLI programs are used primarily (or even exclusively) by humans, a lot of their interaction design still carries the baggage of the past.\nIt’s time to shed some of this baggage: if a command is going to be used primarily by humans, it should be designed for humans first.\n\nA core tenet of the original UNIX philosophy is the idea that small, simple programs with clean interfaces can be combined to build larger systems.\nRather than stuff more and more features into those programs, you make programs that are modular enough to be recombined as needed.\n\nIn the old days, pipes and shell scripts played a crucial role in the process of composing programs together.\nTheir role might have diminished with the rise of general-purpose interpreted languages, but they certainly haven’t gone away.\nWhat’s more, large-scale automation—in the form of CI/CD, orchestration and configuration management—has flourished.\nMaking programs composable is just as important as ever.\n\nFortunately, the long-established conventions of the UNIX environment, designed for this exact purpose, still help us today.\nStandard in/out/err, signals, exit codes and other mechanisms ensure that different programs click together nicely.\nPlain, line-based text is easy to pipe between commands.\nJSON, a much more recent invention, affords us more structure when we need it, and lets us more easily integrate command-line tools with the web.\n\nWhatever software you’re building, you can be absolutely certain that people will use it in ways you didn’t anticipate.\nYour software will become a part in a larger system—your only choice is over whether it will be a well-behaved part.\n\nMost importantly, designing for composability does not need to be at odds with designing for humans first.\nMuch of the advice in this document is about how to achieve both.\n\nThe terminal’s conventions are hardwired into our fingers.\nWe had to pay an upfront cost by learning about command line syntax, flags, environment variables and so on, but it pays off in long-term efficiency… as long as programs are consistent.\n\nWhere possible, a CLI should follow patterns that already exist.\nThat’s what makes CLIs intuitive and guessable; that’s what makes users efficient.\n\nThat being said, sometimes consistency conflicts with ease of use.\nFor example, many long-established UNIX commands don’t output much information by default, which can cause confusion or worry for people less familiar with the command line.\n\nWhen following convention would compromise a program’s usability, it might be time to break with it—but such a decision should be made with care.\n\nThe terminal is a world of pure information.\nYou could make an argument that information is the interface—and that, just like with any interface, there’s often too much or too little of it.\n\nA command is saying too little when it hangs for several minutes and the user starts to wonder if it’s broken.\nA command is saying too much when it dumps pages and pages of debugging output, drowning what’s truly important in an ocean of loose detritus.\nThe end result is the same: a lack of clarity, leaving the user confused and irritated.\n\nIt can be very difficult to get this balance right, but it’s absolutely crucial if software is to empower and serve its users.\n\nWhen it comes to making functionality discoverable, GUIs have the upper hand.\nEverything you can do is laid out in front of you on the screen, so you can find what you need without having to learn anything, and perhaps even discover things you didn’t know were possible.\n\nIt is assumed that command-line interfaces are the opposite of this—that you have to remember how to do everything.\nThe original Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines, published in 1987, recommend “See-and-point (instead of remember-and-type),” as if you could only choose one or the other.\n\nThese things needn’t be mutually exclusive.\nThe efficiency of using the command-line comes from remembering commands, but there’s no reason the commands can’t help you learn and remember.\n\nDiscoverable CLIs have comprehensive help texts, provide lots of examples, suggest what command to run next, suggest what to do when there is an error.\nThere are lots of ideas that can be stolen from GUIs to make CLIs easier to learn and use, even for power users.\n\nCitation: The Design of Everyday Things (Don Norman), Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines\n\nGUI design, particularly in its early days, made heavy use of metaphor: desktops, files, folders, recycle bins.\nIt made a lot of sense, because computers were still trying to bootstrap themselves into legitimacy.\nThe ease of implementation of metaphors was one of the huge advantages GUIs wielded over CLIs.\nIronically, though, the CLI has embodied an accidental metaphor all along: it’s a conversation.\n\nBeyond the most utterly simple commands, running a program usually involves more than one invocation.\nUsually, this is because it’s hard to get it right the first time: the user types a command, gets an error, changes the command, gets a different error, and so on, until it works.\nThis mode of learning through repeated failure is like a conversation the user is having with the program.\n\nTrial-and-error isn’t the only type of conversational interaction, though.\nThere are others:\n\nAcknowledging the conversational nature of command-line interaction means you can bring relevant techniques to bear on its design.\nYou can suggest possible corrections when user input is invalid, you can make the intermediate state clear when the user is going through a multi-step process, you can confirm for them that everything looks good before they do something scary.\n\nThe user is conversing with your software, whether you intended it or not.\nAt worst, it’s a hostile conversation which makes them feel stupid and resentful.\nAt best, it’s a pleasant exchange that speeds them on their way with newfound knowledge and a feeling of achievement.\n\nFurther reading: The Anti-Mac User Interface (Don Gentner and Jakob Nielsen)\n\nRobustness is both an objective and a subjective property.\nSoftware should be robust, of course: unexpected input should be handled gracefully, operations should be idempotent where possible, and so on.\nBut it should also feel robust.\n\nYou want your software to feel like it isn’t going to fall apart.\nYou want it to feel immediate and responsive, as if it were a big mechanical machine, not a flimsy plastic “soft switch.”\n\nSubjective robustness requires attention to detail and thinking hard about what can go wrong.\nIt’s lots of little things: keeping the user informed about what’s happening, explaining what common errors mean, not printing scary-looking stack traces.\n\nAs a general rule, robustness can also come from keeping it simple.\nLots of special cases and complex code tend to make a program fragile.\n\nCommand-line tools are a programmer’s creative toolkit, so they should be enjoyable to use.\nThis doesn’t mean turning them into a video game, or using lots of emoji (though there’s nothing inherently wrong with emoji 😉).\nIt means giving the user the feeling that you are on their side, that you want them to succeed, that you have thought carefully about their problems and how to solve them.\n\nThere’s no list of actions you can take that will ensure they feel this way, although we hope that following our advice will take you some of the way there.\nDelighting the user means exceeding their expectations at every turn, and that starts with empathy.\n\nThe world of the terminal is a mess.\nInconsistencies are everywhere, slowing us down and making us second-guess ourselves.\n\nYet it’s undeniable that this chaos has been a source of power.\nThe terminal, like the UNIX-descended computing environment in general, places very few constraints on what you can build.\nIn that space, all manner of invention has bloomed.\n\nIt’s ironic that this document implores you to follow existing patterns, right alongside advice that contradicts decades of command-line tradition.\nWe’re just as guilty of breaking the rules as anyone.\n\nThe time might come when you, too, have to break the rules.\nDo so with intention and clarity of purpose.\n\n“Abandon a standard when it is demonstrably harmful to productivity or user satisfaction.” — Jef Raskin, The Humane Interface\n\nThis is a collection of specific things you can do to make your command-line program better.\n\nThe first section contains the essential things you need to follow.\nGet these wrong, and your program will be either hard to use or a bad CLI citizen.\n\nThe rest are nice-to-haves.\nIf you have the time and energy to add these things, your program will be a lot better than the average program.\n\nThe idea is that, if you don’t want to think too hard about the design of your program, you don’t have to: just follow these rules and your program will probably be good.\nOn the other hand, if you’ve thought about it and determined that a rule is wrong for your program, that’s fine.\n(There’s no central authority that will reject your program for not following arbitrary rules.)\n\nAlso—these rules aren’t written in stone.\nIf you disagree with a general rule for good reason, we hope you’ll propose a change.\n\nThere are a few basic rules you need to follow.\nGet these wrong, and your program will be either very hard to use, or flat-out broken.\n\nUse a command-line argument parsing library where you can.\nEither your language’s built-in one, or a good third-party one.\nThey will normally handle arguments, flag parsing, help text, and even spelling suggestions in a sensible way.\n\nReturn zero exit code on success, non-zero on failure.\nExit codes are how scripts determine whether a program succeeded or failed, so you should report this correctly.\nMap the non-zero exit codes to the most important failure modes.\n\nSend output to stdout.\nThe primary output for your command should go to stdout.\nAnything that is machine readable should also go to stdout—this is where piping sends things by default.\n\nSend messaging to stderr.\nLog messages, errors, and so on should all be sent to stderr.\nThis means that when commands are piped together, these messages are displayed to the user and not fed into the next command.\n\nDisplay extensive help text when asked.\nDisplay help when passed -h or --help flags.\nThis also applies to subcommands which might have their own help text.\n\nDisplay concise help text by default.\nWhen myapp or myapp subcommand requires arguments to function,\nand is run with no arguments,\ndisplay concise help text.\n\nYou can ignore this guideline\nif your program is interactive by default (e.g. npm init).\n\nThe concise help text should only include:\n\njq does this well.\nWhen you type jq, it displays an introductory description and an example, then prompts you to pass jq --help for the full listing of flags:\n\nShow full help when -h and --help is passed.\nAll of these should show help:\n\nIgnore any other flags and arguments that are passed—you should be able to add -h to the end of anything and it should show help.\nDon’t overload -h.\n\nIf your program is git-like, the following should also offer help:\n\nProvide a support path for feedback and issues.\nA website or GitHub link in the top-level help text is common.\n\nIn help text, link to the web version of the documentation.\nIf you have a specific page or anchor for a subcommand, link directly to that.\nThis is particularly useful if there is more detailed documentation on the web, or further reading that might explain the behavior of something.\n\nLead with examples.\nUsers tend to use examples over other forms of documentation, so show them first in the help page, particularly the common complex uses.\nIf it helps explain what it’s doing and it isn’t too long, show the actual output too.\n\nYou can tell a story with a series of examples, building your way toward complex uses.\n\nIf you’ve got loads of examples, put them somewhere else, in a cheat sheet command or a web page.\nIt’s useful to have exhaustive, advanced examples, but you don’t want to make your help text really long.\n\nFor more complex use cases, e.g. when integrating with another tool, it might be appropriate to write a fully-fledged tutorial.\n\nDisplay the most common flags and commands at the start of the help text.\nIt’s fine to have lots of flags, but if you’ve got some really common ones, display them first.\nFor example, the Git command displays the commands for getting started and the most commonly used subcommands first:\n\nUse formatting in your help text.\nBold headings make it much easier to scan.\nBut, try to do it in a terminal-independent way so that your users aren’t staring down a wall of escape characters.\n\nNote: When heroku apps --help is piped through a pager, the command emits no escape characters.\n\nIf the user did something wrong and you can guess what they meant, suggest it.\nFor example, brew update jq tells you that you should run brew upgrade jq.\n\nYou can ask if they want to run the suggested command, but don’t force it on them.\nFor example:\n\nRather than suggesting the corrected syntax, you might be tempted to just run it for them, as if they’d typed it right in the first place.\nSometimes this is the right thing to do, but not always.\n\nFirstly, invalid input doesn’t necessarily imply a simple typo—it can often mean the user has made a logical mistake, or misused a shell variable.\nAssuming what they meant can be dangerous, especially if the resulting action modifies state.\n\nSecondly, be aware that if you change what the user typed, they won’t learn the correct syntax.\nIn effect, you’re ruling that the way they typed it is valid and correct, and you’re committing to supporting that indefinitely.\nBe intentional in making that decision, and document both syntaxes.\n\nFurther reading: “Do What I Mean”\n\nIf your command is expecting to have something piped to it and stdin is an interactive terminal, display help immediately and quit.\nThis means it doesn’t just hang, like cat.\nAlternatively, you could print a log message to stderr.\n\nThe purpose of help text is to give a brief, immediate sense of what your tool is, what options are available, and how to perform the most common tasks.\nDocumentation, on the other hand, is where you go into full detail.\nIt’s where people go to understand what your tool is for, what it isn’t for, how it works and how to do everything they might need to do.\n\nProvide web-based documentation.\nPeople need to be able to search online for your tool’s documentation, and to link other people to specific parts.\nThe web is the most inclusive documentation format available.\n\nProvide terminal-based documentation.\nDocumentation in the terminal has several nice properties: it’s fast to access, it stays in sync with the specific installed version of the tool, and it works without an internet connection.\n\nConsider providing man pages.\nman pages, Unix’s original system of documentation, are still in use today, and many users will reflexively check man mycmd as a first step when trying to learn about your tool.\nTo make them easier to generate, you can use a tool like ronn (which can also generate your web docs).\n\nHowever, not everyone knows about man, and it doesn’t run on all platforms, so you should also make sure your terminal docs are accessible via your tool itself.\nFor example, git and npm make their man pages accessible via the help subcommand, so npm help ls is equivalent to man npm-ls.\n\nHuman-readable output is paramount.\nHumans come first, machines second.\nThe most simple and straightforward heuristic for whether a particular output stream (stdout or stderr) is being read by a human is whether or not it’s a TTY.\nWhatever language you’re using, it will have a utility or library for doing this (e.g. Python, Node, Go).\n\nFurther reading on what a TTY is.\n\nHave machine-readable output where it does not impact usability.\nStreams of text is the universal interface in UNIX.\nPrograms typically output lines of text, and programs typically expect lines of text as input,\ntherefore you can compose multiple programs together.\nThis is normally done to make it possible to write scripts,\nbut it can also help the usability for humans using programs.\nFor example, a user should be able to pipe output to grep and it should do what they expect.\n\n“Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.”\n— Doug McIlroy\n\nIf human-readable output breaks machine-readable output, use --plain to display output in plain, tabular text format for integration with tools like grep or awk.\nIn some cases, you might need to output information in a different way to make it human-readable.\n\nFor example, if you are displaying a line-based table, you might choose to split a cell into multiple lines, fitting in more information while keeping it within the width of the screen.\nThis breaks the expected behavior of there being one piece of data per line, so you should provide a --plain flag for scripts, which disables all such manipulation and outputs one record per line.\n\nDisplay output as formatted JSON if --json is passed.\nJSON allows for more structure than plain text, so it makes it much easier to output and handle complex data structures.\njq is a common tool for working with JSON on the command-line, and there is now a whole ecosystem of tools that output and manipulate JSON.\n\nIt is also widely used on the web, so by using JSON as the input and output of programs, you can pipe directly to and from web services using curl.\n\nDisplay output on success, but keep it brief.\nTraditionally, when nothing is wrong, UNIX commands display no output to the user.\nThis makes sense when they’re being used in scripts, but can make commands appear to be hanging or broken when used by humans.\nFor example, cp will not print anything, even if it takes a long time.\n\nIt’s rare that printing nothing at all is the best default behavior, but it’s usually best to err on the side of less.\n\nFor instances where you do want no output (for example, when used in shell scripts), to avoid clumsy redirection of stderr to /dev/null, you can provide a -q option to suppress all non-essential output.\n\nIf you change state, tell the user.\nWhen a command changes the state of a system, it’s especially valuable to explain what has just happened, so the user can model the state of the system in their head—particularly if the result doesn’t directly map to what the user requested.\n\nFor example, git push tells you exactly what it is doing, and what the new state of the remote branch is:\n\nMake it easy to see the current state of the system.\nIf your program does a lot of complex state changes and it is not immediately visible in the filesystem, make sure you make this easy to view.\n\nFor example, git status tells you as much information as possible about the current state of your Git repository, and some hints at how to modify the state:\n\nSuggest commands the user should run.\nWhen several commands form a workflow, suggesting to the user commands they can run next helps them learn how to use your program and discover new functionality.\nFor example, in the git status output above, it suggests commands you can run to modify the state you are viewing.\n\nActions crossing the boundary of the program’s internal world should usually be explicit.\nThis includes things like:\n\nIncrease information density—with ASCII art!\nFor example, ls shows permissions in a scannable way.\nWhen you first see it, you can ignore most of the information.\nThen, as you learn how it works, you pick out more patterns over time.\n\nUse color with intention.\nFor example, you might want to highlight some text so the user notices it, or use red to indicate an error.\nDon’t overuse it—if everything is a different color, then the color means nothing and only makes it harder to read.\n\nDisable color if your program is not in a terminal or the user requested it.\nThese things should disable colors:\n\nFurther reading: no-color.org, 12 Factor CLI Apps\n\nIf stdout is not an interactive terminal, don’t display any animations.\nThis will stop progress bars turning into Christmas trees in CI log output.\n\nUse symbols and emoji where it makes things clearer.\nPictures can be better than words if you need to make several things distinct, catch the user’s attention, or just add a bit of character.\nBe careful, though—it can be easy to overdo it and make your program look cluttered or feel like a toy.\n\nFor example, yubikey-agent uses emoji to add structure to the output so it isn’t just a wall of text, and a ❌ to draw your attention to an important piece of information:\n\nIf a piece of output serves only to help you (the developer) understand what your software is doing, it almost certainly shouldn’t be displayed to normal users by default—only in verbose mode.\n\nInvite usability feedback from outsiders and people who are new to your project.\nThey’ll help you see important issues that you are too close to the code to notice.\n\nDon’t treat stderr like a log file, at least not by default.\nDon’t print log level labels (ERR, WARN, etc.) or extraneous contextual information, unless in verbose mode.\n\nUse a pager (e.g. less) if you are outputting a lot of text.\nFor example, git diff does this by default.\nUsing a pager can be error-prone, so be careful with your implementation such that you don’t make the experience worse for the user.\nUse a pager only if stdin or stdout is an interactive terminal.\n\nA good sensible set of options to use for less is less -FIRX.\nThis does not page if the content fills one screen, ignores case when you search, enables color and formatting, and leaves the contents on the screen when less quits.\n\nThere might be libraries in your language that are more robust than piping to less.\nFor example, pypager in Python.\n\nOne of the most common reasons to consult documentation is to fix errors.\nIf you can make errors into documentation, then this will save the user loads of time.\n\nCatch errors and rewrite them for humans.\nIf you’re expecting an error to happen, catch it and rewrite the error message to be useful.\nThink of it like a conversation, where the user has done something wrong and the program is guiding them in the right direction.\nExample: “Can’t write to file.txt. You might need to make it writable by running ‘chmod +w file.txt’.”\n\nSignal-to-noise ratio is crucial.\nThe more irrelevant output you produce, the longer it’s going to take the user to figure out what they did wrong.\nIf your program produces multiple errors of the same type, consider grouping them under a single explanatory header instead of printing many similar-looking lines.\n\nConsider where the user will look first.\nPut the most important information at the end of the output.\nThe eye will be drawn to red text, so use it intentionally and sparingly.\n\nIf there is an unexpected or unexplainable error, provide debug and traceback information, and instructions on how to submit a bug.\nThat said, don’t forget about the signal-to-noise ratio: you don’t want to overwhelm the user with information they don’t understand.\nConsider writing the debug log to a file instead of printing it to the terminal.\n\nMake it effortless to submit bug reports.\nOne nice thing you can do is provide a URL and have it pre-populate as much information as possible.\n\nFurther reading: Google: Writing Helpful Error Messages, Nielsen Norman Group: Error-Message Guidelines\n\nPrefer flags to args.\nIt’s a bit more typing, but it makes it much clearer what is going on.\nIt also makes it easier to make changes to how you accept input in the future.\nSometimes when using args, it’s impossible to add new input without breaking existing behavior or creating ambiguity.\n\nHave full-length versions of all flags.\nFor example, have both -h and --help.\nHaving the full version is useful in scripts where you want to be verbose and descriptive, and you don’t have to look up the meaning of flags everywhere.\n\nCitation: GNU Coding Standards.\n\nOnly use one-letter flags for commonly used flags, particularly at the top-level when using subcommands.\nThat way you don’t “pollute” your namespace of short flags, forcing you to use convoluted letters and cases for flags you add in the future.\n\nMultiple arguments are fine for simple actions against multiple files.\nFor example, rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt.\nThis also makes it work with globbing: rm *.txt.\n\nIf you’ve got two or more arguments for different things, you’re probably doing something wrong.\nThe exception is a common, primary action, where the brevity is worth memorizing.\nFor example, cp <source> <destination>.\n\nUse standard names for flags, if there is a standard.\nIf another commonly used command uses a flag name, it’s best to follow that existing pattern.\nThat way, a user doesn’t have to remember two different options (and which command it applies to), and users can even guess an option without having to look at the help text.\n\nHere’s a list of commonly used options:\n\nMake the default the right thing for most users.\nMaking things configurable is good, but most users are not going to find the right flag and remember to use it all the time (or alias it).\nIf it’s not the default, you’re making the experience worse for most of your users.\n\nFor example, ls has terse default output to optimize for scripts and other historical reasons, but if it were designed today, it would probably default to ls -lhF.\n\nPrompt for user input.\nIf a user doesn’t pass an argument or flag, prompt for it.\n(See also: Interactivity)\n\nNever require a prompt.\nAlways provide a way of passing input with flags or arguments.\nIf stdin is not an interactive terminal, skip prompting and just require those flags/args.\n\nConfirm before doing anything dangerous.\nA common convention is to prompt for the user to type y or yes if running interactively, or requiring them to pass -f or --force otherwise.\n\n“Dangerous” is a subjective term, and there are differing levels of danger:\n\nConsider whether there are non-obvious ways to accidentally destroy things.\nFor example, imagine a situation where changing a number in a configuration file from 10 to 1 means that 9 things will be implicitly deleted—this should be considered a severe risk, and should be difficult to do by accident.\n\nIf input or output is a file, support - to read from stdin or write to stdout.\nThis lets the output of another command be the input of your command and vice versa, without using a temporary file.\nFor example, tar can extract files from stdin:\n\nIf a flag can accept an optional value, allow a special word like “none”.\nFor example, ssh -F takes an optional filename of an alternative ssh_config file, and ssh -F none runs SSH with no config file. Don’t just use a blank value—this can make it ambiguous whether arguments are flag values or arguments.\n\nIf possible, make arguments, flags and subcommands order-independent.\nA lot of CLIs, especially those with subcommands, have unspoken rules on where you can put various arguments.\nFor example a command might have a --foo flag that only works if you put it before the subcommand:\n\nThis can be very confusing for the user—especially given that one of the most common things users do when trying to get a command to work is to hit the up arrow to get the last invocation, stick another option on the end, and run it again.\nIf possible, try to make both forms equivalent, although you might run up against the limitations of your argument parser.\n\nDo not read secrets directly from flags.\nWhen a command accepts a secret, e.g. via a --password flag,\nthe flag value will leak the secret into ps output and potentially shell history.\nAnd, this sort of flag encourages the use of insecure environment variables for secrets.\n(Environment variables are insecure because they can often be read by other users, their values end up in debug logs, etc.)\n\nConsider accepting sensitive data only via files, e.g. with a --password-file flag, or via stdin.\nA --password-file flag allows a secret to be passed in discreetly, in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n(It’s possible to pass a file’s contents into a flag in Bash by using --password $(< password.txt).\nThis approach has the same security problems mentioned above.\nIt’s best avoided.)\n\nOnly use prompts or interactive elements if stdin is an interactive terminal (a TTY).\nThis is a pretty reliable way to tell whether you’re piping data into a command or whether it’s being run in a script, in which case a prompt won’t work and you should throw an error telling the user what flag to pass.\n\nIf --no-input is passed, don’t prompt or do anything interactive.\nThis allows users an explicit way to disable all prompts in commands.\nIf the command requires input, fail and tell the user how to pass the information as a flag.\n\nIf you’re prompting for a password, don’t print it as the user types.\nThis is done by turning off echo in the terminal.\nYour language should have helpers for this.\n\nLet the user escape.\nMake it clear how to get out.\n(Don’t do what vim does.)\nIf your program hangs on network I/O etc, always make Ctrl-C still work.\nIf it’s a wrapper around program execution where Ctrl-C can’t quit (SSH, tmux, telnet, etc), make it clear how to do that.\nFor example, SSH allows escape sequences with the ~ escape character.\n\nIf you’ve got a tool that’s sufficiently complex, you can reduce its complexity by making a set of subcommands.\nIf you have several tools that are very closely related, you can make them easier to use and discover by combining them into a single command (for example, RCS vs. Git).\n\nThey’re useful for sharing stuff—global flags, help text, configuration, storage mechanisms.\n\nBe consistent across subcommands.\nUse the same flag names for the same things, have similar output formatting, etc.\n\nUse consistent names for multiple levels of subcommand.\nIf a complex piece of software has lots of objects and operations that can be performed on those objects, it is a common pattern to use two levels of subcommand for this, where one is a noun and one is a verb.\nFor example, docker container create.\nBe consistent with the verbs you use across different types of objects.\n\nEither noun verb or verb noun ordering works, but noun verb seems to be more common.\n\nFurther reading: User experience, CLIs, and breaking the world, by John Starich.\n\nDon’t have ambiguous or similarly-named commands.\nFor example, having two subcommands called “update” and “upgrade” is quite confusing.\nYou might want to use different words, or disambiguate with extra words.\n\nValidate user input.\nEverywhere your program accepts data from the user, it will eventually be given bad data.\nCheck early and bail out before anything bad happens, and make the errors understandable.\n\nResponsive is more important than fast.\nPrint something to the user in <100ms.\nIf you’re making a network request, print something before you do it so it doesn’t hang and look broken.\n\nShow progress if something takes a long time.\nIf your program displays no output for a while, it will look broken.\nA good spinner or progress indicator can make a program appear to be faster than it is.\n\nUbuntu 20.04 has a nice progress bar that sticks to the bottom of the terminal.\n\nIf the progress bar gets stuck in one place for a long time, the user won’t know if stuff is still happening or if the program’s crashed.\nIt’s good to show estimated time remaining, or even just have an animated component, to reassure them that you’re still working on it.\n\nThere are many good libraries for generating progress bars.\nFor example, tqdm for Python, schollz/progressbar for Go, and node-progress for Node.js.\n\nDo stuff in parallel where you can, but be thoughtful about it.\nIt’s already difficult to report progress in the shell; doing it for parallel processes is ten times harder.\nMake sure it’s robust, and that the output isn’t confusingly interleaved.\nIf you can use a library, do so—this is code you don’t want to write yourself.\nLibraries like tqdm for Python and schollz/progressbar for Go support multiple progress bars natively.\n\nThe upside is that it can be a huge usability gain.\nFor example, docker pull’s multiple progress bars offer crucial insight into what’s going on.\n\nOne thing to be aware of: hiding logs behind progress bars when things go well makes it much easier for the user to understand what’s going on, but if there is an error, make sure you print out the logs.\nOtherwise, it will be very hard to debug.\n\nMake things time out.\nAllow network timeouts to be configured, and have a reasonable default so it doesn’t hang forever.\n\nMake it recoverable.\nIf the program fails for some transient reason (e.g. the internet connection went down), you should be able to hit <up> and <enter> and it should pick up from where it left off.\n\nMake it crash-only.\nThis is the next step up from idempotence.\nIf you can avoid needing to do any cleanup after operations, or you can defer that cleanup to the next run, your program can exit immediately on failure or interruption.\nThis makes it both more robust and more responsive.\n\nCitation: Crash-only software: More than meets the eye.\n\nPeople are going to misuse your program.\nBe prepared for that.\nThey will wrap it in scripts, use it on bad internet connections, run many instances of it at once, and use it in environments you haven’t tested in, with quirks you didn’t anticipate.\n(Did you know macOS filesystems are case-insensitive but also case-preserving?)\n\nIn software of any kind, it’s crucial that interfaces don’t change without a lengthy and well-documented deprecation process.\nSubcommands, arguments, flags, configuration files, environment variables: these are all interfaces, and you’re committing to keeping them working.\n(Semantic versioning can only excuse so much change; if you’re putting out a major version bump every month, it’s meaningless.)\n\nKeep changes additive where you can.\nRather than modify the behavior of a flag in a backwards-incompatible way, maybe you can add a new flag—as long as it doesn’t bloat the interface too much.\n(See also: Prefer flags to args.)\n\nWarn before you make a non-additive change.\nEventually, you’ll find that you can’t avoid breaking an interface.\nBefore you do, forewarn your users in the program itself: when they pass the flag you’re looking to deprecate, tell them it’s going to change soon.\nMake sure there’s a way they can modify their usage today to make it future-proof, and tell them how to do it.\n\nIf possible, you should detect when they’ve changed their usage and not show the warning any more: now they won’t notice a thing when you finally roll out the change.\n\nChanging output for humans is usually OK.\nThe only way to make an interface easy to use is to iterate on it, and if the output is considered an interface, then you can’t iterate on it.\nEncourage your users to use --plain or --json in scripts to keep output stable (see Output).\n\nDon’t have a catch-all subcommand.\nIf you have a subcommand that’s likely to be the most-used one, you might be tempted to let people omit it entirely for brevity’s sake.\nFor example, say you have a run command that wraps an arbitrary shell command:\n\nYou could make it so that if the first argument to mycmd isn’t the name of an existing subcommand, you assume the user means run, so they can just type this:\n\nThis has a serious drawback, though: now you can never add a subcommand named echo—or anything at all—without risking breaking existing usages.\nIf there’s a script out there that uses mycmd echo, it will do something entirely different after that user upgrades to the new version of your tool.\n\nDon’t allow arbitrary abbreviations of subcommands.\nFor example, say your command has an install subcommand.\nWhen you added it, you wanted to save users some typing, so you allowed them to type any non-ambiguous prefix, like mycmd ins, or even just mycmd i, and have it be an alias for mycmd install.\nNow you’re stuck: you can’t add any more commands beginning with i, because there are scripts out there that assume i means install.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with aliases—saving on typing is good—but they should be explicit and remain stable.\n\nDon’t create a “time bomb.”\nImagine it’s 20 years from now.\nWill your command still run the same as it does today, or will it stop working because some external dependency on the internet has changed or is no longer maintained?\nThe server most likely to not exist in 20 years is the one that you are maintaining right now.\n(But don’t build in a blocking call to Google Analytics either.)\n\nIf a user hits Ctrl-C (the INT signal), exit as soon as possible.\nSay something immediately, before you start clean-up.\nAdd a timeout to any clean-up code so it can’t hang forever.\n\nIf a user hits Ctrl-C during clean-up operations that might take a long time, skip them.\nTell the user what will happen when they hit Ctrl-C again, in case it is a destructive action.\n\nFor example, when quitting Docker Compose, you can hit Ctrl-C a second time to force your containers to stop immediately instead of shutting them down gracefully.\n\nYour program should expect to be started in a situation where clean-up has not been run.\n(See Crash-only software: More than meets the eye.)\n\nCommand-line tools have lots of different types of configuration, and lots of different ways to supply it (flags, environment variables, project-level config files).\nThe best way to supply each piece of configuration depends on a few factors, chief among them specificity, stability and complexity.\n\nConfiguration generally falls into a few categories:\n\nLikely to vary from one invocation of the command to the next.\n\nRecommendation: Use flags.\nEnvironment variables may or may not be useful as well.\n\nGenerally stable from one invocation to the next, but not always.\nMight vary between projects.\nDefinitely varies between different users working on the same project.\n\nThis type of configuration is often specific to an individual computer.\n\nRecommendation: Use flags and probably environment variables too.\nUsers may want to set the variables in their shell profile so they apply globally, or in .env for a particular project.\n\nIf this configuration is sufficiently complex, it may warrant a configuration file of its own, but environment variables are usually good enough.\n\nStable within a project, for all users.\n\nThis is the type of configuration that belongs in version control.\nFiles like Makefile, package.json and docker-compose.yml are all examples of this.\n\nRecommendation: Use a command-specific, version-controlled file.\n\nFollow the XDG-spec.\nIn 2010 the X Desktop Group, now freedesktop.org, developed a specification for the location of base directories where config files may be located.\nOne goal was to limit the proliferation of dotfiles in a user’s home directory by supporting a general-purpose ~/.config folder.\nThe XDG Base Directory Specification (full spec, summary) is supported by yarn, fish, wireshark, emacs, neovim, tmux, and many other projects you know and love.\n\nIf you automatically modify configuration that is not your program’s, ask the user for consent and tell them exactly what you’re doing.\nPrefer creating a new config file (e.g. /etc/cron.d/myapp) rather than appending to an existing config file (e.g. /etc/crontab).\nIf you have to append or modify to a system-wide config file, use a dated comment in that file to delineate your additions.\n\nApply configuration parameters in order of precedence.\nHere is the precedence for config parameters, from highest to lowest:\n\nEnvironment variables are for behavior that varies with the context in which a command is run.\nThe “environment” of an environment variable is the terminal session—the context in which the command is running.\nSo, an env var might change each time a command runs, or between terminal sessions on one machine, or between instantiations of one project across several machines.\n\nEnvironment variables may duplicate the functionality of flags or configuration parameters, or they may be distinct from those things.\nSee Configuration for a breakdown of common types of configuration and recommendations on when environment variables are most appropriate.\n\nFor maximum portability, environment variable names must only contain uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (and mustn’t start with a number).\nWhich means O_O and OWO are the only emoticons that are also valid environment variable names.\n\nAim for single-line environment variable values.\nWhile multi-line values are possible, they create usability issues with the env command.\n\nAvoid commandeering widely used names.\nHere’s a list of POSIX standard env vars.\n\nCheck general-purpose environment variables for configuration values when possible:\n\nRead environment variables from .env where appropriate.\nIf a command defines environment variables that are unlikely to change as long as the user is working in a particular directory,\nthen it should also read them from a local .env file so users can configure it differently for different projects without having to specify them every time.\nMany languages have libraries for reading .env files (Rust, Node, Ruby).\n\nDon’t use .env as a substitute for a proper configuration file.\n.env files have a lot of limitations:\n\nIf it seems like these limitations will hamper usability or security, then a dedicated config file might be more appropriate.\n\nDo not read secrets from environment variables.\nWhile environment variables may be convenient for storing secrets, they have proven too prone to leakage:\n\nSecrets should only be accepted via credential files, pipes, AF_UNIX sockets, secret management services, or another IPC mechanism.\n\n“Note the obsessive use of abbreviations and avoidance of capital letters; [Unix] is a system invented by people to whom repetitive stress disorder is what black lung is to miners.\nLong names get worn down to three-letter nubbins, like stones smoothed by a river.”\n— Neal Stephenson, In the Beginning was the Command Line\n\nThe name of your program is particularly important on the CLI: your users will be typing it all the time, and it needs to be easy to remember and type.\n\nMake it a simple, memorable word.\nBut not too generic, or you’ll step on the toes of other commands and confuse users.\nFor example, both ImageMagick and Windows used the command convert.\n\nUse only lowercase letters, and dashes if you really need to.\ncurl is a good name, DownloadURL is not.\n\nKeep it short.\nUsers will be typing it all the time.\nDon’t make it too short: the very shortest commands are best reserved for the common utilities used all the time, such as cd, ls, ps.\n\nMake it easy to type.\nIf you expect people to type your command name all day, make it easy on their hands.\n\nA real-world example: long before Docker Compose was docker compose, it was plum.\nThis turned out to be such an awkward, one-handed hopscotch that it was immediately renamed to fig, which – as well as being shorter – flows much more easily.\n\nFurther reading: The Poetics of CLI Command Names\n\nIf possible, distribute as a single binary.\nIf your language doesn’t compile to binary executables as standard, see if it has something like PyInstaller.\nIf you really can’t distribute as a single binary, use the platform’s native package installer so you aren’t scattering things on disk that can’t easily be removed.\nTread lightly on the user’s computer.\n\nIf you’re making a language-specific tool, such as a code linter, then this rule doesn’t apply—it’s safe to assume the user has an interpreter for that language installed on their computer.\n\nMake it easy to uninstall.\nIf it needs instructions, put them at the bottom of the install instructions—one of the most common times people want to uninstall software is right after installing it.\n\nUsage metrics can be helpful to understand how users are using your program, how to make it better, and where to focus effort.\nBut, unlike websites, users of the command-line expect to be in control of their environment, and it is surprising when programs do things in the background without telling them.\n\nDo not phone home usage or crash data without consent.\nUsers will find out, and they will be angry.\nBe very explicit about what you collect, why you collect it, how anonymous it is and how you go about anonymizing it, and how long you retain it for.\n\nIdeally, ask users whether they want to contribute data (“opt-in”).\nIf you choose to do it by default (“opt-out”), then clearly tell users about it on your website or first run, and make it easy to disable.\n\nExamples of projects that collect usage statistics:\n\nConsider alternatives to collecting analytics.\n\nFurther reading: Open Source Metrics",

    "description": "Learn why AI agents hallucinate, the real costs of ignoring this problem, and how to automatically detect and prevent hallucinations in production using advanced evaluation scorers and root cause analysis.",
    "fullText": "Your new AI customer service agent just confidently told a user that your product is compatible with a competitor's—when it isn't. Your research agent just cited a non-existent academic paper in its summary. Your internal knowledge base agent just invented a company policy that doesn't exist.\n\nThese are not just bugs; they are AI hallucinations. And they are one of the most dangerous and insidious problems facing production AI agents today. They erode user trust, create compliance risks, and can cause direct financial damage.\n\nThis article explains why agents hallucinate and how you can automatically detect and prevent it before your customers do.\n\nAn AI hallucination occurs when a large language model (LLM) generates information that is plausible but factually incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical in the given context. It's not a bug in the traditional sense—the model is functioning as designed, but its internal patterns have led it to an incorrect conclusion which it presents with complete confidence.\n\nFor AI agents, which are often designed to take action based on information, hallucinations are particularly dangerous. An agent that hallucinates can:\n\nThe Dangerous Part: Unlike traditional software bugs that crash or throw errors, hallucinations appear as normal, confident responses. There's no error message—just wrong information delivered with certainty.\n\nThere are several root causes for agent hallucinations, but they often fall into a few key categories:\n\nThe agent generates information that is not supported by the context it was given. This is the most common cause of hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.\n\nExample: A customer asks about your return policy. The RAG system retrieves a document about shipping policies instead. The agent \"fills in the gaps\" by inventing a plausible-sounding return policy.\n\nThe agent makes a logical leap that is incorrect, leading it to a false conclusion. Even with correct information, the model's reasoning process can go astray.\n\nExample: An agent is told \"Product A costs 100\"and\"ProductBcosts100\" and \"Product B costs 150.\" When asked which is cheaper, it might occasionally claim Product B is cheaper due to reasoning errors.\n\nThe model's training data is old, and it provides information that is no longer accurate. This is especially problematic for rapidly changing domains.\n\nExample: An agent trained on 2023 data confidently states a library version that has since been deprecated and replaced.\n\nThe user's prompt is unclear, and the agent makes an incorrect assumption to fill in the gaps rather than asking for clarification.\n\nExample: A user asks \"What's the price?\" without specifying which product. The agent picks one arbitrarily and states its price confidently.\n\nLong conversations or documents can exceed the model's context window, causing it to \"forget\" or misremember earlier information.\n\nThe model may have learned incorrect patterns from its training data, leading to systematic hallucinations on certain topics.\n\nIgnoring hallucinations is not an option. The consequences can be severe:\n\nTraditional methods for detecting hallucinations rely on manual review and fact-checking, which are slow, expensive, and reactive. You find out about a hallucination after it has already happened—often from an angry customer.\n\nNoveum.ai offers a radically different approach: automated, real-time hallucination detection using the agent's own system prompt and context as the ground truth.\n\nOur platform uses a suite of 68+ specialized evaluation scorers to analyze every single agent response. Here are the key scorers for hallucination detection:\n\nThe faithfulness_scorer checks if the agent's answer is factually consistent with the retrieved context. It directly measures whether the agent is \"making things up.\" When a response contradicts the provided documents, it gets flagged with detailed reasoning explaining the inconsistency.\n\nThe groundedness_scorer evaluates whether the agent's responses are based on the provided context or conversation history. It penalizes the model for inventing information not supported by the facts at hand—like citing studies, statistics, or sources that don't exist in the context.\n\nInstead of requiring a manually labeled dataset of \"correct\" answers, Noveum.ai uses the agent's system prompt and the context it was given as the source of truth.\n\nThe evaluation engine automatically checks:\n\nThis allows for fully automated, real-time evaluation without the bottleneck of manual labeling.\n\nDetecting a hallucination is the first step. Understanding why it happened is the key to preventing it. This is where NovaPilot, our AI-powered root cause analysis engine, comes in.\n\nWhen a hallucination is detected, NovaPilot analyzes the entire agent trace and the scores from all 68+ evaluators to identify the root cause. It might find that:\n\nPoor Retrieval Quality — Low context_relevance score indicates the RAG system retrieved wrong documents. The agent didn't have the right information to begin with.\n\nAmbiguous System Prompt — The prompt doesn't explicitly instruct the agent to say \"I don't know.\" Missing guardrails for handling uncertainty.\n\nModel Tendency — Certain models are more prone to hallucination for specific task types. May need to switch models or add verification steps.\n\nContext Window Issues — Important information was truncated due to token limits. Need to optimize context selection.\n\nMissing Verification Steps — No fact-checking layer before response delivery. Consider adding a verification agent to the pipeline.\n\nBased on its diagnosis, NovaPilot suggests specific, actionable fixes:\n\nLet's walk through a complete example of how Noveum.ai catches and diagnoses a hallucination:\n\nA financial services chatbot is asked about the interest rate on a specific savings account. The RAG system retrieves a document about a similar but different account.\n\nThe agent confidently states the interest rate from the wrong document:\n\nUser: \"What's the interest rate on the Premium Savings Account?\"\n\nAgent: \"The Premium Savings Account offers a 2.5% APY.\" ❌\n\n(Actual rate: 3.2% APY — the agent cited the Standard Savings rate)\n\nThe evaluation engine runs automatically on this interaction:\n\nNovaPilot analyzes the trace and identifies the pattern:\n\nRoot Cause: The retrieval system, not the LLM. The wrong document was retrieved, so even a perfect LLM would give the wrong answer.\n\n\"Improve the retrieval system to be more precise. Consider using product-specific embeddings or adding metadata filtering to ensure the correct account type is retrieved. Current retrieval is matching on general 'savings account' terms rather than specific product names.\"\n\nHere's how to add hallucination detection to your existing agent:\n\nIn your Noveum.ai dashboard, select the scorers you want to apply:\n\nSet your thresholds (we recommend 7/10 for production) and configure your alert channels.\n\nConfigure real-time alerts for hallucination detection:\n\nAdd clear instructions to your system prompt:\n\nMonitor your RAG pipeline's context relevance scores. Poor retrieval is the #1 cause of hallucinations.\n\nAdd a verification step before delivering responses. Noveum.ai automatically evaluates every response against its context using our suite of 68+ scorers—no manual verification code needed. Simply enable hallucination detection in your dashboard and get instant alerts when responses don't match the provided context.\n\nHallucination patterns change over time. Monitor trends and adjust your prompts and retrieval strategies accordingly.\n\nStudies suggest that LLMs hallucinate between 3-27% of the time depending on the task and model. For RAG systems with poor retrieval, rates can be even higher.\n\nNo current technology can guarantee zero hallucinations. The goal is to detect them before they reach users and continuously reduce their frequency through better prompts, retrieval, and model selection.\n\nFaithfulness measures whether the response contradicts the provided context. Groundedness measures whether claims are supported by the context at all. A response can be faithful (not contradicting) but not grounded (adding unsupported information).\n\nEvery trace is evaluated automatically as it's captured. Scores are computed in near-real-time, and alerts are triggered immediately when thresholds are crossed.\n\nGenerally, smaller and faster models hallucinate more than larger ones. However, even GPT-4 hallucinates. The key is detection and mitigation, not model selection alone.\n\nHallucinations are a serious threat to the reliability and trustworthiness of AI agents. Relying on manual detection is a losing battle—you'll always be reacting to problems after they've damaged user trust.\n\nThe only scalable solution is to automate the process.\n\nNoveum.ai provides the industry's most advanced platform for automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing hallucinations in production agents.

    "fullText": "Vanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\n\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\n\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\n\nVanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\n\nMany retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\n\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\n\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Days after Ghislaine Maxwell asked a judge to immediately free her from a 20-year prison sentence, the public release of grand jury transcripts from her sex trafficking case returned the spotlight to victims whose allegations helped land her behind bars.\n\nThe disclosure of the transcripts as part of the Justice Department’s ongoing release of its investigative files on Maxwell and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein exposed how an FBI agent told grand jurors about Maxwell's critical role in Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of girls and young women.\n\nMaxwell, a British socialite and publishing heir, was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 after four women told a federal jury in New York City about how she and Epstein abused them in the 1990s and early 2000s. Epstein never went to trial. He was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges and killed himself a month later in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail.\n\nTwo weeks ago, as the Justice Department prepared to begin releasing what are commonly known as the Epstein files, Maxwell filed a habeas petition, asking a federal judge to free her on grounds that “substantial new evidence” has emerged proving that constitutional violations spoiled her trial.\n\nMaxwell claimed exonerating information was withheld and that witnesses lied in their testimony. She filed the petition on her own, without the assistance of a lawyer.\n\nThis week, the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, scolded Maxwell for failing to remove victim names and other identifying information from her court papers. He said future filings must be kept sealed and out of public view until they have been reviewed and redacted to protect victims' identities.\n\nVictims fear Maxwell will be pardoned\n\nEpstein accuser Danielle Bensky said the release of records has only sharpened the focus on Maxwell’s crimes among their victims. Bensky said she's been involved in daily discussions with about two dozen other victims that make clear Maxwell “is a criminal who was 1,000% engaged in sexual acts.\"\n\n“I’ve heard things that would make your blood curdle. I just had a conversation with a survivor last night who said she was the puppeteer,” Bensky said.\n\nBensky said she was sexually abused by Epstein two decades ago. She said she was never personally abused by Maxwell.\n\nDelayed and heavily redacted files\n\nThe transcripts of grand jury proceedings that resulted in Maxwell's indictment were released this week in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law enacted last month after months of public and political pressure.\n\nThe Justice Department has been periodically posting records after acknowledging it would miss last Friday’s congressionally mandated deadline to release all records. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring victims’ names and other identifying information.\n\nOn Wednesday, the department said it may need a “few more weeks” to release the full trove after suddenly discovering more than a million potentially relevant documents. It was a stunning development after department officials suggested months ago that they'd already accounted for the vast universe of Epstein-related materials.\n\nSome of the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury records were initially released with heavy redactions — A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY” — was entirely blacked out. Updated versions were posted over the weekend.\n\nFBI agent testifies Maxwell manipulated young girl\n\nAn FBI agent’s grand jury testimony, describing interviews conducted with Epstein victims, foreshadowed trial testimony a year later from four women who described Maxwell's role in their sexual abuse from 1994 to 2004.\n\nThe agent told of a woman who described meeting Maxwell and Epstein as a 14-year-old attending a Michigan summer arts camp in 1994. Flight logs showed Epstein and Maxwell went to the school sponsoring the camp because Epstein was a donor.\n\nAccording to the agent, whose name was redacted from the transcript, the girl had a chance encounter with Epstein and Maxwell one day. After learning that the girl was from Palm Beach, Florida, Epstein mentioned that he sometimes gave scholarships to students and they requested her phone number, the agent said.\n\nOnce home, the girl visited Epstein's estate with her mother for tea and the mother was impressed when Epstein said he provided scholarships, enough so that the mother said Epstein was like a “godfather,” the agent said.\n\nThe agent said the girl began regularly going to the estate as Epstein and Maxwell “groomed” her with gifts and trips to the movies, and Epstein began paying for voice lessons and giving her money that he said she should give to her struggling mother.\n\nThe agent said the girl thought her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell was strange, “but Maxwell normalized it for her. She was like a cool, older sister and made comments like, ‘This is what grownups do.’”\n\nEventually, the agent testified, the girl saw Maxwell topless at the pool. After she revealed that she hoped to be an actor and a model, Epstein told her he was best friends with the owner of Victoria's Secret and that she'll have to learn to be comfortable in her underwear and not be a prude, the agent said.\n\nThen, the agent said, the girl asked Epstein what he meant by that and the financier pulled her into his lap and masturbated. After that, the agent added, the girl's encounters with Epstein began to include sexual contact, particularly in his massage room.\n\nMaxwell was sometimes there with other girls, the agent said. One of the girls would begin massaging Epstein and Maxwell would tease the girls, the agent said.\n\n“She’d grab the girl’s breasts, and she would direct the girls on what to do,” the agent said, relaying the girl’s account. Maxwell's attitude during the encounters was ”very casual; she acted like this was normal,\" the agent said.\n\nThe released testimony appeared to reflect the testimony at Maxwell's 2021 trial by a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane.”\n\nAt trial, Jane said Maxwell also participated in group sessions between multiple females and Epstein that usually began with Epstein or Maxwell leading them all into a bedroom or a massage room at the Palm Beach residence.",

    "title": "Endocrinologists Warn Against This Popular Breakfast Combo if You’re Trying To Balance Blood Sugar",
    "description": "Find out how this common food pairing can negatively impact your health.",
    "fullText": "Whether you’re at risk for type 2 diabetes or just trying to keep your energy levels steady, there are many reasons why it’s beneficial to keep your blood sugar levels balanced. Breakfast is the first opportunity of the day to do that. \n\nFood combinations are an important part of maintaining steady blood sugar levels. For example, a bagel can lead to an increase in blood sugar after eating it, but if you pair it with eggs or an avocado (both good sources of unsaturated fats), it slows sugar absorption from the carbohydrates and the increase will be less dramatic.\n\nSimilar to how some pairings can be beneficial for blood sugar, other pairings can be detrimental, causing even more of a blood sugar spike. There’s one particularly popular breakfast food and drink combination that can do this, according to endocrinologists.\n\nMaybe you thought that maintaining stable blood sugar was only important for people with diabetes. However, Dr. Fady Hannah-Shmouni, MD, an endocrinologist and the medical director at Eli Health, emphasizes that it’s essential for everyone’s health.\n\n“Even without diabetes, steady blood sugar helps keep energy stable, supports clear thinking, reduces cravings and protects long-term metabolic health,” Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says, adding that frequent spikes can contribute to inflammation, weight gain and insulin resistance over time.\n\n🩺\nUnstable blood sugar levels impact health both in the short term and long term. Short-term, Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says it can lead to fatigue, brain fog, irritability, headaches, shakiness and intense food cravings. “These rapid swings can also disrupt concentration and mood as your body releases stress hormones to rebalance itself,” he adds.\n\nWhat happens when your blood sugar levels are all over the place long-term? Dr. Hannah-Shmouni explains repeated highs and lows can make energy and appetite harder to regulate and that, over time, it increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, weight gain, heart disease and fatty liver disease, among other metabolic conditions.\n\nDr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, MD, an endocrinologist with NYU Langone Health, adds to this, saying, “Complications can occur from long-term unstable blood sugar, including an increased risk for heart attacks, kidney and nerve damage, high cholesterol and blood pressure.”\n\nKnowing how riding the blood sugar rollercoaster can impact health, you’re likely inspired to do what you can to keep it balanced, starting with what you eat for breakfast. After all, how we spend our mornings sets the tone for the rest of the day.\n\nOne breakfast combination that all three endocrinologists we talked to say can majorly spike blood sugar is a pastry paired with fruit juice. Many people pour a glass of OJ or grapefruit juice to have with their breakfast for the vitamin C boost, but this combination can negatively impact blood sugar.\n\n“Pastries and fruit juice are both forms of fast-acting carbohydrates without good nutrients and as a result will significantly increase your glucose levels, especially if you have underlying type 2 diabetes,” Dr. Pessah-Pollack says.\n\nDr. Florence Comite, MD, an endocrinologist, founder of the Comite Center for Precision Medicine and Healthy Longevity and author of the forthcoming book, Invincible: Defy Your Genetic Destiny to Live Better, Longer, explains that pastries and fruit juice are both high in carbohydrates that can cause a rapid glucose spike and equally quick drop, followed by an insulin spike which results in jitteriness and cravings for more quick energy. “That rollercoaster ride of dramatic glucose spikes and dips is unhealthy and will lead to insulin resistance,” she says.\n\nWhile a pastry and fruit juice aren’t exactly a great pairing as far as your blood sugar is concerned, that doesn't mean you can’t ever enjoy either one. If you’re going to have either a pastry or fruit juice for breakfast, all three experts recommend pairing it with a food high in protein, fiber or unsaturated fats. Some examples include nuts, eggs or avocado. This will mitigate the blood sugar spike, especially if you eat the nutrient-dense food first.\n\nDr. Pessah-Pollack recommends having a whole fruit instead of fruit juice, sharing, “Whole fruit has fiber, which is beneficial and slows digestion. Fruit juice lacks this fiber to slow sugar absorption.\"\n\nUnless you’re really craving that pastry, Dr. Pessah-Pollack recommends having oatmeal instead, which is a great source of fiber, compared to the pastry, which doesn’t provide any nutritional benefits. To naturally sweeten your oatmeal without spiking your blood sugar, add cinnamon and top it with fruit.\n\nIn general, whenever you’re craving something sweet (whether it’s for breakfast, a snack or dessert) but you don’t want to spike your blood sugar, Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says to choose sweets that come with protein, fiber or healthy fats, or to pair them with those nutrients. “These [nutrients] slow digestion and help keep glucose steadier. Good options include fruit with nut butter, Greek yogurt with berries, a square of dark chocolate after a balanced meal, chia pudding or a small portion of your favorite dessert eaten after protein rather than on an empty stomach,” he explains.\n\nDr. Fady Hannah-Shmouni, MD, endocrinologist and the medical director at Eli Health\n\nDr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, MD, endocrinologist with NYU Langone Health\n\nDr. Florence Comite, MD, endocrinologist, founder of the Comite Center for Precision Medicine and Healthy Longevity and author of the forthcoming book, Invincible: Defy Your Genetic Destiny to Live Better, Longer\n\nMa, X., Nan, F., Liang, H., et al.

    "description": "\"I'm boiling over angry right now.\"",
    "fullText": "A video of a driver struggling to make their way through the iconic Shrine Drive Thru Tree in California has drawn ire online.\n\nTikToker Kbeautymom75 (@kbeautymom75) shared a video of a driver who had managed to get stuck while driving along the Avenue of the Giants in Humboldt County.\n\nThe video shows the driver trying to maneuver their massive SUV through the tree, a naturally split sequoia that has a small road through it. The Shrine Tree is an iconic tourist attraction, but not one that every vehicle is small enough to make it through.\n\nYou can hear the crack of wood as the driver attempts to maneuver their way through the tree, having misjudged their placement on the road in relation to the tree on either side. After about 10 seconds of maneuvering, the driver makes it through, but not before damaging the roughly 3,000-year-old tree via their hubris.\n\nThis video is emblematic of a recurring issue in national parks across the country, namely a lack of respect for the beauty of the scenery around them. From graffiti at Rocky Mountain National Park to YouTubers defacing the Grand Canyon, there are more and more examples of people treating these landmarks with far less respect than they deserve.\n\nIt also illustrates an issue with the rate at which American cars have grown in size; while the SUV is large, it's hardly the largest model on the road, and it can barely fit through the massive tree. Smaller, more fuel-efficient cars would have a much easier time traversing the narrow pass.\n\nCommenters were quick to pile on the driver.\n\n\"They should be fined tbh,\" one said.\n\nAnother TikTok user wrote: \"I'm boiling over angry right now. The sequoias are my second home, and this hurts.\"\n\n\"They should be liable for any damage done to that tree,\" a third added.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "DENVER (AP) — Former Colorado elections clerk Tina Peters is asking the state appeals court to recognize President Donald Trump's pardon of her state convictions as valid.\n\nIn a motion Tuesday, Peters' lawyers said the Colorado appeals court no longer has jurisdiction over her case because of a Dec. 5 pardon issued by Trump. They also asked the court to release her from prison because of the pardon.\n\nPeters, the former Mesa County, Colorado clerk, was convicted of state crimes there for orchestrating a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race. Trump’s pardon power does not extend to state crimes.\n\nIn the court filing, Peters' lawyers argued that President George Washington issued pardons to people convicted of both state and federal crimes in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1795. They urged the state appeals court to issue a ruling quickly. The court is set to hear arguments from lawyers in Peters' appeal of her conviction on Jan. 14.\n\nThe appeals court ruled Wednesday that lawyers from the state attorney general's office, which is defending the conviction, could respond to Peters’ arguments by Jan. 8.\n\nThe office of Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser declined to comment. Weiser previously dismissed it when Trump announced it Dec. 11.\n\n“The idea that a president could pardon someone tried and convicted in state court has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up,” he said in statement then.\n\nIf the appeals court rules the pardon isn't valid, one of Peters' attorneys, Peter Ticktin, said she could appeal that issue to the U.S. Supreme Court while the state court continues to consider Peters' appeal of her conviction.\n\nAnother Peters attorney, John Case, has asked the state prison system to release Peters based on Trump's pardon but the state refused, according to an email included in the appeals court filing.\n\nEarlier this month, Peters lost a bid in federal court to be released from prison while her state appeal is considered.\n\nPeters claims that the state judge who sentenced her to nine years behind bars violated her First Amendment rights by punishing her for making allegations about election fraud.\n\nDuring Peters’ October 2024 sentencing, Judge Matthew Barrett called Peters a “charlatan” and said she posed a danger to the community for spreading lies about voting and undermining the democratic process.\n\nPeters was unapologetic and insisted that everything she did was geared toward trying to uproot what she believed was fraud. She claimed her actions were done for the greater good.\n\nPeters was convicted of allowing a man to misuse a security card to access the election system and being deceptive about that person’s identity. The man was affiliated with MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election from Trump.",

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nSerpent Lake is expected to pair Intel's upcoming Titan Lake CPU architecture with Nvidia's RTX Rubin graphics, manufactured on TSMC's 3-nanometer process. The chip is reportedly aimed at competing with AMD's Strix Halo by delivering stronger graphics performance in high-end laptops.\n\nOne notable feature is memory bandwidth. The design is said to support up to 16 channels of LPDDR6 memory, a move intended to avoid bottlenecks that have limited graphics performance in competing processors.\n\nThe leak appears to offer the first real glimpse of what Intel and Nvidia's $5 billion partnership could produce.

    "fullText": "Earlier this year, Southwest Airlines made a groundbreaking change as the airline ended its longstanding \"bags fly free\" policy and began charging passengers for checked luggage. The move came as the struggling airline looked to boost overall profits. However, that did not happen this year.\n\nDespite Southwest's decision to begin charging passengers for checked luggage, the airline still saw a massive slump in profits throughout the year.\n\nFor decades, Southwest allowed all of its customers to travel with up to two checked bags, free of charge. However, back in May, the airline officially ended that policy.\n\nIn May, Southwest Airlines officially instituted checked baggage fees, adding a $35 charge for the first bag and $45 for each additional checked bag.\n\nIt was the most high-profile in a series of high-profile changes that Southwest made this year as it undergoes a major brand overhaul.\n\nThough Southwest ditched free bags in an attempt to boost profits, those profits have not come through the first nine months of the year.\n\nAs CNBC reports, Southwest Airlines announced that its profits have actually fallen by 42 percent throughout the first nine months of the year.\n\nThe latest reported profit slumps come after Southwest reported no noticeable boost in revenue from checked bags charges back in August. In fact, executives admitted that basic economy sales slumped immediately following the checked bag charges, indicating that customers were turned off by the new charges.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan has continually expressed optimism about the hypothetical revenue these new bag fees are expected to bring in, but the numbers simply have not backed up that reality.\n\nIt's worth noting that despite the slumping profits, Southwest's stock has been soaring thanks in large part to the changes the airline continues to make, like assigned seating and premium seating options that will officially roll out next year.\n\n“Because the assigned seating, the extra legroom, kicks in and there’s a lot of value in that, of course, [results are] going to be better year over year,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC earlier this month. “The bookings that we’re seeing reflect the business case for assigned seating and extra legroom.”\n\nHowever, even if Southwest's future outlook does look promising to investors, one expert points out that the bag fees aren't exactly the reason for that, no matter what the executives say.\n\n“One month of selling a ‘basic economy’ product they saw their revenue per available seat mile decline by .5 percentage point, and that’s with charging for bags,” Katy Nastro, travel expert at Going, told Customer Experience Dive back in August. “While they say bag fees are looking healthy, with softer demand, they’ve likely had to discount base fares which means they aren’t making pure profit from bag fees.”",

    "fullText": "The name Ana Fedina may not ring a bell, but if you've played games like \"Diablo IV,\" you've seen her work.\n\nFor more than seven years, Fedina has been working as a professional artist and has contributed illustrations to games like \"Raid: Shadow Legends\" as well.\n\nMost recently, she was the illustrator for \"The Armory of Heroes,\" a full-art compendium of weapons and character art released by the gaming and media company Critical Role in July.\n\nFedina didn't start out as a game artist.\n\n\"I didn't know that you could make a living doing what I do now. These cool comic artists seemed pretty unreachable when I was younger, so I thought I would study design and become a graphic designer,\" Fedina told Business Insider.\n\nBut in college, she discovered that drawing for games was a viable career and went all in on making concept art.\n\nFedina, who worked on \"The Armory of Heroes\" alongside writer Martin Cahill, was a fan of Critical Role before landing the book gig.\n\n\"Back in the day, I spent too much time on Tumblr and one day I started to see some interesting-looking characters on my feed,\" Fedina said. Those characters were from the crew's second Twitch-streamed \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaign, which has now been written into an Amazon-backed animated series on Prime Video.\n\n\"I wanted to work with Critical Role for a while, and I may have had some opportunities in the past, but they didn't work out,\" Fedina said. \"So it was pretty cool to try something, but I didn't expect this project to end up being this big.\"\n\nYears later, an editor working with CR's publishing arm contacted her and asked to contribute to the book. That kicked off a yearlong gig that began in January 2024, in which Fedina illustrated around 120 pieces for the book, which spans 216 full-color pages.\n\nFedina's illustration process for \"The Armory of Heroes\" involved everything from research to drafting, then getting several rounds of notes from the Critical Role co-founders.\n\n\"There were some notes, like, 'The character wielding this sharp weapon might hurt themselves.' Or, 'let's make it more functional,' or, 'Let's make changes to suit the armor and weapons to the wearer, make it more personal,'\" she said.\n\nShe said she also relied on notes she'd taken from the Twitch stream. Fedina also said that she included some personal touches in the character art. The cleric Pike Trickfoot was one of her favorites to draw, and Fedina produced her own version of the character's armor.\n\nFedina's top tip for artists who want to secure a role with companies like Critical Role is to branch out and create more than just fan art.\n\n\"If you want to work on a wider variety of gigs, you should learn character design, learn more complex illustration,\" Fedina said. \"Analyze the market and what it needs, not only popular fan work.\"\n\nShe added that many artists who have worked with Critical Role have an \"original touch and vision\" that they can add to the project.\n\nOn the portfolio front, Fedina said market analysis will help budding creatives get gigs.\n\n\"Analyze the artworks of the artists who already worked with that particular client, and try to understand: What are their needs?\" Fedina said.\n\n\"For all the gigs I was hired for, I had something in my portfolio that aligned with their needs,\" Fedina added. \"I think I was hired by Critical Role because I had weapons in my portfolio, not just character art.\"\n\nFedina added, too, that some good old in-person networking doesn't hurt.\n\n\"For some gigs, you will be recommended by an artist, or other people from the industry who know that you are a good person to work with, not just a great artist,\" Fedina said.\n\n\"It's about having soft skills, and knowing that it won't be a problem for people to work with you,\" Fedina said. \"Try to not only get the likes on social media, but also, just make friends, have thoughtful discussions, and make great connections.\"\n\nDo you work on the Critical Role franchise and have a story to share?

    "title": "I left my university in Milan to study in a much smaller town. I loved the lower cost of living and slower pace.",
    "description": "I thought I would enjoy attending a private university in Milan. I quickly learned I had made the wrong choice.",
    "fullText": "I crossed the street near where I was living in Milan on the verge of tears. I had had enough of feeling sad, lonely, and hopeless.\n\nThat surely wasn't how I expected to feel in my first year of university.\n\nThe previous spring, I had thought about which undergraduate degree I wanted to pursue for months, reading about courses, tuition, and life in a new place. Since I loved writing and dreamed of becoming a journalist, studying communication seemed like the best bet. I chose to pursue a degree at a private university in Milan because the classes seemed fascinating and useful, and the idea of living in Milan was thrilling.\n\nUnfortunately, I soon realized I had made the wrong choice.\n\nThe majority of the courses I was taking were engaging, but we occasionally experienced last-minute schedule changes and disorganized lecturers, and that didn't sit right with me.\n\nMore importantly, I began to feel guilty about the expenses my parents were covering for me. They assured me they could afford it and that my education was worthwhile to them; nonetheless, the tuition and rent were expensive. And, if I wasn't loving it, should they be spending so much?\n\nLiving in Milan was way more exciting in my dreams than it was in reality. While this metropolis had a lot to offer, like cultural exhibitions, sports events, and a lively nightlife, it was also chaotic and hectic. I often felt agitated and restless.\n\nIn my first months there, my sleep was severely affected. It was extremely challenging to find accommodation near the university, and I ended up in a small apartment with a shared bedroom. I struggled to adapt to that living situation and to the noisy neighborhood we lived in.\n\nThe following summer, I applied to the University of Urbino. The living costs and slower rhythms of Urbino, a 15,000-inhabitant town located a short distance from where I grew up in San Marino, were way more appealing to me.\n\nThere, I could attend classes just three days a week, so finding an accommodation wasn't an urgent matter anymore. It was manageable to go back and forth by car from my family home in the first month.\n\nAfter that period, I rented a single room with a stunning view, at a walkable distance from my lecture halls. The morning walk in Urbino's historical center to class became a pleasurable part of my day.\n\nI felt relieved because the public university tuition and accommodation in Urbino were much cheaper than what I was paying in Milan. Given the flexibility of my new arrangement and the saved money, I signed up for a fitness course with training branches in Urbino and San Marino, as well as a mindfulness program in Rimini. I was brighter and more serene.\n\nUnfortunately, this period in Urbino didn't last long, because COVID-19 hit and universities implemented online lessons, and I eventually ended up moving back home.\n\nLooking back, those few months in Urbino were the best period of my early 20s, and I'm glad I was courageous enough to know that something wasn't right and that I could do something about it, and that's a lesson that still sticks with me today.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia is forging ahead with another bet on the AI boom, agreeing to a licensing deal with AI hardware startup Groq.\n\nGroq said Wednesday that some of its executives, including its founder and CEO, will join Nvidia as part of the deal. Groq is expected to continue operating independently following what it described as a non-exclusive licensing deal.\n\nGroq is known for its Language Processing Unit, which is a custom chip designed for AI inference, namely, the process by which a trained AI model makes predictions or decisions. The startup was valued at about $6.9 billion as of three months ago and raised around $750 million in its latest funding round.\n\nJonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other members of its team are expected to join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market cap north of $4.5 trillion.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told Business Insider on Wednesday that Nvidia is not acquiring the chip startup.\n\nNeither Nvidia nor Groq disclosed financial terms of the agreement.\n\nRoss and Douglas Wightman were engineers at Google who started the project that became Google's first TPU chips, before leaving to found Groq. The TPUs are custom-made to accelerate large-scale machine-learning tasks designed to handle AI workloads, and are a major rival to Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThe deal between the two companies comes as a new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley. Whereas traditional startups either aim to go public or be acquired, new acqui-hire deals could leave some startup employees behind, only benefiting a small percentage of staff members with desirable AI skills and the founders.\n\nFor instance, in 2024, Google agreed to pay $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology but only hired its two superstar cofounders and 20% of the startup's employees. In the same year, AI developers Adept and Inflection also made similar deals with Amazon and Microsoft, respectively.\n\nMore recently, Meta's acqui-hire of Scale AI became one of the biggest bets on talent after the company agreed to invest roughly $14 billion for a 49% stake and to bring its CEO, Alexandr Wang, into the fold to lead the Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\nThese acqui-hires don't always end well. Windsurf employees were left in limbo after the AI coding startup was nearly aquired by OpenAI for $3 billion, only for the deal to fall apart and the company to be split. Google spent billions to hire Windsurf's CEO and top engineers, while the remaining hundreds of employees were acquired by another startup, Cognition.",

    "description": "Ayumi Nakajima said she values candidates who talk about their failures without spinning stories to make themselves look good.",
    "fullText": "A Pinterest executive who worked at Meta said there's one thing she looks for in potential hires: how they talk about failure.\n\nAyumi Nakajima began her career at Nielsen before taking on a leadership role at Meta — then Facebook — in 2013. She joined Pinterest in 2015, where she's now a senior director in Singapore, heading its Asia-Pacific content partnerships.\n\nShe leads a team of about 20 people across APAC and has interviewed several hundred candidates throughout her career.\n\nNakajima said she pays close attention to how potential hires respond to the interview question: \"What are some failures you have experienced?\"\n\nShe said some candidates tell stories about failures in which they ultimately look good.\n\n\"I'm sure they've prepped in a way to not look too bad, but I actually appreciate it when someone says, 'Actually, this was a failure,'\" she said. \"When they say, 'This was when I messed up,' instead of blaming others.\"\n\n\"Those are some of the soft signals that I look for, when the person can accept when things are not working, or can accept that there was a mistake, and evolve and learn from that,\" Nakajima said.\n\nShe said the tech landscape is changing rapidly, so while there are certain skills she needs in a candidate, she values adaptability and receptiveness to criticism over all else.\n\n\"When I interview candidates, I always look for people who are more flexible and versatile rather than having specific experiences and ticking off a box,\" she said. \"I'd prefer to have someone who's really dynamic and has a growth mindset, because six months down the line, the scope might change.\"\n\nOn the flip side, Nakajima also has a piece of advice for hirers: Don't rush into it.\n\nNakajima said she likes to take her time during the hiring process, with the mindset that the person will stay in the role for four to five years, rather than just one to two.\n\n\"If you think of them as staying for five plus years, then a month delay in the hiring process is not going to ruin things,\" she said. She added that being shortsighted and hiring someone to rush through a project is how employers often pick someone who might not be the best fit.\n\nShe said that she had changed her mind about candidates who were close to being confirmed, after giving it more thought.\n\n\"The recruiting team was obviously not so happy with me, but I think those are just some of the trade-offs that you can make to make the right hiring decision,\" she said.",

Whether you’re surviving harsh environments, building sprawling systems, or just chilling and catching fish, the online co-op games on this list will keep you and all your friends hooked and coming back for more. If you're looking for a cozier setup, check out our best couch co-op games list.\n\nPlayed online with friends, Divinity: Original Sin 2 becomes less about obsessively optimizing builds and more about reacting together to a world that’s constantly responding to your choices. It sounds cheesy, but if you want a game where you can create actual shared stories and feel like your actions impact an entire world, get your mates downloading Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nThe game’s strength lies in how much freedom it gives you all. Quests rarely have a single solution, and disagreements about what to do next are only a sign that you're properly invested. Whatever you do, the game adapts, and the group adapts with it. Combat is turn-based, which gives everyone time to think and discuss/argue over the best plan. Outside of combat, exploration also feels pretty communal if you lean into it, with players splitting up to investigate different areas and then regrouping with new ideas. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a long game, but one that rewards groups willing to commit to a shared adventure--one of you can even be the Game Master if you'd like. There's a new Divinity game coming out at some point, too, so keep your eyes peeled and dig deep into the lore so you don't get left behind.\n\nValheim is one of those games that is almost always better in co-op than played alone. Fans make a lot of noise about the deep exploration and survival mechanics (rightly so), but its base building is another example of where online co-op really shines. Building a settlement together turns the game into a long-term group project, where everyone contributes in their own way. Watching a base slowly grow from a rough shelter into a functioning village is deeply satisfying, and who doesn't want to build a massive Viking longhouse?\n\nThere’s also a comforting rhythm to games like Valheim. Log in, check what needs fixing, expand a wall, add a roof, and then head out together for the next goal. The game supports both focused teamwork and casual hanging out, making it ideal for groups that want something flexible but meaningful. Why not grab some Valheim mods while you're at it?\n\nPhasmophobia is half co-op, half creepy chaos, and by far one of the best horror games on Xbox. It’s a game where communication isn’t just helpful, it might just save your life. Playing with friends transforms what could be a terrifying solo experience into a tense but often hilarious group effort. Just seeing how your nearest and dearest react to jumpscares in real-time is always a treat.\n\nThe aim of the game is to investigate paranormal activity using a selection of tools and finding evidence. Each investigation in Phasmophobia becomes a shared puzzle between four minds, as you split tasks, compare evidence, and constantly relay information over voice chat. Successes and failures feel communal, and the stakes only get higher as the hauntings get more intense. On the up side, shared responsibility makes it easier to laugh about afterward, even if you were shrieking with very real fear in the moment.\n\nGreen Hell is the survival game you recommend to both your novice and veteran friends. Accessible and challenging all at once, the more support you have, the more manageable the challenges become. Green Hell's online co-op turns the jungle from an overwhelming threat into a shared challenge.\n\nSure, you can go out with weapons and stake a claim to the ground, focusing on combat and conquest, or you can raise animals in wooden holding pens, nurture crops, and build--dare we say, cozy--shelters for you and your comrades. Despite including a number of real-world survival techniques and some genuinely challenging hostile encounters, Green Hell isn't too punishing when you've got a group around you to scout, scavenge, defend, and farm your new home.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWebfishing is a little different than most games on this list, but a worthy addition nonetheless. It's a low-key, low-stakes, low-poly chill out zone, where you and your friends can customize animal avatars, go fishing, chat about life, and explore. It's a space for conversation and de-stressing, a great alternative to a group chat, especially if you don't mind periods of silence and relaxation.\n\nOver time you acquire better equipment, new threads, and the ability to catch better fish. Show off your catches, sell them, or merely explore. There are a few secrets hidden in the game that might cause a spark of excitement, but we'll not spoil too much here.\n\nDon’t Starve Together is the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, a game full of harsh wildernesses, strange creatures, and deep mysteries. The game’s uncompromising world is much easier to navigate when mistakes are made--and learned from--together, either with friends in a private server, or with strangers online.\n\nThis one should be an easy sell to friends who aren't sure about survival horror, as Don't Starve is also a game like Minecraft in that you can mine, craft, explore, and gather resources to make a communal base. Just don't mention what happens in the dark.\n\nFactorio is co-op at its most collaborative. It’s a game about building systems, and playing online turns those systems into group efforts that constantly evolve--it's like getting a job in a factory, except you don't get paid and it's actually fun.\n\nEach player can take ownership of part of the factory, but nothing exists in isolation. Changes ripple outward, encouraging constant communication and coordination. Planning becomes a shared activity, often involving diagrams, discussions, and occasional redesigns. Only enlist your smartest, most strategic friends.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic is a great gateway horror game for when you don't want something too scary, easing you and your friends into a slightly spooky experience that requires focus and commitment to survive. Missions are designed so that players naturally rely on each other’s strengths, making co-op feel purposeful and fun, despite the horrors that persist.\n\nEach class contributes something unique, encouraging loose communication without forcing strict coordination. Deep Rock Galactic strikes a balance between structure and flexibility, letting groups play casually or strategically, and employs its light-hearted tone to keep things flowing even when the going gets tough.\n\nTerraria in co-op feels like a shared sandbox adventure, a story only you and your friends could have written. Online play turns simple exploration and building into group projects that evolve organically, battles that require backup, and bases worthy of Terraria's most elaborate decor.\n\nYou'll naturally split tasks--some of you can explore, some can build, some can fight--and then regroup to share the spoils with everyone. The procedurally generated world feels more alive the more people live in it, reflecting the collective efforts of everyone involved and growing at a pace alongside you. Depending on your ability and playstyle, you can choose to go the offensive route, battling your way through the wilds, or become a homebody, creating a comforting environment for everyone to come back to once they're done fighting. There's a role for everyone. If you're needing some inspiration, check out our extensive Terraria guidesto get you started.\n\nAstroneer turns the realities of brutal and isolated space exploration into a cooperative, rewarding process, which is why it's one of the best survival games you can play online. Online co-op encourages players to plan, experiment, and adapt together as they reshape alien worlds and make it through another night. The tactile feel of the game's crafting system and potential for laid-back exploration and terraforming means you can (as long as you're willing to carry some of the survival responsibility) play it with just about anyone.\n\nWhen your oxygen level is on the line, tasks feel lighter when shared. It's not a punishing survival game, but it expects you to keep an eye on many moving parts at once for your colonization efforts to be effective. For creative groups who enjoy a bit of focus and tranquility, Astroneer might just hit the spot\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a light-hearted and silly online co-op game where every action requires coordination, and success depends on players communicating constantly, despite being in stitches.\n\nRunning a spaceship together (especially when you're just lil' guys) means juggling roles on the fly. Shields, weapons, navigation--it all requires cooperation, often under pressure and with heavy doses of chaos. It's an easy game to pick up and a fun party game for breaking the ice, we've even rated it one of the best couch co-op games to play together.",

    "fullText": "Luka Dončić set to play his first Christmas Day game as a Laker. Is he enough to pull out a win? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have been in a bit of a slump as of late. Despite being 19-9 and the 4th seed in the Western Conference, they're 4-5 in December.\n\nThis does coincide with some injuries, which makes sense. Of the nine games played in December, the Lakers have been without Austin Reaves for three games and Luka Dončić for three and a half, amid many other role players missing time.\n\nThis, along with the obvious deficiencies on the roster, has led the team to where they are now.\n\nMore: Here are the two ways the Lakers can fix their biggest issues\n\nAustin Reaves made his return on Tuesday night, coming off the bench against the Suns, who absolutely thrashed LA. It was a decent first showing back, as he scored 17 points on 6/11 shooting.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the Lakers are set to take on the Houston Rockets at Crypto.com Arena, and from the sounds of it, they'll be getting their other star back as Luka Dončić is set to make his return.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the month of December has not been kind to the Lakers. Not only are they currently below .500 for the month, but it's the way they've looked in these losses that's concerning.\n\nOf the five games they've lost, they've averaged an 18-point deficit in those losses and have had some abysmal shooting nights, shooting below 20% in two of their last four.\n\nWe can’t play defense and we can’t shoot 3s\n\n-Lakers now rank 23rd in defense\n-Lakers are 28th in 3 point shooting\n\nNot a contender pic.twitter.com/nNKJF9BVpv\n\n— The Lakers Chip (@Lakerschipp) December 24, 2025\n\nObviously, this is a much different team without Luka Dončić, but are these problems too large for him alone to solve?\n\nThe Houston Rockets, while not as good as most expected them to be, are still a problem. They have length, shooting, and depth that will absolutely punish the Lakers on their home court if they're not careful.\n\nHopefully, for Lakers fans, Luka Dončić's return to the lineup, paired with playing on Christmas, gives the team the jolt needed to break out of this slump and deliver a gift to Los Angeles.\n\nLuka Dončić playing Santa in Los Angeles this holiday season\n\nWhat's behind the NBA's best bromance between Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves?\n\nJJ Redick saw the All-Star writing on the wall on day one with Austin Reaves.\n\nThe Lakers reportedly have a 6'7 trade pivot out of Cleveland",

As darkness falls across North America, the tracker tradition becomes a nightly countdown, with one eye on the radar and the other on the clock.​\n\nSports fans eager to open their presents and track Santa can keep one eye on the tree and the other on the TV, with football bowls and wall-to-wall NBA action giving them plenty to watch between unwrapping gifts and waiting for the big delivery.\n\nCavs vs. Knicks 'Dunk the Halls' alt-cast\n\nSporting events on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day will be spread across multiple networks, including ABC and ESPN.

    "fullText": "James Harden blasted as 'foul baiter' by opposing head coach originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHouston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka wasn’t happy with the undisciplined way that his team defended Los Angeles Clippers guard James Harden during L.A.’s 128-108 win over the Rockets on Tuesday night.\n\nAfter the game, Udoka put Harden on blast for intentional foul-seeking and simultaneously admonished his own troops for falling into the veteran guard’s well-established traps.\n\nHarden finished the game against Houston with 29 points and 13 free throw attempts, 12 of which he converted.\n\n“The undisciplined things of reaching in and fouling,” Udoka said. “Fouled him on three jump shots and then slap down. He’s a foul-baiter, and you don’t stay disciplined, show your hands, and reach in. And so, prime example of the things we did well last game or that we need to do against certain guys, and obviously didn’t come out with that tonight.”\n\nUdoka is far from the first person to call Harden out for fishing for fouls, but it is a little surprising to hear a coach be so blunt and critical about an opposing player.\n\nHarden has led the league in free throw attempts and makes on a whopping seven separate occasions, so there's no denying that he has a certain knack for drawing contact. While some would classify that as a skill, others like Udoka, might label it differently.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Harden isn’t the only guard in the league currently facing foul-baiting accusations. New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson recently responded to similar claims about his style of play by denying them and challenging his defenders to be more disciplined.\n\n“I play by the rules. I’m not a foul baiter,” Brunson said. “I just play by the rules. Be disciplined on defense. Don’t reach.”\n\nReigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander also recently defended himself against claims that he receives a favorable whistle.\n\n\"I don't care, not one bit. I can't control how the refs blow the whistle ever,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I've never been able to. Never been a ref. All I can do is play basketball, and that's all I focus on.”\n\nSo again, it’s not just Harden. Players today are very smart, and many have figured out how to exploit certain rules to their advantage. That might not always lead to the most aesthetically-pleasing brand of basketball, but it has proven to be effective given the way the game is officiated today.",

    "description": "Kerr reflected Wednesday on not only the heated exchange with his veteran do-it-all forward but also on the state of the Warriors.",
    "fullText": "An especially introspective Steve Kerr told reporters Wednesday that there's beauty in the struggle while he reflected on the state of his Golden State Warriors and the blowup he had with Draymond Green during the third quarter of a 120-97 win over the Orlando Magic two days earlier.\n\nKerr and Green were seen in a heated discussion during a timeout Monday night. After an animated exchange, Green decided to remove himself and left for the Chase Center locker rooms.\n\nAlthough he eventually returned to the bench, he didn't check back into the game.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nKerr said he and his do-it-all forward had a \"great chat\" Wednesday. The longtime Warriors head coach said he and Green apologized to each other as well as to the team.\n\nKerr explained that it was not his finest hour, nor was it a good look for his group.\n\n\"That was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange,\" Kerr said Wednesday.\n\n\"These things, they happen, especially when you get two incredibly competitive people like Dray and me. So over the 12 years we've been together, this has happened occasionally, and I'm not proud of it.\"\n\nKerr added: \"I care so much about Draymond, and the relationship we have is like family. And like family, you go through ups and downs. And my No. 1 goal honestly is for him to finish his career as a Warrior with us fighting — metaphorically, not literally — and competing together until we're both gone. And I believe that's going to happen because I believe in Draymond, and I believe in myself and I believe in everything we've built for 12 years.\"\n\nFull soundbite of Steve Kerr on the heated exchange with Draymond Green:\n\n“I regret my actions in that exchange and I apologized to Dray, he apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\nKerr reflected on their 12 years of winning together, expressing his belief in Green. pic.twitter.com/xpWhHFwZoA\n\n— Kenzo Fukuda (@kenzofuku) December 24, 2025\n\nThe Warriors famously selected Green out of Michigan State with the 35th overall pick in the second round of the 2012 draft. Kerr has coached him from the 2014-15 season on. Since, Green has emerged as a four-time All-Star, one-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. Together, Kerr and Green have won four NBA championships.\n\nWhile Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and then Kevin Durant, consistently shot the lights out, Green has left his own mark on the organization: with defensive tenacity, heady court vision and physical rebounding, plus timely scoring.\n\n\"We have four banners out there, and obviously a lot of people have played important roles in that, but I've said this before, and I truly believe it. I don't think we have any without Draymond. That's how much he impacts winning.\n\n\"So his ability to channel that passion, that emotion, that raw rage that he has is a key component to what makes us successful. And what I said about the other night, I didn't channel my own raw emotion and rage, of which there is plenty. We are far more alike than anyone would ever realize.\"\n\nKerr cited a long history of turning negative moments into positive momentum during his relationship with Green, who Kerr described as \"very complex.\" While Green has racked up technical fouls and served his fair share of suspensions for outbursts during a 14-season NBA career, he's also known for his basketball acumen and his contemplative commentary.\n\n\"We've always, always found a way to not only bounce back, but to make strides as a result,\" Kerr said, via Warriors reporter Kenzo Fukuda.\n\nWith the win over the Magic, the Warriors improved to 15-15. They've won back-to-back games for the fifth time this season. But they've still yet to string together more than three victories in a row.\n\nThis version of Golden State is spearheaded by Curry, Green and Jimmy Butler III. They're all at least 35 years old. Butler is a Warriors transplant who helped spark a second-half run last season, which ended in the Western Conference semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in the first game of the series.\n\n\"Where we are as a team, as an organization, the most important thing for me is for guys to recognize that there's beauty in the struggle. There's beauty in what we're trying to accomplish right now,\" Kerr said Wednesday, via The San Francisco Standard's Danny Emerman.\n\n\"We are no longer the '17 Warriors, dominating the league. We are a fading dynasty. We know that. Everyone knows that. So what is up to us? How do we carry ourselves night to night? How connected are we? And can we give ourselves another swing at the plate? We did that last year. I was really proud of the team last year. Despite the loss to Minnesota, injury to Steph. Who knows how long we would've gone? But we gave ourselves a chance. That's the goal here.\n\n\"We know where we are. We've got to know who we are, we've got to know what's possible, and we've got to take pride in the struggle, because this is part of life.\"\n\nKerr said he believes sorting out the tiff with Green has been a major step in this Warriors team working through its issues.\n\nHe sees an opportunity for Golden State to make another run like last year's.\n\nAs for Green, Kerr wants him to finish his career in a Warriors uniform.\n\n\"He's undyingly loyal and passionate, and I will go to bat for him as long as I'm coaching him here,\" Kerr said, per Emerman. \"Honestly, I'd go to bat for him 20 years from now when we haven't been together. That's how strongly I feel about him. And that's how I want this thing to end with us, whenever that is.\"",

    "fullText": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (WGN) — While Caleb Williams, DJ Moore and the Chicago Bears’ offense received most of the praise for last weekend’s dramatic, come-from-behind victory over the Green Bay Packers, it would have never happened had it not been for kicker Cairo Santos.\n\nIn a press release on Wednesday, the NFL announced Santos was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for Week 16 after his efforts in the Bears’ 22-16 overtime win versus the Packers.\n\nHow improbable was the Chicago Bears’ OT win over the Green Bay Packers?\n\n“Cairo navigating the wind … It was just unbelievable with the gusty conditions out there. You guys saw all of the paper cups and all of the things flying and floating all over the field,” Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower said. “For him to have the mental fortitude to stay focused and play the conditions is what we talk about doing.\n\n“Not trying to beat the conditions, not being upset about the conditions, but play the conditions. I thought he did an excellent job of that and struck the ball really well … It helped us a ton.”\n\nSantos converted all three of his field goal attempts in a driving wind—from 46, 51 and 43 yards—and his lone point-after attempt. He was also the only NFC kicker to score at least 10 points and make 100% of his kicks, including one from 50 yards or longer.\n\n“It was super gusty. It was a tough day today,” Santos said after the game. “My first 46-yarder was against the wind, and all the other ones were with the wind. IN the fourth quarter, we were kicking with the wind, but it was more of a crosswind. So, we just had to play a perfect ball and trust it.”\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, wind gusts reached as high as 25-30 mph on Saturday at Soldier Field.\n\nOn top of his ten points scored, he also helped Chicago’s special teams unit recover an onside kick with 1:59 remaining in regulation against Green Bay.\n\n“Cairo’s done so much work on campus here, and he’s done it in the offseason too—I’m talking about all different types of kicks,” Hightower said. “I’ve tried to stop him at times from kicking onside kicks so much, like, ‘Hey, it’s time to go in.’ And he keeps doing it. There’s so much work that’s been put in from that standpoint that it’s not an accident.\n\n“He put work in for it and he hit a really good ball.”\n\nHis one make from 50+, a 51-yarder in the fourth quarter, was his 25th made field goal of 50-plus yards as a member of the Bears, the most by any kicker in franchise history.\n\n“I don’t have many words, man. It’s special to do this with you guys—coaches, players,” Santos said after receiving a game ball from Ben Johnson in the postgame locker room.\n\nOver the last two seasons, under Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower, the Bears have earned five Special Teams Player of the Week awards, tied with the Denver Broncos for the most in the NFL.",

That immediately solidifies Lagway’s position on the list of possibilities for next year.\n\nLane Kiffin and his staff must come away with a new option at quarterback next year. The only scholarship player at the position on the roster is Michael Van Buren Jr.\n\nWhile Van Buren showed flashes over the last few weeks when he took over for Garrett Nussmeier, but not enough to warrant going into next season with him as the only option.\n\nKiffin is likely to go big game hunting for one of the top names available.\n\nThe most obvious observation to make is bringing over Trinidad Chambliss from the Ole Miss Rebels, but he’s not guaranteed another year of eligibility.\n\nArizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt was another top option, coming off a down year but still carrying hopes of having an NFL career. Working with Kiffin could secure that.\n\nIf it does come down to Lagway as the choice, it would be an exciting outcome for LSU. He may not have had the best start to his career with the Gators, but he’s still a high potential player.\n\nLagway was the top high school passer in a class that included stars like Julian Sayin, Dylan Raiola and CJ Carr. He’s now one of the top options in the portal.\n\nThe Texas native has completed 63.2% of his passes for 4,179 yards with 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions over his two seasons in Florida.\n\nHe’ll have great games and make impressive throws, but no consistency has been developed. It wouldn’t be crazy to think that Kiffin and his staff could unlock something that the failed Gators crew couldn’t.",

Brown (teeth)\nLB Nakobe Dean (hamstring)\nOG Landon Dickerson (illness)\nOT Lane Johnson (foot)\n\nLB Zack Baun (hand)\nLB Jihaad Campbell (back/ankle)\nDT Jalen Carter (shoulders)\nOT Fred Johnson (ankle)\nTE Cameron Latu (stinger)\nWR DeVonta Smith (illness)\nOT Cameron Williams (shoulder)\n\nNote that this report is an estimation because the Bills held a walkthrough in lieu of a normal practice.\n\nThe Bills listed seven players under DID NOT PARTICIPATE: starting edge rusher Joey Bosa, starting defensive tackle DaQuan Jones, starting safety Jordan Poyer, starting tight end Dawson Knox, rotational tight end Dalton Kincaid, kicker Matt Prater, and depth defensive tackle (and dirty player) Jordan Phillips.\n\nBosa, who leads the Bills in TFLs and ranks second in sacks, previously missed time due to his hamstring injury but he was removed from the injury report in Week 16. It remains to be seen if this is a new hamstring injury or if it’s related to his previous one. Something to monitor.\n\nJones has previously been getting rest in practice so perhaps the Bills are taking it easy with him.\n\nPoyer picked up a hammy injury during the Bills’ Week 16 win. We’ll see if the former Eagles UDFA signing is able to play.\n\nKnox is a new addition to the Bills’ injury report. If neither him nor Kincaid can play, the Bills will be without two of their top three tight ends.\n\nBills kicker Matt Prater is still hurt so Michael Badgley might have to kick in place of him again.\n\nThe Bills listed four players under LIMITED PARTICIPATION: starting quarterback Josh Allen, linebacker Shaq Thompson, starting nickel cornerback Taron Johnson, and backup nickel cornerback Cam Lewis.\n\nAll indications point to Allen playing but he might be less than 100%. We’ll see if his mobility is impacted at all.\n\nDE Joey Bosa (hamstring)\nDT DaQuan Jones (calf)\nTE Dalton Kincaid (knee)\nTE Dawson Knox (knee)\nDT Jordan Phillips (ankle)\nS Jordan Poyer (hamstring)\nK Matt Prater (right quad)\n\nQB Josh Allen (foot)\nCB Taron Johnson (quad)\nDB Cam Lewis (hamstring)\nLB Shaq Thompson (neck)\n\nS Cole Bishop (ribs)\nRB Ray Davis (knee)",

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

    "fullText": "It seems all is well between Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green and head coach Steve Kerr following a Monday argument during a third quarter timeout in their eventual 120-97 win against the Orlando Magic.\n\nKerr, during a press conference Wednesday, took accountability for the dust up that led to Green briefly walking away from the bench to gain his composure alone in the locker room before returning shortly before the fourth quarter began, despite never taking off his warmups.\n\n\"Monday night was not my finest hour and that was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange. I apologized to Dray. He apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.\"\n\nSteve Kerr on Draymond Green: “Monday night was not my finest hour and that was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange. I apologized to Dray. He apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\n— Joseph Dycus (@joseph_dycus) December 24, 2025\n\nGreen, a four-time champion in 13 seasons with the Warriors, said after Monday's game to reporters that \"tempers spilled over\".\n\n\"I just thought it was best that I get out of there,\" Green said. \"I don't think it was a situation where it was going to get better, so it was best to remove myself.\"\n\nThe cause of the argument Green said was basketball.\n\n\"It's what we do,\" he said. \"We play basketball. It's an emotional game. People lose their emotions sometimes, it happens. It is what it is. We've been at this now for a long time. Sometimes you're with people for a long time there's a level of comfort and it happens. We move forward.\"\n\nReporters on Monday asked if it was something that would linger on, but Green dismissed it saying they would \"move forward\".\n\n\"We'll move forward, we're alright,\" Green said regarding his spat with Kerr.\n\nThe Warriors are currently have a .500 record after 30 games, sitting at the eighth spot in the Western Conference. They have a Christmas Day game Thursday against the Dallas Mavericks and their rookie sensation Cooper Flagg at Chase Center in San Francisco.\n\n\"I think we're headed in the right direction,\" Green said to reporters Monday. \"No one's happy about being 15-15.

Williams’s 21-day practice window is open, and the Patriots can activate him at any point.\n\nNot only is the Patriots’ Wednesday injury report long, but it also features some of the most important players on the team. With Hollins, Boutte and Douglas all on the injury report, the Patriots could be thin in the wide receiver room for their game against the New York Jets.\n\nThe Patriots could lean on rookie wide receiver Kyle Williams more this week. He has proven he can make big plays this season, and needs just one more 30-plus yard touchdown to tie Randy Moss’s franchise record for 30-plus yard touchdowns in a single season.\n\nIf Wilson is unable to play, Ben Brown figures to draw another start. Spillane has not played since Dec. 1 against the New York Giants. Williams is unlikely to be activated this week, but his limited participation is a good sign that he will be ready to go when the playoffs start.\n\nThe Patriots can clinch the division and at least one home playoff game with a win and a Buffalo Bills loss or tie.

    "description": "Our FIU vs. UTSA predictions expect the battle-tested Roadrunners to rise to the occasion in the First Responder Bowl.",
    "fullText": "We should be in for an entertaining matchup on Friday night when the Florida International Panthers meet the UTSA Roadrunners in the First Responder Bowl.\n\nThe Panthers are playing in their first bowl game in six years, and just their sixth since the program’s inception in 2002, but getting their third bowl victory ever will be difficult against this Roadrunners offense.\n\nSee why I like the Roadrunners to get the job done in my Florida International vs. UTSA predictions and college football picks for Friday night’s First Responder Bowl!\n\nUTSA is the better team, with the better quarterback and the more effective defense. The Roadrunners will utilize their ground game and limit FIU’s scoring opportunities en route to a win.\n\nIt makes sense to look at the 7-5 record for the Florida International Panthers, compared to the UTSA Roadrunners' mark of 6-6, and assume they might be a bit better.\n\nHowever, according to Jeff Sagarin, the Panthers played a weaker strength of schedule this season than Illinois State and North Dakota.\n\nAnd if you’re thinking neither of those is an FBS school, then you’d be correct.\n\nDespite facing such a weak schedule, the Panthers rank 104th in offensive EPA, 103rd in rushing success, and 105th in rushing defense success rate. They also allow 3.77 points per quality drive, ranking 94th in FBS.\n\nThat’s what happens when you get dominated at the line of scrimmage on defense. The Panthers allow the third-most yards before contact of any FBS team, giving up 2.87 line yards. They also generate little pressure without blitzing heavily.\n\nThat’s great news for a UTSA offensive line that ranks 29th in line yards and 34th in pressure rate allowed. Their backs also rank 20th in yards after contact in the ground game, which is why they’re 43rd in EPA/rush.\n\nOwen McCown is the better quarterback in this game, and he threw for 370 yards and four touchdowns as he led the Roadrunners to an upset win over Tulane. That’s by far a better win than any FIU posted this season.\n\nThe FIU defense ranks in the 100s in explosive run rate allowed, early down EPA, and stuff rate. Its offense posts very few explosive pass plays, struggles on third down, and is among the most penalized in college football.\n\nUTSA played a tougher schedule, and yet still posted far better metrics on offense and defense. I’ll take the team with the better roster, even with some defections, laying less than a touchdown.\n\nThe UTSA offense can put up explosive plays, especially against this FIU defense. It’s a big reason why the Over is 6-1 in the last seven games for the Roadrunners as they’ve averaged 37 points over that span.\n\nAnd while FIU’s not as good as UTSA, that’s not to say the Panthers won’t light up the scoreboard themselves. The Over has cashed in three of their last four as they’ve scored 34+ in all three of those contests.\n\nAs good as UTSA plays on the whole, the Roadrunners have allowed 34 plays of at least 30 yards this season. FIU has shown an ability to hit big runs, despite the iffy line play, and USF rushed for 7.4 yards a pop against UTSA earlier this season.\n\nIt might take some garbage-time offense, but even at 59.5, I think the total is a bit lower than it should be.\n\nMoneyline: FIU +200 | UTSA -250\n\nOver/Under: Over 59.5 | Under 59.5\n\nUTSA has cashed the first-half Over in six of their last seven games for +4.90 units and a 62% ROI.

    "title": "Investors Warn of 'Rot in Private Equity' as Funds Strike Circular Deals",
    "description": "Buyout firms have struggled to sell companies they own and have instead found a workaround to get cash back to clients: Selling the companies to themselves.",
    "fullText": "In May 2022, clients of the private equity firm Clearlake Capital gathered at a California resort with dazzling views of the Pacific Ocean, where champagne and shrimp flowed freely.\n\nPerhaps even more dazzling than the setting at the Monarch Beach Resort & Club was Clearlake’s recent performance, which had blown through almost every imaginable benchmark, with one fund generating average annual returns of 50 percent.\n\nOne reason for the firm’s success, according to one attendee and documents shared at the gathering: Clearlake was selling the companies it owned from one set of investment funds to another set of funds it also managed called “continuation vehicles.”\n\nContinuation funds are meant as a temporary fix for a serious problem that has been bedeviling firms like Clearlake.\n\nPrivate equity firms have been struggling to deliver on their core business model of taking on debt, buying companies and selling them for a profit. Several years of high interest rates have made it too expensive for many would-be buyers to purchase companies with debt, and private equity firms are contending with a backlog of more than 31,000 unsold companies, a record amount. Deal activity picked up toward the end of this year, but not enough to make a significant dent in the backlog.\n\nContinuation vehicles are providing a short-term solution by allowing firms to sell the companies to themselves, book a paper gain and wait for interest rates to improve.\n\nPrivate equity firms have been turning to this strategy more frequently. The dollar value of continuation vehicles across the industry is expected to total $100 billion or more by the end of 2025, up from about $35 billion in 2019, according to the investment bank Evercore.\n\nPrivate equity is one of the biggest parts of the global economy, with more than $7 trillion in investors’ money, and some of those investors are getting increasingly worried that strategies like continuation vehicles are putting off a painful reckoning.\n\nPrivate equity firms say they are selling only their best-performing companies to continuation vehicles, which would yield big profits when the companies can eventually be sold to outside buyers.\n\nThe risk, investors say, is that the insular nature of these sales — where the private equity firm is both the buyer and seller — is leading to questionable valuations and unrealistic projections, leaving investors vulnerable to painful surprises.\n\nAt the gathering of pension managers and other Clearlake clients at the Monarch Hotel in 2022, the firm boasted about the success of Wheel Pros, an auto accessories retailer that it had sold to one of its continuation funds.\n\nThe company sells flashy hubcaps and other accessories for wheels, which were popular during the pandemic when consumers were flush with stimulus money and had time for do-it-yourself projects.\n\nTwo years after that gathering, in September 2024, Wheel Pros declared bankruptcy, because sales slowed after the pandemic. The company couldn’t keep up with its ballooning debt payments. Every investor, including public employees’ pension funds from New York, Connecticut and Nevada, was wiped out. (Connecticut and Nevada had previously sold out of some of their Wheel Pros stake.)\n\nClearlake Capital declined to make their executives available for an interview. In a 2023 podcast interview, José E. Feliciano, a founder of the firm, said it used continuation vehicles for “companies that were A-plus assets that we wouldn’t mind owning for a long time, maybe forever.” He added that it was also for companies that would need more time and investment to realize their full potential.\n\nPlatinum Equity, another firm, has struggled with its investment in United Site Services, which makes portable toilets. In 2021, Platinum Equity executives described the sale of United Site Services to a continuation fund it created as a “win-win.” Now, United Site Services is in the process of turning the company over to its lenders, and its investors are expected to lose all their money.\n\n“Continuation vehicles are indicative of rot in private equity,’’ said Marcus Frampton, chief investment officer of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, which manages $83 billion of the state’s money that is derived from oil revenues and distributed annually to Alaskans.\n\nThe increased use of these funds, he said, is one of the reasons the Alaska fund has scaled back investments with private equity firms. Mr. Frampton said the firms were shirking their purpose to create value through buying and selling companies. In 2021, the Alaska fund held 22 percent of its dollars in private equity firms. Now it holds about 17 percent.\n\nScott Ramsower, who oversees the private equity investments of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, a pension fund that manages roughly $229 billion, said there were inherent conflicts in continuation funds because a private equity firm is typically involved on both sides of the deal.\n\n“We’d be happier if a private equity firm never did any of these,” Mr. Ramsower said about continuation funds.\n\nThe private equity industry says there are no conflicts because the deals are independently vetted. First, a private equity firm’s largest investors must consent to selling a portfolio company to a continuation vehicle. Then, existing and new investors have a chance to scrutinize the company’s financials and decide whether to buy into a deal at a specific price tag. If the investors don’t see the upside for future returns for a specific company when it is finally sold to an outside buyer, the deal won’t move forward.\n\nBut some investors say this vetting process is not always transparent.\n\nThis month, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery claiming that Energy & Minerals Group, a private equity firm, was seeking to “reap a massive benefit for themselves” at the expense of their investors by selling a company into a continuation vehicle.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the firm tried to force the sovereign wealth funds and other investors to vote on the sale on short notice, provided different data to different investors and would not allow the investors to confer with each other about the deal.\n\nEnergy & Minerals Group did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNigel Dawn, global head of private capital advisory at Evercore, said that so far continuation fund bankruptcies were below the rates of traditional buyout funds, which hover between 5 and 10 percent.\n\nBut he said it was far too soon to say what returns will ultimately look like more broadly for these funds. “It’s still the early days,” he said.\n\nClearlake is one of the most frequent users of continuation funds, creating six of them since 2020.\n\nClearlake, which was founded by Mr. Feliciano and Behdad Eghbali, both billionaires, in 2006 and initially managed $182 million. Now they manage roughly $90 billion of investor money and recently said they would double that amount by buying another fund.\n\nClearlake bought Wheel Pros for about $420 million in 2018. As its new owners, Clearlake wanted to go big, pushing executives to buy up almost every competitor that made accessories for the wheels of cars and trucks, according to two people familiar with the firm’s thinking. By 2021, profits had jumped to over $200 million from about $50 million in 2018.\n\nEven though the I.P.O. market was strong in 2021, private equity firms often have to wait a few years after a company goes public to collect all their gains. Clearlake figured it could book an even bigger and immediate gain by putting Wheel Pros into a continuation vehicle that valued the business at $2.3 billion, more than four times the price Clearlake had paid just three years earlier, the two people said. As is typical in continuation funds, Clearlake gave its existing investors the chance to either cash out or roll their investment into the new fund.\n\nPennsylvania State Employees’ Retirement System was among the sellers, while state pensions for Connecticut and Nevada rolled some of their commitment into the new fund and New York rolled all of it.\n\nClearlake also brought in a new batch of investors, including other large private equity firms like Blackstone, Pantheon and ICG.\n\nWheel Pros’ senior managers took their own stock options — worth about $100 million — and put them into the new fund, the people said. Clearlake invested about $50 million of its partners’ profits, too, said another person familiar with the matter.\n\nOnce Clearlake moved Wheel Pros into the continuation vehicle and booked a profit, it added substantially more debt to the company, ratcheting up the financial pressure, according to internal company documents reviewed by The New York Times. The move came not long before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. Wheel Pros had some debt with an interest rate tied to government bond yields, and that also increased the company’s debt costs.\n\nClearlake’s continuation vehicles, known as Icon Partners I and II, reported strong annual returns of 49 percent and 56 percent on average through March 2025 since they were created in 2020 and 2021.\n\nBut Icon Partners III, which held Wheel Pros, was a total loss, and Icon Partners IV and V reported annualized returns of 2.7 percent and 10.1 percent from their creation in 2021 through the end of March.\n\nClearlake hasn’t yet sold or taken public any of the companies in the continuation funds, making a true measure of returns difficult to discern.\n\n“Private equity walks so much in the shadows,” said Yaron Nili, a professor of corporate law at Duke Law School who wrote a paper recently on continuation funds.\n\nBecause so many deals involve private equity firms buying from each other or from themselves, “it will be hard to distinguish between value-generating activities and just collecting and recollecting fees,’’ Mr. Nili said.\n\nSome firms are pushing out the sales timeline even further. This year, private equity firms including Accel-KKR have started selling their companies from one continuation vehicle to another.\n\nThe industry calls these new funds “CV-squared.”",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s assault on the city of Chicago began in September, and it claimed its first casualty quickly. As Reuters would later report, on September 12, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez dropped his kids off at their school in the suburb of Franklin Park on his way to his job at a diner on the northwest side. Villegas-Gonzalez had come to the United States in 2007 to flee the violence in his home state of Michoacán, Mexico—violence wrought by the Mexican government’s militarization of its drug war, a policy encouraged and funded by the United States. (In November, the mayor of the city of Uruapan was assassinated after calling for a crackdown on organized crime.)\n\nDescribed by friends and co-workers as kind and soft-spoken, Villegas-Gonzalez had two sons and met a woman from his hometown as he worked long hours in kitchens around the city.\n\nAfter he dropped off his sons on the morning of September 12, two Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers approached the 38-year-old in his car. He put the vehicle in reverse and attempted to flee. One officer continued to chase him on foot and eventually fired his weapon, striking Villegas-Gonzalez, who crashed into a delivery truck and was pronounced dead an hour later. Officials of the Department of Homeland Security would later say that Villegas-Gonzalez “drove his car at law enforcement officers,” a claim clearly refuted by surveillance video. DHS also claimed the officer who killed Villegas-Gonzalez had been struck and dragged by the car and feared for his life. That allegation is more difficult to confirm or refute—the officer is obscured by the car in the video. The officer was later treated for “minor” injuries.\n\nVillegas-Gonzalez had no criminal record. Over eight years, he had only a series of traffic citations for offenses like a broken taillight and driving without insurance. His most serious citation was for driving 30 miles per hour over the speed limit. In its press release laying out the ICE agents’ version of events, DHS referred to him as “a criminal illegal alien with a history of reckless driving.” The release included the striking line, “The illegal alien was pronounced dead.”\n\nIn the weeks that followed, immigration agents continued to arrest parents and nannies as they dropped off and picked up children from school, a tactic unheard of in prior administrations.\n\nVideos posted to social media showed ICE and Border Patrol agents pointing their guns at unarmed protesters, unnecessarily tackling children and elderly people, and shutting down streets and intersections as they extracted people from their cars. Agents tear-gassed entire neighborhoods, in some cases enveloping schools and even Chicago Police Department officers in clouds of chemical irritant. Videos showed federal officers engaging in Precision Immobilization Technique, or PIT, maneuvers to cut off fleeing vehicles, a dangerous tactic banned or limited by the Chicago Police Department and many other police agencies in the country. On at least three occasions, ICE officers violently pulled U.S. citizens from their cars and detained them, claiming the drivers had deliberately crashed into agents—despite video and witness accounts contradicting the officers’ narrative.\n\nAs October dragged on, the raids intensified. Toward the end of the month, immigration officers gassed a neighborhood just hours before a scheduled Halloween parade for children. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker asked the administration to pause the raids on Halloween night so Chicago kids could go trick-or-treating without fear of being gassed, witnessing traumatic arrests, or seeing their parents or caretakers apprehended and detained. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem refused, calling the request “shameful.” Activists in Los Angeles would later photograph immigration officers, in an especially galling display of cruelty, wearing Halloween masks depicting horror movie villains while conducting immigration raids. When the citizen journalism site L.A. Taco asked DHS for comment, a spokesperson replied, “Happy Halloween.”\n\nTrump has launched similar federal crackdowns in Los Angeles, Washington, Charlotte, Memphis, Minneapolis, and New Orleans, and threatened them in Baltimore, San Francisco, New York, and other cities. He has sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles and Memphis, and has promised to send more to other cities, along with active-duty troops. With astonishing speed, the administration has toppled the most cherished pillars of a free society. Masked secret police now tear-gas entire city streets, jump out from unmarked vehicles to abduct and detain suspected undocumented people, and demand that foreign-looking people (mostly Latino) produce papers on demand. These deportation forces have been told by the president and his advisers to cast a wide net, that immigrants are “animals,” that the activists defending them are “domestic terrorists,” and that the officers themselves have “immunity” from any form of accountability. Meanwhile, administration lawyers have brazenly lied to federal judges to supplement those deportation forces by deploying U.S. troops to the streets of American cities—seeking to break this country’s healthy antipathy toward domestic use of the military policing that dates back to the founding.\n\n“They’re assaulting basic democratic ideals on all fronts,” said Dana Marks, an immigration judge who retired in 2021. “It’s really just classic authoritarianism. It always starts with the minorities. It always starts with the immigrants. If we don’t stop them, it will be American citizens. Congress, the courts, the people, we should all be jumping up and down and screaming about this. We need to be screaming that this isn’t America—that this isn’t who we are.”\n\nI’ve been writing and reporting on policing in the United States for more than 20 years. I’ve spent much of that time writing about the effects of police militarization, or the way military weapons, training, uniforms, and culture have infiltrated domestic law enforcement agencies. But I’ve never seen anything quite like the last six months.\n\nWe’ve seen rapid normalization of abuses we once associated with authoritarian regimes or the old Iron Curtain countries. It’s now routine for masked, unidentifiable government agents to sweep people off the street and whisk them away in unmarked vehicles. Some of those arrested have been quickly shuttled off to detention facilities in other parts of the country without any notification to their families or attorneys. Others have been sent to a third country, often a country in the developing world to which they have no connection. Still others have been explicitly targeted for their political opinions, their activism, or their journalism.\n\nThe phrase “your papers, please” has historically been the sort of demand we associated with Hitler’s SS or the East German Stasi. Immigration officers now routinely stop people who simply “look like” immigrants and demand they prove their citizenship or legal residency. Legal residents who fail to produce documentation on demand have been fined, and flustered immigrants who fail to produce sufficient records or recall a Social Security number have been arrested.\n\nThe administration is also shredding due process. The United States government has extradited immigrants to a torture prison in a foreign country after lying to a judge, then falsely claimed it was helpless to get them back. Immigrants are now stacked in detention centers under already inhumane conditions that appear to be deteriorating. And in a brazen contravention of a principle ingrained in the American founding, the president and his aides have claimed the power to deploy active-duty troops in cities they allege have been overrun with migrants, crime, or homeless people—or merely those overseen by mayors or governors the administration dislikes.\n\nMost alarmingly, the administration no longer feels obligated to even pretend that it’s observing norms and constitutional restrictions. “They just don’t care when judges or the public says they’re violating the law,” one longtime immigration judge, now retired, told me. “That’s unheard of in my lifetime.”\n\nOver the last year, I’ve spoken to and met with immigration attorneys and advocates all over the country. Many who openly spoke with me prior to the 2024 election are no longer willing to be quoted, fearing retaliation against their organizations or their funders, or even against them personally.\n\nIn more recent months, I’ve also interviewed former ICE and Customs and Border Protection officials, and former Immigration Court judges who served across multiple administrations of both parties. Career legal and law enforcement officials tend to be circumspect in their critiques of fellow law enforcement officers. They tend to avoid casual references to police states, or comparing U.S. police agencies to those in authoritarian countries. That’s no longer the case. These career police executives and prosecutors now use language I’ve rarely heard from current or former government officials in my career.\n\n“What we’re seeing is a disgrace to policing,” said Reneé Hall, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, or NOBLE. Hall compares the tactics used by ICE and Border Protection officers to the worst abuses of the civil rights era. “We’ve made a lot of progress in policing,” she said. “They’ve wiped it out in months.… We’re back to letting police target people because of their skin color. We’re letting them kidnap people and take them to undisclosed locations. They’re barging into homes with no warrant. We saw them zip-tie young Black children—U.S. citizens—in Chicago. We’ve seen them use unnecessary force, slam people on the concrete. If I were just watching these incidents on television, I would think that we were not in the United States of America. Back then they wore hoods. Today they wear masks.”\n\n“I’m horrified by what I’ve seen,” said Chris Magnus, who served both as Joe Biden’s CBP commissioner and as police chief of Tucson, Fargo, and Richmond, California. “I wish the public had a better understanding of the harm they’re doing. Because it’s going to take a very long time to undo.”\n\n“I wish I had something better to say than that it’s really bad,” another former senior Department of Justice official told me. “But it’s really fucking bad.”\n\nThe new federal budget Trump recently signed into law will triple the ICE budget and significantly increase the budgets both for Border Protection and for the construction of new detention centers. Trump’s deportation force will be larger than all but a handful of foreign militaries. According to the Brennan Center, the 2025 budget for immigration enforcement already exceeds that of every other federal law enforcement agency combined. And going forward, spending from the “Big Beautiful Bill” on immigration alone will exceed total spending by every state and local police agency in the country.\n\nAnd if there’s one thing this administration has made clear, it’s this: What happened in Chicago will soon be happening in cities around the country.\n\nOne of the more maddening patterns playing out in the federal courts right now is the administration’s exploitation of a legal principle called “the presumption of regularity.” The legal doctrine instructs courts to presume that government lawyers argue in good faith and don’t deliberately misrepresent facts. The doctrine has rarely been a problem, because most administrations have argued in good faith, even when making bad arguments.\n\nThis administration is different. As of this writing, in the months since Trump’s second inauguration, the site Just Security has documented more than 60 instances in which federal courts have ruled that Justice Department attorneys misrepresented the facts or the law. Some judges have done so with unusually frank language, including accusing the administration of outright lying. One judge wrote, “Trust that had been earned over generations has been lost in weeks.”\n\nMany of Trump’s power grabs are grounded in “emergency powers” exceptions that Congress or the courts have built into constitutional or statutory restraints on executive power. These powers have always been a glitch in the system. Dozens of emergencies declared with good intentions at the time have lingered over the years, as new administrations simply renew them without much oversight from Congress. Many concern sanctions against international figures involved in crime, drug smuggling, or weapons trafficking.\n\nBut the current administration has exploited those exceptions like none before. Trump has declared nine new emergencies since January. His tariffs, for example, are based on a law allowing the president to temporarily impose tariffs in response to an emergency. But he has threatened and imposed tariffs for clearly illegal reasons, such as slapping sanctions on Brazil for prosecuting former President Jair Bolsonaro for an attempted coup, or on Canada for accurately using footage of former President Ronald Reagan in a TV commercial.\n\nThe presumption of regularity and the enormous deference the Supreme Court demands courts show to the executive branch mean that any challenge to one of these declarations faces an uphill battle to prove that the administration is misrepresenting the facts or acting in bad faith in each individual case, even though it has shown an almost routine willingness to lie in other cases. And nowhere is this disconnect more striking than in Trump’s obsession with putting troops in American cities.\n\nThe norm against using troops for routine law enforcement is one of America’s most important contributions to democratic governance. It’s a principle we came by honestly, from firsthand experience. Prior to the American Revolution, the British crown stationed soldiers in the streets of Boston to enforce tariffs and import taxes. The soldiers were armed with general warrants that gave them carte blanche to force their way into homes in search of contraband. The abuse of those powers sowed anger and ignited revolutionary fervor.\n\nLessons from Boston lingered after the Revolution and instilled in the Founders a deep distrust of standing armies. “A large standing Army in time of Peace hath ever been considered dangerous to the liberties of a Country,” George Washington wrote in 1783. Four years later, at the Constitutional Convention, James Madison cautioned, “A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty.”\n\nAfter fierce debate, the Framers of the Constitution reluctantly concluded that the threats posed to the new republic still demanded an army at the ready. But to guard against abuses, they divided control of the military between the executive and legislative branches. Still, the fears about domestically deployed troops spilled into the Bill of Rights debates the following year. It’s why we have a Second Amendment (the purpose of the state militia “is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty,” Elbridge Gerry declared), as well as the Third Amendment protection against the forced quartering of soldiers, and the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThis fear of domestically deployed troops has become ingrained in America’s DNA. Presidents have deployed active-duty troops within U.S. borders only sporadically, and almost always temporarily. The most common reason for doing so early in the republic was to put down labor uprisings, rebellions, and riots, and while there are legitimate reasons to question the motivations and propriety of those deployments, they were at least temporary and narrowly defined. The one exception was Reconstruction, which saw federal troops in Southern states for a decade. But that came after a bloody and destructive Civil War.\n\nIn fact, one of the healthier and most encouraging characteristics of American democracy is that this norm has only become more robust over time. One big reason—also a sign of a healthy democracy—is that the principle has become ingrained in the military itself.\n\nIn the late 1980s, for example, the Reagan administration wanted to deploy active-duty troops to fight the drug war on American streets. The plan was thwarted by opposition from the Pentagon. “One of [America’s] great strengths is that ... we do not allow the Army, Navy, and the Marines and Air Force to be a police force,” Marine Lt. Gen. Stephen Olmstead told Congress in 1989. “History is replete with countries that allowed that to happen. Disaster is the result.”\n\nPrior to Trump’s deployment of 700 Marines in Los Angeles in June, no president had deployed active-duty troops to a U.S. city since the Los Angeles riots in 1992. And no president had deployed the military over the objections of a state governor since Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to desegregate Little Rock’s public schools in 1957.\n\nThe deployment of National Guard troops is much more common. But that’s nearly always done by governors calling up their own Guard troops, sometimes to put down riots or protests, but more typically to aid with disaster response after hurricanes and tornadoes. Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles is the first time a president has deployed the Guard over the objections of a state governor since 1965.\n\nTrump is a well-documented admirer of dictators and strongmen and has made clear that he harbors little reverence for this firewall between the military and domestic policing. In his first term, Trump wanted to deploy troops to put down the George Floyd protests, if possible by “shooting them in the legs.” He was thwarted by more levelheaded senior staff, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley. Trump and his second term advisers have made clear that they won’t tolerate that sort of dissent this time around. To fully implement his vision for the country, they’d need to purge the federal government of institutionalists and those who put democratic values and the rule of law over subservience to the president. As JD Vance put it in a 2021 podcast interview, “Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.”\n\nTrump found his enforcer in Pete Hegseth, a man who is not only the least-qualified person ever nominated for secretary of defense, but whose record—which includes allegations of alcohol abuse and sexual assault and running two veterans’ nonprofits into the ground—should have been disqualifying. Trump really only had two prerequisites for the position. He wanted someone who loathed Pentagon institutionalists like Milley and Esper, and someone he could count on to be loyal. Here, Hegseth was more than qualified—embarrassingly so.\n\nHegseth has also echoed Trump’s contempt for the Pentagon’s healthier, democratically grounded principles. In his book, he has argued for enlisting the military in a modern-day crusade. And prior to 2025, other than his weekend co-hosting duties on Fox News, Hegseth was probably best known for lobbying Trump to pardon troops convicted of conscience-shocking war crimes.\n\nAfter his confirmation, Hegseth dutifully began purging the Pentagon of its Milleys and Espers. He dismissed dozens of senior officials with centuries of experience (particularly those who weren’t male and weren’t white). Importantly, he also purged senior-level Judge Advocate General’s Corps, or JAG, officers, the attorneys who provide legal guidance on critical issues like rules of engagement or, say, the legality of deploying troops in U.S. cities.\n\nThe administration has since been caught brazenly lying to federal courts to justify Trump’s military interventions. In Portland, Oregon, a Trump-appointed Federal District Court judge wrote that Trump and the DOJ’s claims that the city was “war ravaged” and “under siege” were “simply untethered to the facts.” The administration was later found to have vastly overstated to the court the number of federal officers it had sent to Portland to protect federal facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, in Chicago, a federal judge rejected the administration’s claims that the city was under “coordinated assault” by unnamed “violent groups … actively aligned with designated domestic terror organizations.” The judge chided the administration for its “lack of candor,” which, she wrote, “calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” and noted a “troubling trend” of DOJ officials “equating protests with riots.”\n\nThe most alarming images to emerge from the first year of Trump’s second term are those of immigration officers in balaclavas, gaiters, and ski masks stopping immigrants on sidewalks and demanding proof of citizenship, chasing day laborers and landscapers through parking lots and city streets, or emerging from unmarked vehicles, snatching people off the streets, then quickly carrying them away.\n\nThose unmarked vehicles are often rented, and officers have been caught swapping out license plates to prevent themselves from being identified—or just not bothering with license plates at all. “The agency clearly wants to appear like a ghost,” one former Baltimore ICE official told NPR. “I have never experienced this.”\n\n“When law enforcement officers of any kind wear masks and withhold their identity, it smacks of tactics that are consistent with an authoritarian government,” said Magnus, the ex-police chief and former head of Border Patrol.\n\n“We’ve had police here for two centuries,” said George Pappas, an immigration judge whom Trump’s Justice Department fired in July. “They didn’t need masks. You use masks when you’re looking to carry out an illegal, extrajudicial operation. This is straight from the fascist playbook.”\n\nThe images and videos of masked agents have provoked alarm in law enforcement and legal communities. They’ve been criticized by groups ranging from the New York City Bar Association to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Even the FBI has asked DHS to remove the masks, pointing out that criminals have committed robberies and sexual assaults while impersonating immigration officers.\n\nBut more to the point, masked secret police jumping out of vans to snatch people up and whisk them away isn’t supposed to happen in a free society. It’s the sort of thing we’ve cited to distinguish ourselves from military juntas or, more recently, from countries like Brazil or the Philippines, where masked officers have carried out horrific extrajudicial killings by the thousands. Or from Russia, where the spectacle of masked police carrying out illegal and undemocratic orders is common enough to have birthed the term “mask show.”\n\nThose distinctions are getting harder and harder to make. Trump has lavished praise on the current and former authoritarian leaders of all three countries, often specifically for their despotism. He praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte explicitly for his drug war policies, which even then were known to include sending masked police teams to execute thousands of drug offenders. Because of those killings, Duterte is now facing trial at the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nAnya Bidwell heads up the Project on Immunity and Accountability for the Institute for Justice, a libertarian law firm. IJ is currently representing two U.S. citizens who were wrongly arrested and detained by immigration officers. “I was born in what was part of the Soviet Union at the time,” she said. “So seeing these kinds of things chills me to the bone. It brings bad memories.”\n\nDHS officials have dismissed such comparisons as hysterical and hyperbolic. They say masking is necessary to prevent activists from “doxing” immigration officers and claim there has been an alarming surge in assaults on those officers. In June, they put the increase in assaults at 413 percent; by July, it was over 700 percent; and by October, it was over 1,000 percent.\n\nThose figures are deceptive. The 2024 baseline figure against which the administration is making these calculations is 10, according to Fox News. That is, there were 10 alleged assaults on ICE officers between January and June 2024. There were 79 in 2025. Meanwhile, over the same period, the number of federal agents participating in deportations and removals has swelled from 6,000 to over 30,000. That puts the assault rate on federal immigration officials (0.23 per 100) exponentially lower than the assault rate on police officers more generally (13.5).\n\nGiven the ramped-up immigration enforcement and the exceptionally violent and aggressive tactics, we’d expect to see an increase in assaults on agents. More interactions, and more violent interactions, mean more opportunities for those interactions to escalate. We also know from surveillance and cell phone videos that agents have arrested and charged people with assault either on little evidence or for defending themselves when assaulted by police. After an ICE officer shot a Chicago woman named Marimar Martinez five times, for example, the administration claimed she had intentionally boxed agents in with her car and fired a gun at them. She was arrested and charged with assault. After that account was contradicted by witnesses and video, Martinez was released without charges.\n\n“The mask issue really burns my biscuits,” said Reneé Hall. “I patrolled in the city of Detroit for nearly 20 years. I lived in the place that I policed. I didn’t get to hide my face. And you know what? Every other police officer across this country arresting people for drugs, for violent criminal acts, for gang violence, show their faces, too. My father was a police officer who was killed on duty. He never would have dreamed of hiding his face from the people he served. These federal officers are coming into these communities from other places, hiding their faces, using unnecessary force and violence, and then just walking away. That isn’t how it works. Hell no to that.”\n\nThere are, of course, limited circumstances in which it may be justified for police officers to shield their identities—officers who investigate organized crime, for example, or who frequently work undercover. So there are no federal laws that prohibit it. But the most important reason U.S. police don’t wear masks isn’t grounded in the law, but in democratic values. “I find the masking absolutely fucking horrific,” said “Bryan,” a former high-ranking official in the DOJ. “It’s not something we do in a free society. It’s what they do under regimes we should never be emulating. It’s about intimidating and terrorizing.”\n\nThat shared understanding has broken down under an administration that seems to emulate those regimes, and that has made clear that it wants to instill fear and terror in immigrant communities. They aren’t letting federal immigration agents terrorize neighborhoods like Chicago’s Little Village because terrifying these places makes them safer. They’re doing it because they don’t believe neighborhoods like Little Village should exist. “The president’s goal is to create fear and anxiety,” said Michael Rodriguez, an alderman whose district includes the heavily Mexican American neighborhood. “It’s a sinister agenda to relitigate the Civil War. I don’t think that’s vitriol. This country is becoming majority minority, and they can’t handle that. So they’re turning to xenophobia to reverse the trend.”\n\nOne needn’t look far to validate Rodriguez’s fears. Stephen Miller, who has been traipsing about the fever swamps of white nationalism for years, has made it no secret that he wants to reduce immigration from nonwhite countries to zero. Trump has echoed the sentiment, bemoaning at one point why so many immigrants come from “shithole countries” (the countries he’s named have all been predominantly Black and brown), and so few from countries like Norway or Switzerland. It’s now been widely reported that by the end of Trump’s second term, the bulk of the country’s refugee program will be redirected to aid white farmers from South Africa.\n\nThe most basic definition of a police state is a society in which the police themselves are above the law. In 2024, Donald Trump campaigned on promises to make police officers completely immune from both criminal prosecution and civil liability. Whether a president could actually do that isn’t as important as the fact that a major party’s nominee for president was, quite literally, promising to turn the country into a police state. And then he won.\n\nThe United States has long had a problem with holding bad cops accountable, and, to be fair, much of that problem predates Donald Trump. The George Floyd protests in 2020 provoked public discussion about qualified immunity, a legal doctrine wholly invented by the Supreme Court in 1967 that makes it extremely difficult to sue state and local police for abuses that violate the Constitution.\n\nLess discussed is that it’s even more difficult—all but impossible, really—to sue federal law enforcement officers. For years, the only real avenue to do so was through the precedent set in the 1971 Supreme Court case Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents. But the court has been gradually chipping away at that case ever since and all but overturned it in 2022. There is one remaining, far more complicated law, the Federal Tort Claims Act, which lets people sue federal police officers, but to sue under that law is an immensely complicated process. The law also bars punitive damages, and it, too, is being eroded by the federal courts.\n\n“People ask me questions like ‘Is it constitutional for them to wear masks?’ or ‘Can they really detain U.S. citizens incommunicado?’ or ‘Is it really legal for them to scare children like that?’” said Bidwell, the IJ attorney. “The answer is that it doesn’t matter if what they do is legal. Because they know that fundamentally they can’t be sued, either as the government itself or individually.”\n\nSo while the administration sets arrest and deportation quotas, attacks immigrants with dehumanizing rhetoric, and tells immigration officers that they’ve been “unleashed,” Bidwell said, there’s nothing pushing back to keep deportation forces in line. “There’s no incentive for these officers to act in a cautious manner that’s compliant with the Constitution.”\n\n“Back when I worked for ICE, there would occasionally be times when they’d inadvertently arrest or detain an American citizen or legal resident,” said Javad Khazaeli, who was an immigration prosecutor during the Obama administration and now works as an immigration defense attorney. (Disclosure: Khazaeli is also a friend.) “When that happened, it would be all hands on deck. It was like, OK, what went wrong here and how do we fix it? Now there’s nothing like that. Now they just don’t care.”\n\nThe immunity problem pervades the chain of command from top to bottom. Thanks to a spate of Supreme Court rulings from the case that all but killed Bivens, to rulings protecting political appointees for policy decisions, to the Supreme Court’s infamous ruling on presidential immunity, everyone is protected, from the Border Patrol officer who abandons a baby in the back seat of a car after detaining his immigrant parents (as happened in a suburb of Chicago) to the Border Patrol commander who tear-gasses elementary schools, to the president who says immigrants are “poisoning the blood of the country.”\n\nThat leaves only criminal liability. It seems unlikely that Trump’s DOJ would ever prosecute an immigration officer, even for egregious abuses. Some have suggested that local police and prosecutors arrest and charge Border Patrol agents caught committing clear crimes, or that states pass laws prohibiting masking by law enforcement, and then arrest officers who violate it. But state and local charges against federal police are almost always removed to federal court, at which point the Trump administration would presumably take over the prosecution and drop the charges. There may be some value in bringing charges anyway to force the issue and draw public attention to these abuses. But they aren’t likely to bring much accountability. It’s yet another policy that, while in place over multiple administrations, could be particularly destructive in the hands of an administration so averse to the rule of law.\n\nIn the end, this administration has exposed how the Supreme Court has made the Bill of Rights almost entirely reliant on the executive branch’s willingness to police itself. If federal police officers can violate constitutional rights with impunity, those rights may as well not exist.\n\nTrump’s immigration agents are erasing accountability in other ways, too. They’re specifically targeting journalists who report on their actions. In Chicago, they tackled and arrested a WGN producer, claiming she threw something at ICE officers—an allegation that was disputed by witnesses. She was later released without charges. In June, the administration arrested an immigrant journalist in Georgia who had been reporting on immigration raids. At his deportation hearing, DOJ lawyers explicitly argued that his journalism was a threat to public safety. He has since been deported. In Los Angeles, immigration officers shot a citizen journalist who had built an online following for streaming ICE raids. They claim he rammed his vehicle into theirs. He was arrested for assaulting a federal officer. In Texas, another freelance journalist and DACA recipient had his status revoked and was arrested for “glorifying terrorism” over social media posts after he advocated at a city council meeting for a Muslim man who had recently been detained.\n\nShortly after the raids on Home Depot parking lots and car washes began in L.A., civil and immigration rights groups filed a lawsuit accusing the administration of racially profiling Latino people. Notably, a federal judge ordered the government to stop, and arrests dropped dramatically. The Supreme Court eventually ordered a pause on that temporary restraining order, allowing raids and stops based on skin color, language, and presence in areas where immigrants live and work to continue.\n\nThere was no majority opinion, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that people who are in the country illegally have no right not to be racially profiled. As for U.S. citizens or legal residents, Kavanaugh wrote, once immigration officials establish legal status, “they promptly let the individual go.”\n\nIn a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that Kavanaugh’s “concurrence improperly shifts the burden onto an entire class of citizens to carry enough documentation to prove that they deserve to walk freely.” It effectively made anyone who “looks immigrant” into a second-class citizen.\n\nKavanaugh added that if immigration officers violate other rights of citizens or legal residents, such as by using excessive force or not “promptly letting that individual go,” those people could always sue. It had been just three years since Kavanaugh joined the majority in all but overturning Bivens, effectively shutting down the right to sue federal law enforcement.\n\nKavanaugh’s claim that citizens and legal residents would simply be “let go” hasn’t held up. About a month after the ruling on racial profiling, ProPublica published a report documenting 170 cases in which immigration officers had detained U.S. citizens. The publication found 130 cases in which U.S. citizens had been arrested for allegedly interfering with immigration operations or assaulting officers but were often never charged. It found over 20 cases in which U.S. citizens were held for more than a day without being permitted to contact an attorney or their families. “Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents,” the publication wrote. “They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem watched.” More recently, immigration officers stopped a Latino U.S. citizen in Los Angeles during a raid on a Home Depot. They arrested the man for an alleged assault and weapons violation, then drove off in his vehicle with the man’s one-year-old daughter still in the back seat. All of this in just the first 10 months of the new administration.\n\n“This version of the Trump administration is a stress test for the United States,” said Bidwell. “They’re very good at identifying cracks in the system, then working at those cracks to widen them. These gaps in accountability for federal police have been around for a long time. We’re going to see how bad it can get when those gaps are exploited by an administration with no respect for constitutional restraints.”\n\nIn a different world, immigration judges might be a check on all this abuse by immigration officers. But that isn’t the world we’re inhabiting. Despite their name, immigration courts have always operated within the executive branch, not the judicial, so they lack the independence of federal courts. Still, previous administrations mostly just tinkered with these courts at the margins, replacing judges as necessary with judges \n\nThe following month, the firings began. Since February, DOJ has fired at least 98 immigration judges, and another 55 or so left voluntarily after seeing the writing on the wall. “Amanda” was one of the first judges fired in February. “I was never told why I was let go,” she said. “A lot of people were shocked. I don’t think anyone would have described me as a liberal judge. I’m a former immigration prosecutor. The feeling was that if they’d fire someone like me, no one was safe. Which is probably the message DOJ wanted to send.”\n\nAmanda said there was one incident in her record, when she worked for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, that may have flagged Trump’s DOJ. “I was once reported for engaging in ‘illegal DEI,’” she said. “One of the individuals I supervised moved the seating arrangements for African American staff to the same undesirable hallway, causing staff to refer to that hall as ‘Jim Crow Row.’ I told her she had to stop doing that. When this new administration called for reporting of ‘illegal DEI,’ the staff member forwarded an email to me to notify me that she had reported me. Maybe that’s why I was fired. But my termination notice was a few sentences long. So who knows.”\n\nIn October, the DOJ announced that it would begin appointing military lawyers from the JAG Corps to serve as temporary immigration judges—the officers who had survived Hegseth’s purge. The move has been widely derided in the legal community as an effort to turn the courts into little more than a rubber stamp for the administration. “Immigration law is incredibly complicated,” Pappas said. “There’s just no way you’re going to be able to pick it up in a matter of weeks and treat these cases with the judgment and care they require.”\n\nThe most immediate effect of the administration’s politicization of immigration courts will be in denials of asylum claims and in expedited removal orders and deportations. “Immigration courts are like litigating death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” said Marks, the longtime immigration judge who retired in 2021. “When you deny asylum to someone, there’s a real possibility that person will turn up dead after they’re deported.”\n\nTrump has also purged the board that hears immigration appeals and replaced those members with his own appointees. The new, Trump-friendly version of the board then announced that judges could no longer order bond for anyone in the country illegally. That decision—which has been roundly rejected when challenged in federal courts—potentially means millions more people in federal detention, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating.\n\nThis, too, is all part of the plan. Miller, Tom Homan, and the architects of the child separation policy during Trump’s first term have made clear that one goal of their immigration policy is to disincentivize people from coming to the United States by inflicting suffering on those who do. One way to make people suffer is to take away their children. Another is to stuff them into overcrowded cells, deny them access to a shower, medication, and clean food and water, and make it all but impossible for them to contact their families or attorneys. Human rights groups have already documented these and other inhumane conditions at detention facilities all over the country, including at brand new centers like “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida.\n\nWhen Trump took office in January 2025, there were 39,000 people in ICE custody. By September, there were more than 60,000, and there will be capacity for around 107,000 by January 2026. As of this writing, 23 people have died this year in ICE custody. That’s the most since 2005, and more than the previous three years combined. The conditions faced by those in custody are only likely to get worse as deportation efforts continue to ramp up.\n\nAt the same time, the administration has hollowed out the offices within DHS and DOJ that oversee detention facilities. “There’s no oversight. There’s no reporting. There’s no access,” said “Dan,” a longtime former DHS employee and immigration prosecutor. “Until this administration, if a lawyer or an NGO complained about inhumane conditions, that was something we took very seriously. Now they just don’t care. It’s fully part of the plan. They’re open about it. You put people in detention, deny them access to a lawyer, and just continue to squeeze them until they’re so miserable that they give up their rights.”\n\nIn the midst of all of this, the Pentagon began engaging in this administration’s most egregious and brazen breach of due process to date: bombing boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, off the coasts of Colombia and Venezuela. The Pentagon claimed the occupants of the boats were “narco-terrorists,” but provided no evidence to support the accusation—nor would it be justified to kill them if they were. Smuggling drugs is not a capital crime in the United States. It also seems unlikely that most of the boats were bound for the United States, and neither Colombia nor Venezuela produces or exports significant quantities of fentanyl, the drug most responsible for overdose deaths in America.\n\nThe strikes are illegal, under both domestic and international law. The United States is not engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels, drug cartels are not terrorists or enemy combatants, and the administration has provided no evidence beyond its say-so that the people it has killed fit into any of those categories. The administration later conceded that it doesn’t actually know the identities of the people it is killing, but that it would be legally justified to kill anyone who is “as much as three hops away from a known member” of a designated terrorist organization. Setting aside the fact that, again, drug cartels are not terrorist groups, sociological studies estimate that the average person knows about 600 people. This means that under the “three-hop rule,” which allows authorities to pursue individuals three “hops” away from the target, each member of a terrorist group would make about 216 million people eligible for legal assassination by the U.S. government.\n\nAs of publication, the administration had killed more than 83 people in 21 strikes. The strikes embody Trump’s most authoritarian instincts—unchecked and unreviewable executive power; crass imperialism; a feverish, 1980s-era approach to illicit drugs (Trump has frequently said that drug dealers should be executed); and xenophobic bigotry, particularly toward the developing world. Both Trump and Vice President Vance have even joked about the possibility that the strikes may have killed innocent people, delivering wry bons mots about how Caribbean fishermen probably don’t go out on the water much anymore.\n\nThe strikes are abominable, reckless acts of violence in and of themselves. But it isn’t difficult to envision how an administration with so little regard for law, human life, and due process might make the leap to think it can also carry out extrajudicial executions inside the United States, particularly one run by a president who equates criticism of him with treason, likens immigrants to vermin, and calls his opponents “the enemy within.” This, after all, is an administration already trying to legally define peaceful protesters and their supporters as “terrorists,” the same term it uses to justify those extrajudicial killings.\n\nThere would certainly be far more popular and political backlash to such strikes within U.S. borders, or against U.S. citizens. But public opinion isn’t a dependable bulwark against an administration that has anointed itself judge, jury, and executioner. It’s of little comfort in the throes of an administration that believes it can kill on demand, regardless of domestic or international law, and feels no obligation to justify its decision to do so to Congress, the courts, or the public.\n\nPerhaps that sounds overwrought. But if you had suggested in 2024 that if elected, the Republican candidate for president would instruct federal police to sweep immigrants off the street—some of whom were here legally, and most of whom had no prior criminal record—put them on airplanes, and send them to a Central American gulag, all without ever letting them speak to a judge, you’d also have been called overwrought. But it is happening.\n\nIf you had suggested 10 years ago that federal agencies would use Nazi, fascist, and white nationalist iconography and allude to explicitly white supremacist literature in their social media posts, or that the Department of Homeland Security would use nativist, blood-and-soil messaging about preserving Western heritage in its outreach to recruit new immigration officers, you’d also have been called overwrought. But this, too, is happening.\n\nIf you had suggested during the Obama era that a U.S. president would encourage a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol in order to prevent his successor from taking office, that said president would then be reelected, would pardon all of the insurrectionists, and then go about erasing that history from official records, you’d also have been called overwrought. But Trump has done all these things.\n\nDuring the week I finished this story, a federal judge ruled that the conditions at the main immigration detention facility in Chicago were “inhumane.” U.S. District Court Judge Robert Gettleman found that prisoners were being forced to sleep on top of one another, slept next to overflowing toilets, were provided with no beds or access to showers, didn’t have adequate food or medicine, and were forced to drink water that “tasted like sewer.”\n\nThe following day, in a separate lawsuit, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis ruled that federal immigration officers in the city were using levels of force that “shocks the conscience.” She found that Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and other government agents had lied to her in court proceedings. In an impassioned opinion, Ellis mounted an eloquent defense of both the city of Chicago and American values, quoting Carl Sandburg and John Adams. She also ruled that federal forces were deliberately undermining free speech by detaining and beating protesters. “The freedom of speech is a principal pillar in a free Government,” she wrote, quoting Benjamin Franklin, “when this support is taken away the Constitution is dissolved, and Tyranny is erected on its Ruins.”\n\nThe next day, Bovino and his agents were back in Little Village, clashing with protesters. In the days that followed, they dragged a day care teacher out of her school as she screamed, used tear gas on large groups of protesters, and pepper-sprayed a one-year-old (they denied at least the pepper-spraying of the infant). Later, Bovino and his agents posed in front of Cloud Gate, the iconic sculpture more commonly called the Bean. According to local reports, the officers shouted out “Little Village!” as they mugged for a group selfie.\n\nJust a few days before Ellis’s ruling, in a prime-time interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, President Trump was asked if in tear-gassing entire neighborhoods, beating U.S. citizens, terrorizing children, and lying to federal courts—if given all of that—he thought that perhaps his deportation force in Chicago may have gone too far.\n\nHe answered, “I don’t think they’ve gone far enough.”",

    "description": "Why powerful AI might arrive sooner than we think",
    "fullText": "Dwarkesh Patel recently published a compelling essay arguing that today's AI systems are still many years away from AGI. His core view is that they are missing key components of cognition, most importantly true continual learning. Despite impressive benchmark performance, current models aren't yet economically transformative because they can't learn on the job the way humans do. Instead, labs are \"pre-baking\" skills into models using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), constructing bespoke training environments for coding, Excel, browser navigation, and countless other narrow tasks. To Dwarkesh, this reveals a fundamental limitation. As he puts it, \"Human workers are valuable precisely because we don't need to build schleppy training loops for every small part of their job.\"\n\nIt's a persuasive argument. But the question I keep coming back to is: is the elegant solution a hard requirement or can we sort of duct tape our way to AGI?\n\nConsider Deep Blue. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in a six-game chess match that captivated the world. Deep Blue did not understand chess in any human sense. It had no intuition, no internalized strategy, no aesthetic judgment. It simply evaluated millions of positions per second and searched deeper than any human could. One move in Game 2 unsettled Kasparov so badly that he accused IBM of cheating; it felt too creative, too human. But it was nothing of the sort. It was brute force, systematically exploring the possibility space. Twenty years later, AlphaZero learned through self-play, developing a fluid, intuitive style that grandmasters described as alien yet beautiful. AlphaZero played chess the \"right\" way. Both systems accomplished the goal of playing chess better than humans, but Deep Blue got there first. The ugly solution won.\n\nAre we in a similar situation today?\n\nDwarkesh looks at the current AI landscape and sees missing categories of cognition. Labs are painstakingly constructing verification environments for individual skills, and to him this is evidence that models lack genuine generalization. Real jobs, he argues, consist of hundreds of small, shifting tasks that vary from day to day, even for the same person. You can't automate them with predefined skill sets. In a way he's recapitulating the old expert systems vs learning systems debate. Manually coding how to behave was too brittle, so it never worked.\n\nInterestingly, his view does stand in contrast to many lab leaders. A skeptical reader will surely argue that's because they have a strong incentive to exaggerate the pace of progress, but for the purposes of this discussion, let's take their statements at face value. Dario Amodei believes the current paradigm will get us there, predicting powerful AI as early as 2026. Sam Altman and Jakub Pachocki have offered concrete timelines, an intern-level AI researcher by late 2026 and a fully automated one by 2028, backed by over a trillion dollars in infrastructure commitments. Mark Chen, OpenAI's Chief Research Officer, has pushed back on the idea that scaling is exhausted, hinting that they have made some important breakthroughs in pretraining specifically.\n\nThis perspective is not unanimous. Demis Hassabis believes additional breakthroughs are needed on the level of the transformer, and Andrej Karpathy estimates something like a decade. This camp tends to be more neuroscience-inspired, believing the current architectures are missing something fundamental.\n\nSo what's the actual bottleneck?\n\nDwarkesh's argument largely boils down to three problems all related to memory. First, current models are sample inefficient—they need far more examples to learn something than a human would. Second, what they learn isn't general enough to transfer across contexts. Third, they can't continue to learn on the job the way humans do.\n\nThis last problem is intrinsic to how gradient descent works. When a model learns, it adjusts billions of parameters at once, a global update that touches the entire network. This makes the system brittle; new information can overwrite old information, a problem called catastrophic forgetting. So today’s models come with a frozen pretrained brain and rely on stuffing relevant information into each prompt, called a context window. These are crude substitutes. Everything must be reprocessed with every response. There's no dynamic working memory, no graceful fading of irrelevant information, no seamless integration with long-term storage.\n\nThis matters for a number of reasons. Without the ability to integrate new information into its world model, it can only grasp new tasks superficially. It can't build on what it learned yesterday. Models struggle to navigate complex software because they can't track things the way you do. Photoshop is intuitive to an experienced user, but to a model with fragmented memory, every menu is half-familiar, every action a guess. These aren't signs of low intelligence. They're signs of a specific limitation, not dissimilar to a human disability. Blindness or deafness will make some tasks virtually impossible, but this says nothing about their underlying intelligence. Similarly, a model can be extraordinarily capable and still fail at tasks that require persistent memory.\n\nAll of this is accurate. The open question is whether it represents a hard scientific boundary or is just a matter of iterative engineering.\n\nHuman memory itself is not a single, elegant system. It's a collection of specialized mechanisms layered together by evolution. Most day-to-day learning does not instantly integrate deeply into the brain. It involves holding information in working memory, encoding episodes, retrieving associations, and slowly consolidating over time.\n\nSeen this way, perhaps the models aren't so far from functional equivalence after all. Retrieval over long interaction histories so a system remembers what you discussed weeks ago. Persistent preference and project files injected into context. Lightweight fine-tuning methods like LoRA applied periodically rather than continuously. External memory via tool use, where models write notes to themselves and read them back. Better working-memory mechanisms layered on top of existing architectures. None of this requires brand-new science, and much of it already exists in partial form.\n\nThese solutions are undeniably schleppy. They are brittle and can fail in surprising ways. Skeptics rightly point out that unlike chess, which is a closed system with perfect information, the real world is an open environment where errors can compound. That's all true, but we are no longer discussing hypotheticals. People are already using these systems for real work. Coding agents are writing and debugging software semi-autonomously. Customer service systems are starting to handle basic help desk queries. Legal research can often be handled end to end by an extended thinking model. There's still a capability gap, but it is shrinking.\n\nIt's important to recognize that 2025 was less a year of huge new models than one of bringing the frontier to everyone at a reasonable cost. That infrastructure buildout absorbed resources that might otherwise have gone toward pushing capabilities. If progress has felt slower than expected, this is part of the reason. It's easy to anchor on the current pace and assume it's the new normal. That would be a mistake.\n\nThe hardware trajectory is significant. Nvidia’s GB300 NVL72 racks use 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs acting as a single massive unit. Microsoft has announced the first large-scale production cluster with over 4,600 of these racks, claiming it will enable training models with hundreds of trillions of parameters and reduce training times from months to weeks. Depending on workload, this represents anywhere from a 4x improvement in training speed to a 10x reduction in inference costs compared to the previous generation. When you can throw an order of magnitude more compute at context management, retrieval, and verification, many of today's clumsy workarounds start to look far more viable.\n\nWe do need solutions to memory and some degree of continual learning, but Dwarkesh may also be understating how much current models already generalize. No one built a special training pipeline for GeoGuessr, yet general models can perform at a borderline superhuman level. This requires inferring the geographic location of pictures from subtle cues like vegetation, signage, architecture, and sun angle. And long before job-specific reinforcement learning was used, models already showed remarkable capability across many professions, just from compressing the internet.\n\nThe labs' heavy investment in RLVR could be viewed less like a confession of architectural inadequacy and more like a pragmatic choice. RLVR improves effectiveness on tasks that matter commercially. It simply juices the value of current models.\n\nThe benchmark, OSWorld, provides a useful case in point of my argument. This benchmark tests models on everyday computer tasks in a virtual machine: adding page numbers to a document, exporting a CSV from a spreadsheet, configuring browser settings. Over the past year, success rates have climbed from under 10% to over 60%, approaching the human baseline of 72%. But a closer look reveals something interesting: much of this progress comes from models finding workarounds. About 15% of tasks can be completed using only terminal commands, no GUI required. Another 30% can be largely solved with Python scripts instead of clicking through menus. The benchmark was designed to measure GUI manipulation, something models are known to struggle with, but instead of failing, they just found a workaround.\n\nThis discussion largely hinges on how far these workarounds can ultimately go. The debate isn't about whether human-like continual learning would be powerful. It would be. It's about what exactly is required to cross the human threshold of reliable knowledge work. History suggests that inelegant, resource-intensive solutions arrive first, especially when the incentives are overwhelming.\n\nRay Kurzweil's long-running prediction of human-level AI by 2029 is relevant here. Kurzweil's track record on specific technologies is mixed, but he has been remarkably prescient about the pace and magnitude of technological progress. His law of accelerating returns is all about markets. Computing power compounds due to incentives and what’s allowed by physics. Capital, talent, and institutional effort then develop new technologies enabled by that compute.\n\nHumans are best understood as what E.O. Wilson called a “superorganism,” similar to ants or termites. We cooperate at an unprecedented scale. And this global superorganism has slowly been turning itself toward the production of machine intelligence ever since ChatGPT arrived in late 2022. Nation-states, corporations, supply chains, research communities, and capital markets are all aligning around the same attractor. This applies immense pressure to each barrier to progress.\n\nIf the current paradigm fails to reach AGI, it will be because continual learning turns out to be a hard scientific barrier rather than an engineering challenge. But given the scale of investment, the pace of hardware progress, and the growing stack of workable approximations, I'd bet on the engineers.\n\nIt's unclear when we will get the elegant, human-like mind we are waiting for. But if history is any guide, that distinction may not matter much. When Deep Blue won, Kasparov felt it was a trick. He sensed a human creativity that simply wasn't there and accused IBM of cheating. We are likely walking into the same psychological trap. We will look at these schleppy, duct-taped systems and insist they are just parroting data or faking reasoning. We will call it a parlor trick right up until the moment it outperforms us. At that point, like Kasparov, we will have to accept that the mechanism matters less than the move.",

    "description": "AI chatbots are generating fake titles that people insist are real.",
    "fullText": "Everyone knows that AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini can often hallucinate sources. But for the folks tasked with helping the public find books and journal articles, the fake AI bullshit is really taking its toll. Librarians sound absolutely exhausted by the requests for titles that don’t exist, according to a new post from Scientific American.\n\nThe magazine spoke with Sarah Falls, the chief of researcher engagement at the Library of Virginia, who estimates that about 15% of all emailed reference questions that they receive are generated by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. And the requests often include questions about fake citations.\n\nWhat’s more, Falls suggests that people don’t seem to believe librarians when they explain that a given record doesn’t exist, a trend that’s been reported elsewhere like 404 Media. Many people really believe their stupid chatbot over a human who specializes in finding reliable information day in and day out.\n\nA recent post from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) titled, “Important notice: AI generated archival reference,” provides more evidence that librarians are just exhausted with it all.\n\n“If a reference cannot be found, this does not mean that the ICRC is withholding information. Various situations may explain this, including incomplete citations, documents preserved in other institutions, or— increasingly—AI-generated hallucinations,” the organization said. “In such cases, you may need to look into the administrative history of the reference to determine whether it corresponds to a genuine archival source.”\n\nYes it happened to me 🫠, I went to a bookstore for a totally plausible old French metaphor book mentioned by ChatGPT a year ago, only to discover that it does not exist.\n\n— Joanne Boisson (@joanneboisson.bsky.social) December 9, 2025 at 4:31 AM\n\nThe year seems to have been filled with examples of fake books and journal articles created with AI. A freelance writer for the Chicago Sun-Times generated a summer reading list for the newspaper with 15 books to recommend. But ten of the books didn’t exist. The first report from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s so-called Make America Healthy Again commission was released in May. A week later, reporters at NOTUS published their findings after going through all of the citations. At least seven didn’t exist.\n\nYou can’t blame everything on AI. Papers have been retracted for giving fake citations since long before ChatGPT or any other chatbot came on the scene. Back in 2017, a professor at Middlesex University found at least 400 papers citing a non-existent research paper that was essentially the equivalent of filler text.\n\nVan der Geer, J., Hanraads, J.A.J., Lupton, R.A., 2010. The art of writing a scientific article. J Sci. Commun. 163 (2) 51-59.\n\nIt’s gibberish, of course. The citation seems to have been included in many lower quality papers—likely due to laziness and sloppiness rather than an intent to deceive. But it’s a safe bet that any authors of those pre-AI papers would have probably been embarrassed about their inclusion. The thing about AI tools is that too many humans have come to believe our chatbots are more trustworthy than humans.\n\nAs someone who gets lots of local history queries, can confirm there’s been a big increase in people starting their history research with GenAI/LLM (which just spews out fake facts and hallucinated rubbish) who then wonder why they can’t find anything at all to corroborate it.\n\n— Huddersfield Exposed (@huddersfield.exposed) December 9, 2025 at 2:28 AM\n\nWhy might users trust their AI over humans? For one thing, part of the magic trick that AI pulls is speaking in an authoritative voice. Who are you going to believe, the chatbot you’re using all day or some random librarian on the phone? The other problem might have something to do with the fact that people develop what they believe are reliable tricks for making AI more reliable.\n\nSome people even think that adding things like “don’t hallucinate” and “write clean code” to their prompt will make sure their AI only gives the highest quality output. If that actually worked, we imagine companies like Google and OpenAI would just add that to every prompt for you. If it does work, boy, have we got a lifehack for all the tech companies currently terrified of the AI bubble bursting.",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI - Japanese-themed manga and anime have been barred from one of China's largest comic conventions about a week before the show begins in late December, Hong Kong media reported, amid a continuing diplomatic row between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe decision was notified to participants last Friday ahead of the two-day Comicup convention scheduled to be held next weekend in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou near Shanghai, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nExhibitors and visitors were informed by the event's organizers that there would be a \"full-scale adjustment\" of content toward \"a new Chinese style\" theme across the venue due to the \"current social environment and our cultural obligations,\" the Hong Kong newspaper said Tuesday.\n\nThe exhibition areas themed around American and European content did not seem to be affected at the event featuring some 7,000 booths, which has become a massive marketplace for creators of derivative works based on various anime, comics, and game fan groups, according to the report.\n\nWhile the notification did not name Japan, several dozen exhibitors featuring Japanese anime and other themed content said on social media that their booths had been cancelled for reasons \"well-known to all\" and \"factors beyond control,\" the SCMP said.\n\nA similar comic convention held in Shanghai in October drew hundreds of thousands of visitors. The paper quoted a woman whose booth was supposed to have featured artwork of the Japanese manga \"Let's Go Karaoke!\" as saying, \"I am feeling utterly helpless and sad.\"\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the two Asian neighbors stems from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's parliamentary remarks last month that suggested an attack on Taiwan could constitute a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Japan, prompting possible involvement of the Self-Defense Forces.\n\nBeijing has since ramped up its retaliatory measures, including urging its citizens not to visit Japan, suspending seafood imports from the neighboring country and canceling cultural events featuring Japanese artists.\n\nMeanwhile, manga and animation events scheduled for January in such Chinese cities as Shenzhen in Guangdong Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were postponed due to \"force majeure,\" according to organizers.",

    "description": "A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.  U.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

    "fullText": "Bernice King, the daughter of late civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., is pushing back against Vice President JD Vance’s comments surrounding white privilege in the U.S.\n\nKing sounded off on social media, writing, “@ JDVance Help me with this. In my 62 years, I don’t recall white people ever having to apologize for being white in America. The courage to tell the truth about the advantages white people have had in this country is the real issue.”\n\n“It’s time to stop reframing accountability as injury and start reckoning honestly with history, power, and responsibility—so we can move toward repair justice, and a shared future where dignity is not selective,” she added.\n\nVance: In the United States of America, you don't have to apologize for being white anymore. pic.twitter.com/QikIDkXNy5\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 21, 2025\n\nOver the weekend, Turning Point USA, or AmFest 2025, took place for the first time since Charlie Kirk‘s assassination on Sept. 10, 2025. In his speech, Vance encouraged people to join ICE, but it’s his comments about white privilege that folks can’t stop talking about.\n\n“In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore,” Vance told the crowd.\n\nUnsurprisingly, countless people, including rapper Ice Cube’s son, O’Shea Jackson Jr., who co-hosts the No Contest Wrestling podcast, slammed Vance for his remarks.\n\n“When the f**k did you have to?” Jackson wrote on X.\n\n“When JD Vance declares that white people no longer have to apologize for being white, what he’s truly signaling is a license for them to embrace open racism without remorse—emboldening them to spout bigoted rhetoric with brazen impunity, just as he and Trump do,” another person wrote on X. “This isn’t about pride in identity; it’s a dog whistle for unchecked prejudice, freeing supporters to echo their leaders’ divisive slurs against immigrants, minorities, and anyone who challenges the status quo.”\n\n“If being white is the only thing going for you I really feel sorry for you,” someone else added.\n\nOn the other hand, some argued there’s no such thing as white privilege: “I know plenty of white Americans living the exact same struggle as people in the Black community same wages, same bills, same stress, same lack of opportunity,” they commented under The Jasmine Brand’s Facebook post.\n\nAs Blavity reported, Vance took shots at Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett at the Turning Point USA America Fest.\n\n“The record speaks for itself. She wants to be a senator, though her street girl persona is about as real as her nails,” Vance said.\n\nCrockett was quick to fire back at Vance during her appearance on MS NOW’s The Weekend: Primetime.\n\n“When they can tell me about their policies that are helping Texas, then we can have a conversation, until then, take whatever shots you want to take at me, because I have been a Black woman my entire life,” she said.\n\nCrockett, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Texas, also called out the fact that Vance should be more concerned about the real reason why he’s Trump’s VP.\n\n“Baby, let’s talk about your record, because the only reason you’re the vice president is because the current President tried to have his last [vice] president killed,” she said, referencing the January 6 Capitol attack in which Trump supporters chanted “Hang Mike Pence” following Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe post MLK’s Daughter Bernice Claps Back At JD Vance Saying White People Don’t Have To Apologize For Being White appeared first on Blavity.",

    "description": "It's an indication of a broader trend.",
    "fullText": "A fishing competition off the coast of Libya took an odd turn when an angler hooked a species a long way from its natural range.\n\nThe Libya Observer reported that a Red Sea pennant fish was spotted for the first time in Libyan coastal waters. As the name suggests, the fish is a native of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden but has since spread across the Indo-Pacific region. The unusual discovery has prompted concerns by the competition's organizers, the Benghazi Scout Commission, over the potential harm the pennant fish could inflict outside of its native range.\n\nIt's also another indication that the Mediterranean is heating up. The UN's Environment Programme notes the region is warming about 20% faster than the global average. Among the consequences is the migration of invasive species. The Mediterranean has been dealing with interlopers ever since the Suez Canal opened in 1869, a phenomenon known as the Lessepsian migration.\n\nIt's not yet clear if the Red Sea pennant will establish itself in Libyan waters or if it will do significant harm, as not every uninvited guest from the Suez has been a problem. However, once an invasive species does take hold, the consequences are alarming for native fauna and flora.\n\nBecause they have no natural system of control, nothing is stopping their populations from getting out of hand. Invasive species outcompete natives for resources and disrupt the food web. When an invasive predator shows up in a new area, its prey is utterly helpless against it. For example, the UK's water vole population dropped 94% because of North American minks imported for fur.\n\nPrevention is the preferred course of action for invasive species, but in this case, that horse has long since bolted. Aside from occasional mishaps by ships, the Suez Canal is going to stay open, and Libya is much too close to Egypt to realistically stem the tide of invasive marine species.\n\nSo it's a question of raising awareness about the risks of invasive species and working with local stakeholders to form effective measures to manage them. If that fails, if the species is safe to consume, they can always grab a fork.\n\nDo you think humans are doing enough to protect endangered animals?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor bargain hunters, Costco has long been a go-to destination. The warehouse giant famously still sells its hot dog and soda combo for $1.50 — the same price it launched with back in the mid-1980s. But not every Costco item has held its price as stubbornly as the hot dog combo.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco began selling 1-ounce gold bars. At the time, shoppers could choose between two types: the PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan bar and the Rand Refinery bar, priced at $1,979.99 and $1,949.99, respectively, according to Business Insider. Despite the hefty price tag, both quickly became hot sellers (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nFast forward to today, and not much has changed — except the price.\n\nAs of December 2025, the Pamp Suisse bar sells for $4,119.99, an increase of 108% (2).\n\nThe jump in price is in line with the broader gold market, which has surged roughly 65% over the course of 2025. What’s more surprising is the continued demand.\n\nCustomers are now restricted to “one transaction per membership, with a maximum of 4 units per 24 hours”, according to the Costco website (3).\n\nGold has long been viewed as a way to preserve purchasing power. Unlike fiat currencies, it can’t be printed at will by central banks.\n\nIt’s also considered a classic safe haven. Gold isn’t tied to any one country, currency or economy, and in times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to it — driving prices higher.\n\nThat’s exactly what appears to be happening now. Markets are getting whipsawed by tariff uncertainty, rising deficits and global tensions — and gold has emerged as a rare bright spot.\n\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, also highlighted gold’s importance as part of a resilient portfolio.\n\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he told CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier (4).”\n\nGold hit a peak price of $4,371.78 per ounce in October, and many experts expect it to continue to rise as stock market outlooks get shaky (5).",

Copper prices have rallied by more than 35% this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009, driven higher by rising tech demand, supply constraints, and tariff uncertainty.\n\nGlobal copper (HG=F) prices officially surpassed $12,000 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday for the first time ever and continued to march higher on Wednesday.\n\nEach type of metal reacts slightly differently to economic conditions, and copper is no exception. However, unlike gold and silver, copper isn’t so directly influenced by investor sentiment or economic expectations. Its price movements can typically be attributed to physical growth and expansion.\n\nCopper is often viewed as a barometer for the economy. It plays a central role in power grids, construction, industrial machinery, and more. When there’s a demand for those types of goods or services, it’s typically a good sign that the economy has a clean bill of health — giving copper its nickname: Doctor Copper.\n\nRising copper prices often signal strong industrial demand and a rapidly growing economy, while falling prices may indicate an economic slowdown, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Copper is “a major beneficiary of investments in grid and power infrastructure globally, as AI and defence heighten the need for robust and secure energy networks,” wrote Goldman Sachs Research analyst Eoin Dinsmore in a note.\n\nGold is seen as more of a “safe-haven” asset and a hedge against inflation. Silver straddles the line between gold and copper and has both investment and industrial purposes. Copper, however, is predominantly industrial. It’s not typically purchased to be stored like gold or silver but meant to be used, which is why it’s usually the strongest indicator, of the three metals, that the economy is moving in the right direction.\n\nThere are a few key reasons that copper is experiencing a surge right now. Major copper-producing regions such as Chile and Indonesia have faced supply challenges and environmental disasters that have contributed to a global copper shortage and a tighter market.\n\n“After essentially flat mine supply growth expected this year, our 2026 mine supply growth estimates have fallen to only around +1.4%, or about 500 kmt lower than our estimates at the beginning of the year,” said Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, in a statement.\n\nA dip in supply isn’t the only factor that’s pushing prices higher. In July, the Trump administration issued tariffs on several categories of copper imports, putting additional pressure on the market. At the same time, heavy investment in the AI sector is significantly boosting demand because of its reliance on copper for data centers.\n\nOne source estimates that hyperscale AI data centers can use up to 50,000 tons of copper per facility.\n\nAs far as where prices are headed, JPMorgan Global Research expects copper prices to reach $12,500 a ton in the second quarter of 2026, ultimately averaging around $12,075 a ton for the full year.\n\nWhile researchers are optimistic that copper prices will continue on an upward trend, experts say the long-term implications of recent price surges remain uncertain.\n\n“The intersection of tariffs and copper prices in July 2025 highlights the complex dynamics of global trade and commodity markets,” said David Koch, CFP and director of portfolio management at Halbert Hargrove. “While the immediate effect has been a sharp rise in copper prices, the long-term consequences will depend on how markets, governments, and industries adapt to this new trade environment.”\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nGold and silver prices have been on a tear, with silver prices increasing by more than 100% year to date.

    "fullText": "CBS News aired the Kennedy Center Honors on Tuesday using a sharply edited Donald Trump monologue and dodging his controversial “Trump Kennedy Center” rebrand.\n\nThe new Trump-appointed Kennedy Center board voted on Dec. 18 to rename the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” leading to almost immediate legal action.\n\nDespite the 79-year-old president trying to muscle the rebrand into the country’s living rooms while hosting what he called “THE TRUMP KENNEDY CENTER HONORS” on Tuesday evening, CBS aired the 48th Kennedy Center Honors with the institution’s long-standing name, noted The Washington Post.\n\nBehind the scenes, the paper said CBS News standards had circulated guidance telling staff to stick with “Kennedy Center,” noting the board’s vote alone doesn’t make the change official because Congress would have to approve it.\n\nThe network also trimmed Trump’s opening remarks from roughly 12 minutes to about two minutes for viewers at home, cutting out some of his freewheeling asides—including his crack at the laughing crowd as “miserable, horrible people.”\n\nThe on-air snub came as CBS’s relationship with Trump has taken repeated hits, often with 60 Minutes at the center.\n\nIn July, Paramount, the network’s parent company, agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s presidential library to settle his $20 billion lawsuit over what he claimed was deceptive editing of a Kamala Harris interview, a deal the company announced without an apology.\n\nSince then, Trump has continued his attack on the network, even as CBS has been accused of bending over backwards to placate him. In November, it aired a 28-minute version of a Trump 60 Minutes sit-down with Norah O’Donnell, as well as a separate 73-minute extended cut.\n\nYet it left out a tense exchange in which Trump expressed irritation over questions about a crypto mogul he pardoned amid reports of a $2 billion deal tied to a Trump family crypto venture. The edits also omitted Trump’s comment about CBS’s payout related to the settlement.\n\nThen came the network’s leadership turmoil. After Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, 42, installed Bari Weiss, 41, as CBS News editor-in-chief in October, the MAGA-curious boss spiked a 60 Minutes segment at the eleventh hour last weekend.\n\nIt featured interviews with deportees sent by the Trump administration to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador, with Weiss claiming the segment needed more work before it could air. Her last-minute decision sparked concerns of White House interference and triggered fury inside the newsroom.\n\nThe episode spiraled further when the segment surfaced anyway after a Canadian broadcaster aired it, and Paramount Skydance began issuing copyright takedowns to scrub reposts.\n\nSet against concerns over political pressure and corporate leverage, the network’s refusal to call the venue the “Trump Kennedy Center” on its biggest annual cultural broadcast—and cutting Trump’s screen time—has raised more than a few eyebrows.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted CBS and the Kennedy Center for comment.",

    "fullText": "Dozens of laboratory mice allowed to roam a large outdoor enclosure returned to a typical level of mouse anxiety after just one week, researchers observed, suggesting that 'rewilding' may prevent lab-induced fear responses from developing in the first place.\n\nThe researchers, from Cornell University in the US, say their findings raise questions about the best ways to run anxiety tests on animals in the lab. This could also teach us something about how anxieties first begin to form in animals, including ourselves.\n\n\"We put them in the field for a week, and they returned to their original levels of anxiety behavior,\" says biologist Matthew Zipple.\n\n\"Living in this naturalistic environment both blocks the formation of the initial fear response, and it can reset a fear response that's already been developed in these animals in the lab.\"\n\nResearchers typically induce and measure anxiety in mice using what's called an elevated plus maze or EPM. It has two arms: an enclosed arm, which makes the animals feel safer, and an exposed arm, where the mice are in a more open environment.\n\nIn a standard response to the EPM, mice tend to explore the maze before returning to the enclosed spaces. This is interpreted as a sign of fear triggered by a single exposure to the open areas, a behavior so persistent that it resists SSRI anti-anxiety drugs.\n\nWhen researchers freed 44 mice from their lab cages to explore a relatively vast space outdoors, to burrow and climb and experience a variety of different sensations and conditions, they found it acted like a reset button.\n\nMice that were returned to the EPM explored both the open and closed spaces equally, as if encountering the maze for the first time. The effects were observed across mice regardless of whether they were rewilded from birth or not.\n\nThe findings may have implications for how we understand anxiety and its relationship to our environment – something that may be true of people as well as mice. It's possible that a narrow set of experiences can drive anxiety.\n\n\"If you experience lots of different things that happen to you every day, you have a better way to calibrate whether or not something is scary or threatening,\" says neurobiologist Michael Sheehan.\n\n\"But if you've only had five experiences, you come across your sixth experience, and it's quite different from everything you've done before, that's going to invoke anxiety.\"\n\nThe researchers suggest a rethink might be needed about how anxiety is studied in the lab, and how applicable experiments with mice could be to humans. What we think of as anxiety in lab mice might be easily mitigated by their environment, rather than being hardwired into their biology.\n\nThis idea of a more sheltered life as a contributor to anxiety is something that's been explored in studies of people as well. Perhaps more varied and even more risky experiences could help reduce anxiety – though we also know that there are multiple factors involved.\n\n\"This opens a lot of possibilities for asking interesting questions about how our library of experiences shapes our response to novel experiences, because I think that's essentially what anxiety is – when you have an inappropriate response to something that isn't actually scary,\" says Sheehan.\n\nThe research has been published in Current Biology.\n\nAn Anatomy Professor Explains The Bizarre Biology of Elves\n\nTiny Molecule Made by Gut Bacteria Could Cut Type 2 Diabetes Risk\n\nNew Drug Stalls Alzheimer's Development in Breakthrough Trial",

    "fullText": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) brought up the rear in a new poll asking Americans to assess the job performance of 13 U.S. leaders.\n\nGallup’s latest survey, conducted Dec. 1-15, found that 28% of Americans approve of how Schumer is handling his duties.\n\nHe was the only figure below 30%, a mark weighed down by an abysmal 39% approval rating among Democratic respondents. That represented a dramatic 37-point drop from January 2024, when 76% of Democrats approved of Schumer’s job performance, according to Gallup’s data.\n\nThe latest Gallup poll reflects fallout from a tumultuous year for Schumer.\n\nThe Minority Leader was roundly mocked by Republicans and upbraided by his own party after eight members of the Senate Democratic Caucus broke ranks to end the 43-day shutdown without securing an extension of enhanced health care subsidies.\n\nSchumer’s tactical misfire, coupled with his refusal to endorse New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, led some frustrated Democrats to call for new leadership.\n\n“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) posted on X. “If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?”\n\nBeyond Schumer, Gallup found that none of the 12 U.S. leaders from Congress, the Cabinet, the Supreme Court or the Federal Reserve earned majority-level approval.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell received the top mark with a 44% approval rating. He was followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio (41%), Vice President JD Vance (39%) and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F.

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

    "description": "“Consumers are just in this, whatever the highest price is, is the price they're going to focus on,” Harvard professor Jason Furman said.",
    "fullText": "As President Donald Trump struggles to address Americans’ growing affordability concerns, he has gotten some sympathy from one of former President Barack Obama’s former top economists.\n\nJason Furman, Harvard Kennedy School of Government professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday pessimistic consumers have overlooked gas prices that have remained affordable, making Trump’s job of addressing the affordability crisis more challenging.\n\nGas prices in December marked the lowest they’ve been all year, according to data from motor club AAA, with unleaded gasoline $0.18 cheaper nationally this year compared to last. National average prices reached their cheapest on Monday, hitting $2.85 a gallon. That hasn’t stopped consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since April, and approval ratings indicating more Americans disagree with how Trump is handling the economy.\n\n“I’ve been puzzled,” Furman said. “When you’re in government, you’re told, politically, the one price that matters is the price of gasoline. That’s the one price that’s been great this year. And I sort of feel a tiny bit bad for President Trump that he doesn’t get any credit for that.”\n\nTrump has continued to offer his own mixed signals on the affordability crisis, including saying in a primetime address last week he inherited an economic “mess” from the Biden administration, offering to cut checks for millions of military personnel for housing supplements, while simultaneously calling the economy the strongest it’s been.\n\nAccording to Furman, Trump also has a bit of a tough crowd: Consumers have been concerned about inflation and the price of groceries, which have increased nearly 30% over the past five years, making it more difficult to assuage economic anxieties, even when there are other optimistic signals.\n\n“Consumers are just in this sort of, whatever the highest price is, is the price they’re going to focus on and be upset about,” he said. “And that’s a really hard problem to solve economically or politically.”\n\nConflicting economic indicators extend beyond prices, Furman said. The U.S. saw its strongest economic growth in two years last quarter with a 4.3% GDP growth, exceeding past analysts’ estimates. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate creeped up to 4.6% in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, markedly higher than last November’s 4.2% and above 4%, which is considered reasonable.",

    "title": "This millennial home designer spent 9 months building a replica of ‘The Holiday’ cottage—now it’s renting fast at $499 a night",
    "description": "Lucy Small, a Georgia-based home designer, had 4,000 fans lined up to rent her festive cottage years before it hit the market. She says the home is so special that its success can’t “be replicated.”",
    "fullText": "Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance. Before joining the Success desk, she co-authored Fortune’s CHRO Daily newsletter, extensively covering the workplace and the future of jobs. Emma has also written for publications including the Observer and The China Project, publishing long-form stories on culture, entertainment, and geopolitics. She has a joint-master’s degree from New York University in Global Journalism and East Asian Studies.\n\nEveryone has must-watch holiday movies that they binge during the festive season, from Love Actually to Home Alone. But few actually get the chance to step inside the world of their favorite comfort flicks—that is, until now. Superfans of The Holiday can now rent out a replica of the quaint English cottage where fictional Hollywood bigwig Amanda Woods (played by Cameron Diaz) was charmed by heartthrob British book editor Graham (played by Jude Law). They’ll have to wait four months, though, and make the trek to Georgia instead of the Cotswolds.\n\nHome designer Lucy Small put the Holiday Cottage up for short-term rentals this October after a nine-month build—and a fan frenzy quickly ensued. The 37-year-old has spent the past six years designing homes in the Blue Ridge Mountains; she’s worked on three dozen houses, from bathroom and kitchen rebuilds to hardcore construction projects. But nothing could have prepared her for the rush of attention that came with her latest project: replicating the cozy Rosehill Cottage featured in The Holiday, from the ground up. After all, nearly two decades after the movie’s release, it continues to be a top-watched festive flick: In 2023, The Holiday was streamed 2.3 million times, according to an analysis from Samba TV.\n\nAs it turns out, the house featured in the 2006 film—owned by Kate Winslet’s character, Iris, who home-swaps with Amanda, staying at her L.A. mansion for the Christmas season—never actually existed in real life. It was a big undertaking, but Small saw a potential hit on her hands.\n\n“The Holiday Cottage was really a fun thing. I was like, ‘Hey, why don’t I do this? I have everything at my disposal to be able to do it, I know how to build, and I can find land,’” Small tells Fortune, adding she’s a fan of the iconic movie. “Honestly, it was just one of those situations where I had this wacky idea, and everyone got excited about it, and no one stopped me.”\n\nBefore the foundation of the two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath home was even built, Small had attracted attention from thousands of customers. She first announced her plan to build the cottage in 2022, and fan fervor started pouring in. The entrepreneur says she only had digital renderings of the cottage at the time, but people were already sending her handwritten letters about how they couldn’t wait to stay there. Around 4,000 people left their email addresses on a website Small threw together to update the public on its availability. Now, just two months after going live on the market, the short-term stay is fully booked until March 2026.\n\n“People have really loved it, and every time I get one of those letters of, ‘This means so much to me, thank you so much for making it possible,’ that’s just way more worthwhile to me than anything else,” Small continues. “Anyone can build a house, have it be a good investment, and sell it to an investor. But this seems to really have meaning to people, and that makes it important.”\n\nIt’s no easy feat bringing a piece of cinema into the real world—especially when you’re up against a home that’s impossible to replicate. In truth, the Rosehill Cottage featured in The Holiday was just a bit of movie magic; the home’s weathered facade was built in an open field, while the interior was filmed on sets. Some designers might balk at the idea of building a fictional home—but Small was actually excited by the premise.\n\n“I found out that the house never actually existed in real life, which, for me, is a big deal. Because if you can actually go visit the Brady Bunch house, or the Home Alone house, me building another one is less interesting,” she explains. “But if it never existed, if it’s a set that was torn down 20 years ago, that’s a lot more interesting, because there is literally nothing else in the world like it.”\n\nSmall put the project into motion several years ago, but quickly ran into some time-consuming roadblocks. Georgia, a popular tourist getaway and filming location, was slow to issue more short-term rental licenses as temporary stays flooded the market. Heavy taxes and fees also had to be factored into the price, as counties wanted in on the industry’s growing success. Finding the right land to build on was a struggle—but once she settled on a plot in North Georgia, it was off to the races.\n\nIn total, it took nine months to build the Holiday Cottage, from breaking ground to putting in the final flourishes. Small worked with an architectural designer, watching the romcom together “1,000 times” to try and get it right. The first hurdle: They realized the house would never meet code. When trying to build at scale, they discovered the ceilings would be too low, standing at only seven feet tall, based on where the windows were positioned in the movie. The film version of the cottage had only two chimneys but featured three fireplaces; the bathroom floor was sloped; and, in reality, one window would cut halfway through the kitchen cabinet. Small and her team did everything to match the same aesthetic, even setting up fake walls and slopes.\n\nReplicating the home’s furnishings proved to be a bit pricey, too. Despite the quaint movie cottage, seemingly adorned with humble, secondhand furniture, the decor was beyond Small’s budget. Using Google image reverse searches, she tracked down antiques identical to the ones on set, which ran upwards of $30,000 each. The bamboo umbrella tree shown in the cottage entryway, for example, was priced at over $15,000. Eventually, Small was able to parallel the same warm, charming atmosphere with similar decor. She declines to share how much the entire build set her back, or even when she’ll recoup on costs. Small says she rents out the home at a modest price—$399 per night during the low season, and $499 during high season—and is adamant the Holiday Cottage has been a worthwhile investment.\n\n“It’s not like we were totally surprised and totally blew the budget. We knew what it would be; we don’t charge a stupid amount,” Small says. “And so it’s still been a good investment, given that we did not, like, cheap out on the build at all.”\n\nWith 4,000 eager renters already waiting in line, the Holiday Cottage’s instant success wasn’t a huge surprise. However, Small wasn’t used to her projects getting so much attention.\n\n“As someone who, frankly, does not know how to use social media at all, who doesn’t have it, who’s pretty private, I’m usually unable to get eyeballs on any of my projects,” she continues. “For this one, [attention has] just been pouring in completely, even though I haven’t gone out to seek it, which has been a very new position for me as a designer.”\n\nOnce the Holiday Cottage booking site went live on Oct. 4, Small says dates started filling up “immediately.” And media attention only riled up more interest; the millennial home designer says she “can’t think of a magazine” that hasn’t covered her new build. And just in time for the holidays, it’s proved to be the perfect place to get into the festive spirit. Currently, there is only one open day in March, a few available slots in April, and just one in May. The Holiday Cottage isn’t available for a multiday booking until June 2026—the house is nearly booked out for six straight months.\n\nSmall’s latest project has proved a huge success, and she says renters have so far been loving it. Travelers leave their stories in the home’s guest book; a trio of sisters brought their mother, a big fan of The Holiday, along for the ultimate dream stay; another visitor used to watch the movie with her mom every Christmas, and after her passing, rented the place with her dad. For the people who stay there, the short-term rental is more than a place to crash. It’s the chance to be immersed in romcom nostalgia and reconnect with loved ones.\n\nWhen asked if she is planning another movie-related build, Small says she’s perfectly happy being the owner of this one viral sensation. Right now, she has no other ideas—all she knows is she will only take on projects like this, where people are excited about the result. Plus, Small believes there’s no other home built that can replicate the same magic as the Holiday Cottage.\n\n“Honestly, I’m fine being a one-hit wonder,” Small says. “I don’t need it to be a big moneymaker or big success, because a lot of the things that make this house—the Holiday Cottage—so special, I don’t think can be replicated.”\n\nA version of this story originally appeared at Fortune.com on Nov. 28, 2025.",

    "description": "I've spent my holidays in Punta del Este since I was 2. From endless beaches to kid-friendly culture and great food, here's why I keep going back.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I was 2 years old, my family has been spending the holiday break at the same beach: Punta del Este, in Uruguay.\n\nThe beach town is hands down one of my favorite places in the world, not only because of our long-standing family tradition — which I've now kept up with my own kids — but because it's a hidden gem in South America that deserves to be visited at least once.\n\nUruguay has opposite seasons to the US, which means it's summer during our winter. For my family of five, that means it's the perfect place to take a break from the sub-zero temperatures of Maine during the holidays.\n\nPunta del Este has endless miles of beach, with options for everyone. If you like surfing, there's a popular beach where you can find people sitting on their boards waiting for the perfect wave. For families with young children, there's Playa Mansa, which rarely has waves, making it ideal for kids to wade around in the water. For more experienced swimmers, there's Playa Brava, which offers big waves and strong tides.\n\nYou can often find merchants walking around with towels, bikinis, dresses, ice cream, and coffee. Some beaches have beach restaurants where you can buy food and drinks, although they can get crowded during peak season.\n\nUruguayans are known for being incredibly kind to kids. You can expect priority lines for families with young children at airports and supermarkets. In my experience, people often go above and beyond at restaurants and shops to ensure kids are happy.\n\nBeyond that, there are endless activities to keep kids happy. From ice cream shops to try on every block downtown, to an extensive (and free!) playground called El Jaguel, where families can spend the day exploring the grounds, having lunch, and riding horses.\n\nMy kids also love the day camps at Portal del Bosque in La Barra, which cost $2,000 Uruguayan pesos, or about $50, where they spend half a day exploring activities such as art, stop-motion animation, soccer, and more. My kids also love visiting the downtown hippie market, getting temporary tattoos, and getting threaded braids.\n\nDespite having been coming here for 40 years, I still haven't tried all the restaurants that Punta del Este has to offer.\n\nThere are historical ones, like La Huella in Jose Ignacio, which is loved by both locals and tourists (although securing a table during peak season can be challenging). Highlights include grilled octopus and fish, as well as a dessert volcano of dulce de leche.\n\nLo de Tere in the port, which is so fun to spend New Year's Eve at, as people dance on the street once the clock hits midnight. On other days, you can enjoy food with an emphasis on local products.\n\nAnd for a quick, casual bite, Rex, which has the best chivitos in town, is excellent to go with kids because of its quick service and lively atmosphere. One year, my kids spent the entire meal petting the restaurant's dog, while my husband and I enjoyed the coldest beer I've ever had.\n\nWhile Uruguay is known for its excellent steak, there are restaurants for every palate. My kids love eating fondue at Bungalow Suizo. I always enjoy getting fresh, local fish, and anything with dulce de leche (a local caramel) is a hit with the whole family.\n\nBut these are just a few of the endless options for food. You really can find something for everyone's taste.\n\nSummer here runs from December to March, which is the ideal time to come to enjoy the beach, as well as when most restaurants are open.\n\nThat said, the weeks between Christmas and New Year's can be really expensive and hard to get reservations for. Another factor to consider is that while there are direct flights from Miami to Montevideo and from Buenos Aires to Punta del Este, these can be particularly expensive during high season. To get an idea, for my family of five, return tickets to the US for January 2nd were running at $18,000. We opted to fly on December 31st instead and spend New Year's in the air.\n\nI hope we can continue spending more family vacations in Punta del Este, as seeing my kids enjoy the things I used to do as a kid brings me so much joy.",

    "description": "Tahmina Watson's law firm assists with employment visas. She advises all visa holders with a valid stamp to return to the US immediately.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tahmina Watson, a business immigration lawyer in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Watson's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a business immigration lawyer, and in my day-to-day work with clients, I'm seeing immigration disruptions with immediate consequences, including H-1B visa holders who are outside the US being uncertain if they can return.\n\n​​My law firm, Watson Immigration Law, assists founders and businesses in navigating the employment visa application process. It appears that, at this time, the administration is coordinating the rescheduling and delay of immigration appointments.\n\nNon-immigrant visas generally must be scheduled at a US embassy or consulate in the person's country of nationality or residence. From my experience, many employees accrue their holiday time and schedule immigration appointments during this period because they're already planning to leave the country, allowing them to easily visit their designated US embassy or consulate.\n\nThese employees are now getting stuck, having already left the US, with their appointments getting rescheduled for June, July, or August 2026, and beyond.\n\nMajor tech companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft, sent memos out to their employees in the past week, warning visa-holding employees to avoid international travel amid long delays at US consulates. These policies are coming one after another, and they all intersect with each other.\n\nIf somebody is outside the country, what are employers supposed to do? Right now, my advice to clients outside the country is that if they have a valid visa stamp, they should return to the US as soon as possible.\n\nFor someone who has left the country to obtain a new visa stamp, I'm not sure there's a clear path to return. This includes individuals on F-1 student visas who traveled to visit family and were planning to re-enter the US. They will need that visa stamp from a consulate.\n\nEnsure your employment is still active and consider whether remote work is an option. If an employer decides they cannot keep someone on the books, even an appointment months from now will not help if there's no job waiting.\n\nIt's tough to know how things will unfold. What we're seeing is a confluence of policies coming in at the same time. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has just announced that it is replacing the lottery system for H-1B work visas, which randomly selects who receives a visa. The system is now set to prioritize higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.\n\nSocial media disclosure is being expanded from F-1 visa holders, which began during the student visa crisis, to now include H-1B workers. These applicants are required to change all social media privacy settings to public.\n\nIt could easily expand to other visa categories. The government has not provided clear guidance on what they are reviewing. By casting an overly broad net under the banner of national security, without clear standards or transparency, the administration is creating uncertainty that will ripple across families, employers, and the US economy.\n\nClients should limit what they post online.\n\nIn 2024, I was already anticipating these issues with traveling and returning to the US. We've also seen issues affecting green card holders with past criminal convictions.\n\nThere are many stories of people who have lived in the US for decades, suddenly facing deportation proceedings. This is a highly precarious time for immigrants, and limiting travel is critical.\n\nIt feels like a fire hose of policies. Everyone in the immigrant ecosystem is on high alert: Immigration lawyers, immigrants, employers, investors, founders, and employees.",

This January, it looks set to be Antoine Semenyo.\n\nManchester City are in advanced talks to sign the 25-year-old Bournemouth forward, who has a £65m release clause which expires on 10 January.\n\nBBC Sport understands four other Premier League clubs – Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea - have made enquiries.\n\nIt marks the latest step in a rapid rise for London-born Semenyo, who represents Ghana internationally through his father's heritage.\n\nHe was rejected by Arsenal, Spurs and Millwall as a youngster before ending up in a West Country academy run by former Leeds and Forest Green manager Dave Hockaday.\n\nBristol City signed him in 2017, but he needed loan spells at Bath, Newport and Sunderland before breaking into the Robins' first team in 2020-21.\n\nIn January 2023, he made a £10m move to Bournemouth - and he has been improving ever since.\n\nBut why Manchester City, and why now? And do the Cherries have any chance of persuading him to stay?",
