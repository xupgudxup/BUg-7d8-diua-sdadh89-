Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have been in a bit of a slump as of late. Despite being 19-9 and the 4th seed in the Western Conference, they're 4-5 in December.\n\nThis does coincide with some injuries, which makes sense. Of the nine games played in December, the Lakers have been without Austin Reaves for three games and Luka Dončić for three and a half, amid many other role players missing time.\n\nThis, along with the obvious deficiencies on the roster, has led the team to where they are now.\n\nMore: Here are the two ways the Lakers can fix their biggest issues\n\nAustin Reaves made his return on Tuesday night, coming off the bench against the Suns, who absolutely thrashed LA. It was a decent first showing back, as he scored 17 points on 6/11 shooting.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the Lakers are set to take on the Houston Rockets at Crypto.com Arena, and from the sounds of it, they'll be getting their other star back as Luka Dončić is set to make his return.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the month of December has not been kind to the Lakers. Not only are they currently below .500 for the month, but it's the way they've looked in these losses that's concerning.\n\nOf the five games they've lost, they've averaged an 18-point deficit in those losses and have had some abysmal shooting nights, shooting below 20% in two of their last four.\n\nWe can’t play defense and we can’t shoot 3s\n\n-Lakers now rank 23rd in defense\n-Lakers are 28th in 3 point shooting\n\nNot a contender pic.twitter.com/nNKJF9BVpv\n\n— The Lakers Chip (@Lakerschipp) December 24, 2025\n\nObviously, this is a much different team without Luka Dončić, but are these problems too large for him alone to solve?\n\nThe Houston Rockets, while not as good as most expected them to be, are still a problem. They have length, shooting, and depth that will absolutely punish the Lakers on their home court if they're not careful.\n\nHopefully, for Lakers fans, Luka Dončić's return to the lineup, paired with playing on Christmas, gives the team the jolt needed to break out of this slump and deliver a gift to Los Angeles.\n\nLuka Dončić playing Santa in Los Angeles this holiday season\n\nWhat's behind the NBA's best bromance between Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves?\n\nJJ Redick saw the All-Star writing on the wall on day one with Austin Reaves.\n\nThe Lakers reportedly have a 6'7 trade pivot out of Cleveland",

    "fullText": "James Harden blasted as 'foul baiter' by opposing head coach originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHouston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka wasn’t happy with the undisciplined way that his team defended Los Angeles Clippers guard James Harden during L.A.’s 128-108 win over the Rockets on Tuesday night.\n\nAfter the game, Udoka put Harden on blast for intentional foul-seeking and simultaneously admonished his own troops for falling into the veteran guard’s well-established traps.\n\nHarden finished the game against Houston with 29 points and 13 free throw attempts, 12 of which he converted.\n\n“The undisciplined things of reaching in and fouling,” Udoka said. “Fouled him on three jump shots and then slap down. He’s a foul-baiter, and you don’t stay disciplined, show your hands, and reach in. And so, prime example of the things we did well last game or that we need to do against certain guys, and obviously didn’t come out with that tonight.”\n\nUdoka is far from the first person to call Harden out for fishing for fouls, but it is a little surprising to hear a coach be so blunt and critical about an opposing player.\n\nHarden has led the league in free throw attempts and makes on a whopping seven separate occasions, so there's no denying that he has a certain knack for drawing contact. While some would classify that as a skill, others like Udoka, might label it differently.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Harden isn’t the only guard in the league currently facing foul-baiting accusations. New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson recently responded to similar claims about his style of play by denying them and challenging his defenders to be more disciplined.\n\n“I play by the rules. I’m not a foul baiter,” Brunson said. “I just play by the rules. Be disciplined on defense. Don’t reach.”\n\nReigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander also recently defended himself against claims that he receives a favorable whistle.\n\n\"I don't care, not one bit. I can't control how the refs blow the whistle ever,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I've never been able to. Never been a ref. All I can do is play basketball, and that's all I focus on.”\n\nSo again, it’s not just Harden. Players today are very smart, and many have figured out how to exploit certain rules to their advantage. That might not always lead to the most aesthetically-pleasing brand of basketball, but it has proven to be effective given the way the game is officiated today.",

    "fullText": "An especially introspective Steve Kerr told reporters Wednesday that there's beauty in the struggle while he reflected on the state of his Golden State Warriors and the blowup he had with Draymond Green during the third quarter of a 120-97 win over the Orlando Magic two days earlier.\n\nKerr and Green were seen in a heated discussion during a timeout Monday night. After an animated exchange, Green decided to remove himself and left for the Chase Center locker rooms.\n\nAlthough he eventually returned to the bench, he didn't check back into the game.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nKerr said he and his do-it-all forward had a \"great chat\" Wednesday. The longtime Warriors head coach said he and Green apologized to each other as well as to the team.\n\nKerr explained that it was not his finest hour, nor was it a good look for his group.\n\n\"That was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange,\" Kerr said Wednesday.\n\n\"These things, they happen, especially when you get two incredibly competitive people like Dray and me. So over the 12 years we've been together, this has happened occasionally, and I'm not proud of it.\"\n\nKerr added: \"I care so much about Draymond, and the relationship we have is like family. And like family, you go through ups and downs. And my No. 1 goal honestly is for him to finish his career as a Warrior with us fighting — metaphorically, not literally — and competing together until we're both gone. And I believe that's going to happen because I believe in Draymond, and I believe in myself and I believe in everything we've built for 12 years.\"\n\nFull soundbite of Steve Kerr on the heated exchange with Draymond Green:\n\n“I regret my actions in that exchange and I apologized to Dray, he apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\nKerr reflected on their 12 years of winning together, expressing his belief in Green. pic.twitter.com/xpWhHFwZoA\n\n— Kenzo Fukuda (@kenzofuku) December 24, 2025\n\nThe Warriors famously selected Green out of Michigan State with the 35th overall pick in the second round of the 2012 draft. Kerr has coached him from the 2014-15 season on. Since, Green has emerged as a four-time All-Star, one-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. Together, Kerr and Green have won four NBA championships.\n\nWhile Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and then Kevin Durant, consistently shot the lights out, Green has left his own mark on the organization: with defensive tenacity, heady court vision and physical rebounding, plus timely scoring.\n\n\"We have four banners out there, and obviously a lot of people have played important roles in that, but I've said this before, and I truly believe it. I don't think we have any without Draymond. That's how much he impacts winning.\n\n\"So his ability to channel that passion, that emotion, that raw rage that he has is a key component to what makes us successful. And what I said about the other night, I didn't channel my own raw emotion and rage, of which there is plenty. We are far more alike than anyone would ever realize.\"\n\nKerr cited a long history of turning negative moments into positive momentum during his relationship with Green, who Kerr described as \"very complex.\" While Green has racked up technical fouls and served his fair share of suspensions for outbursts during a 14-season NBA career, he's also known for his basketball acumen and his contemplative commentary.\n\n\"We've always, always found a way to not only bounce back, but to make strides as a result,\" Kerr said, via Warriors reporter Kenzo Fukuda.\n\nWith the win over the Magic, the Warriors improved to 15-15. They've won back-to-back games for the fifth time this season. But they've still yet to string together more than three victories in a row.\n\nThis version of Golden State is spearheaded by Curry, Green and Jimmy Butler III. They're all at least 35 years old. Butler is a Warriors transplant who helped spark a second-half run last season, which ended in the Western Conference semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in the first game of the series.\n\n\"Where we are as a team, as an organization, the most important thing for me is for guys to recognize that there's beauty in the struggle. There's beauty in what we're trying to accomplish right now,\" Kerr said Wednesday, via The San Francisco Standard's Danny Emerman.\n\n\"We are no longer the '17 Warriors, dominating the league. We are a fading dynasty. We know that. Everyone knows that. So what is up to us? How do we carry ourselves night to night? How connected are we? And can we give ourselves another swing at the plate? We did that last year. I was really proud of the team last year. Despite the loss to Minnesota, injury to Steph. Who knows how long we would've gone? But we gave ourselves a chance. That's the goal here.\n\n\"We know where we are. We've got to know who we are, we've got to know what's possible, and we've got to take pride in the struggle, because this is part of life.\"\n\nKerr said he believes sorting out the tiff with Green has been a major step in this Warriors team working through its issues.\n\nHe sees an opportunity for Golden State to make another run like last year's.\n\nAs for Green, Kerr wants him to finish his career in a Warriors uniform.\n\n\"He's undyingly loyal and passionate, and I will go to bat for him as long as I'm coaching him here,\" Kerr said, per Emerman. \"Honestly, I'd go to bat for him 20 years from now when we haven't been together. That's how strongly I feel about him. And that's how I want this thing to end with us, whenever that is.\"",

    "fullText": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (WGN) — While Caleb Williams, DJ Moore and the Chicago Bears’ offense received most of the praise for last weekend’s dramatic, come-from-behind victory over the Green Bay Packers, it would have never happened had it not been for kicker Cairo Santos.\n\nIn a press release on Wednesday, the NFL announced Santos was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for Week 16 after his efforts in the Bears’ 22-16 overtime win versus the Packers.\n\nHow improbable was the Chicago Bears’ OT win over the Green Bay Packers?\n\n“Cairo navigating the wind … It was just unbelievable with the gusty conditions out there. You guys saw all of the paper cups and all of the things flying and floating all over the field,” Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower said. “For him to have the mental fortitude to stay focused and play the conditions is what we talk about doing.\n\n“Not trying to beat the conditions, not being upset about the conditions, but play the conditions. I thought he did an excellent job of that and struck the ball really well … It helped us a ton.”\n\nSantos converted all three of his field goal attempts in a driving wind—from 46, 51 and 43 yards—and his lone point-after attempt. He was also the only NFC kicker to score at least 10 points and make 100% of his kicks, including one from 50 yards or longer.\n\n“It was super gusty. It was a tough day today,” Santos said after the game. “My first 46-yarder was against the wind, and all the other ones were with the wind. IN the fourth quarter, we were kicking with the wind, but it was more of a crosswind. So, we just had to play a perfect ball and trust it.”\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, wind gusts reached as high as 25-30 mph on Saturday at Soldier Field.\n\nOn top of his ten points scored, he also helped Chicago’s special teams unit recover an onside kick with 1:59 remaining in regulation against Green Bay.\n\n“Cairo’s done so much work on campus here, and he’s done it in the offseason too—I’m talking about all different types of kicks,” Hightower said. “I’ve tried to stop him at times from kicking onside kicks so much, like, ‘Hey, it’s time to go in.’ And he keeps doing it. There’s so much work that’s been put in from that standpoint that it’s not an accident.\n\n“He put work in for it and he hit a really good ball.”\n\nHis one make from 50+, a 51-yarder in the fourth quarter, was his 25th made field goal of 50-plus yards as a member of the Bears, the most by any kicker in franchise history.\n\n“I don’t have many words, man. It’s special to do this with you guys—coaches, players,” Santos said after receiving a game ball from Ben Johnson in the postgame locker room.\n\nOver the last two seasons, under Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower, the Bears have earned five Special Teams Player of the Week awards, tied with the Denver Broncos for the most in the NFL.",

    "fullText": "Everyone knows that the LSU Tigers are going to be in the market for a quarterback this offseason, the only question is which one.\n\nMatt Mascona, of LouisianaSports.net, reported that the Tigers have made contact with the reps of former Florida Gators star DJ Lagway. That immediately solidifies Lagway’s position on the list of possibilities for next year.\n\nLane Kiffin and his staff must come away with a new option at quarterback next year. The only scholarship player at the position on the roster is Michael Van Buren Jr.\n\nWhile Van Buren showed flashes over the last few weeks when he took over for Garrett Nussmeier, but not enough to warrant going into next season with him as the only option.\n\nKiffin is likely to go big game hunting for one of the top names available.\n\nThe most obvious observation to make is bringing over Trinidad Chambliss from the Ole Miss Rebels, but he’s not guaranteed another year of eligibility.\n\nArizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt was another top option, coming off a down year but still carrying hopes of having an NFL career. Working with Kiffin could secure that.\n\nIf it does come down to Lagway as the choice, it would be an exciting outcome for LSU. He may not have had the best start to his career with the Gators, but he’s still a high potential player.\n\nLagway was the top high school passer in a class that included stars like Julian Sayin, Dylan Raiola and CJ Carr. He’s now one of the top options in the portal.\n\nThe Texas native has completed 63.2% of his passes for 4,179 yards with 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions over his two seasons in Florida.\n\nHe’ll have great games and make impressive throws, but no consistency has been developed. It wouldn’t be crazy to think that Kiffin and his staff could unlock something that the failed Gators crew couldn’t.",

    "fullText": "Mike Tomlin and Mike McCarthy are two of the most successful NFL head coaches of this century. Both won a Super Bowl, while Tomlin has 200 career wins and counting and McCarthy has 185.\n\nMcCarthy even won his Super Bowl at Tomlin’s expense in early 2011, with his Green Bay Packers edging the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25 in Super Bowl XLV as Aaron Rodgers outdueled Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nNeither team has been back to the Super Bowl since, although Rodgers and Tomlin have a chance to get there this year in a wide-open AFC.\n\nWith Tomlin notching his 200th career win last week and extending his historic streak of seasons without a losing record to 19, McCarthy praised his former rival on Wednesday’s episode of “The Pat McAfee Show.”\n\n\"I'm so happy to see Mike Tomlin get the recognition that he deserves..\n\nHe's a Hall of Famer and what he's done in Pittsburgh is incredible\" ~ Coach McCarthy #PMSLive pic.twitter.com/4SD7UCjZON\n\n— Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) December 24, 2025\n\n“I’m so happy to see Mike get the recognition and love that he deserves,” McCarthy said. “This, to me, is the reality of who he is as a coach. To do that for 19 seasons is incredible. You want that in your leader…He’s a Hall of Famer in my view, and I’m just really happy for him to see him recognized properly.”\n\nTomlin has received a good amount of praise and respect over the last few days just weeks after many fans and media members were calling for the Steelers to fire him. Such is life in the NFL.\n\nThe veteran coach has helped turn his team around and get them back on track after a midseason swoon that nearly derailed their playoff hopes. They’ve won three straight games, playing their best football during the biggest games of the year.\n\nIf Pittsburgh keeps it up, Tomlin has a good chance to earn his first playoff win in nearly a decade next month.\n\nMore Steelers: Mike McCarthy Reveals Steelers-Themed Christmas Wish\n\nThe post Steelers’ Mike Tomlin Earns Lofty Praise From Former Rival appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles issued their first official injury report in advance of their Week 17 road game against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe Eagles listed four players under DID NOT PARTICIPATE: Lane Johnson, A.J. Brown, Nakobe Dean, and Landon Dickerson.\n\nFor the second week in a row, there was a report about Johnson returning to practice but it’s yet to happen. Unless Lane Johnson returns to practice on Thursday, he’s probably out again this week.\n\nBrown is listed with “teeth” as his injury designation. More context below. Guessing he should be able to play.\n\nA.J. Brown said yesterday that he was getting his wisdom teeth out this week, so that could be the reason for his absence. #Eagles https://t.co/W9TILDfNuu\n\n— Jeff McLane (@Jeff_McLane) December 24, 2025\n\nVic Fangio suggested that Dean is unlikely to play on Sunday. Don’t want to rush him back from his hamstring injury, especially with Jihaad Campbell as a more than capable starting linebacker option.\n\nDickerson missed Wednesday’s practice due to illness. He’s been missing some practice sessions in recent weeks due to rest reasons.\n\nThe Eagles listed seven players under FULL PARTICIPATION: Jalen Carter, DeVonta Smith, Zack Baun, Jihaad Campbell, Fred Johnson, Cameron Latu, and Cameron Williams.\n\nCarter told reporters he plans on returning to action on Sunday. It remains to be seen just how much the time off helped him.\n\nJalen Carter said he expects to play on Sunday. He had some shots in his shoulders before missing the last three weeks and is already feeling the benefits.\n\n— Dave Zangaro (@DZangaroNBCS) December 24, 2025\n\nJalen Carter said he got multiple shots in both shoulders. He’s probably not going to feel 100% during this stretch run and will likely have to revisit the injury in the offseason.\n\n— Jeff Neiburg (@Jeff_Neiburg) December 24, 2025\n\nDeVonta, Baun, Campbell, and Fred Johnson were never in doubt.\n\nLatu missed Week 16 due to a stinger. Seems like he might be able to return in Week 17.\n\nWilliams is still in his 21-day practice window to return from injured reserve but the Eagles don’t seem to be in a rush to replace him.\n\nWR A.J.

It remains to be seen if this is a new hamstring injury or if it’s related to his previous one. Something to monitor.\n\nJones has previously been getting rest in practice so perhaps the Bills are taking it easy with him.\n\nPoyer picked up a hammy injury during the Bills’ Week 16 win. We’ll see if the former Eagles UDFA signing is able to play.\n\nKnox is a new addition to the Bills’ injury report. If neither him nor Kincaid can play, the Bills will be without two of their top three tight ends.\n\nBills kicker Matt Prater is still hurt so Michael Badgley might have to kick in place of him again.\n\nThe Bills listed four players under LIMITED PARTICIPATION: starting quarterback Josh Allen, linebacker Shaq Thompson, starting nickel cornerback Taron Johnson, and backup nickel cornerback Cam Lewis.\n\nAll indications point to Allen playing but he might be less than 100%.

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

    "fullText": "It seems all is well between Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green and head coach Steve Kerr following a Monday argument during a third quarter timeout in their eventual 120-97 win against the Orlando Magic.\n\nKerr, during a press conference Wednesday, took accountability for the dust up that led to Green briefly walking away from the bench to gain his composure alone in the locker room before returning shortly before the fourth quarter began, despite never taking off his warmups.\n\n\"Monday night was not my finest hour and that was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange. I apologized to Dray. He apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.\"\n\nSteve Kerr on Draymond Green: “Monday night was not my finest hour and that was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange. I apologized to Dray. He apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\n— Joseph Dycus (@joseph_dycus) December 24, 2025\n\nGreen, a four-time champion in 13 seasons with the Warriors, said after Monday's game to reporters that \"tempers spilled over\".\n\n\"I just thought it was best that I get out of there,\" Green said. \"I don't think it was a situation where it was going to get better, so it was best to remove myself.\"\n\nThe cause of the argument Green said was basketball.\n\n\"It's what we do,\" he said. \"We play basketball. It's an emotional game. People lose their emotions sometimes, it happens. It is what it is. We've been at this now for a long time. Sometimes you're with people for a long time there's a level of comfort and it happens. We move forward.\"\n\nReporters on Monday asked if it was something that would linger on, but Green dismissed it saying they would \"move forward\".\n\n\"We'll move forward, we're alright,\" Green said regarding his spat with Kerr.\n\nThe Warriors are currently have a .500 record after 30 games, sitting at the eighth spot in the Western Conference. They have a Christmas Day game Thursday against the Dallas Mavericks and their rookie sensation Cooper Flagg at Chase Center in San Francisco.\n\n\"I think we're headed in the right direction,\" Green said to reporters Monday. \"No one's happy about being 15-15.

The following players did not participate in practice:\n\nTreVeyon Henderson, DeMario Douglas, Morgan Moses, Thayer Munford Jr., Milton Williams, Anfernee Jennings and Charles Woods were listed as limited participants. Williams’s 21-day practice window is open, and the Patriots can activate him at any point.\n\nNot only is the Patriots’ Wednesday injury report long, but it also features some of the most important players on the team. With Hollins, Boutte and Douglas all on the injury report, the Patriots could be thin in the wide receiver room for their game against the New York Jets.\n\nThe Patriots could lean on rookie wide receiver Kyle Williams more this week. He has proven he can make big plays this season, and needs just one more 30-plus yard touchdown to tie Randy Moss’s franchise record for 30-plus yard touchdowns in a single season.\n\nIf Wilson is unable to play, Ben Brown figures to draw another start. Spillane has not played since Dec. 1 against the New York Giants. Williams is unlikely to be activated this week, but his limited participation is a good sign that he will be ready to go when the playoffs start.\n\nThe Patriots can clinch the division and at least one home playoff game with a win and a Buffalo Bills loss or tie.

    "description": "Our FIU vs. UTSA predictions expect the battle-tested Roadrunners to rise to the occasion in the First Responder Bowl.",
    "fullText": "We should be in for an entertaining matchup on Friday night when the Florida International Panthers meet the UTSA Roadrunners in the First Responder Bowl.\n\nThe Panthers are playing in their first bowl game in six years, and just their sixth since the program’s inception in 2002, but getting their third bowl victory ever will be difficult against this Roadrunners offense.\n\nSee why I like the Roadrunners to get the job done in my Florida International vs. UTSA predictions and college football picks for Friday night’s First Responder Bowl!\n\nUTSA is the better team, with the better quarterback and the more effective defense. The Roadrunners will utilize their ground game and limit FIU’s scoring opportunities en route to a win.\n\nIt makes sense to look at the 7-5 record for the Florida International Panthers, compared to the UTSA Roadrunners' mark of 6-6, and assume they might be a bit better.\n\nHowever, according to Jeff Sagarin, the Panthers played a weaker strength of schedule this season than Illinois State and North Dakota.\n\nAnd if you’re thinking neither of those is an FBS school, then you’d be correct.\n\nDespite facing such a weak schedule, the Panthers rank 104th in offensive EPA, 103rd in rushing success, and 105th in rushing defense success rate. They also allow 3.77 points per quality drive, ranking 94th in FBS.\n\nThat’s what happens when you get dominated at the line of scrimmage on defense. The Panthers allow the third-most yards before contact of any FBS team, giving up 2.87 line yards. They also generate little pressure without blitzing heavily.\n\nThat’s great news for a UTSA offensive line that ranks 29th in line yards and 34th in pressure rate allowed. Their backs also rank 20th in yards after contact in the ground game, which is why they’re 43rd in EPA/rush.\n\nOwen McCown is the better quarterback in this game, and he threw for 370 yards and four touchdowns as he led the Roadrunners to an upset win over Tulane. That’s by far a better win than any FIU posted this season.\n\nThe FIU defense ranks in the 100s in explosive run rate allowed, early down EPA, and stuff rate. Its offense posts very few explosive pass plays, struggles on third down, and is among the most penalized in college football.\n\nUTSA played a tougher schedule, and yet still posted far better metrics on offense and defense. I’ll take the team with the better roster, even with some defections, laying less than a touchdown.\n\nThe UTSA offense can put up explosive plays, especially against this FIU defense. It’s a big reason why the Over is 6-1 in the last seven games for the Roadrunners as they’ve averaged 37 points over that span.\n\nAnd while FIU’s not as good as UTSA, that’s not to say the Panthers won’t light up the scoreboard themselves. The Over has cashed in three of their last four as they’ve scored 34+ in all three of those contests.\n\nAs good as UTSA plays on the whole, the Roadrunners have allowed 34 plays of at least 30 yards this season. FIU has shown an ability to hit big runs, despite the iffy line play, and USF rushed for 7.4 yards a pop against UTSA earlier this season.\n\nIt might take some garbage-time offense, but even at 59.5, I think the total is a bit lower than it should be.\n\nMoneyline: FIU +200 | UTSA -250\n\nOver/Under: Over 59.5 | Under 59.5\n\nUTSA has cashed the first-half Over in six of their last seven games for +4.90 units and a 62% ROI.

    "description": "Buyout firms have struggled to sell companies they own and have instead found a workaround to get cash back to clients: Selling the companies to themselves.",
    "fullText": "In May 2022, clients of the private equity firm Clearlake Capital gathered at a California resort with dazzling views of the Pacific Ocean, where champagne and shrimp flowed freely.\n\nPerhaps even more dazzling than the setting at the Monarch Beach Resort & Club was Clearlake’s recent performance, which had blown through almost every imaginable benchmark, with one fund generating average annual returns of 50 percent.\n\nOne reason for the firm’s success, according to one attendee and documents shared at the gathering: Clearlake was selling the companies it owned from one set of investment funds to another set of funds it also managed called “continuation vehicles.”\n\nContinuation funds are meant as a temporary fix for a serious problem that has been bedeviling firms like Clearlake.\n\nPrivate equity firms have been struggling to deliver on their core business model of taking on debt, buying companies and selling them for a profit. Several years of high interest rates have made it too expensive for many would-be buyers to purchase companies with debt, and private equity firms are contending with a backlog of more than 31,000 unsold companies, a record amount. Deal activity picked up toward the end of this year, but not enough to make a significant dent in the backlog.\n\nContinuation vehicles are providing a short-term solution by allowing firms to sell the companies to themselves, book a paper gain and wait for interest rates to improve.\n\nPrivate equity firms have been turning to this strategy more frequently. The dollar value of continuation vehicles across the industry is expected to total $100 billion or more by the end of 2025, up from about $35 billion in 2019, according to the investment bank Evercore.\n\nPrivate equity is one of the biggest parts of the global economy, with more than $7 trillion in investors’ money, and some of those investors are getting increasingly worried that strategies like continuation vehicles are putting off a painful reckoning.\n\nPrivate equity firms say they are selling only their best-performing companies to continuation vehicles, which would yield big profits when the companies can eventually be sold to outside buyers.\n\nThe risk, investors say, is that the insular nature of these sales — where the private equity firm is both the buyer and seller — is leading to questionable valuations and unrealistic projections, leaving investors vulnerable to painful surprises.\n\nAt the gathering of pension managers and other Clearlake clients at the Monarch Hotel in 2022, the firm boasted about the success of Wheel Pros, an auto accessories retailer that it had sold to one of its continuation funds.\n\nThe company sells flashy hubcaps and other accessories for wheels, which were popular during the pandemic when consumers were flush with stimulus money and had time for do-it-yourself projects.\n\nTwo years after that gathering, in September 2024, Wheel Pros declared bankruptcy, because sales slowed after the pandemic. The company couldn’t keep up with its ballooning debt payments. Every investor, including public employees’ pension funds from New York, Connecticut and Nevada, was wiped out. (Connecticut and Nevada had previously sold out of some of their Wheel Pros stake.)\n\nClearlake Capital declined to make their executives available for an interview. In a 2023 podcast interview, José E. Feliciano, a founder of the firm, said it used continuation vehicles for “companies that were A-plus assets that we wouldn’t mind owning for a long time, maybe forever.” He added that it was also for companies that would need more time and investment to realize their full potential.\n\nPlatinum Equity, another firm, has struggled with its investment in United Site Services, which makes portable toilets. In 2021, Platinum Equity executives described the sale of United Site Services to a continuation fund it created as a “win-win.” Now, United Site Services is in the process of turning the company over to its lenders, and its investors are expected to lose all their money.\n\n“Continuation vehicles are indicative of rot in private equity,’’ said Marcus Frampton, chief investment officer of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, which manages $83 billion of the state’s money that is derived from oil revenues and distributed annually to Alaskans.\n\nThe increased use of these funds, he said, is one of the reasons the Alaska fund has scaled back investments with private equity firms. Mr. Frampton said the firms were shirking their purpose to create value through buying and selling companies. In 2021, the Alaska fund held 22 percent of its dollars in private equity firms. Now it holds about 17 percent.\n\nScott Ramsower, who oversees the private equity investments of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, a pension fund that manages roughly $229 billion, said there were inherent conflicts in continuation funds because a private equity firm is typically involved on both sides of the deal.\n\n“We’d be happier if a private equity firm never did any of these,” Mr. Ramsower said about continuation funds.\n\nThe private equity industry says there are no conflicts because the deals are independently vetted. First, a private equity firm’s largest investors must consent to selling a portfolio company to a continuation vehicle. Then, existing and new investors have a chance to scrutinize the company’s financials and decide whether to buy into a deal at a specific price tag. If the investors don’t see the upside for future returns for a specific company when it is finally sold to an outside buyer, the deal won’t move forward.\n\nBut some investors say this vetting process is not always transparent.\n\nThis month, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery claiming that Energy & Minerals Group, a private equity firm, was seeking to “reap a massive benefit for themselves” at the expense of their investors by selling a company into a continuation vehicle.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the firm tried to force the sovereign wealth funds and other investors to vote on the sale on short notice, provided different data to different investors and would not allow the investors to confer with each other about the deal.\n\nEnergy & Minerals Group did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNigel Dawn, global head of private capital advisory at Evercore, said that so far continuation fund bankruptcies were below the rates of traditional buyout funds, which hover between 5 and 10 percent.\n\nBut he said it was far too soon to say what returns will ultimately look like more broadly for these funds. “It’s still the early days,” he said.\n\nClearlake is one of the most frequent users of continuation funds, creating six of them since 2020.\n\nClearlake, which was founded by Mr. Feliciano and Behdad Eghbali, both billionaires, in 2006 and initially managed $182 million. Now they manage roughly $90 billion of investor money and recently said they would double that amount by buying another fund.\n\nClearlake bought Wheel Pros for about $420 million in 2018. As its new owners, Clearlake wanted to go big, pushing executives to buy up almost every competitor that made accessories for the wheels of cars and trucks, according to two people familiar with the firm’s thinking. By 2021, profits had jumped to over $200 million from about $50 million in 2018.\n\nEven though the I.P.O. market was strong in 2021, private equity firms often have to wait a few years after a company goes public to collect all their gains. Clearlake figured it could book an even bigger and immediate gain by putting Wheel Pros into a continuation vehicle that valued the business at $2.3 billion, more than four times the price Clearlake had paid just three years earlier, the two people said. As is typical in continuation funds, Clearlake gave its existing investors the chance to either cash out or roll their investment into the new fund.\n\nPennsylvania State Employees’ Retirement System was among the sellers, while state pensions for Connecticut and Nevada rolled some of their commitment into the new fund and New York rolled all of it.\n\nClearlake also brought in a new batch of investors, including other large private equity firms like Blackstone, Pantheon and ICG.\n\nWheel Pros’ senior managers took their own stock options — worth about $100 million — and put them into the new fund, the people said. Clearlake invested about $50 million of its partners’ profits, too, said another person familiar with the matter.\n\nOnce Clearlake moved Wheel Pros into the continuation vehicle and booked a profit, it added substantially more debt to the company, ratcheting up the financial pressure, according to internal company documents reviewed by The New York Times. The move came not long before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. Wheel Pros had some debt with an interest rate tied to government bond yields, and that also increased the company’s debt costs.\n\nClearlake’s continuation vehicles, known as Icon Partners I and II, reported strong annual returns of 49 percent and 56 percent on average through March 2025 since they were created in 2020 and 2021.\n\nBut Icon Partners III, which held Wheel Pros, was a total loss, and Icon Partners IV and V reported annualized returns of 2.7 percent and 10.1 percent from their creation in 2021 through the end of March.\n\nClearlake hasn’t yet sold or taken public any of the companies in the continuation funds, making a true measure of returns difficult to discern.\n\n“Private equity walks so much in the shadows,” said Yaron Nili, a professor of corporate law at Duke Law School who wrote a paper recently on continuation funds.\n\nBecause so many deals involve private equity firms buying from each other or from themselves, “it will be hard to distinguish between value-generating activities and just collecting and recollecting fees,’’ Mr. Nili said.\n\nSome firms are pushing out the sales timeline even further. This year, private equity firms including Accel-KKR have started selling their companies from one continuation vehicle to another.\n\nThe industry calls these new funds “CV-squared.”",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s assault on the city of Chicago began in September, and it claimed its first casualty quickly. As Reuters would later report, on September 12, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez dropped his kids off at their school in the suburb of Franklin Park on his way to his job at a diner on the northwest side. Villegas-Gonzalez had come to the United States in 2007 to flee the violence in his home state of Michoacán, Mexico—violence wrought by the Mexican government’s militarization of its drug war, a policy encouraged and funded by the United States. (In November, the mayor of the city of Uruapan was assassinated after calling for a crackdown on organized crime.)\n\nDescribed by friends and co-workers as kind and soft-spoken, Villegas-Gonzalez had two sons and met a woman from his hometown as he worked long hours in kitchens around the city.\n\nAfter he dropped off his sons on the morning of September 12, two Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers approached the 38-year-old in his car. He put the vehicle in reverse and attempted to flee. One officer continued to chase him on foot and eventually fired his weapon, striking Villegas-Gonzalez, who crashed into a delivery truck and was pronounced dead an hour later. Officials of the Department of Homeland Security would later say that Villegas-Gonzalez “drove his car at law enforcement officers,” a claim clearly refuted by surveillance video. DHS also claimed the officer who killed Villegas-Gonzalez had been struck and dragged by the car and feared for his life. That allegation is more difficult to confirm or refute—the officer is obscured by the car in the video. The officer was later treated for “minor” injuries.\n\nVillegas-Gonzalez had no criminal record. Over eight years, he had only a series of traffic citations for offenses like a broken taillight and driving without insurance. His most serious citation was for driving 30 miles per hour over the speed limit. In its press release laying out the ICE agents’ version of events, DHS referred to him as “a criminal illegal alien with a history of reckless driving.” The release included the striking line, “The illegal alien was pronounced dead.”\n\nIn the weeks that followed, immigration agents continued to arrest parents and nannies as they dropped off and picked up children from school, a tactic unheard of in prior administrations.\n\nVideos posted to social media showed ICE and Border Patrol agents pointing their guns at unarmed protesters, unnecessarily tackling children and elderly people, and shutting down streets and intersections as they extracted people from their cars. Agents tear-gassed entire neighborhoods, in some cases enveloping schools and even Chicago Police Department officers in clouds of chemical irritant. Videos showed federal officers engaging in Precision Immobilization Technique, or PIT, maneuvers to cut off fleeing vehicles, a dangerous tactic banned or limited by the Chicago Police Department and many other police agencies in the country. On at least three occasions, ICE officers violently pulled U.S. citizens from their cars and detained them, claiming the drivers had deliberately crashed into agents—despite video and witness accounts contradicting the officers’ narrative.\n\nAs October dragged on, the raids intensified. Toward the end of the month, immigration officers gassed a neighborhood just hours before a scheduled Halloween parade for children. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker asked the administration to pause the raids on Halloween night so Chicago kids could go trick-or-treating without fear of being gassed, witnessing traumatic arrests, or seeing their parents or caretakers apprehended and detained. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem refused, calling the request “shameful.” Activists in Los Angeles would later photograph immigration officers, in an especially galling display of cruelty, wearing Halloween masks depicting horror movie villains while conducting immigration raids. When the citizen journalism site L.A. Taco asked DHS for comment, a spokesperson replied, “Happy Halloween.”\n\nTrump has launched similar federal crackdowns in Los Angeles, Washington, Charlotte, Memphis, Minneapolis, and New Orleans, and threatened them in Baltimore, San Francisco, New York, and other cities. He has sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles and Memphis, and has promised to send more to other cities, along with active-duty troops. With astonishing speed, the administration has toppled the most cherished pillars of a free society. Masked secret police now tear-gas entire city streets, jump out from unmarked vehicles to abduct and detain suspected undocumented people, and demand that foreign-looking people (mostly Latino) produce papers on demand. These deportation forces have been told by the president and his advisers to cast a wide net, that immigrants are “animals,” that the activists defending them are “domestic terrorists,” and that the officers themselves have “immunity” from any form of accountability. Meanwhile, administration lawyers have brazenly lied to federal judges to supplement those deportation forces by deploying U.S. troops to the streets of American cities—seeking to break this country’s healthy antipathy toward domestic use of the military policing that dates back to the founding.\n\n“They’re assaulting basic democratic ideals on all fronts,” said Dana Marks, an immigration judge who retired in 2021. “It’s really just classic authoritarianism. It always starts with the minorities. It always starts with the immigrants. If we don’t stop them, it will be American citizens. Congress, the courts, the people, we should all be jumping up and down and screaming about this. We need to be screaming that this isn’t America—that this isn’t who we are.”\n\nI’ve been writing and reporting on policing in the United States for more than 20 years. I’ve spent much of that time writing about the effects of police militarization, or the way military weapons, training, uniforms, and culture have infiltrated domestic law enforcement agencies. But I’ve never seen anything quite like the last six months.\n\nWe’ve seen rapid normalization of abuses we once associated with authoritarian regimes or the old Iron Curtain countries. It’s now routine for masked, unidentifiable government agents to sweep people off the street and whisk them away in unmarked vehicles. Some of those arrested have been quickly shuttled off to detention facilities in other parts of the country without any notification to their families or attorneys. Others have been sent to a third country, often a country in the developing world to which they have no connection. Still others have been explicitly targeted for their political opinions, their activism, or their journalism.\n\nThe phrase “your papers, please” has historically been the sort of demand we associated with Hitler’s SS or the East German Stasi. Immigration officers now routinely stop people who simply “look like” immigrants and demand they prove their citizenship or legal residency. Legal residents who fail to produce documentation on demand have been fined, and flustered immigrants who fail to produce sufficient records or recall a Social Security number have been arrested.\n\nThe administration is also shredding due process. The United States government has extradited immigrants to a torture prison in a foreign country after lying to a judge, then falsely claimed it was helpless to get them back. Immigrants are now stacked in detention centers under already inhumane conditions that appear to be deteriorating. And in a brazen contravention of a principle ingrained in the American founding, the president and his aides have claimed the power to deploy active-duty troops in cities they allege have been overrun with migrants, crime, or homeless people—or merely those overseen by mayors or governors the administration dislikes.\n\nMost alarmingly, the administration no longer feels obligated to even pretend that it’s observing norms and constitutional restrictions. “They just don’t care when judges or the public says they’re violating the law,” one longtime immigration judge, now retired, told me. “That’s unheard of in my lifetime.”\n\nOver the last year, I’ve spoken to and met with immigration attorneys and advocates all over the country. Many who openly spoke with me prior to the 2024 election are no longer willing to be quoted, fearing retaliation against their organizations or their funders, or even against them personally.\n\nIn more recent months, I’ve also interviewed former ICE and Customs and Border Protection officials, and former Immigration Court judges who served across multiple administrations of both parties. Career legal and law enforcement officials tend to be circumspect in their critiques of fellow law enforcement officers. They tend to avoid casual references to police states, or comparing U.S. police agencies to those in authoritarian countries. That’s no longer the case. These career police executives and prosecutors now use language I’ve rarely heard from current or former government officials in my career.\n\n“What we’re seeing is a disgrace to policing,” said Reneé Hall, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, or NOBLE. Hall compares the tactics used by ICE and Border Protection officers to the worst abuses of the civil rights era. “We’ve made a lot of progress in policing,” she said. “They’ve wiped it out in months.… We’re back to letting police target people because of their skin color. We’re letting them kidnap people and take them to undisclosed locations. They’re barging into homes with no warrant. We saw them zip-tie young Black children—U.S. citizens—in Chicago. We’ve seen them use unnecessary force, slam people on the concrete. If I were just watching these incidents on television, I would think that we were not in the United States of America. Back then they wore hoods. Today they wear masks.”\n\n“I’m horrified by what I’ve seen,” said Chris Magnus, who served both as Joe Biden’s CBP commissioner and as police chief of Tucson, Fargo, and Richmond, California. “I wish the public had a better understanding of the harm they’re doing. Because it’s going to take a very long time to undo.”\n\n“I wish I had something better to say than that it’s really bad,” another former senior Department of Justice official told me. “But it’s really fucking bad.”\n\nThe new federal budget Trump recently signed into law will triple the ICE budget and significantly increase the budgets both for Border Protection and for the construction of new detention centers. Trump’s deportation force will be larger than all but a handful of foreign militaries. According to the Brennan Center, the 2025 budget for immigration enforcement already exceeds that of every other federal law enforcement agency combined. And going forward, spending from the “Big Beautiful Bill” on immigration alone will exceed total spending by every state and local police agency in the country.\n\nAnd if there’s one thing this administration has made clear, it’s this: What happened in Chicago will soon be happening in cities around the country.\n\nOne of the more maddening patterns playing out in the federal courts right now is the administration’s exploitation of a legal principle called “the presumption of regularity.” The legal doctrine instructs courts to presume that government lawyers argue in good faith and don’t deliberately misrepresent facts. The doctrine has rarely been a problem, because most administrations have argued in good faith, even when making bad arguments.\n\nThis administration is different. As of this writing, in the months since Trump’s second inauguration, the site Just Security has documented more than 60 instances in which federal courts have ruled that Justice Department attorneys misrepresented the facts or the law. Some judges have done so with unusually frank language, including accusing the administration of outright lying. One judge wrote, “Trust that had been earned over generations has been lost in weeks.”\n\nMany of Trump’s power grabs are grounded in “emergency powers” exceptions that Congress or the courts have built into constitutional or statutory restraints on executive power. These powers have always been a glitch in the system. Dozens of emergencies declared with good intentions at the time have lingered over the years, as new administrations simply renew them without much oversight from Congress. Many concern sanctions against international figures involved in crime, drug smuggling, or weapons trafficking.\n\nBut the current administration has exploited those exceptions like none before. Trump has declared nine new emergencies since January. His tariffs, for example, are based on a law allowing the president to temporarily impose tariffs in response to an emergency. But he has threatened and imposed tariffs for clearly illegal reasons, such as slapping sanctions on Brazil for prosecuting former President Jair Bolsonaro for an attempted coup, or on Canada for accurately using footage of former President Ronald Reagan in a TV commercial.\n\nThe presumption of regularity and the enormous deference the Supreme Court demands courts show to the executive branch mean that any challenge to one of these declarations faces an uphill battle to prove that the administration is misrepresenting the facts or acting in bad faith in each individual case, even though it has shown an almost routine willingness to lie in other cases. And nowhere is this disconnect more striking than in Trump’s obsession with putting troops in American cities.\n\nThe norm against using troops for routine law enforcement is one of America’s most important contributions to democratic governance. It’s a principle we came by honestly, from firsthand experience. Prior to the American Revolution, the British crown stationed soldiers in the streets of Boston to enforce tariffs and import taxes. The soldiers were armed with general warrants that gave them carte blanche to force their way into homes in search of contraband. The abuse of those powers sowed anger and ignited revolutionary fervor.\n\nLessons from Boston lingered after the Revolution and instilled in the Founders a deep distrust of standing armies. “A large standing Army in time of Peace hath ever been considered dangerous to the liberties of a Country,” George Washington wrote in 1783. Four years later, at the Constitutional Convention, James Madison cautioned, “A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty.”\n\nAfter fierce debate, the Framers of the Constitution reluctantly concluded that the threats posed to the new republic still demanded an army at the ready. But to guard against abuses, they divided control of the military between the executive and legislative branches. Still, the fears about domestically deployed troops spilled into the Bill of Rights debates the following year. It’s why we have a Second Amendment (the purpose of the state militia “is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty,” Elbridge Gerry declared), as well as the Third Amendment protection against the forced quartering of soldiers, and the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThis fear of domestically deployed troops has become ingrained in America’s DNA. Presidents have deployed active-duty troops within U.S. borders only sporadically, and almost always temporarily. The most common reason for doing so early in the republic was to put down labor uprisings, rebellions, and riots, and while there are legitimate reasons to question the motivations and propriety of those deployments, they were at least temporary and narrowly defined. The one exception was Reconstruction, which saw federal troops in Southern states for a decade. But that came after a bloody and destructive Civil War.\n\nIn fact, one of the healthier and most encouraging characteristics of American democracy is that this norm has only become more robust over time. One big reason—also a sign of a healthy democracy—is that the principle has become ingrained in the military itself.\n\nIn the late 1980s, for example, the Reagan administration wanted to deploy active-duty troops to fight the drug war on American streets. The plan was thwarted by opposition from the Pentagon. “One of [America’s] great strengths is that ... we do not allow the Army, Navy, and the Marines and Air Force to be a police force,” Marine Lt. Gen. Stephen Olmstead told Congress in 1989. “History is replete with countries that allowed that to happen. Disaster is the result.”\n\nPrior to Trump’s deployment of 700 Marines in Los Angeles in June, no president had deployed active-duty troops to a U.S. city since the Los Angeles riots in 1992. And no president had deployed the military over the objections of a state governor since Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to desegregate Little Rock’s public schools in 1957.\n\nThe deployment of National Guard troops is much more common. But that’s nearly always done by governors calling up their own Guard troops, sometimes to put down riots or protests, but more typically to aid with disaster response after hurricanes and tornadoes. Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles is the first time a president has deployed the Guard over the objections of a state governor since 1965.\n\nTrump is a well-documented admirer of dictators and strongmen and has made clear that he harbors little reverence for this firewall between the military and domestic policing. In his first term, Trump wanted to deploy troops to put down the George Floyd protests, if possible by “shooting them in the legs.” He was thwarted by more levelheaded senior staff, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley. Trump and his second term advisers have made clear that they won’t tolerate that sort of dissent this time around. To fully implement his vision for the country, they’d need to purge the federal government of institutionalists and those who put democratic values and the rule of law over subservience to the president. As JD Vance put it in a 2021 podcast interview, “Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.”\n\nTrump found his enforcer in Pete Hegseth, a man who is not only the least-qualified person ever nominated for secretary of defense, but whose record—which includes allegations of alcohol abuse and sexual assault and running two veterans’ nonprofits into the ground—should have been disqualifying. Trump really only had two prerequisites for the position. He wanted someone who loathed Pentagon institutionalists like Milley and Esper, and someone he could count on to be loyal. Here, Hegseth was more than qualified—embarrassingly so.\n\nHegseth has also echoed Trump’s contempt for the Pentagon’s healthier, democratically grounded principles. In his book, he has argued for enlisting the military in a modern-day crusade. And prior to 2025, other than his weekend co-hosting duties on Fox News, Hegseth was probably best known for lobbying Trump to pardon troops convicted of conscience-shocking war crimes.\n\nAfter his confirmation, Hegseth dutifully began purging the Pentagon of its Milleys and Espers. He dismissed dozens of senior officials with centuries of experience (particularly those who weren’t male and weren’t white). Importantly, he also purged senior-level Judge Advocate General’s Corps, or JAG, officers, the attorneys who provide legal guidance on critical issues like rules of engagement or, say, the legality of deploying troops in U.S. cities.\n\nThe administration has since been caught brazenly lying to federal courts to justify Trump’s military interventions. In Portland, Oregon, a Trump-appointed Federal District Court judge wrote that Trump and the DOJ’s claims that the city was “war ravaged” and “under siege” were “simply untethered to the facts.” The administration was later found to have vastly overstated to the court the number of federal officers it had sent to Portland to protect federal facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, in Chicago, a federal judge rejected the administration’s claims that the city was under “coordinated assault” by unnamed “violent groups … actively aligned with designated domestic terror organizations.” The judge chided the administration for its “lack of candor,” which, she wrote, “calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” and noted a “troubling trend” of DOJ officials “equating protests with riots.”\n\nThe most alarming images to emerge from the first year of Trump’s second term are those of immigration officers in balaclavas, gaiters, and ski masks stopping immigrants on sidewalks and demanding proof of citizenship, chasing day laborers and landscapers through parking lots and city streets, or emerging from unmarked vehicles, snatching people off the streets, then quickly carrying them away.\n\nThose unmarked vehicles are often rented, and officers have been caught swapping out license plates to prevent themselves from being identified—or just not bothering with license plates at all. “The agency clearly wants to appear like a ghost,” one former Baltimore ICE official told NPR. “I have never experienced this.”\n\n“When law enforcement officers of any kind wear masks and withhold their identity, it smacks of tactics that are consistent with an authoritarian government,” said Magnus, the ex-police chief and former head of Border Patrol.\n\n“We’ve had police here for two centuries,” said George Pappas, an immigration judge whom Trump’s Justice Department fired in July. “They didn’t need masks. You use masks when you’re looking to carry out an illegal, extrajudicial operation. This is straight from the fascist playbook.”\n\nThe images and videos of masked agents have provoked alarm in law enforcement and legal communities. They’ve been criticized by groups ranging from the New York City Bar Association to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Even the FBI has asked DHS to remove the masks, pointing out that criminals have committed robberies and sexual assaults while impersonating immigration officers.\n\nBut more to the point, masked secret police jumping out of vans to snatch people up and whisk them away isn’t supposed to happen in a free society. It’s the sort of thing we’ve cited to distinguish ourselves from military juntas or, more recently, from countries like Brazil or the Philippines, where masked officers have carried out horrific extrajudicial killings by the thousands. Or from Russia, where the spectacle of masked police carrying out illegal and undemocratic orders is common enough to have birthed the term “mask show.”\n\nThose distinctions are getting harder and harder to make. Trump has lavished praise on the current and former authoritarian leaders of all three countries, often specifically for their despotism. He praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte explicitly for his drug war policies, which even then were known to include sending masked police teams to execute thousands of drug offenders. Because of those killings, Duterte is now facing trial at the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nAnya Bidwell heads up the Project on Immunity and Accountability for the Institute for Justice, a libertarian law firm. IJ is currently representing two U.S. citizens who were wrongly arrested and detained by immigration officers. “I was born in what was part of the Soviet Union at the time,” she said. “So seeing these kinds of things chills me to the bone. It brings bad memories.”\n\nDHS officials have dismissed such comparisons as hysterical and hyperbolic. They say masking is necessary to prevent activists from “doxing” immigration officers and claim there has been an alarming surge in assaults on those officers. In June, they put the increase in assaults at 413 percent; by July, it was over 700 percent; and by October, it was over 1,000 percent.\n\nThose figures are deceptive. The 2024 baseline figure against which the administration is making these calculations is 10, according to Fox News. That is, there were 10 alleged assaults on ICE officers between January and June 2024. There were 79 in 2025. Meanwhile, over the same period, the number of federal agents participating in deportations and removals has swelled from 6,000 to over 30,000. That puts the assault rate on federal immigration officials (0.23 per 100) exponentially lower than the assault rate on police officers more generally (13.5).\n\nGiven the ramped-up immigration enforcement and the exceptionally violent and aggressive tactics, we’d expect to see an increase in assaults on agents. More interactions, and more violent interactions, mean more opportunities for those interactions to escalate. We also know from surveillance and cell phone videos that agents have arrested and charged people with assault either on little evidence or for defending themselves when assaulted by police. After an ICE officer shot a Chicago woman named Marimar Martinez five times, for example, the administration claimed she had intentionally boxed agents in with her car and fired a gun at them. She was arrested and charged with assault. After that account was contradicted by witnesses and video, Martinez was released without charges.\n\n“The mask issue really burns my biscuits,” said Reneé Hall. “I patrolled in the city of Detroit for nearly 20 years. I lived in the place that I policed. I didn’t get to hide my face. And you know what? Every other police officer across this country arresting people for drugs, for violent criminal acts, for gang violence, show their faces, too. My father was a police officer who was killed on duty. He never would have dreamed of hiding his face from the people he served. These federal officers are coming into these communities from other places, hiding their faces, using unnecessary force and violence, and then just walking away. That isn’t how it works. Hell no to that.”\n\nThere are, of course, limited circumstances in which it may be justified for police officers to shield their identities—officers who investigate organized crime, for example, or who frequently work undercover. So there are no federal laws that prohibit it. But the most important reason U.S. police don’t wear masks isn’t grounded in the law, but in democratic values. “I find the masking absolutely fucking horrific,” said “Bryan,” a former high-ranking official in the DOJ. “It’s not something we do in a free society. It’s what they do under regimes we should never be emulating. It’s about intimidating and terrorizing.”\n\nThat shared understanding has broken down under an administration that seems to emulate those regimes, and that has made clear that it wants to instill fear and terror in immigrant communities. They aren’t letting federal immigration agents terrorize neighborhoods like Chicago’s Little Village because terrifying these places makes them safer. They’re doing it because they don’t believe neighborhoods like Little Village should exist. “The president’s goal is to create fear and anxiety,” said Michael Rodriguez, an alderman whose district includes the heavily Mexican American neighborhood. “It’s a sinister agenda to relitigate the Civil War. I don’t think that’s vitriol. This country is becoming majority minority, and they can’t handle that. So they’re turning to xenophobia to reverse the trend.”\n\nOne needn’t look far to validate Rodriguez’s fears. Stephen Miller, who has been traipsing about the fever swamps of white nationalism for years, has made it no secret that he wants to reduce immigration from nonwhite countries to zero. Trump has echoed the sentiment, bemoaning at one point why so many immigrants come from “shithole countries” (the countries he’s named have all been predominantly Black and brown), and so few from countries like Norway or Switzerland. It’s now been widely reported that by the end of Trump’s second term, the bulk of the country’s refugee program will be redirected to aid white farmers from South Africa.\n\nThe most basic definition of a police state is a society in which the police themselves are above the law. In 2024, Donald Trump campaigned on promises to make police officers completely immune from both criminal prosecution and civil liability. Whether a president could actually do that isn’t as important as the fact that a major party’s nominee for president was, quite literally, promising to turn the country into a police state. And then he won.\n\nThe United States has long had a problem with holding bad cops accountable, and, to be fair, much of that problem predates Donald Trump. The George Floyd protests in 2020 provoked public discussion about qualified immunity, a legal doctrine wholly invented by the Supreme Court in 1967 that makes it extremely difficult to sue state and local police for abuses that violate the Constitution.\n\nLess discussed is that it’s even more difficult—all but impossible, really—to sue federal law enforcement officers. For years, the only real avenue to do so was through the precedent set in the 1971 Supreme Court case Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents. But the court has been gradually chipping away at that case ever since and all but overturned it in 2022. There is one remaining, far more complicated law, the Federal Tort Claims Act, which lets people sue federal police officers, but to sue under that law is an immensely complicated process. The law also bars punitive damages, and it, too, is being eroded by the federal courts.\n\n“People ask me questions like ‘Is it constitutional for them to wear masks?’ or ‘Can they really detain U.S. citizens incommunicado?’ or ‘Is it really legal for them to scare children like that?’” said Bidwell, the IJ attorney. “The answer is that it doesn’t matter if what they do is legal. Because they know that fundamentally they can’t be sued, either as the government itself or individually.”\n\nSo while the administration sets arrest and deportation quotas, attacks immigrants with dehumanizing rhetoric, and tells immigration officers that they’ve been “unleashed,” Bidwell said, there’s nothing pushing back to keep deportation forces in line. “There’s no incentive for these officers to act in a cautious manner that’s compliant with the Constitution.”\n\n“Back when I worked for ICE, there would occasionally be times when they’d inadvertently arrest or detain an American citizen or legal resident,” said Javad Khazaeli, who was an immigration prosecutor during the Obama administration and now works as an immigration defense attorney. (Disclosure: Khazaeli is also a friend.) “When that happened, it would be all hands on deck. It was like, OK, what went wrong here and how do we fix it? Now there’s nothing like that. Now they just don’t care.”\n\nThe immunity problem pervades the chain of command from top to bottom. Thanks to a spate of Supreme Court rulings from the case that all but killed Bivens, to rulings protecting political appointees for policy decisions, to the Supreme Court’s infamous ruling on presidential immunity, everyone is protected, from the Border Patrol officer who abandons a baby in the back seat of a car after detaining his immigrant parents (as happened in a suburb of Chicago) to the Border Patrol commander who tear-gasses elementary schools, to the president who says immigrants are “poisoning the blood of the country.”\n\nThat leaves only criminal liability. It seems unlikely that Trump’s DOJ would ever prosecute an immigration officer, even for egregious abuses. Some have suggested that local police and prosecutors arrest and charge Border Patrol agents caught committing clear crimes, or that states pass laws prohibiting masking by law enforcement, and then arrest officers who violate it. But state and local charges against federal police are almost always removed to federal court, at which point the Trump administration would presumably take over the prosecution and drop the charges. There may be some value in bringing charges anyway to force the issue and draw public attention to these abuses. But they aren’t likely to bring much accountability. It’s yet another policy that, while in place over multiple administrations, could be particularly destructive in the hands of an administration so averse to the rule of law.\n\nIn the end, this administration has exposed how the Supreme Court has made the Bill of Rights almost entirely reliant on the executive branch’s willingness to police itself. If federal police officers can violate constitutional rights with impunity, those rights may as well not exist.\n\nTrump’s immigration agents are erasing accountability in other ways, too. They’re specifically targeting journalists who report on their actions. In Chicago, they tackled and arrested a WGN producer, claiming she threw something at ICE officers—an allegation that was disputed by witnesses. She was later released without charges. In June, the administration arrested an immigrant journalist in Georgia who had been reporting on immigration raids. At his deportation hearing, DOJ lawyers explicitly argued that his journalism was a threat to public safety. He has since been deported. In Los Angeles, immigration officers shot a citizen journalist who had built an online following for streaming ICE raids. They claim he rammed his vehicle into theirs. He was arrested for assaulting a federal officer. In Texas, another freelance journalist and DACA recipient had his status revoked and was arrested for “glorifying terrorism” over social media posts after he advocated at a city council meeting for a Muslim man who had recently been detained.\n\nShortly after the raids on Home Depot parking lots and car washes began in L.A., civil and immigration rights groups filed a lawsuit accusing the administration of racially profiling Latino people. Notably, a federal judge ordered the government to stop, and arrests dropped dramatically. The Supreme Court eventually ordered a pause on that temporary restraining order, allowing raids and stops based on skin color, language, and presence in areas where immigrants live and work to continue.\n\nThere was no majority opinion, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that people who are in the country illegally have no right not to be racially profiled. As for U.S. citizens or legal residents, Kavanaugh wrote, once immigration officials establish legal status, “they promptly let the individual go.”\n\nIn a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that Kavanaugh’s “concurrence improperly shifts the burden onto an entire class of citizens to carry enough documentation to prove that they deserve to walk freely.” It effectively made anyone who “looks immigrant” into a second-class citizen.\n\nKavanaugh added that if immigration officers violate other rights of citizens or legal residents, such as by using excessive force or not “promptly letting that individual go,” those people could always sue. It had been just three years since Kavanaugh joined the majority in all but overturning Bivens, effectively shutting down the right to sue federal law enforcement.\n\nKavanaugh’s claim that citizens and legal residents would simply be “let go” hasn’t held up. About a month after the ruling on racial profiling, ProPublica published a report documenting 170 cases in which immigration officers had detained U.S. citizens. The publication found 130 cases in which U.S. citizens had been arrested for allegedly interfering with immigration operations or assaulting officers but were often never charged. It found over 20 cases in which U.S. citizens were held for more than a day without being permitted to contact an attorney or their families. “Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents,” the publication wrote. “They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem watched.” More recently, immigration officers stopped a Latino U.S. citizen in Los Angeles during a raid on a Home Depot. They arrested the man for an alleged assault and weapons violation, then drove off in his vehicle with the man’s one-year-old daughter still in the back seat. All of this in just the first 10 months of the new administration.\n\n“This version of the Trump administration is a stress test for the United States,” said Bidwell. “They’re very good at identifying cracks in the system, then working at those cracks to widen them. These gaps in accountability for federal police have been around for a long time. We’re going to see how bad it can get when those gaps are exploited by an administration with no respect for constitutional restraints.”\n\nIn a different world, immigration judges might be a check on all this abuse by immigration officers. But that isn’t the world we’re inhabiting. Despite their name, immigration courts have always operated within the executive branch, not the judicial, so they lack the independence of federal courts. Still, previous administrations mostly just tinkered with these courts at the margins, replacing judges as necessary with judges \n\nThe following month, the firings began. Since February, DOJ has fired at least 98 immigration judges, and another 55 or so left voluntarily after seeing the writing on the wall. “Amanda” was one of the first judges fired in February. “I was never told why I was let go,” she said. “A lot of people were shocked. I don’t think anyone would have described me as a liberal judge. I’m a former immigration prosecutor. The feeling was that if they’d fire someone like me, no one was safe. Which is probably the message DOJ wanted to send.”\n\nAmanda said there was one incident in her record, when she worked for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, that may have flagged Trump’s DOJ. “I was once reported for engaging in ‘illegal DEI,’” she said. “One of the individuals I supervised moved the seating arrangements for African American staff to the same undesirable hallway, causing staff to refer to that hall as ‘Jim Crow Row.’ I told her she had to stop doing that. When this new administration called for reporting of ‘illegal DEI,’ the staff member forwarded an email to me to notify me that she had reported me. Maybe that’s why I was fired. But my termination notice was a few sentences long. So who knows.”\n\nIn October, the DOJ announced that it would begin appointing military lawyers from the JAG Corps to serve as temporary immigration judges—the officers who had survived Hegseth’s purge. The move has been widely derided in the legal community as an effort to turn the courts into little more than a rubber stamp for the administration. “Immigration law is incredibly complicated,” Pappas said. “There’s just no way you’re going to be able to pick it up in a matter of weeks and treat these cases with the judgment and care they require.”\n\nThe most immediate effect of the administration’s politicization of immigration courts will be in denials of asylum claims and in expedited removal orders and deportations. “Immigration courts are like litigating death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” said Marks, the longtime immigration judge who retired in 2021. “When you deny asylum to someone, there’s a real possibility that person will turn up dead after they’re deported.”\n\nTrump has also purged the board that hears immigration appeals and replaced those members with his own appointees. The new, Trump-friendly version of the board then announced that judges could no longer order bond for anyone in the country illegally. That decision—which has been roundly rejected when challenged in federal courts—potentially means millions more people in federal detention, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating.\n\nThis, too, is all part of the plan. Miller, Tom Homan, and the architects of the child separation policy during Trump’s first term have made clear that one goal of their immigration policy is to disincentivize people from coming to the United States by inflicting suffering on those who do. One way to make people suffer is to take away their children. Another is to stuff them into overcrowded cells, deny them access to a shower, medication, and clean food and water, and make it all but impossible for them to contact their families or attorneys. Human rights groups have already documented these and other inhumane conditions at detention facilities all over the country, including at brand new centers like “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida.\n\nWhen Trump took office in January 2025, there were 39,000 people in ICE custody. By September, there were more than 60,000, and there will be capacity for around 107,000 by January 2026. As of this writing, 23 people have died this year in ICE custody. That’s the most since 2005, and more than the previous three years combined. The conditions faced by those in custody are only likely to get worse as deportation efforts continue to ramp up.\n\nAt the same time, the administration has hollowed out the offices within DHS and DOJ that oversee detention facilities. “There’s no oversight. There’s no reporting. There’s no access,” said “Dan,” a longtime former DHS employee and immigration prosecutor. “Until this administration, if a lawyer or an NGO complained about inhumane conditions, that was something we took very seriously. Now they just don’t care. It’s fully part of the plan. They’re open about it. You put people in detention, deny them access to a lawyer, and just continue to squeeze them until they’re so miserable that they give up their rights.”\n\nIn the midst of all of this, the Pentagon began engaging in this administration’s most egregious and brazen breach of due process to date: bombing boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, off the coasts of Colombia and Venezuela. The Pentagon claimed the occupants of the boats were “narco-terrorists,” but provided no evidence to support the accusation—nor would it be justified to kill them if they were. Smuggling drugs is not a capital crime in the United States. It also seems unlikely that most of the boats were bound for the United States, and neither Colombia nor Venezuela produces or exports significant quantities of fentanyl, the drug most responsible for overdose deaths in America.\n\nThe strikes are illegal, under both domestic and international law. The United States is not engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels, drug cartels are not terrorists or enemy combatants, and the administration has provided no evidence beyond its say-so that the people it has killed fit into any of those categories. The administration later conceded that it doesn’t actually know the identities of the people it is killing, but that it would be legally justified to kill anyone who is “as much as three hops away from a known member” of a designated terrorist organization. Setting aside the fact that, again, drug cartels are not terrorist groups, sociological studies estimate that the average person knows about 600 people. This means that under the “three-hop rule,” which allows authorities to pursue individuals three “hops” away from the target, each member of a terrorist group would make about 216 million people eligible for legal assassination by the U.S. government.\n\nAs of publication, the administration had killed more than 83 people in 21 strikes. The strikes embody Trump’s most authoritarian instincts—unchecked and unreviewable executive power; crass imperialism; a feverish, 1980s-era approach to illicit drugs (Trump has frequently said that drug dealers should be executed); and xenophobic bigotry, particularly toward the developing world. Both Trump and Vice President Vance have even joked about the possibility that the strikes may have killed innocent people, delivering wry bons mots about how Caribbean fishermen probably don’t go out on the water much anymore.\n\nThe strikes are abominable, reckless acts of violence in and of themselves. But it isn’t difficult to envision how an administration with so little regard for law, human life, and due process might make the leap to think it can also carry out extrajudicial executions inside the United States, particularly one run by a president who equates criticism of him with treason, likens immigrants to vermin, and calls his opponents “the enemy within.” This, after all, is an administration already trying to legally define peaceful protesters and their supporters as “terrorists,” the same term it uses to justify those extrajudicial killings.\n\nThere would certainly be far more popular and political backlash to such strikes within U.S. borders, or against U.S. citizens. But public opinion isn’t a dependable bulwark against an administration that has anointed itself judge, jury, and executioner. It’s of little comfort in the throes of an administration that believes it can kill on demand, regardless of domestic or international law, and feels no obligation to justify its decision to do so to Congress, the courts, or the public.\n\nPerhaps that sounds overwrought. But if you had suggested in 2024 that if elected, the Republican candidate for president would instruct federal police to sweep immigrants off the street—some of whom were here legally, and most of whom had no prior criminal record—put them on airplanes, and send them to a Central American gulag, all without ever letting them speak to a judge, you’d also have been called overwrought. But it is happening.\n\nIf you had suggested 10 years ago that federal agencies would use Nazi, fascist, and white nationalist iconography and allude to explicitly white supremacist literature in their social media posts, or that the Department of Homeland Security would use nativist, blood-and-soil messaging about preserving Western heritage in its outreach to recruit new immigration officers, you’d also have been called overwrought. But this, too, is happening.\n\nIf you had suggested during the Obama era that a U.S. president would encourage a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol in order to prevent his successor from taking office, that said president would then be reelected, would pardon all of the insurrectionists, and then go about erasing that history from official records, you’d also have been called overwrought. But Trump has done all these things.\n\nDuring the week I finished this story, a federal judge ruled that the conditions at the main immigration detention facility in Chicago were “inhumane.” U.S. District Court Judge Robert Gettleman found that prisoners were being forced to sleep on top of one another, slept next to overflowing toilets, were provided with no beds or access to showers, didn’t have adequate food or medicine, and were forced to drink water that “tasted like sewer.”\n\nThe following day, in a separate lawsuit, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis ruled that federal immigration officers in the city were using levels of force that “shocks the conscience.” She found that Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and other government agents had lied to her in court proceedings. In an impassioned opinion, Ellis mounted an eloquent defense of both the city of Chicago and American values, quoting Carl Sandburg and John Adams. She also ruled that federal forces were deliberately undermining free speech by detaining and beating protesters. “The freedom of speech is a principal pillar in a free Government,” she wrote, quoting Benjamin Franklin, “when this support is taken away the Constitution is dissolved, and Tyranny is erected on its Ruins.”\n\nThe next day, Bovino and his agents were back in Little Village, clashing with protesters. In the days that followed, they dragged a day care teacher out of her school as she screamed, used tear gas on large groups of protesters, and pepper-sprayed a one-year-old (they denied at least the pepper-spraying of the infant). Later, Bovino and his agents posed in front of Cloud Gate, the iconic sculpture more commonly called the Bean. According to local reports, the officers shouted out “Little Village!” as they mugged for a group selfie.\n\nJust a few days before Ellis’s ruling, in a prime-time interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, President Trump was asked if in tear-gassing entire neighborhoods, beating U.S. citizens, terrorizing children, and lying to federal courts—if given all of that—he thought that perhaps his deportation force in Chicago may have gone too far.\n\nHe answered, “I don’t think they’ve gone far enough.”",

    "description": "Why powerful AI might arrive sooner than we think",
    "fullText": "Dwarkesh Patel recently published a compelling essay arguing that today's AI systems are still many years away from AGI. His core view is that they are missing key components of cognition, most importantly true continual learning. Despite impressive benchmark performance, current models aren't yet economically transformative because they can't learn on the job the way humans do. Instead, labs are \"pre-baking\" skills into models using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), constructing bespoke training environments for coding, Excel, browser navigation, and countless other narrow tasks. To Dwarkesh, this reveals a fundamental limitation. As he puts it, \"Human workers are valuable precisely because we don't need to build schleppy training loops for every small part of their job.\"\n\nIt's a persuasive argument. But the question I keep coming back to is: is the elegant solution a hard requirement or can we sort of duct tape our way to AGI?\n\nConsider Deep Blue. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in a six-game chess match that captivated the world. Deep Blue did not understand chess in any human sense. It had no intuition, no internalized strategy, no aesthetic judgment. It simply evaluated millions of positions per second and searched deeper than any human could. One move in Game 2 unsettled Kasparov so badly that he accused IBM of cheating; it felt too creative, too human. But it was nothing of the sort. It was brute force, systematically exploring the possibility space. Twenty years later, AlphaZero learned through self-play, developing a fluid, intuitive style that grandmasters described as alien yet beautiful. AlphaZero played chess the \"right\" way. Both systems accomplished the goal of playing chess better than humans, but Deep Blue got there first. The ugly solution won.\n\nAre we in a similar situation today?\n\nDwarkesh looks at the current AI landscape and sees missing categories of cognition. Labs are painstakingly constructing verification environments for individual skills, and to him this is evidence that models lack genuine generalization. Real jobs, he argues, consist of hundreds of small, shifting tasks that vary from day to day, even for the same person. You can't automate them with predefined skill sets. In a way he's recapitulating the old expert systems vs learning systems debate. Manually coding how to behave was too brittle, so it never worked.\n\nInterestingly, his view does stand in contrast to many lab leaders. A skeptical reader will surely argue that's because they have a strong incentive to exaggerate the pace of progress, but for the purposes of this discussion, let's take their statements at face value. Dario Amodei believes the current paradigm will get us there, predicting powerful AI as early as 2026. Sam Altman and Jakub Pachocki have offered concrete timelines, an intern-level AI researcher by late 2026 and a fully automated one by 2028, backed by over a trillion dollars in infrastructure commitments. Mark Chen, OpenAI's Chief Research Officer, has pushed back on the idea that scaling is exhausted, hinting that they have made some important breakthroughs in pretraining specifically.\n\nThis perspective is not unanimous. Demis Hassabis believes additional breakthroughs are needed on the level of the transformer, and Andrej Karpathy estimates something like a decade. This camp tends to be more neuroscience-inspired, believing the current architectures are missing something fundamental.\n\nSo what's the actual bottleneck?\n\nDwarkesh's argument largely boils down to three problems all related to memory. First, current models are sample inefficient—they need far more examples to learn something than a human would. Second, what they learn isn't general enough to transfer across contexts. Third, they can't continue to learn on the job the way humans do.\n\nThis last problem is intrinsic to how gradient descent works. When a model learns, it adjusts billions of parameters at once, a global update that touches the entire network. This makes the system brittle; new information can overwrite old information, a problem called catastrophic forgetting. So today’s models come with a frozen pretrained brain and rely on stuffing relevant information into each prompt, called a context window. These are crude substitutes. Everything must be reprocessed with every response. There's no dynamic working memory, no graceful fading of irrelevant information, no seamless integration with long-term storage.\n\nThis matters for a number of reasons. Without the ability to integrate new information into its world model, it can only grasp new tasks superficially. It can't build on what it learned yesterday. Models struggle to navigate complex software because they can't track things the way you do. Photoshop is intuitive to an experienced user, but to a model with fragmented memory, every menu is half-familiar, every action a guess. These aren't signs of low intelligence. They're signs of a specific limitation, not dissimilar to a human disability. Blindness or deafness will make some tasks virtually impossible, but this says nothing about their underlying intelligence. Similarly, a model can be extraordinarily capable and still fail at tasks that require persistent memory.\n\nAll of this is accurate. The open question is whether it represents a hard scientific boundary or is just a matter of iterative engineering.\n\nHuman memory itself is not a single, elegant system. It's a collection of specialized mechanisms layered together by evolution. Most day-to-day learning does not instantly integrate deeply into the brain. It involves holding information in working memory, encoding episodes, retrieving associations, and slowly consolidating over time.\n\nSeen this way, perhaps the models aren't so far from functional equivalence after all. Retrieval over long interaction histories so a system remembers what you discussed weeks ago. Persistent preference and project files injected into context. Lightweight fine-tuning methods like LoRA applied periodically rather than continuously. External memory via tool use, where models write notes to themselves and read them back. Better working-memory mechanisms layered on top of existing architectures. None of this requires brand-new science, and much of it already exists in partial form.\n\nThese solutions are undeniably schleppy. They are brittle and can fail in surprising ways. Skeptics rightly point out that unlike chess, which is a closed system with perfect information, the real world is an open environment where errors can compound. That's all true, but we are no longer discussing hypotheticals. People are already using these systems for real work. Coding agents are writing and debugging software semi-autonomously. Customer service systems are starting to handle basic help desk queries. Legal research can often be handled end to end by an extended thinking model. There's still a capability gap, but it is shrinking.\n\nIt's important to recognize that 2025 was less a year of huge new models than one of bringing the frontier to everyone at a reasonable cost. That infrastructure buildout absorbed resources that might otherwise have gone toward pushing capabilities. If progress has felt slower than expected, this is part of the reason. It's easy to anchor on the current pace and assume it's the new normal. That would be a mistake.\n\nThe hardware trajectory is significant. Nvidia’s GB300 NVL72 racks use 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs acting as a single massive unit. Microsoft has announced the first large-scale production cluster with over 4,600 of these racks, claiming it will enable training models with hundreds of trillions of parameters and reduce training times from months to weeks. Depending on workload, this represents anywhere from a 4x improvement in training speed to a 10x reduction in inference costs compared to the previous generation. When you can throw an order of magnitude more compute at context management, retrieval, and verification, many of today's clumsy workarounds start to look far more viable.\n\nWe do need solutions to memory and some degree of continual learning, but Dwarkesh may also be understating how much current models already generalize. No one built a special training pipeline for GeoGuessr, yet general models can perform at a borderline superhuman level. This requires inferring the geographic location of pictures from subtle cues like vegetation, signage, architecture, and sun angle. And long before job-specific reinforcement learning was used, models already showed remarkable capability across many professions, just from compressing the internet.\n\nThe labs' heavy investment in RLVR could be viewed less like a confession of architectural inadequacy and more like a pragmatic choice. RLVR improves effectiveness on tasks that matter commercially. It simply juices the value of current models.\n\nThe benchmark, OSWorld, provides a useful case in point of my argument. This benchmark tests models on everyday computer tasks in a virtual machine: adding page numbers to a document, exporting a CSV from a spreadsheet, configuring browser settings. Over the past year, success rates have climbed from under 10% to over 60%, approaching the human baseline of 72%. But a closer look reveals something interesting: much of this progress comes from models finding workarounds. About 15% of tasks can be completed using only terminal commands, no GUI required. Another 30% can be largely solved with Python scripts instead of clicking through menus. The benchmark was designed to measure GUI manipulation, something models are known to struggle with, but instead of failing, they just found a workaround.\n\nThis discussion largely hinges on how far these workarounds can ultimately go. The debate isn't about whether human-like continual learning would be powerful. It would be. It's about what exactly is required to cross the human threshold of reliable knowledge work. History suggests that inelegant, resource-intensive solutions arrive first, especially when the incentives are overwhelming.\n\nRay Kurzweil's long-running prediction of human-level AI by 2029 is relevant here. Kurzweil's track record on specific technologies is mixed, but he has been remarkably prescient about the pace and magnitude of technological progress. His law of accelerating returns is all about markets. Computing power compounds due to incentives and what’s allowed by physics. Capital, talent, and institutional effort then develop new technologies enabled by that compute.\n\nHumans are best understood as what E.O. Wilson called a “superorganism,” similar to ants or termites. We cooperate at an unprecedented scale. And this global superorganism has slowly been turning itself toward the production of machine intelligence ever since ChatGPT arrived in late 2022. Nation-states, corporations, supply chains, research communities, and capital markets are all aligning around the same attractor. This applies immense pressure to each barrier to progress.\n\nIf the current paradigm fails to reach AGI, it will be because continual learning turns out to be a hard scientific barrier rather than an engineering challenge. But given the scale of investment, the pace of hardware progress, and the growing stack of workable approximations, I'd bet on the engineers.\n\nIt's unclear when we will get the elegant, human-like mind we are waiting for. But if history is any guide, that distinction may not matter much. When Deep Blue won, Kasparov felt it was a trick. He sensed a human creativity that simply wasn't there and accused IBM of cheating. We are likely walking into the same psychological trap. We will look at these schleppy, duct-taped systems and insist they are just parroting data or faking reasoning. We will call it a parlor trick right up until the moment it outperforms us. At that point, like Kasparov, we will have to accept that the mechanism matters less than the move.",

    "description": "AI chatbots are generating fake titles that people insist are real.",
    "fullText": "Everyone knows that AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini can often hallucinate sources. But for the folks tasked with helping the public find books and journal articles, the fake AI bullshit is really taking its toll. Librarians sound absolutely exhausted by the requests for titles that don’t exist, according to a new post from Scientific American.\n\nThe magazine spoke with Sarah Falls, the chief of researcher engagement at the Library of Virginia, who estimates that about 15% of all emailed reference questions that they receive are generated by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. And the requests often include questions about fake citations.\n\nWhat’s more, Falls suggests that people don’t seem to believe librarians when they explain that a given record doesn’t exist, a trend that’s been reported elsewhere like 404 Media. Many people really believe their stupid chatbot over a human who specializes in finding reliable information day in and day out.\n\nA recent post from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) titled, “Important notice: AI generated archival reference,” provides more evidence that librarians are just exhausted with it all.\n\n“If a reference cannot be found, this does not mean that the ICRC is withholding information. Various situations may explain this, including incomplete citations, documents preserved in other institutions, or— increasingly—AI-generated hallucinations,” the organization said. “In such cases, you may need to look into the administrative history of the reference to determine whether it corresponds to a genuine archival source.”\n\nYes it happened to me 🫠, I went to a bookstore for a totally plausible old French metaphor book mentioned by ChatGPT a year ago, only to discover that it does not exist.\n\n— Joanne Boisson (@joanneboisson.bsky.social) December 9, 2025 at 4:31 AM\n\nThe year seems to have been filled with examples of fake books and journal articles created with AI. A freelance writer for the Chicago Sun-Times generated a summer reading list for the newspaper with 15 books to recommend. But ten of the books didn’t exist. The first report from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s so-called Make America Healthy Again commission was released in May. A week later, reporters at NOTUS published their findings after going through all of the citations. At least seven didn’t exist.\n\nYou can’t blame everything on AI. Papers have been retracted for giving fake citations since long before ChatGPT or any other chatbot came on the scene. Back in 2017, a professor at Middlesex University found at least 400 papers citing a non-existent research paper that was essentially the equivalent of filler text.\n\nVan der Geer, J., Hanraads, J.A.J., Lupton, R.A., 2010. The art of writing a scientific article. J Sci. Commun. 163 (2) 51-59.\n\nIt’s gibberish, of course. The citation seems to have been included in many lower quality papers—likely due to laziness and sloppiness rather than an intent to deceive. But it’s a safe bet that any authors of those pre-AI papers would have probably been embarrassed about their inclusion. The thing about AI tools is that too many humans have come to believe our chatbots are more trustworthy than humans.\n\nAs someone who gets lots of local history queries, can confirm there’s been a big increase in people starting their history research with GenAI/LLM (which just spews out fake facts and hallucinated rubbish) who then wonder why they can’t find anything at all to corroborate it.\n\n— Huddersfield Exposed (@huddersfield.exposed) December 9, 2025 at 2:28 AM\n\nWhy might users trust their AI over humans? For one thing, part of the magic trick that AI pulls is speaking in an authoritative voice. Who are you going to believe, the chatbot you’re using all day or some random librarian on the phone? The other problem might have something to do with the fact that people develop what they believe are reliable tricks for making AI more reliable.\n\nSome people even think that adding things like “don’t hallucinate” and “write clean code” to their prompt will make sure their AI only gives the highest quality output. If that actually worked, we imagine companies like Google and OpenAI would just add that to every prompt for you. If it does work, boy, have we got a lifehack for all the tech companies currently terrified of the AI bubble bursting.",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI - Japanese-themed manga and anime have been barred from one of China's largest comic conventions about a week before the show begins in late December, Hong Kong media reported, amid a continuing diplomatic row between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe decision was notified to participants last Friday ahead of the two-day Comicup convention scheduled to be held next weekend in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou near Shanghai, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nExhibitors and visitors were informed by the event's organizers that there would be a \"full-scale adjustment\" of content toward \"a new Chinese style\" theme across the venue due to the \"current social environment and our cultural obligations,\" the Hong Kong newspaper said Tuesday.\n\nThe exhibition areas themed around American and European content did not seem to be affected at the event featuring some 7,000 booths, which has become a massive marketplace for creators of derivative works based on various anime, comics, and game fan groups, according to the report.\n\nWhile the notification did not name Japan, several dozen exhibitors featuring Japanese anime and other themed content said on social media that their booths had been cancelled for reasons \"well-known to all\" and \"factors beyond control,\" the SCMP said.\n\nA similar comic convention held in Shanghai in October drew hundreds of thousands of visitors. The paper quoted a woman whose booth was supposed to have featured artwork of the Japanese manga \"Let's Go Karaoke!\" as saying, \"I am feeling utterly helpless and sad.\"\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the two Asian neighbors stems from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's parliamentary remarks last month that suggested an attack on Taiwan could constitute a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Japan, prompting possible involvement of the Self-Defense Forces.\n\nBeijing has since ramped up its retaliatory measures, including urging its citizens not to visit Japan, suspending seafood imports from the neighboring country and canceling cultural events featuring Japanese artists.\n\nMeanwhile, manga and animation events scheduled for January in such Chinese cities as Shenzhen in Guangdong Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were postponed due to \"force majeure,\" according to organizers.",

U.S. District Judge Anne M.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

    "fullText": "Bernice King, the daughter of late civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., is pushing back against Vice President JD Vance’s comments surrounding white privilege in the U.S.\n\nKing sounded off on social media, writing, “@ JDVance Help me with this. In my 62 years, I don’t recall white people ever having to apologize for being white in America. The courage to tell the truth about the advantages white people have had in this country is the real issue.”\n\n“It’s time to stop reframing accountability as injury and start reckoning honestly with history, power, and responsibility—so we can move toward repair justice, and a shared future where dignity is not selective,” she added.\n\nVance: In the United States of America, you don't have to apologize for being white anymore. pic.twitter.com/QikIDkXNy5\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 21, 2025\n\nOver the weekend, Turning Point USA, or AmFest 2025, took place for the first time since Charlie Kirk‘s assassination on Sept. 10, 2025. In his speech, Vance encouraged people to join ICE, but it’s his comments about white privilege that folks can’t stop talking about.\n\n“In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore,” Vance told the crowd.\n\nUnsurprisingly, countless people, including rapper Ice Cube’s son, O’Shea Jackson Jr., who co-hosts the No Contest Wrestling podcast, slammed Vance for his remarks.\n\n“When the f**k did you have to?” Jackson wrote on X.\n\n“When JD Vance declares that white people no longer have to apologize for being white, what he’s truly signaling is a license for them to embrace open racism without remorse—emboldening them to spout bigoted rhetoric with brazen impunity, just as he and Trump do,” another person wrote on X. “This isn’t about pride in identity; it’s a dog whistle for unchecked prejudice, freeing supporters to echo their leaders’ divisive slurs against immigrants, minorities, and anyone who challenges the status quo.”\n\n“If being white is the only thing going for you I really feel sorry for you,” someone else added.\n\nOn the other hand, some argued there’s no such thing as white privilege: “I know plenty of white Americans living the exact same struggle as people in the Black community same wages, same bills, same stress, same lack of opportunity,” they commented under The Jasmine Brand’s Facebook post.\n\nAs Blavity reported, Vance took shots at Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett at the Turning Point USA America Fest.\n\n“The record speaks for itself. She wants to be a senator, though her street girl persona is about as real as her nails,” Vance said.\n\nCrockett was quick to fire back at Vance during her appearance on MS NOW’s The Weekend: Primetime.\n\n“When they can tell me about their policies that are helping Texas, then we can have a conversation, until then, take whatever shots you want to take at me, because I have been a Black woman my entire life,” she said.\n\nCrockett, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Texas, also called out the fact that Vance should be more concerned about the real reason why he’s Trump’s VP.\n\n“Baby, let’s talk about your record, because the only reason you’re the vice president is because the current President tried to have his last [vice] president killed,” she said, referencing the January 6 Capitol attack in which Trump supporters chanted “Hang Mike Pence” following Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe post MLK’s Daughter Bernice Claps Back At JD Vance Saying White People Don’t Have To Apologize For Being White appeared first on Blavity.",

As the name suggests, the fish is a native of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden but has since spread across the Indo-Pacific region. The unusual discovery has prompted concerns by the competition's organizers, the Benghazi Scout Commission, over the potential harm the pennant fish could inflict outside of its native range.\n\nIt's also another indication that the Mediterranean is heating up. The UN's Environment Programme notes the region is warming about 20% faster than the global average. Among the consequences is the migration of invasive species. The Mediterranean has been dealing with interlopers ever since the Suez Canal opened in 1869, a phenomenon known as the Lessepsian migration.\n\nIt's not yet clear if the Red Sea pennant will establish itself in Libyan waters or if it will do significant harm, as not every uninvited guest from the Suez has been a problem. However, once an invasive species does take hold, the consequences are alarming for native fauna and flora.\n\nBecause they have no natural system of control, nothing is stopping their populations from getting out of hand. Invasive species outcompete natives for resources and disrupt the food web. When an invasive predator shows up in a new area, its prey is utterly helpless against it. For example, the UK's water vole population dropped 94% because of North American minks imported for fur.\n\nPrevention is the preferred course of action for invasive species, but in this case, that horse has long since bolted. Aside from occasional mishaps by ships, the Suez Canal is going to stay open, and Libya is much too close to Egypt to realistically stem the tide of invasive marine species.\n\nSo it's a question of raising awareness about the risks of invasive species and working with local stakeholders to form effective measures to manage them. If that fails, if the species is safe to consume, they can always grab a fork.\n\nDo you think humans are doing enough to protect endangered animals?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor bargain hunters, Costco has long been a go-to destination. The warehouse giant famously still sells its hot dog and soda combo for $1.50 — the same price it launched with back in the mid-1980s. But not every Costco item has held its price as stubbornly as the hot dog combo.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco began selling 1-ounce gold bars. At the time, shoppers could choose between two types: the PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan bar and the Rand Refinery bar, priced at $1,979.99 and $1,949.99, respectively, according to Business Insider. Despite the hefty price tag, both quickly became hot sellers (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nFast forward to today, and not much has changed — except the price.\n\nAs of December 2025, the Pamp Suisse bar sells for $4,119.99, an increase of 108% (2).\n\nThe jump in price is in line with the broader gold market, which has surged roughly 65% over the course of 2025. What’s more surprising is the continued demand.\n\nCustomers are now restricted to “one transaction per membership, with a maximum of 4 units per 24 hours”, according to the Costco website (3).\n\nGold has long been viewed as a way to preserve purchasing power. Unlike fiat currencies, it can’t be printed at will by central banks.\n\nIt’s also considered a classic safe haven. Gold isn’t tied to any one country, currency or economy, and in times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to it — driving prices higher.\n\nThat’s exactly what appears to be happening now. Markets are getting whipsawed by tariff uncertainty, rising deficits and global tensions — and gold has emerged as a rare bright spot.\n\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, also highlighted gold’s importance as part of a resilient portfolio.\n\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he told CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier (4).”\n\nGold hit a peak price of $4,371.78 per ounce in October, and many experts expect it to continue to rise as stock market outlooks get shaky (5).",

    "description": "Copper prices have rallied over 35% so far this year amid supply shortages, surging global demand, and tariff uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMetals have had a record year with recent surges in gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) prices, but there’s a third metal hitting its own record highs. Copper prices have rallied by more than 35% this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009, driven higher by rising tech demand, supply constraints, and tariff uncertainty.\n\nGlobal copper (HG=F) prices officially surpassed $12,000 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday for the first time ever and continued to march higher on Wednesday.\n\nEach type of metal reacts slightly differently to economic conditions, and copper is no exception. However, unlike gold and silver, copper isn’t so directly influenced by investor sentiment or economic expectations. Its price movements can typically be attributed to physical growth and expansion.\n\nCopper is often viewed as a barometer for the economy. It plays a central role in power grids, construction, industrial machinery, and more. When there’s a demand for those types of goods or services, it’s typically a good sign that the economy has a clean bill of health — giving copper its nickname: Doctor Copper.\n\nRising copper prices often signal strong industrial demand and a rapidly growing economy, while falling prices may indicate an economic slowdown, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Copper is “a major beneficiary of investments in grid and power infrastructure globally, as AI and defence heighten the need for robust and secure energy networks,” wrote Goldman Sachs Research analyst Eoin Dinsmore in a note.\n\nGold is seen as more of a “safe-haven” asset and a hedge against inflation. Silver straddles the line between gold and copper and has both investment and industrial purposes. Copper, however, is predominantly industrial. It’s not typically purchased to be stored like gold or silver but meant to be used, which is why it’s usually the strongest indicator, of the three metals, that the economy is moving in the right direction.\n\nThere are a few key reasons that copper is experiencing a surge right now. Major copper-producing regions such as Chile and Indonesia have faced supply challenges and environmental disasters that have contributed to a global copper shortage and a tighter market.\n\n“After essentially flat mine supply growth expected this year, our 2026 mine supply growth estimates have fallen to only around +1.4%, or about 500 kmt lower than our estimates at the beginning of the year,” said Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, in a statement.\n\nA dip in supply isn’t the only factor that’s pushing prices higher. In July, the Trump administration issued tariffs on several categories of copper imports, putting additional pressure on the market. At the same time, heavy investment in the AI sector is significantly boosting demand because of its reliance on copper for data centers.\n\nOne source estimates that hyperscale AI data centers can use up to 50,000 tons of copper per facility.\n\nAs far as where prices are headed, JPMorgan Global Research expects copper prices to reach $12,500 a ton in the second quarter of 2026, ultimately averaging around $12,075 a ton for the full year.\n\nWhile researchers are optimistic that copper prices will continue on an upward trend, experts say the long-term implications of recent price surges remain uncertain.\n\n“The intersection of tariffs and copper prices in July 2025 highlights the complex dynamics of global trade and commodity markets,” said David Koch, CFP and director of portfolio management at Halbert Hargrove. “While the immediate effect has been a sharp rise in copper prices, the long-term consequences will depend on how markets, governments, and industries adapt to this new trade environment.”\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nGold and silver prices have been on a tear, with silver prices increasing by more than 100% year to date.

    "fullText": "CBS News aired the Kennedy Center Honors on Tuesday using a sharply edited Donald Trump monologue and dodging his controversial “Trump Kennedy Center” rebrand.\n\nThe new Trump-appointed Kennedy Center board voted on Dec. 18 to rename the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” leading to almost immediate legal action.\n\nDespite the 79-year-old president trying to muscle the rebrand into the country’s living rooms while hosting what he called “THE TRUMP KENNEDY CENTER HONORS” on Tuesday evening, CBS aired the 48th Kennedy Center Honors with the institution’s long-standing name, noted The Washington Post.\n\nBehind the scenes, the paper said CBS News standards had circulated guidance telling staff to stick with “Kennedy Center,” noting the board’s vote alone doesn’t make the change official because Congress would have to approve it.\n\nThe network also trimmed Trump’s opening remarks from roughly 12 minutes to about two minutes for viewers at home, cutting out some of his freewheeling asides—including his crack at the laughing crowd as “miserable, horrible people.”\n\nThe on-air snub came as CBS’s relationship with Trump has taken repeated hits, often with 60 Minutes at the center.\n\nIn July, Paramount, the network’s parent company, agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s presidential library to settle his $20 billion lawsuit over what he claimed was deceptive editing of a Kamala Harris interview, a deal the company announced without an apology.\n\nSince then, Trump has continued his attack on the network, even as CBS has been accused of bending over backwards to placate him. In November, it aired a 28-minute version of a Trump 60 Minutes sit-down with Norah O’Donnell, as well as a separate 73-minute extended cut.\n\nYet it left out a tense exchange in which Trump expressed irritation over questions about a crypto mogul he pardoned amid reports of a $2 billion deal tied to a Trump family crypto venture. The edits also omitted Trump’s comment about CBS’s payout related to the settlement.\n\nThen came the network’s leadership turmoil. After Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, 42, installed Bari Weiss, 41, as CBS News editor-in-chief in October, the MAGA-curious boss spiked a 60 Minutes segment at the eleventh hour last weekend.\n\nIt featured interviews with deportees sent by the Trump administration to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador, with Weiss claiming the segment needed more work before it could air. Her last-minute decision sparked concerns of White House interference and triggered fury inside the newsroom.\n\nThe episode spiraled further when the segment surfaced anyway after a Canadian broadcaster aired it, and Paramount Skydance began issuing copyright takedowns to scrub reposts.\n\nSet against concerns over political pressure and corporate leverage, the network’s refusal to call the venue the “Trump Kennedy Center” on its biggest annual cultural broadcast—and cutting Trump’s screen time—has raised more than a few eyebrows.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted CBS and the Kennedy Center for comment.",

    "fullText": "Dozens of laboratory mice allowed to roam a large outdoor enclosure returned to a typical level of mouse anxiety after just one week, researchers observed, suggesting that 'rewilding' may prevent lab-induced fear responses from developing in the first place.\n\nThe researchers, from Cornell University in the US, say their findings raise questions about the best ways to run anxiety tests on animals in the lab. This could also teach us something about how anxieties first begin to form in animals, including ourselves.\n\n\"We put them in the field for a week, and they returned to their original levels of anxiety behavior,\" says biologist Matthew Zipple.\n\n\"Living in this naturalistic environment both blocks the formation of the initial fear response, and it can reset a fear response that's already been developed in these animals in the lab.\"\n\nResearchers typically induce and measure anxiety in mice using what's called an elevated plus maze or EPM. It has two arms: an enclosed arm, which makes the animals feel safer, and an exposed arm, where the mice are in a more open environment.\n\nIn a standard response to the EPM, mice tend to explore the maze before returning to the enclosed spaces. This is interpreted as a sign of fear triggered by a single exposure to the open areas, a behavior so persistent that it resists SSRI anti-anxiety drugs.\n\nWhen researchers freed 44 mice from their lab cages to explore a relatively vast space outdoors, to burrow and climb and experience a variety of different sensations and conditions, they found it acted like a reset button.\n\nMice that were returned to the EPM explored both the open and closed spaces equally, as if encountering the maze for the first time. The effects were observed across mice regardless of whether they were rewilded from birth or not.\n\nThe findings may have implications for how we understand anxiety and its relationship to our environment – something that may be true of people as well as mice. It's possible that a narrow set of experiences can drive anxiety.\n\n\"If you experience lots of different things that happen to you every day, you have a better way to calibrate whether or not something is scary or threatening,\" says neurobiologist Michael Sheehan.\n\n\"But if you've only had five experiences, you come across your sixth experience, and it's quite different from everything you've done before, that's going to invoke anxiety.\"\n\nThe researchers suggest a rethink might be needed about how anxiety is studied in the lab, and how applicable experiments with mice could be to humans. What we think of as anxiety in lab mice might be easily mitigated by their environment, rather than being hardwired into their biology.\n\nThis idea of a more sheltered life as a contributor to anxiety is something that's been explored in studies of people as well. Perhaps more varied and even more risky experiences could help reduce anxiety – though we also know that there are multiple factors involved.\n\n\"This opens a lot of possibilities for asking interesting questions about how our library of experiences shapes our response to novel experiences, because I think that's essentially what anxiety is – when you have an inappropriate response to something that isn't actually scary,\" says Sheehan.\n\nThe research has been published in Current Biology.\n\nAn Anatomy Professor Explains The Bizarre Biology of Elves\n\nTiny Molecule Made by Gut Bacteria Could Cut Type 2 Diabetes Risk\n\nNew Drug Stalls Alzheimer's Development in Breakthrough Trial",

That represented a dramatic 37-point drop from January 2024, when 76% of Democrats approved of Schumer’s job performance, according to Gallup’s data.\n\nThe latest Gallup poll reflects fallout from a tumultuous year for Schumer.\n\nThe Minority Leader was roundly mocked by Republicans and upbraided by his own party after eight members of the Senate Democratic Caucus broke ranks to end the 43-day shutdown without securing an extension of enhanced health care subsidies.\n\nSchumer’s tactical misfire, coupled with his refusal to endorse New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, led some frustrated Democrats to call for new leadership.\n\n“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) posted on X. “If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?”\n\nBeyond Schumer, Gallup found that none of the 12 U.S. leaders from Congress, the Cabinet, the Supreme Court or the Federal Reserve earned majority-level approval.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell received the top mark with a 44% approval rating.

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

    "description": "“Consumers are just in this, whatever the highest price is, is the price they're going to focus on,” Harvard professor Jason Furman said.",
    "fullText": "As President Donald Trump struggles to address Americans’ growing affordability concerns, he has gotten some sympathy from one of former President Barack Obama’s former top economists.\n\nJason Furman, Harvard Kennedy School of Government professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday pessimistic consumers have overlooked gas prices that have remained affordable, making Trump’s job of addressing the affordability crisis more challenging.\n\nGas prices in December marked the lowest they’ve been all year, according to data from motor club AAA, with unleaded gasoline $0.18 cheaper nationally this year compared to last. National average prices reached their cheapest on Monday, hitting $2.85 a gallon. That hasn’t stopped consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since April, and approval ratings indicating more Americans disagree with how Trump is handling the economy.\n\n“I’ve been puzzled,” Furman said. “When you’re in government, you’re told, politically, the one price that matters is the price of gasoline. That’s the one price that’s been great this year. And I sort of feel a tiny bit bad for President Trump that he doesn’t get any credit for that.”\n\nTrump has continued to offer his own mixed signals on the affordability crisis, including saying in a primetime address last week he inherited an economic “mess” from the Biden administration, offering to cut checks for millions of military personnel for housing supplements, while simultaneously calling the economy the strongest it’s been.\n\nAccording to Furman, Trump also has a bit of a tough crowd: Consumers have been concerned about inflation and the price of groceries, which have increased nearly 30% over the past five years, making it more difficult to assuage economic anxieties, even when there are other optimistic signals.\n\n“Consumers are just in this sort of, whatever the highest price is, is the price they’re going to focus on and be upset about,” he said. “And that’s a really hard problem to solve economically or politically.”\n\nConflicting economic indicators extend beyond prices, Furman said. The U.S. saw its strongest economic growth in two years last quarter with a 4.3% GDP growth, exceeding past analysts’ estimates. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate creeped up to 4.6% in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, markedly higher than last November’s 4.2% and above 4%, which is considered reasonable.",

    "title": "This millennial home designer spent 9 months building a replica of ‘The Holiday’ cottage—now it’s renting fast at $499 a night",
    "description": "Lucy Small, a Georgia-based home designer, had 4,000 fans lined up to rent her festive cottage years before it hit the market. She says the home is so special that its success can’t “be replicated.”",
    "fullText": "Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance. Before joining the Success desk, she co-authored Fortune’s CHRO Daily newsletter, extensively covering the workplace and the future of jobs. Emma has also written for publications including the Observer and The China Project, publishing long-form stories on culture, entertainment, and geopolitics. She has a joint-master’s degree from New York University in Global Journalism and East Asian Studies.\n\nEveryone has must-watch holiday movies that they binge during the festive season, from Love Actually to Home Alone. But few actually get the chance to step inside the world of their favorite comfort flicks—that is, until now. Superfans of The Holiday can now rent out a replica of the quaint English cottage where fictional Hollywood bigwig Amanda Woods (played by Cameron Diaz) was charmed by heartthrob British book editor Graham (played by Jude Law). They’ll have to wait four months, though, and make the trek to Georgia instead of the Cotswolds.\n\nHome designer Lucy Small put the Holiday Cottage up for short-term rentals this October after a nine-month build—and a fan frenzy quickly ensued. The 37-year-old has spent the past six years designing homes in the Blue Ridge Mountains; she’s worked on three dozen houses, from bathroom and kitchen rebuilds to hardcore construction projects. But nothing could have prepared her for the rush of attention that came with her latest project: replicating the cozy Rosehill Cottage featured in The Holiday, from the ground up. After all, nearly two decades after the movie’s release, it continues to be a top-watched festive flick: In 2023, The Holiday was streamed 2.3 million times, according to an analysis from Samba TV.\n\nAs it turns out, the house featured in the 2006 film—owned by Kate Winslet’s character, Iris, who home-swaps with Amanda, staying at her L.A. mansion for the Christmas season—never actually existed in real life. It was a big undertaking, but Small saw a potential hit on her hands.\n\n“The Holiday Cottage was really a fun thing. I was like, ‘Hey, why don’t I do this? I have everything at my disposal to be able to do it, I know how to build, and I can find land,’” Small tells Fortune, adding she’s a fan of the iconic movie. “Honestly, it was just one of those situations where I had this wacky idea, and everyone got excited about it, and no one stopped me.”\n\nBefore the foundation of the two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath home was even built, Small had attracted attention from thousands of customers. She first announced her plan to build the cottage in 2022, and fan fervor started pouring in. The entrepreneur says she only had digital renderings of the cottage at the time, but people were already sending her handwritten letters about how they couldn’t wait to stay there. Around 4,000 people left their email addresses on a website Small threw together to update the public on its availability. Now, just two months after going live on the market, the short-term stay is fully booked until March 2026.\n\n“People have really loved it, and every time I get one of those letters of, ‘This means so much to me, thank you so much for making it possible,’ that’s just way more worthwhile to me than anything else,” Small continues. “Anyone can build a house, have it be a good investment, and sell it to an investor. But this seems to really have meaning to people, and that makes it important.”\n\nIt’s no easy feat bringing a piece of cinema into the real world—especially when you’re up against a home that’s impossible to replicate. In truth, the Rosehill Cottage featured in The Holiday was just a bit of movie magic; the home’s weathered facade was built in an open field, while the interior was filmed on sets. Some designers might balk at the idea of building a fictional home—but Small was actually excited by the premise.\n\n“I found out that the house never actually existed in real life, which, for me, is a big deal. Because if you can actually go visit the Brady Bunch house, or the Home Alone house, me building another one is less interesting,” she explains. “But if it never existed, if it’s a set that was torn down 20 years ago, that’s a lot more interesting, because there is literally nothing else in the world like it.”\n\nSmall put the project into motion several years ago, but quickly ran into some time-consuming roadblocks. Georgia, a popular tourist getaway and filming location, was slow to issue more short-term rental licenses as temporary stays flooded the market. Heavy taxes and fees also had to be factored into the price, as counties wanted in on the industry’s growing success. Finding the right land to build on was a struggle—but once she settled on a plot in North Georgia, it was off to the races.\n\nIn total, it took nine months to build the Holiday Cottage, from breaking ground to putting in the final flourishes. Small worked with an architectural designer, watching the romcom together “1,000 times” to try and get it right. The first hurdle: They realized the house would never meet code. When trying to build at scale, they discovered the ceilings would be too low, standing at only seven feet tall, based on where the windows were positioned in the movie. The film version of the cottage had only two chimneys but featured three fireplaces; the bathroom floor was sloped; and, in reality, one window would cut halfway through the kitchen cabinet. Small and her team did everything to match the same aesthetic, even setting up fake walls and slopes.\n\nReplicating the home’s furnishings proved to be a bit pricey, too. Despite the quaint movie cottage, seemingly adorned with humble, secondhand furniture, the decor was beyond Small’s budget. Using Google image reverse searches, she tracked down antiques identical to the ones on set, which ran upwards of $30,000 each. The bamboo umbrella tree shown in the cottage entryway, for example, was priced at over $15,000. Eventually, Small was able to parallel the same warm, charming atmosphere with similar decor. She declines to share how much the entire build set her back, or even when she’ll recoup on costs. Small says she rents out the home at a modest price—$399 per night during the low season, and $499 during high season—and is adamant the Holiday Cottage has been a worthwhile investment.\n\n“It’s not like we were totally surprised and totally blew the budget. We knew what it would be; we don’t charge a stupid amount,” Small says. “And so it’s still been a good investment, given that we did not, like, cheap out on the build at all.”\n\nWith 4,000 eager renters already waiting in line, the Holiday Cottage’s instant success wasn’t a huge surprise. However, Small wasn’t used to her projects getting so much attention.\n\n“As someone who, frankly, does not know how to use social media at all, who doesn’t have it, who’s pretty private, I’m usually unable to get eyeballs on any of my projects,” she continues. “For this one, [attention has] just been pouring in completely, even though I haven’t gone out to seek it, which has been a very new position for me as a designer.”\n\nOnce the Holiday Cottage booking site went live on Oct. 4, Small says dates started filling up “immediately.” And media attention only riled up more interest; the millennial home designer says she “can’t think of a magazine” that hasn’t covered her new build. And just in time for the holidays, it’s proved to be the perfect place to get into the festive spirit. Currently, there is only one open day in March, a few available slots in April, and just one in May. The Holiday Cottage isn’t available for a multiday booking until June 2026—the house is nearly booked out for six straight months.\n\nSmall’s latest project has proved a huge success, and she says renters have so far been loving it. Travelers leave their stories in the home’s guest book; a trio of sisters brought their mother, a big fan of The Holiday, along for the ultimate dream stay; another visitor used to watch the movie with her mom every Christmas, and after her passing, rented the place with her dad. For the people who stay there, the short-term rental is more than a place to crash. It’s the chance to be immersed in romcom nostalgia and reconnect with loved ones.\n\nWhen asked if she is planning another movie-related build, Small says she’s perfectly happy being the owner of this one viral sensation. Right now, she has no other ideas—all she knows is she will only take on projects like this, where people are excited about the result. Plus, Small believes there’s no other home built that can replicate the same magic as the Holiday Cottage.\n\n“Honestly, I’m fine being a one-hit wonder,” Small says. “I don’t need it to be a big moneymaker or big success, because a lot of the things that make this house—the Holiday Cottage—so special, I don’t think can be replicated.”\n\nA version of this story originally appeared at Fortune.com on Nov. 28, 2025.",

    "description": "I've spent my holidays in Punta del Este since I was 2. From endless beaches to kid-friendly culture and great food, here's why I keep going back.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I was 2 years old, my family has been spending the holiday break at the same beach: Punta del Este, in Uruguay.\n\nThe beach town is hands down one of my favorite places in the world, not only because of our long-standing family tradition — which I've now kept up with my own kids — but because it's a hidden gem in South America that deserves to be visited at least once.\n\nUruguay has opposite seasons to the US, which means it's summer during our winter. For my family of five, that means it's the perfect place to take a break from the sub-zero temperatures of Maine during the holidays.\n\nPunta del Este has endless miles of beach, with options for everyone. If you like surfing, there's a popular beach where you can find people sitting on their boards waiting for the perfect wave. For families with young children, there's Playa Mansa, which rarely has waves, making it ideal for kids to wade around in the water. For more experienced swimmers, there's Playa Brava, which offers big waves and strong tides.\n\nYou can often find merchants walking around with towels, bikinis, dresses, ice cream, and coffee. Some beaches have beach restaurants where you can buy food and drinks, although they can get crowded during peak season.\n\nUruguayans are known for being incredibly kind to kids. You can expect priority lines for families with young children at airports and supermarkets. In my experience, people often go above and beyond at restaurants and shops to ensure kids are happy.\n\nBeyond that, there are endless activities to keep kids happy. From ice cream shops to try on every block downtown, to an extensive (and free!) playground called El Jaguel, where families can spend the day exploring the grounds, having lunch, and riding horses.\n\nMy kids also love the day camps at Portal del Bosque in La Barra, which cost $2,000 Uruguayan pesos, or about $50, where they spend half a day exploring activities such as art, stop-motion animation, soccer, and more. My kids also love visiting the downtown hippie market, getting temporary tattoos, and getting threaded braids.\n\nDespite having been coming here for 40 years, I still haven't tried all the restaurants that Punta del Este has to offer.\n\nThere are historical ones, like La Huella in Jose Ignacio, which is loved by both locals and tourists (although securing a table during peak season can be challenging). Highlights include grilled octopus and fish, as well as a dessert volcano of dulce de leche.\n\nLo de Tere in the port, which is so fun to spend New Year's Eve at, as people dance on the street once the clock hits midnight. On other days, you can enjoy food with an emphasis on local products.\n\nAnd for a quick, casual bite, Rex, which has the best chivitos in town, is excellent to go with kids because of its quick service and lively atmosphere. One year, my kids spent the entire meal petting the restaurant's dog, while my husband and I enjoyed the coldest beer I've ever had.\n\nWhile Uruguay is known for its excellent steak, there are restaurants for every palate. My kids love eating fondue at Bungalow Suizo. I always enjoy getting fresh, local fish, and anything with dulce de leche (a local caramel) is a hit with the whole family.\n\nBut these are just a few of the endless options for food. You really can find something for everyone's taste.\n\nSummer here runs from December to March, which is the ideal time to come to enjoy the beach, as well as when most restaurants are open.\n\nThat said, the weeks between Christmas and New Year's can be really expensive and hard to get reservations for. Another factor to consider is that while there are direct flights from Miami to Montevideo and from Buenos Aires to Punta del Este, these can be particularly expensive during high season. To get an idea, for my family of five, return tickets to the US for January 2nd were running at $18,000. We opted to fly on December 31st instead and spend New Year's in the air.\n\nI hope we can continue spending more family vacations in Punta del Este, as seeing my kids enjoy the things I used to do as a kid brings me so much joy.",

    "description": "Tahmina Watson's law firm assists with employment visas. She advises all visa holders with a valid stamp to return to the US immediately.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tahmina Watson, a business immigration lawyer in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Watson's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a business immigration lawyer, and in my day-to-day work with clients, I'm seeing immigration disruptions with immediate consequences, including H-1B visa holders who are outside the US being uncertain if they can return.\n\n​​My law firm, Watson Immigration Law, assists founders and businesses in navigating the employment visa application process. It appears that, at this time, the administration is coordinating the rescheduling and delay of immigration appointments.\n\nNon-immigrant visas generally must be scheduled at a US embassy or consulate in the person's country of nationality or residence. From my experience, many employees accrue their holiday time and schedule immigration appointments during this period because they're already planning to leave the country, allowing them to easily visit their designated US embassy or consulate.\n\nThese employees are now getting stuck, having already left the US, with their appointments getting rescheduled for June, July, or August 2026, and beyond.\n\nMajor tech companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft, sent memos out to their employees in the past week, warning visa-holding employees to avoid international travel amid long delays at US consulates. These policies are coming one after another, and they all intersect with each other.\n\nIf somebody is outside the country, what are employers supposed to do? Right now, my advice to clients outside the country is that if they have a valid visa stamp, they should return to the US as soon as possible.\n\nFor someone who has left the country to obtain a new visa stamp, I'm not sure there's a clear path to return. This includes individuals on F-1 student visas who traveled to visit family and were planning to re-enter the US. They will need that visa stamp from a consulate.\n\nEnsure your employment is still active and consider whether remote work is an option. If an employer decides they cannot keep someone on the books, even an appointment months from now will not help if there's no job waiting.\n\nIt's tough to know how things will unfold. What we're seeing is a confluence of policies coming in at the same time. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has just announced that it is replacing the lottery system for H-1B work visas, which randomly selects who receives a visa. The system is now set to prioritize higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.\n\nSocial media disclosure is being expanded from F-1 visa holders, which began during the student visa crisis, to now include H-1B workers. These applicants are required to change all social media privacy settings to public.\n\nIt could easily expand to other visa categories. The government has not provided clear guidance on what they are reviewing. By casting an overly broad net under the banner of national security, without clear standards or transparency, the administration is creating uncertainty that will ripple across families, employers, and the US economy.\n\nClients should limit what they post online.\n\nIn 2024, I was already anticipating these issues with traveling and returning to the US. We've also seen issues affecting green card holders with past criminal convictions.\n\nThere are many stories of people who have lived in the US for decades, suddenly facing deportation proceedings. This is a highly precarious time for immigrants, and limiting travel is critical.\n\nIt feels like a fire hose of policies. Everyone in the immigrant ecosystem is on high alert: Immigration lawyers, immigrants, employers, investors, founders, and employees.",

    "fullText": "CBS News head Bari Weiss sent a Christmas memo to staff on Wednesday defending her decision to pull a \"60 Minutes\" segment on the Trump administration's use of El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison.\n\nIn the memo, signed by Weiss and other CBS News leadership, she wrote that the press needed to win back the public's trust, and that \"sometimes it means holding a piece about an important subject to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.\"\n\n\"Right now, the majority of Americans say they do not trust the press,\" she wrote. \"It isn't because they're crazy.\"\n\nWeiss' decision to hold the \"60 Minutes\" shortly before it aired led to blowback both inside and outside CBS News, which is owned by Paramount Skydance. Sharyn Alfonsi, who reported the segment, wrote in note to colleagues that the decision was a \"political one,\" multiple outlets reported.\n\nWeiss said in her memo that she and other CBS News leaders are \"not out to score points with one side of the political spectrum or to win followers on social media.\"\n\nThe media world has heavily scrutinized Weiss' management since she was installed atop CBS News by Paramount CEO David Ellison in October. Paramount also acquired The Free Press, the conservative-friendly news site Weiss founded after leaving The New York Times' opinion section, for about $150 million.\n\nParamount is dueling with Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. President Donald Trump has said he would be involved in the regulatory review process.\n\nWeiss added in the memo that CBS News would hold itself to a high standard of fairness and be independent.\n\nHere's the full text of the memo:",
