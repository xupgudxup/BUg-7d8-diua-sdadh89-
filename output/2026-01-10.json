    "description": "Rory McIlroy relaxes his shoulder. Scottie Scheffler rolls his forearms.",
    "fullText": "Rory McIlroy relaxes his shoulder. Scottie Scheffler rolls his forearms. Jordan Spieth shortens his swing. Same shot shape. Three different answers to three different problems.\n\nThe draw — that coveted right-to-left curve — has haunted amateurs for decades. Most golfers freeze at the thought of it, trapped in an over-the-top motion that sends the ball slicing into oblivion. Yet three Major champions have cracked the code, each engineering the same outcome through radically different methods. The secret? There is no single “correct” draw. Only the one that solves your specific flaw.\n\nFor pure distance with shape, McIlroy’s method stands alone. The five-time Major winner — widely regarded as one of the best drivers the game has ever produced — builds his towering draw on a deceptively simple foundation: aim right, move the ball slightly back, and let gravity do the work.\n\nThe key move happens at the top of the backswing. McIlroy relaxes his trail shoulder, allowing the club to drop below the plane naturally. This “Sleepy Shoulder” move creates an inside-out path without conscious hand manipulation. The ball launches right, then curves back toward the target with penetrating flight and maximum roll.\n\nA recent instructional breakdown reinforces this principle: a solid draw emerges from rotational swing mechanics rather than lateral sway. McIlroy’s shoulder drop exemplifies that philosophy — the body rotates, the path shapes itself, and the hands stay quiet.\n\nIf your draw struggles stem from an out-to-in path, McIlroy’s shoulder relaxation offers the simplest correction. Speed converts to shape with minimal conscious effort.\n\nWhere McIlroy chases distance, Spieth chases precision. The three-time Major champion approaches the draw as a scoring weapon, not a power play. His method centers on restraint. Instead of a full swing, Spieth uses a deliberate three-quarter motion — reducing speed to tighten dispersion.\n\n“I’ve got to take a little bit off, so I’m going to do that by using a three-quarter motion,” Spieth explained in a Titleist instruction session. “Then I’m going to try to be just as aggressive with the ball as I would be on a full one.”\n\nThe second element: late delofting. Spieth keeps the clubface lean through impact, allowing loft to release at the last moment. Face stability remains intact because the adjustment happens early in the swing, not at contact. His target philosophy seals the approach. Rather than firing at pins, Spieth aims at the fat parts of greens, letting draw spin work the ball back toward the hole.\n\n“If you start training that way, it’s so much easier to play the game, because you’re missing on the fat parts of the greens,” he noted.\n\nIf your draw over-curves or your contact lacks consistency, Spieth’s shortened motion and face control offer a path to repeatability. Prioritize strike over speed.\n\nScheffler’s draw solves a different problem entirely — the need to shape on command. The four-time Major winner, who captured five wins in his first eight starts of 2024, including the Masters and the Players Championship, has built his dominance on adaptability. When a dogleg demands a curve or a tree blocks the direct line, Scheffler’s hands take over.\n\nThe setup is straightforward: close the stance slightly, move the ball back. From there, the intention shifts to the trail forearm.\n\n“With the ball position here, the ball is going to start way out to the right,” Scheffler explained in a Golf.com instruction feature. “And all I’m trying to do is get that ball to turn over as much as I can.”\n\nThe key difference from McIlroy’s body-driven method: Scheffler’s “Forearm Turnover” relies on active rotation of the trail forearm over the lead arm through impact. It’s a hand-driven feel, not a sequencing play — simpler to execute under pressure, easier to repeat when the margin for error shrinks.\n\nIf your face control wavers at impact, Scheffler’s forearm turnover provides a direct, feel-based solution. The hands create the shape; the body follows.\n\nThree methods. Three contexts. Path problem? Relax the shoulder like McIlroy. Face control problem? Roll the forearms like Scheffler. Contact and dispersion problem? Shorten the swing like Spieth.\n\nThree Major champions. Three different moves. One shot shape. The “correct” draw has always been the one that fixes your flaw — nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe post How to Hit a Perfect Draw Like Major Champions Ft.

    "description": "Los Angeles allowed a free-falling Winnipeg squad to find its first victory since mid-December.",
    "fullText": "With a prime opportunity to get back in the win column against a last-place Jets team, the Los Angeles Kings were downed 5-1 on Friday evening at Canada Life Centre. Marking the second straight Kings loss, the squad dropped to 18-15-10, sitting fifth in the Pacific Division.\n\nWinnipeg headed into the contest riding an 11-game losing streak, with their last win coming in a 5-1 victory over the Washington Capitals on Dec. 13. The skid was the longest for the club since moving to Winnipeg from Atlanta in 2011.\n\nVladislav Namestnikov and Cole Koepke got the Jets out in front in the first, with each contributing a score to create a 2-0 cushion. Namestnikov snapped a sizeable scoring drought in the process, finding the net for the first time in 29 games.\n\nQuinton Byfield, the lone Kings' scorer of the evening, saw the puck deflect off him and into the net after the initial shot attempt from Warren Foegele. Earning his seventh goal of the season, Byfield now has four points in his last four games.\n\nQ-Tips-It! pic.twitter.com/ShJqK8lxg8\n\n— LA Kings (@LAKings) January 10, 2026\n\nThe score also represented his second consecutive game with a point against the Jets. He had previously earned his 100th career assist in a 3-0 Los Angeles victory against Winnipeg on Nov. 4, 2025.\n\nForward Taylor Ward recorded his first career assist on the play in the third game of his young NHL career. It was the 27-year-old's first action on the road.\n\nHowever, the Jets poured in three goals of their own during the period to pull away and establish a sizeable advantage. Jonathan Toews had the third goal for the Jets, snapping a 26-game scoring skid of his own.\n\nMark Scheifele closed the frame with back-to-back goals, making it 5-1. Through two periods, starting Kings' netminder Darcy Kuemper saved 11 of 16 shots before being replaced by Anton Forsberg in the third.\n\nKuemper dropped to 12-8-7 on the year, conceding a season-high five scores in the loss. He has failed to find the win column in two consecutive starts after the Kings came up short in Thursday's overtime loss to the Sharks.\n\nFollowing a frustrating loss, Los Angeles will look to rebound on the second end of a back-to-back in Edmonton on Saturday evening. It will be the first battle between the Kings and Oilers this season. Currently holding second place in the Pacific Division at 22-16-6, Edmonton is riding a two-game win streak.\n\nPuck drop is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. PT.",

    "description": "It appears that Oregon quarterback Dante Moore is still uncertain about his future following the Ducks' 56-22 loss in the CFP Semifinals.",
    "fullText": "Moments after the Oregon Ducks' 56-22 loss to the Indiana Hoosiers amid a disastrous three-turnover performance from quarterback Dante Moore, it appears that the potential 2026 draft prospect is still uncertain on his future.\n\n\"I don't know my decision yet,\" he revealed after being asked whether he'll declare for the 2026 NFL draft or return to Eugene for one more season.\n\nIt's the answer that Moore has given ever since his name began to appear in 2026 mock drafts and big boards.\n\nNotably, he's the No. 1 prospect on esteemed ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr.'s Big Board. With the draft order set, he's widely projected to be selected by the Las Vegas Raiders or New York Jets, the teams that own the No. 1 and No. 2 picks, respectively.\n\nOregon QB Dante Moore on his future: “I don’t know my decision yet.”\n\n— Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) January 10, 2026\n\nBut if there was ever a performance that changed Moore's perspective on if he's ready to go pro or not, this may have been it.\n\nOn the surface, Moore wasn't bad. By game's end, he'd completed 24 of 39 passes for 285 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\n\nBut there was also a badly thrown pass on the first play of the game that resulted in a Hoosiers pick-six. There was a mishap in the backfield in which Moore's throwing arm bumped into running back Dierre Hill Jr., causing a fumble and an Indiana recovery deep inside Duck territory. A strip sack followed in which he held the ball for far too long, allowing the Hoosiers pass rush to reach him and cause another fumble.\n\nIn all, Moore committed three first-half turnovers, plummeting the Ducks' chances of a win and showing that he may not be as ready for the NFL as previous opinions have suggested.\n\nRegardless of what he says now, in the wake of one of the most disappointing losses in program history for Oregon and easily the worst game that Moore has pieced together as a Duck, a decision will come soon.\n\nUntil then, the Oregon program, plus the Raiders and Jets, will be waiting for his answer.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Oregon Ducks QB Dante Moore still unsure of future after CFP Semis",

    "description": "The WNBA and its players’ union weren’t able to agree to a new collective bargaining agreement by the Friday night deadline, and now the league enters a “status-quo” period with no new extension reached.",
    "fullText": "The WNBA and its players’ union weren’t able to agree to a new collective bargaining agreement by the Friday night deadline, and now the league enters a “status-quo” period with no new extension reached.\n\nNegotiations will continue with the current CBA still in effect.\n\nThe league and the players had two previous extensions, with the most recent expiring Friday night. The sides have met several times this week, but are still far apart on many key issues, including salary structure and revenue-sharing.\n\n“Despite demonstrating our willingness to compromise in order to get a deal done, the WNBA and its teams have failed to meet us at the table with the same spirit and seriousness,’ the union said in a statement. “Instead, they have remained committed to undervaluing player contributions, dismissing player concerns, and running out the clock.”\n\nIf a new CBA isn’t agreed upon soon, it could delay the start of the 2026 season.\n\n“The WNBA continues to negotiate in good faith with the goal of reaching a deal as quickly as possible,” the league told The Associated Press in a statement Thursday. “Our focus remains on reaching an agreement that significantly increases player compensation while ensuring the long-term growth of the business.”\n\nThe last CBA was announced in the middle of January 2020, a month after it had been agreed to. It could easily take two months from when a new CBA is reached to get to the start of free agency, which was supposed to begin later this month.\n\nThe WNBA, under U.S. labor law, has a status-quo obligation to allow teams to send out qualifying offers under the expired CBA agreement. Both sides could agree to a moratorium that would result in a pause of all free agency activities until a new CBA is ratified. The league offered one, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on Friday night on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations.\n\nWith no moratorium in place, the league has told its teams that they can send out qualifying offers to free agents beginning on Sunday, according to the person. Those offers would go to players who were restricted free agents or ones that the teams wanted to give the franchise tag to.\n\nBecause neither the players nor the teams have any idea what the new salary structure and salary cap would be in the new CBA, no teams are expected to make those offers.\n\nThe league’s most recent offer last month would guarantee a maximum base salary of $1 million in 2026 that could reach $1.3 million through revenue sharing. That’s up from the current $249,000 and could grow to nearly $2 million over the life of the agreement, the person told the AP.\n\nUnder the league’s proposal, players would receive in excess of 70% of net revenue — though that would be their take of the profits after expenses are paid. Those expenses would include upgraded facilities, charter flights, five-star hotels, medical services, security and arenas.\n\nThe average salary in 2026 would be more than $530,000, up from its current $120,000, and grow to more than $770,000 over the life of the agreement. The minimum salary would grow from its current $67,000 to approximately $250,000 in the first year, the person told the AP.\n\nThe proposal would also financially pay star young players like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers, who are all still on their rookie contracts, nearly double the league minimum.\n\nRevenue sharing is one of the major sticking points in the negotiations.\n\nThe union’s counter proposal to the league would give players around 30% of the gross revenue. The player’s percentage would be from money generated before expenses for the first year and teams would have a $10.5 million salary cap to sign players. Under the union’s proposal, the revenue sharing percent would go up slightly each year.\n\n“Make no mistake. Pay equity is not optional and progress is long overdue,” the union statement said. “We urge the league and its teams to meet this moment. The players already have and will continue to do so.”",

    "description": "Here's what Grizzlies' players said about trade speculation regarding Ja Morant.",
    "fullText": "When Jaren Jackson Jr. hit a 3-pointer early in the Grizzlies' game against the Thunder on Jan. 9, there was only one way for him to celebrate.\n\nJackson immediately hit Ja Morant's \"block out the noise\" celebration, paying homage to his fellow star on what might go down as a monumental day for the franchise. News broke earlier in the day that the Grizzlies would consider trade offers for Morant, potentially signaling a path toward the end of an era of Grizzlies basketball.\n\nJackson, who like Morant has played his entire career with the Grizzlies, reflected postgame on what the partnership has meant to him.\n\n\"The business of basketball, it takes a toll,\" Jackson said. \"And I told him too, I think we've seen it all. I think we've seen so many different things. But, you know, that's my brother. I'm always feeling for him. Yeah, man. It's just a tough thing, man. But he showed up to the game, he's still around. You can understand the mood, something like that. And just, especially with someone like him, who's just viral for freaking anything, it's just intense, man.\n\n\"We're all growing up in the public eye, but it's just intense. I feel for him. That's my brother. That side of the game plays out like it plays out. No matter what, he changed my life coming here. You know who he is.\"\n\nMorant missed the game with a calf contusion. It was his fourth straight missed game, and it isn't clear how long he could be out. The Grizzlies led by as many as 21 points against the Thunder but collapsed down the stretch in an eventual 117-116 loss.\n\nThe loss capped a long day for the Grizzlies, who had to deal with the Morant news and then quickly turn around to face the defending NBA champion (albeit against a Thunder team that was missing multiple key players, including reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander).\n\n\"I'm not going to say I didn't expect it, and I'm going to say I was expecting it,\" Grizzlies forward GG Jackson said about the Morant news. \"I kind of thought things would just mellow over and get back to him being on the floor with us. Right now, I really don't have no reaction. He still comes in the facility smiling with us, doesn't let any of the outside noise affect him.\"\n\nMorant still sat on the bench during the game.\n\n\"Obviously we love Ja over here,\" guard Jaylen Wells said.\n\nReach sports writer Jonah Dylan at jonah.dylan@commercialappeal.com or on X @thejonahdylan.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Memphis Commercial Appeal: What Grizzlies players said about Ja Morant trade speculation",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have a break from Premier League action tomorrow when they take on Charlton in the FA Cup third round.\n\nThe Addicks’ manager Nathan Jones has fired up his men ahead of the game, claiming their intent is to give Chelsea a tough game, not look for autographs from their Premier League opposition.\n\n“You start at the third round and you’ve got that opportunity of getting a big one, which is always nice because it’s a test, it’s not because we want to high-five Liam Delap or anyone,” the ex-Southampton coach said.\n\n“What we have to make sure is that it doesn’t become just an autograph session. It becomes a proper game where we can test ourselves, test our structure, test what we do.”\n\nCole Palmer and a fairly generic group of Chelsea players look disappointed. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\n\nWe can certainly expect Charlton to come out all guns blazing. They may be a couple of divisions below, but this is their biggest game of the season so far in terms of audience, and they will want to show what they can do.\n\nMeanwhile Chelsea are in bad form, are playing an intense run of games, will use a mainly rotated team and have a new coach in place. This could be a very tricky tie.\n\nChelsea’s rotten project under BlueCo has been slammed by a player who was at the club in a very different era, and who can’t believe that “money, money, money” is all that remains.\n\nWe won’t get a full preview of Chelsea’s tactics today because it’s going to be a heavily rotated team and he’s only had one day of training. But long term there are questions about how he will solve the big problem from Enzo Maresca’s reign.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are ramping up their search for the caretaker manager position following Ruben Amorim’s brutal sack.\n\nDarren Fletcher was at the helm for United’s game against Burnley, and even though the match ended in a disappointing 2-2 draw, there were positive signs.\n\nThe players played with a lot more freedom, while the former midfielder was brave with his substitutions, unlike the Portuguese.\n\nFletcher will remain in charge for the FA Cup tie against Brighton and Hove Albion at Old Trafford, and the expectation is that a new appointment will be made in time for the Manchester derby.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are among the leading candidates. It was expected that both might be working in tandem like before, but that does not seem to be the plan anymore.\n\nINEOS have already spoken with the ex-England midfielder, and now, as per The Daily Mail, face-to-face talks with the Norwegian will be held on Saturday.\n\n“Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will hold face-to-face talks with Manchester United on Saturday as he bids to become interim head coach until the end of the season.\n\n“Solskjaer is battling with Michael Carrick for the role after United sacked Ruben Amorim this week, although caretaker boss Darren Fletcher cannot be ruled out.\n\n“It’s understood that both Solskjaer and Carrick held preliminary discussions with the United hierarchy earlier in the week.\n\n“Carrick, 44, met with chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox in person on Thursday, and Solskjaer will have his interview at Carrington on Saturday.\n\n“It will be his first face-to-face meeting with the club’s hierarchy since Amorim was sacked.”\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has the backing of plenty of United’s superstars, and The Peoples Person has already relayed that he would want the permanent job should he succeed in taking the 20-time English league champions back to the Champions League.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

Ponds palmed Dante Moore's first pass attempt just seconds into the game. The Hoosiers cornerback finished the play by sprinting 25 yards up the right flank for an early edge.\n\nDucks quarterback Dante Moore helped even the score with a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jamari Johnson to end the next possession, but the Hoosiers responded with a surge of 35-consecutive points.\n\nMendoza found wide receiver Omar Cooper Jr. for an 8-yard score at the end of the first quarter to give the lead back to the Hoosiers. Moore fumbled early in the second quarter, giving the Hoosiers a short field. Running back Kaelon Black scored on a 1-yard run less than a minute later.\n\nMendoza threw his second score about five minutes later, finding Charlie Becker for a 36-yard touchdown. Moore lost his second fumble -- and committed his third turnover of the half -- on the next Ducks drive. Mendoza threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Elijah Sarratt at the end of the quarter to give the Hoosiers a 28-point lead of the break.\n\nMendoza threw his fourth touchdown pass to a fourth different teammate on the first possession of the second half. That 13-yard pass, which ended an 11-play, 75-yard drive, found E.J. Williams Jr.\n\nDucks running back Jay Harris ran for a 2-yard score on the next drive. But Mendoza continued to pile on, throwing his fifth touchdown pass of the night with 11:36 remaining to push the Hoosiers lead to 49-15.\n\nBlack ran for his second touchdown of the Peach Bowl with 5:13 remaining to further cement the victory.\n\nMoore threw a 1-yard pass to tight end Roger Saleapaga for the final touchdown of the night with 22 seconds remaining. The Ducks quarterback completed 23 of 38 passes for 285 yards, two scores and an interception, in addition to two fumbles. Ducks running back Dierre Hill Jr. logged 111 yards from scrimmage on seven touches.\n\nMendoza completed 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards. Black ran for 63 yards and two scores on 12 carries in the victory.

(WFXR)— Liberty Christian Academy (LCA) Thursday announced that longtime Head Football Coach Frank Rocco will retire at the conclusion of the 2025–2026 school year, bringing to a close one of the most successful coaching tenures in the state’s history.\n\nCoach Rocco retires as the winningest football coach in Liberty Christian Academy history, compiling an extraordinary 199–35 record over 20 seasons at LCA. Across his distinguished career, he amassed 294 total wins, including 14 seasons coaching in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools.\n\nUnder Coach Rocco’s leadership, LCA football became a perennial powerhouse. His teams advanced to the postseason in 19 of his 20 seasons, capturing an impressive eight VISSA/VHSL state championships. Beyond wins and championships, Rocco’s impact extended to player development, with 85 of his athletes going on to play college football.\n\nPrior to joining Liberty Christian Academy, Rocco served as Offensive Coordinator at Liberty University from 2000 to 2004, establishing his influence on football in the region.\n\nIn 2024, Coach Rocco was diagnosed with cancer. While he has continued to lead with strength and determination, he has shared that his decision to retire is centered on prioritizing his health and spending meaningful time with his family, including his seven grandchildren.\n\nDr. Jeff Capps, LCA Head of Schools, expressed his gratitude for Coach Rocco, “We are thankful for Coach Rocco’s leadership in our football program and the investment that he made in the lives of our student athletes on and off the field to help them become better players and young men, and stronger in their faith.”",

    "fullText": "After beating Oregon 56–22 in the Peach Bowl semifinal, Curt Cignetti’s Indiana is set to face Miami in the National Title Game. But at this moment, instead of talking about preparation, Cignetti gives off a different vibe. It’s an interesting contrast, especially as Miami’s head coach has already signaled the team’s best version of preparation.\n\n“I’m not really thinking about the next game, I’m thinking about cracking open a beer,” said Cignetti after the win in the CFP semifinal.\n\nWhile Barstool Sports shared that clip of Cignetti saying this during an interview with an ESPN reporter, the head coach’s words suggest he may want a moment of refresh before the ultimate game. Otherwise, it could be a strategy to throw off the opponent’s preparation.\n\nWhatever the case, Miami’s Mario Cristobal is ready to give a tough fight, and after the Fiesta Bowl win, he made that clear publicly.\n\n“My f****** head is spinning. I’m ready to go watch the film. We should have scored 10 more points,” said Cristobal.\n\nIt clearly appears the Hurricanes’ coach wants to beat Indiana at any cost, so preparing early by studying film is the best way to identify flaws and ensure they aren’t repeated against the Hoosiers in the final game.\n\nWhile mindsets may differ with timing, both teams are desperately ready to make history by capturing the national title. That’s clearly visible in their dominance in recent bowl games. Still, only one team will bring it home, and that will be interesting to watch.\n\nThe post Curt Cignetti Goes Completely Opposite to Mario Cristobal After Peach Bowl Victory appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "The redshirt sophomore was projected to go second overall to the Jets in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Peach Bowl didn't help his stock.",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl was a clash between No. 5 Oregon and No. 1 Indiana. It was also a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 picks of Yahoo Sports' latest NFL mock draft.\n\nIn both cases, it's pretty safe to say who came out on top.\n\nIndiana reached the national title game with a 56-22 demolishing of the Ducks, taking a four-touchdown lead into halftime and coasting from there. Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the favorite to be the Las Vegas Raiders' first overall pick in a few months, was 17-for-20 for 177 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and 0 interceptions.\n\nAnd Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, the projected second pick? He was 24-for-39 with 285 passing yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 backbreaking turnovers. It's safe to say the performance didn't help the redshirt sophomore's draft stock.\n\nWhen asked about his draft decision after the game, Moore said he hadn't made a decision yet.\n\n“At the end of the day, I don’t know my decision yet.”\n\nDante Moore on his future ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/W1r22EaepO\n\n— FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) January 10, 2026\n\n\"I'm going to soak this moment up and, most importantly, give my hugs and thank yous to my teammates. But at the end of the day, I don't know my decision yet. I'm going to talk to coach Lanning and talk to my family and everybody, but at the end of the day I don't want to think about that right now.\"\n\nAs of now, Moore still looms as a candidate to go second overall to the New York Jets, but his performance on Friday laid bare some concerns around his game.\n\nAfter a rough freshman year at UCLA and a redshirt year under Dillon Gabriel last season, Moore had impressed all season with his arm strength, accuracy, athleticism and command of the Oregon offense. However, he was never pressured in the pocket like he was against Indiana, and the results were ugly.\n\n— Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) January 10, 2026\n\nOregon would surely welcome Moore back for a junior season and at only 20 years old, he still has plenty of time to get to the NFL. The decision is shaping up to be one of the biggest among all underclassmen in this year's draft cycle.\n\nAs for Mendoza, you can probably guess where he's going after a dream season in which he's led Indiana to a 15-0 record while winning the Heisman Trophy.",

    "fullText": "Trae Young reveals why he wanted to be traded to Wizards originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStar guard Trae Young raised some eyebrows when it was reported that his preferred trade destination was the Washington Wizards. Players don’t typically want to get traded to Washington. If anything, the opposite is usually the case.\n\nBut, Young wanted the Wizards, and he ultimately got his wish, as the Atlanta Hawks relocated him to Washington earlier this week.\n\nDuring his introductory press conference with the Wizards, Young explained what it was about Washington that was attractive to him.\n\n“I’m just super excited. For me, D.C. is overlooked as far as a big market. In the NBA, I feel like this is a big market,” Young said. “I just feel like I’m coming into an opportunity to be myself. I’m around people that obviously have known me for a long time and know the type of person I am and the type of winner I want to be.\n\n“And I know it's a day-by-day process. I know what it takes. It's not going to be easy. But I know this is a place that I'm excited about and I was excited about whenever I heard it could be a possibility.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen when Young when make his debut for the Wizards. He's dealing with a sprained knee and a quad bruise and hasn't appeared in a game since Dec. 27.\n\nWhen he does return, he’ll be sporting a different number. Young wore No. 11 during his time in Atlanta, but that number is retired in Washington, so he was forced to switch to No. 3.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how long Trae’s tenure in Washington will last. The four-time All-Star has a player option in his contract for next season, which he could turn down in favor of unrestricted free agency. Though, one would assume that the Wizards traded for Young with the intension of inking him to an extension.\n\nThe expectation around the league is that Young will indeed sign an extension with Washington, per ESPN, but it remains to be seen when that might happen.\n\nNBA legend blasts Hawks over Trae Young trade, labels them a 'mid' franchise\n\nLuka Doncic reacts to Trae Young trade to Washington Wizards\n\nCJ McCollum reacts to being traded to Atlanta Hawks for Trae Young",

    "description": "Lincoln boys basketball coach Neil Alexander is on the path to 1,000 victories, and he got one step closer Friday at Lanphier.",
    "fullText": "The first half of Lanphier’s boys basketball season may be filled with exasperation, but the Lions gave Lincoln everything the Railsplitters wanted.\n\nLincoln (14-3 overall, 5-1 in the Central State Eight Conference) pulled out a 35-31 win over Lanphier on Friday at Lober-Nika Gymnasium.\n\nLincoln coach Neil Alexander, who is approaching win No. 1,000 in his career, said there is no mystery why Lanphier gave Lincoln a tough, down-to-the-wire game.\n\n“It always is when Lanphier and Lincoln play,” Alexander said after picking up his 992nd career win. “It’s been a rivalry long before I was at Lincoln, and I’ve been there 35 years, so long before me and it always will be.\n\n“It’s fun. Both teams are very competitive, both teams play very good defense, and when you’ve got that, you’ve got the scoreboard reading what it does.”\n\nMore: ISU was right choice for Lincoln's Poole before run through FCS playoffs\n\nLanphier coach Blake Turner, himself a veteran of the game in his 14th season as the Lions’ head coach, doesn’t do moral victories. Lanphier, he says, should expect to win these types of games.\n\n“We’re not a disciplined team, we don’t play with that sense of urgency that Lanphier basketball fans are accustomed to, and it’s just frustrating at this point,” Turner said. “You want to try to grind them out.\n\n“We’re not into moral victories or (just) playing hard or playing teams close isn’t good enough and it’s not the standard for our program,” Turner said.\n\nKarson Komnick led Lincoln with 16 points while teammate Tate Aue had nine points, including one clutch 3-pointer from the volleyball line that gave Lincoln a 29-26 lead with 6 minutes, 22 seconds left. It was the first lead change since Lanphier’s Kaimen Smith put the Lions ahead 24-22 late in the third when he connected on a 3-pointer. After Aue made the shot, he let his Lanphier defender know.\n\nAlmost a minute later, Smith hit his third 3 and gave the nearest Lincoln player a verbal retort to the earlier exchange of words.\n\nThis time, the officials called a technical foul, and Lincoln took advantage of that to snap the 29-29 tie with four quick points from Komnick — two technical free throws and a layup off a backdoor cut — with 5 minutes, 15 seconds remaining.\n\n“We got more aggressive to the basket, we made things, and then we had the offensive rebound to tie it by (Komnick, tied it 24-24 15 seconds into the final period),” Alexander said. “Luckily we came out on top.”\n\nDemond Porter hit a transition layup with 45 seconds to get the Lions (5-11, 3-3 CS8) within 33-31. Brody Tungate split a pair of free throws and Camarie Richmond’s attempt at a game-tying 3 missed, went out of bounds with 6.0 seconds left. Komnick split his pair of free throws for the final tally and prevented a 3 from forcing overtime.\n\nMore: After nearly a quarter century away, Kevin Gordon happy back at Greenview\n\nKomnick said the Railers drew some motivation from the technical foul.\n\n“The two free throws helped us and after that, we just rolled and got the lead,” Komnick said, “(before Lanphier) came back a little bit.”\n\nLanphier held Lincoln to just two points in the third quarter as the Lions were able to regain the lead they lost early in the game. Richmond drained a floater to get Lanphier within 22-19, then had a pull-up jumper in transition on his next time down the floor.\n\nWith 2:37 left, Soriano Hayes was called for a charge about two minutes after Lanphier’s Anthony Peck tried to take a charge, but the officials sent Komnick to the free-throw line where he made the Railers’ lone points of the period. Turner was not happy with the Peck foul, but was especially perturbed with the one which went against Hayes.\n\n“I just we did a good job defensively, (but) I still wasn’t happy with the way we were running our offense; just undisciplined on offense, not getting the shots that we should get, not attacking the zone the way we wanted to attack. I thought we were too complacent and too laid back against it.”\n\nMore: Springfield High boys basketball coach suspended for IHSA violation\n\nSmith, however, made his 3 with 1:10 left in the quarter as Lanphier finished the quarter outscoring Lincoln 9-2. The fourth began with Komnick getting an offensive rebound and the putback before Hayes attacked the Lincoln defense and got to the rim just 11 seconds later. Bryce Vlahovich erased Lanphier’s last lead with a tough basket before Aue’s 3.\n\nThe City Tournament begins on Wednesday, Jan. 21, and Turner expects the prospect of a three-peat to help the team clean up some areas of its game.\n\n“We’re close, but close doesn’t get you anything in this game,” Turner said. “We’re back-to-back city champions, we’re going for a three-peat, something that hasn’t been done in a long time (Southeast was the last team to win three in a row outright from 1989-91).\n\n“Maybe that will give them the edge. With this team and being young and the lack of experience, I never know what to expect. Sometimes we play state championship basketball, sometimes we look like a freshman basketball team — sometimes in the same game — and you get everything in between.”\n\nContact Ryan Mahan: 788-1546, ryan.mahan@sj-r.com, Twitter.com/RyanMahanSJR.\n\nThis article originally appeared on State Journal-Register: Boys basketball: Old rivals clash as Lincoln tops Lanphier",

    "description": "High school boys basketball: Top-ranked Timpview doubles-up Orem in dominant region win",
    "fullText": "Over the past four years, every time Orem and Timpview have tangled on the court — including two playoff games — it has been must-see action, with the past 10 meetings decided by an average of 6.5 points.\n\nFriday night’s first meeting of the season in a packed Orem gym had a similar pregame buzz, but at the end of the day, nationally-ranked Timpview was the only must-see team on the floor.\n\nTimpview shot over 72% from the field and pushed the game to a running clock late in the third quarter in a dominant 72-36 road win over the Tigers.\n\nTimpview, ranked No. 16 nationally by MaxPreps, improved to 13-1 on the season with the resounding victory. Its only loss has come against No. 14 Redondo Union, California, in a pre-Christmas tournament in Las Vegas.\n\nDefense was the catalyst for Timpview’s big win over Orem.\n\n“I thought defensively we were as good as we’ve been all year, just guarding team defense,” said Timpview coach Brad Kitchen.\n\n“I don’t know if Orem played their best game tonight. I have a lot of respect for what (Tigers coach) Jace (Tavita) does. His teams are always well-coached. If a couple baskets go their way, it’s a different game, and so I don’t take anything for granted.”\n\nWill Openshaw led the way for Timpview with 21 points on 9 of 11 shooting, with Dean Rueckert adding 18 points and Mason Ford chipping in 13.\n\nOpenshaw recorded back-to-back dunks late in the second quarter that helped Timpview race out to a 40-16 halftime lead.\n\nAs good as Timpview was in November and December, an argument could be made that its past two games have been the most impressive of the season.\n\nWith a veteran group led by eight seniors, Timpview had very high expectations about winning the championship in the top group at the Tarkanian Classic in Las Vegas before Christmas, but fatigue caught up with the T-Birds in the title game on Dec. 23 as it shot just 6 of 35 from 3-point range.\n\nA win would’ve surely pushed Timpview into the top 10 nationally. With the loss though, Kitchen was curious what type of focus his players return with after getting a week off during the Christmas break.\n\nEven more specifically, he wondered how his group would respond after he scheduled them for a Jan. 2 game against Juan Diego with just one practice since that Redondo Union loss.\n\n“I told our guys, ‘This is my fault. I did a bad job scheduling this game because that’s a trap game, right?,” said Kitchen, “and our guys responded with laser focus. We’re not going to let this be the slip-up, and I was really proud that there wasn’t that letdown.”\n\nTimpview won 80-43, with Rueckert leading the way with 27 points.\n\n“Our guys were really great at being diligent in their craft. They were all doing their conditioning over the break, staying in shape. This is a really mature group of dudes. I have eight seniors and they lead and they’re a great example for my young guys in this program,” said Kitchen.\n\nWith a full week off since that Juan Diego win, Timpview was chomping at the bit to get back after it — especially against an Orem team it lost to twice last season.\n\nAlready leading comfortably midway through the second quarter 21-12, Timpview blew the game wide open to close the first half as it scored on eight straight possessions over a four-minute stretch to push the lead to 40-14 with a 19-2 run.\n\nRueckert accounted for 11 of those 19 points, with Openshaw slamming down two emphatic dunks. Many of the buckets came in transition after great defensive stops at the other end.\n\n“We had a couple very individual stellar efforts, Lincoln Holcombe and Will Openshaw, really doing a great job and even (Rueckert),” said Kitchen.\n\n“Deano always gets all the accolades for how he scores the ball. Deano did an excellent job guarding Simeon (Suguturaga) who’s their leading scorer.\n\n“He’s a problem, and Deano did a great job, so I was just really proud of the way we guarded and that translated to being able to play in transition and how we want to play.”\n\nTimpview shot 71% in the first half in building the 40-16 lead.\n\nOrem, meanwhile, struggled against Timpview’s length defensively, shooting just 23%. A bunch of those misses came on contested shots at the rim.\n\nKitchen acknowledged that on a different day — perhaps in the rematch next month — those shots at the rim could easily go in and it could be an entirely different game.\n\nAt the end of the day though, Timpview’s first-year coach said Friday’s game exemplified everything the team has been building toward this season — even while acknowledging it’s one win and there are bigger goals.\n\n“We’re trying to play this team brand of basketball where we don’t care who gets the shot, we just care that we get a shot that is good, high quality, that we like, so that’s kind of our goal in all we’re doing, we’re just trying to get a little bit better every day,” said Kitchen.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to snap the school’s 15-year state title drought.",

    "fullText": "Indiana left no doubt Friday night, rolling No. 5 Oregon 56–22 in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl to move within one win of a national title.\n\nThe Hoosiers struck immediately when D’Angelo Ponds returned an interception for a touchdown on Oregon’s first offensive snap. Indiana scored touchdowns on five straight possessions, four before halftime, to build a 35–7 lead.\n\nHeisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza threw five touchdown passes, while Oregon quarterback Dante Moore struggled under pressure, committing three first-half turnovers despite passing for 285 yards and two scores. Indiana repeatedly turned short fields into points.\n\nThe 56 points were the most Oregon has allowed in 41 postseason games and the most since Washington scored 70 in 2016. As soon as the final whistle blew on the Hoosiers’ 56–22 College Football Playoff semifinal win, fans turned their attention to the next target: Miami.\n\nWith Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, one of the Hurricanes’ most iconic legends, looming as symbolic motivation, Indiana fans made it clear they believe the belt is coming north.\n\nIrvin has used the phrase “belt to a*s” and the accompanying motion as a declaration of dominance, particularly when speaking about Miami’s swagger and physicality. But after watching Indiana dismantle Oregon on a national stage, Hoosier fans warned Miami that the belt is changing hands.\n\n“Indiana gonna whoop Miami. They gonna take the belt from Michael Irvin,” one fan commented. “The Philly Special,” one said while referring to a video of a Hoosier fan absolutely demolishing a toy duck. “MIAMI IS NEXT,” another warned.\n\nIndiana didn’t just beat Oregon in the Peach Bowl; they humiliated a program that entered the College Football Playoff riding momentum and confidence. By the time the fourth quarter arrived, the outcome was long decided, and the Ducks were simply trying to survive the night.\n\nIndiana (15–0) advances to the College Football Playoff Championship Game, where it will face Miami (13–2) on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nOregon (13–2), meanwhile, heads into the offseason following another lopsided postseason loss. A year after a 41–21 Rose Bowl defeat to Ohio State, the Ducks saw their title hopes end again in emphatic fashion. Both of Oregon’s losses this season came against Indiana, each by double-digit margins, despite the Ducks recording the third 13-win season in program history.\n\nThe post “They Gonna Take the Belt From Michael Irvin”: Indiana Fans Warn Miami After Crushing Oregon in Semis appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Fernando Mendoza and the Hoosiers have once again laid waste to one of the best teams in college football. And only one remains.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA — The air horn at Mercedes-Benz Stadium blasted for the first time Friday night after just 11 seconds. It’s a distinct, piercing sound with a unique local story, ringing through the sky here after every touchdown.\n\nThis city began to sprout up from the ground nearly two centuries ago because it is where the Western & Atlantic railroad made its last stop. With a stake hammered into the ground, they originally called it Terminus — the end of the line.\n\nSince erecting this modern football palace nine years ago and adding the train horn to commemorate how it all began, nearly every great college football team has come through Atlanta on its way to a national title.\n\nBut none have embodied that sound quite like Indiana.\n\nSleek and efficient, powerful and unrelenting, the Indiana Hoosiers — yes, the Indiana Hoosiers — are barreling down the tracks like a locomotive running late for a date with destiny, blowing that horn as a warning to any creature in its path.\n\nHey, after 139 years of mostly bad Indiana football, what’s another 10 days to become the most mesmerizing national champion we’ve ever seen?\n\nPerhaps the Jan. 19 national championship game against Miami will become something other than a Hoosier coronation. But after Indiana’s tour de force through the College Football Playoff, including a savage 56-22 beatdown of Oregon here in the Peach Bowl, rarely have we encountered a college football team that looks and feels more inevitable than this one.\n\n“They’re complete,” Oregon coach Dan Lanning said. “They do a lot, and they do it really, really well. There’s not a weakness in their game. They run the ball well, they stop the run well, they throw the ball well, they defend the pass well, they've been good on special teams. They obviously have a ton of belief, and deservedly so. They’re really good.”\n\nOregon, it turned out, never really had a chance.\n\nWhen these two teams played in mid-October, with Indiana winning 30-20 on the road in Autzen Stadium, the game was competitive enough to make a dramatic rematch seem plausible.\n\nBut it took 11 seconds to realize Indiana football has subsequently evolved into something different. It is now a weapon sharpened for dissection, a machine built for humiliation, deployed with confidence and precision as its coach stalks the sideline with an eternal expression of annoyance.\n\nOn the first play from scrimmage, Indiana cornerback D’Angelo Ponds — one of the many players who followed coach Curt Cignetti from James Madison to Indiana two years ago — read the eyes of Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, jumped the route and snagged a pick-6 to trip that air horn for the first time.\n\nThen Indiana did it four more times before the first half concluded, each one chipping away at Oregon’s belief until it became a myth. By the time both teams went to the locker room with the Hoosiers leading 35-7, the only point of comparison for a CFP semifinal in this building was LSU’s 63-28 win over Oklahoma six years ago.\n\nSince that season, 2019 LSU has remained the gold standard for modern-era college football dominance, a team so ruthless in the way it attacked opponents that most realized after awhile they never had a chance in the first place.\n\nIndiana is one more performance like this from taking their crown.\n\n“A lot of people [who doubted us] really don't know our team,” Cignetti said. “They don't know what we're made of, what we got, and I get it. There was a lot of skepticism after last year that we were a fluke. That team did a lot of great things and got it all started. We’ve just built off our successes, and we've won some big games on the road, and it helps when you have a quarterback play his best football when the game's online in the fourth quarter. And so, you know, here we are.”\n\nPlayer for player, the Hurricanes will believe they’re the better team based on recruiting rankings, physical size and NFL Draft stock. But so did Oregon and Alabama, which lost to the Hoosiers by a combined 69 points in this playoff.\n\nWith Indiana, it’s not about the measurables. All season long, the Hoosiers have been a nuclear missile of execution and attitude, mocking anyone who dared not believe a program with a litany of laments and losing seasons could turn into this juggernaut practically overnight.\n\nIt was the seventh time against an FBS opponent this year Indiana has won by 30 or more points, and at every turn, they’ve thirsted for more. Beating Ohio State to become Big Ten champs for the first time since 1967? Not enough. A Rose Bowl romp over Alabama? They expected it long before we realized it was possible.\n\nEven when this game against Oregon was well in hand in the fourth quarter, Indiana kept delivering indignities. Only after one final 24-yard touchdown run by Kaelon Black, which drew the slightest smile from Cignetti’s lips with 5:14 to go, had Indiana’s appetite been satisfied. For a little while, anyway.\n\n“Our philosophy is to attack,” Cignetti said. “The reason we are where we are is because we prepared the right way, and that's why we've been able to meet the challenge and put it on the field.”\n\nAnd when the game finally ended, it looked like the most perfunctory of Indiana’s three big celebrations this postseason. This wasn’t like the relief of conquering the Big Ten or the sheer joy of reducing college football’s most iconic brand to a bystander in Pasadena. This was the moment before the moment, the one that seems poised to stamp Indiana as the greatest turnaround story maybe in the history of American sports.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any time to celebrate because this is what everybody dreams of,” Mendoza said.\n\nNow just one game remains as the Indiana train rolls through Atlanta, headed to Miami at maximum speed. To Terminus and beyond.",

Now that might be a clue as to what age/generation I am, because I’m not sure it’s the same now.\n\nWhether it’s the lack of giant killing, or the Champions League gaining traction (i.e. prize money) or the fact that half the Premier League could qualify for one of the European competitions, or we could simply blame Manchester United for just not bothering a quarter of a century ago – but the fact is, it’s just lost a bit of that magic.\n\nBut, after midweek it feels like the distraction of the FA Cup couldn’t have better timing for both clubs.\n\nOur midweek trip to Brentford was strange. The performance wasn’t that different from what we’ve seen in a few away fixtures recently, such as Brighton and Spurs. We stayed in the game and waited for our chance – something we’ve been good at taking advantage of, but on this occasion, we didn’t take the chance and collapsed in on ourselves afterwards.\n\nEverton probably thought they’d have a comfortable evening entertaining Premier League whipping boys Wolves, but the visitors claimed their seventh point of the season, and it could/should have been more after Everton went down to nine men in the later stages.\n\nIt was only four years ago when we were getting knocked out in the first round before the festive season by Mansfield Town and we haven’t had much luck in the FA Cup in recent years, having just got past the third round once in the last ten years, but this weekend a fifth of Premier League clubs will exit the competition and with the league table shaping up the way it is we’d all enjoy a good cup run.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 23/10 to win the game, while Everton are priced at 23/20, and the draw is 2/1.\n\n[Calvert-Lewin 39’, 52’, Niasse 83’]\n\nSunderland: Steele, Love, Jones, Kone, Matthews, Honeyman (Williams), Gibson, Ndong, Rodwell (McManaman), Gooch, Vaughan (Robson) Substitutes not used: Ruiter, Oviedo, Cattermole, Asoro\n\nEverton: Stekelenburg, Kenny, Holgate, Klaassen, Keane, Williams, Besic, Davies, Ramirez (Lookman), Calvert-Lewin (Niasse), Vlasic (Lennon) Substitutes not used: Robles, Martina, Gueye, Sigurdsson\n\nIf this was a few years ago I reckon it would have gone to a replay.",

    "description": "For the second year in a row, Oregon was blown out in the College Football Playoff when it fell to Indiana. Where do the Ducks go from here.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA — Oregon will chew on this one for 239 days, reliving a 56-22 blowout loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl again and again until its 2026 season kicks off against Boise State on Sept 5.\n\nIf only these new Hoosiers were still the same-old Hoosiers. If only. The Indiana program’s evolution into a Power Four devourer of worlds was the one hurdle in the Ducks’ path during a season that can split into two camps: on one side, two losses in two games against Hoosiers; on the other, 13 wins in as many tries against everyone else.\n\nOregon bulldozed No. 12 seed James Madison in the opening round of the College Football Playoff and then did the same to No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl. But Indiana presented a challenge Oregon couldn’t overcome. That no one else has conquered the Hoosiers doesn’t make this one any easier to swallow.\n\nPATH TO PLAYOFF: \n“I think it's probably too premature for me to speak on what happened tonight until I go back and really evaluate it,” said Oregon coach Dan Lanning. “I also think you can't discredit that we played well. We've played well at times even here in the postseason. Yeah, there will be an opportunity for reflection and evaluation, but I couldn't speak on that right now.”\n\nOn the heels of a second one-sided playoff loss to a Big Ten foe in as many years — the 2024 Ducks went unbeaten in the regular season and won the conference but suffered a 41-24 loss to Ohio State in the Rose Bowl that was over in the first half — Oregon can only wonder:\n\nHow did this happen? And what do we have to change to finally capture an elusive national title?\n\n“Man, you hurt for those guys because the world is going to judge everybody in that room based on the result tonight,” said Lanning. “They're not failures. These guys won a lot of damn ball games. They've had a lot of success. They've changed some peoples' lives, but right now, that moment is going to hurt.”\n\nThe first question is easy to answer. Indiana is unquestionably the better team, defying recruiting rankings that heavily favor Oregon. In every way and on nearly every play, the Hoosiers dictated the terms to the Ducks, just as they did earlier this month in a similar rout of No. 9 seed Alabama in the Rose Bowl.\n\nBut in addition to being more physical and more explosive on both sides of the ball, Indiana was unmoved by the high-pressure stakes that have come with each new achievement this team has unlocked during a breathtaking 2025 season.\n\nThe same can’t be said of Oregon. To suffer another meltdown on this stage raises significant concerns about the Ducks’ preparedness and mindset in neutral-site games against the best of the best.\n\n“Man, I feel like the gameplan we had was awesome,” said Oregon guard Dave Iuli. “I just feel like, you know, we went out there and didn’t execute our jobs. Usually, when it comes to critical moments like this with three teams left or four teams left, the biggest thing is executing. Once people stopped executing, we stopped winning.”\n\nQuarterback Dante Moore tossed a pick-six on the first play from scrimmage. He fumbled with 9:29 left in the second quarter to goose an Indiana touchdown drive that put the Hoosiers up 21-7. He fumbled again about seven minutes later to set up another touchdown, making it 35-7 at the half.\n\nWith lead running backs Noah Whittington and Jordon Davison unable to play due to injury, backups Dierre Hill Jr. and Jay Harris combined for 121 yards on 21 carries. But the Ducks ran for 93 yards on 3.6 yards per carry as a team, counting sacks, with 71 yards coming on a Hill run in the third quarter when they were down 35 points.\n\nOffensively, Oregon was wobbled early and remained off-balance the rest of the way, unable to regain its footing as Indiana pinned its ears back and threw the kitchen sink at Moore.\n\n“They have a great defense, great disguise and different looks, but you can't win football games if you're causing turnovers,” Moore said. “But overall, I mean, Indiana’s defense is great, defensive coordinator, but at the end of the day, we beat ourselves.”\n\nDefensively, a group that engulfed the Duke and the Red Raiders was helpless against Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza and a brilliant, steady-handed receiver corps headed by Elijah Sarrat (75 yards and two touchdowns), Omar Cooper Jr. (one score) and Charlie Becker (48 yards and two scores).\n\nWhile the Hoosiers had three sacks and 10 tackles for loss, Oregon’s defensive front barely sniffed Mendoza, who continued his Joe Burrow-like postseason run by hitting on 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards and five touchdowns. Through two playoff games, he has more touchdowns, eight, than incompletions, five.\n\nAnd while the Ducks committed three game-changing giveaways in the first half, Indiana continued to play nearly perfect football. The Hoosiers turned the ball over with a fumble on their 18th play from scrimmage in the season opener against Old Dominion but have not lost a fumble since.\n\nAdding insult to injury, an Oregon punt near its own goal line in the fourth quarter was blocked by Indiaan, which then scored on a short Mendoza pass to Sarratt for a third touchdown drive lasting fewer than 22 yards.\n\n“Yeah, it sucks right now,” said linebacker Bryce Boettcher. “I'm not going to lie. Not how I envisioned it whatsoever. Obviously prepared to win, and Indiana was a better team tonight. Doesn't take away from our season. We had one heck of a season.”\n\nIt's possible to look at this loss with a slightly optimistic slant: Oregon was minus-three in turnover margin and doomed its own chances against the No. 1-ranked team in the country. The loss hurts, sure, but the Ducks have still gone 26-3 since joining the Big Ten last season. There is no question this is an elite program.\n\nYet regular-season success is just not translating to the postseason. As the Ducks head into a crucial offseason defined by their ability to rebuild a roster set to be picked apart by graduation and early NFL draft entries, Lanning’s biggest charge will be assessing and fixing the flaws that have led to two humbling playoff losses in as many years.\n\nOne common thread has been a flat and sluggish start. The Buckeyes buried the Ducks by taking a 34-0 lead in the second quarter of last January’s Rose Bowl. Indiana led by 28 at the break. While the Ducks flopped out of the gate and never recovered, the Hoosiers resembled an unstoppable, merciless, Terminator-like machine that craves to not just beat their opponent but bury them.\n\nTo say the Ducks were simply outmanned by one eventual champion in Ohio State and a potentially historic squad in Indiana is way too tidy an explanation. That excuse works for the have-nots in the Big Ten and elsewhere, teams that expect to be body-slammed by the best of the best in the Power Four.\n\nThat’s not Oregon. The Ducks have higher aspirations; in fact, the program rightfully believes it can beat anyone, anywhere, under any conditions, after spending most of this century knocking on the door of the national title.\n\nBut it was one thing to reach the title game against Auburn in the Bowl Championship Series era and against Ohio State in the first year of the four-team playoff format. Winning the 12-team reboot requires much more: Teams need to be almost perfectly constructed and mentally unflappable to thrive against this gauntlet.\n\nAgain, that’s not Oregon, which is built to reach this point but not to advance. For a program that believes a title is part of its destiny, this loss should trigger a long offseason of soul-searching, with plenty of questions but no obvious answers.\n\n“I think every man can learn from adversity. I just told that whole locker room, right, this is going to be about how you respond in life,” said Lanning.\n\n“This is going to be a life lesson that a lot of people never get. We just got our butt kicked. Right? That's going to happen in life, right, and not just Dante. Every single person in the locker room, every coach, every person can learn, ‘Hey, how do you respond to that?’”\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Oregon after CFP blowout loss in Peach Bowl faces soul-searching",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSteph Curry and the Golden State Warriors took care of business on Friday night against the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe matchup was a cakewalk for Curry’s Warriors, as they issued the Kings their 30th loss of the year. It was done in blowout fashion, as Golden State won 137-103.\n\nAfter the game, Curry was asked about the Warriors-Kings “rivalry.” Clearly, the former MVP doesn’t see the battle as anything more than two California teams facing off.\n\n“Geographically, yes,” Curry said when asked if the Kings and the Warriors are rivals. “That's about it.”\n\nThe Warriors and the Kings have faced each 418 times in the history of their existence. The all-time record for the battle isn’t as lopsided as it would seem. The Warriors have 220 wins, while the Kings have 198. Considering playoff and championship success, it's clearly not close.\n\nMore NBA:Kings still pursuing Warriors' Jonathan Kuminga\n\nIt’s been quite a while since Golden State has dominated the series to the point where they didn’t even let the Kings get one on them. Back in 2021-2022, the Warriors swept the Kings, and only allowed for one win out of four games in the following year.\n\nSince then, it’s been a split series throughout the regular season. The Warriors’ win on Friday night was their first over the Kings this year, as they lost to Sacramento on November 5.\n\nCurry checked in for 32 minutes. He shot 10-21 from the field, and knocked down six of his 12 shots from beyond the arc. The veteran guard produced 27 points, 10 assists, one steal, and one block.\n\nThe Kings and the Warriors will go head-to-head again on April 7. The series will close out on April 10, with a finale in Sacramento, California.\n\nFixing the Warriors with a 3-team trade featuring LaMelo Ball and Zion Williamson\n\nNets predicted to cut ties with Michael Porter Jr. via trade to Warriors\n\nWarriors' Jonathan Kuminga approach continues to botch trade value",

    "fullText": "When I decided to write about Enzo Le Fee earlier in the week, the intention was to laud him for his exceptional form and how he has bounced back after being left out for the Premier League opener against West Ham.\n\nHowever, this is football, and in a matter of days, our once-record signing has been receiving pelters (understandably) for his ridiculous Panenka attempt against Brentford.\n\nFootball is all about timing, and while there is arguably never a great time to take such a penalty, doing so while your team is 1-0 down away from home is ill-advised.\n\nNevertheless, I think it would be fair to forgive Le Fee and move on from his costly mistake, as he has plenty of credit in the bank for his displays this campaign.\n\nJust don’t do it again, Enzo, please.\n\nThere have been many moments in the last year that I have found hard to believe, and one of those was signing the former AS Roma man on a permanent deal.\n\nIt is almost a year to the day that we signed our midfield maestro on an initial loan with an obligation to buy, hinging on promotion.\n\nWhile I had not seen him play, there was sizeable hype about his ability, with those around me assuring me that Chelsea had been linked with his services, so therefore he must be elite.\n\nSure enough, they were spot on.\n\nIn terms of ability, it would be hard to find a more naturally gifted player to have graced the Championship. His close control and touch were up there with Adel Taraabt, Jack Grealish and Emi Buendia.\n\nGiven how ridiculous Enzo was in the second tier, the injury that thwarted his impact, and our woeful end-of-season form, I didn’t have much hope of promotion or, therefore, signing him permanently.\n\nHowever, 2025 was all about miracles for Sunderland, and after a couple of godly moments in the play-offs, Le Fee became our record signing at £19.3million before Habib Diarra took that mantle.\n\nWhen the deal went through, the 25-year-old and the bulk of Black Cats supporters would have assumed that his place in Regis Le Bris’ side was a formality, but then the transfer window and Noah Sadiki happened.\n\nIndeed, there were murmurings in pre-season that Sadiki looked like a generational talent and that the gaffer would bench Le Fee in favour of the DR Congo international.\n\nSure enough, those murmurings came to fruition, with Regis opting for Granit Xhaka, Diarra and Sadiki in a midfield three, with Chemsdine Talbi and Simon Adingra out wide.\n\nThat decision must have hurt Enzo, and while he could have sulked, instead, he has put his head down, adapted and reemerged stronger than ever.\n\nIronically, it was against the Bees in August when the former Lorient man made his mark in the Premier League, with his penalty and overall performance showcasing exactly what he is capable of.\n\nSince then, Le Fee’s overall statistics have been encouraging, too, as the midfielder has six goal contributions and ranks in the top 15 players in the division for chances created per 90, which is more than Bruno Guimaraes, Antoine Semenyo and Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nOf course, he has had the odd quiet game, but who hasn’t?\n\nOn his day, the 26-year-old has been majestic, whether it is picking out a key pass, making a run in behind or linking up with Brian Brobbey, he looks a natural in the top flight.\n\nNow, the little magician has endured his latest setback, and this one will require an even bigger reaction, but I’m confident that Enzo will come back fighting.",

    "description": "Everton Away, FA Cup Round 3 — how do our writers see this one going?",
    "fullText": "Score prediction: Everton 2 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mundle\n\nWho knows what sort of team we’re going to be putting out today, but it’s likely to have a few changes in there and quite rightly so. If the FA really want teams to take the competition seriously again there shouldn’t be any other fixtures the week before or after each round.\n\nSo, we are likely to see a few changes, and I suspect a narrow defeat. On the positive side of things, a few players will get some minutes in their legs, including Mundle, who I think will get our goal.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 1 Sunderland 1 (AET, SAFC win on pens)\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mayenda\n\nBrentford was a low day for all, but this team is highly likely to be a very different XI plus subs.\n\nI am hoping that as a wider squad we rotate and get a win on the board somehow, while allowing rest for those who need it. Any win against Moyes has to be a good one.\n\nMayenda has done well coming on wide on the right of late, but we know how much he loves a lung-busting and very physical run as the centre forward from his Championship performances.\n\nI am backing Eli to get us a goal in a tight game, which I think will go into extra time (not that either side needs that) and I hope we will nick it on pens, putting to bed the whole chapter about Le Fee and his attempt at a bit of flai,r which backfired as we all saw.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 0 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Traore\n\nEveryone has gone a bit crazy after the defeat mid-week. Yes, it was a poor penalty, but these things happen. It’s not so long ago Wilson Isidor missed two in one match. We’re tired after playing three games in six days, and this is likely going to be a rotated eleven.\n\nIt’s tough to predict games like this, as you have no idea who will play and how we will approach it. Similarly, you have to ask the same question of Everton, so who knows how it will ultimately unfold.\n\nI’ll go for us to win, as everyone generally expects us to throw the game, but we’ll go classic Sunderland and throw a spanner in the works by actually winning.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 0 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mayenda\n\nNew stadium, same Everton, who will be there for the taking. We’ll make changes, because half the squad has played enough minutes to last a lifetime, but there’s still enough spark in the side to nick something.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 0 Sunderland 1 (AET)\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mayenda\n\nThere will be some within the fanbase who will be hoping we go near full strength today, to try our luck at a nice little cup run. I think those fans will be disappointed. I see us rotating heavily today and resting those who have played so many games in so little time.\n\nWill Everton do the same? I suspect they will, for the same reasons as we. Two of those were enforced by red cards handed out against Wolves.\n\nI have absolutely no idea how this goes. I don’t think it will be a thriller by any means, though. Through hope more than belief, I’ll back us to win it after extra time and throw our name in the pot for the next round.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 2 Sunderland 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: N/A\n\nI’m so downhearted after Brentford that I cannot see us beating a depleted Everton squad with our very own depleted squad. Everton have been on such a bad run that they’ll view this as a way to turn their season around.\n\nWe’ll give it a good go, but I reckon Xhaka will be rested and we’ll be left without a real vibesman pulling the strings as good as the Granit. Sorry.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 0 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mayenda\n\nAfter an awful trip to Brentford, hopefully we can put that aside and give nearly 8,000 travelling supporters a lot to cheer about.\n\nScore predictions in the cup feel like a complete lottery. I have no idea what type of team RLB intends to field. If ever there was a time to go full-strength in the cup, though, it’s now, as there’s no reason to focus on the league and survival as a priority over a good cup run at this point.\n\nUnfortunately, if we are looking at starting our best XI, the timing of this game is far from ideal, given how fatigued we’ve started to look after a gruelling festive schedule, coinciding with AFCON, which has forced us into deploying the same personnel for most of that period.\n\nRLB will have to strike the right balance of freshening things up and selecting the best team to progress. Hopefully Everton, with the suspensions of Keane and Grealish, find themselves in a similar boat to even things out.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 1 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Dan Neil\n\nWho the hell plays in this one? Do we think we’ve done enough in the league to go for a cup run?\n\nDo any of the lads who are coming back from AFCON get in the team? Can RLB squeeze anymore out of those tired limbs we saw on Wednesday night?\n\nAre Everton going to look to rest players, or are they up for the cup? Does Le Fee take the first penalty if it gets that far?..\n\nOne thing I do know, the lads will be backed by over 7000 passionate away fans, daring to dream of another trip to Wembley in May.\n\nWorth remembering also that after every defeat this season, we’ve won the next game (against Premier League opposition). So I look forward to seeing us in the big plastic bowl for the 4th round draw.\n\nThe less we say about the loss away to Brentford, the better.\n\nThe squad have done really well across the AFCON challenge period, but this was one game too many, with a tired squad and against a very in-form team.\n\nAdd in the penalty we didn’t convert, which Brobbey won at a time when momentum was really swinging in our favour, and it was all just too much across too short a period with too little resource to cope. That penna miss was a step too far for even us to come back from.\n\nWe draw a line, thank the lads for the 30 points we already have, and have a go at this cup game, getting the less-used lads some time on the grass, and welcome rest for those who need it.\n\nNot a lot of predictions lads shouted for a loss at the Gtech, so not many points for the lads from that miserable day in West London.\n\n“Happy Gary” did go for a loss, but not 3-0, so gets a point for that. Quite a few missed out on one point for FGS with the penalty not being converted by Enzo.\n\nThe man is a legend in the making. We all move on and take it on the chin for me.\n\nGary extends his lead to 2 points by being Mr Happy.\n\nRest of the table stays as is, so we move on to Cup action, and the chances of a first SAFC goal scorer point get even more challenging!\n\nJust a quick reminder of how we allocate points to our match-by-match predictions:\n\nCorrect outcome (but not correct score) = One point\n\nCorrect first Sunderland goalscorer = One point (no goalscorer is a valid call)\n\nPossible deductions for being lazy and not submitting on time = a two-point deduction.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter years of Chiefs dominance in the AFC, there’s a new heavyweight making waves.\n\nThe Broncos enjoyed a splendid 2025 campaign, besting all but three foes en route to an AFC West crown and the top seed in the AFC playoff bracket. Denver’s success largely stems from its harrowing defense, which surrendered fewer points than all but two teams. The Broncos boast a host of gifted talents across their rearguard, from reigning Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II to linebacking standouts Alex Singleton and Nik Bonitto.\n\nSean Payton’s side fancies itself a Super Bowl contender. Its record would seem to support that assessment, as the roster looks to improve on last year’s defeat in the wild-card round.\n\nWith that, here’s what you need to know about the Broncos’ playoff schedule, including who they face next in postseason play.\n\nSN's expert predictions for NFL playoffs, Super Bowl 60\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nIt's currently unclear who the Broncos will play when they begin their pilgrimage through postseason play in the divisional round. They'll be matched up against the lowest-seeded team still remaining after wild-card play. Who will that be? It's anyone's guess at the moment.\n\nAfter finishing with a 14-3 record and outgunning the Patriots via tiebreakers, Denver landed the top seed in the AFC. That gives Sean Payton's side home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, as well as a bye week during the wild-card round. While it's unknown exactly what day and time they'll play when the divisional round starts on Jan. 25, the Broncos' game will be available to watch on Fubo.\n\nFor a limited time, you can get your first month of Fubo for as low as $59.99, a $25 savings.

    "description": "We’re predicting four changes to the starting line up this afternoon…",
    "fullText": "Today’s game offers us a big chance to progress in the FA Cup, and I do think we should take the competition seriously this season. A decent draw or two could see us get to the latter stages, and who doesn’t love a cup run? Regis has players coming back from the AFCON plus some in need of a rest after a busy schedule, so who will we see in the starting XI today?\n\nRoefs should be in goal today. He’s our number one and if we’re taking things seriously he’ll be in the team. Although he’s played every league game he’s not going to be fatigued like outfield players, so there’s no reason to make a change here.\n\nDan Ballard still looked to be carrying an injury at Brentford, while Omar Alderete looked tired and completely off his game – he’s played a lot of football in recent weeks so could maybe be on the bench for this one. We won’t want to make wholesale changes, so I think Mukiele could be partnered by Geertruida in the centre of defence, with Trai Hume at right back and the returning Reinilido slotting back in at left back.\n\nIn midfield we hae the opportunity to give Chris Rigg a run out in his more favoured position, and I think we will see him partner Granit Xhaka in the middle of the part today – potentially Noah Sadiki will come on to replace Xhaka after an hour or so. Enzo will want to shake off the Brentford disappointment too, so will play in his usual role as well.\n\nBrian Brobbey has been excellent over recent weeks, but has been carrying a slight hamstring injury by all accounts, so we may take the opportunity to let him have a breather today. Mayenda’s been impressive over the past month and I think we’ll see him start up front. Traore’s back from AFCON and will likely resume his role on the right of the attack, while on the left Mundle could get the chance to get more minutes in his legs and stake his claim before Talbi and Diarra are back in contention. I really like Mundle but he’s looked off the pace since returning from injury – so this will be a good opportunity to really assess where he’s at.",

    "description": "A toothless Sunderland side failed to fire against Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool at the Stadium of Light",
    "fullText": "Simon Mignolet, Jordan Henderson and Fabio Borini all returned to Wearside to play at a windy Stadium of Light on this day in 2015. In particular, the presence of Borini in the Liverpool team was quite the surprise, given that he had barely had a look in despite opting against a much mooted return to Gus Poyet’s team after a successful loan spell the previous season.\n\nBorini’s decision against returning to Sunderland was a bitter pill to swallow for the fans as the team looked glaringly toothless up until this point in the season. Connor Wickham had been given the reins as the team’s main centre forward, but his inability to score consistently has resulted in the team having to grind out draws due to the limited attacking play that they can muster up.\n\nAfter Liverpool’s new signing Lazar Markovic gave them an eighth-minute lead, it became extremely difficult for the home side to threaten in any way in a first half that saw the team barely create any opportunity on the Liverpool goal.\n\nIn fact, the game could have been over at halftime had Phillipe Coutinho and Steven Gerrard not been slightly wayward with their shooting. Henderson was ruling the midfield on his return to his boyhood club, and his control and leadership were beginning to frustrate our midfield, who were struggling to get near him.\n\nLiam Bridcutt – one of Poyet’s purchases – was sent off for two yellow cards early into the second half after two bad tackles ensured he was going for an early shower. Inexplicably, we began to improve in his absence and actually created some (half) decent opportunities.\n\nMoreover, it was the increase in energy that actually saw the fans get behind the team \n\nWith minutes to go, the opportunity arrived when a shot from outside the box bounced off the inside corner of Mignolet’s post and went out. Despite their first-half dominance, Liverpool were almost punished for not getting a second, and after the game, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers did lament his side’s inability to close the game out despite having ‘real good control of the game’\n\nAs for Poyet, with the transfer window open, a striker had to be certainly top of his wishlist given the team’s lack of prolificacy during the season thus far. The manager admitted there’s nothing much he could say when boos began to ring around the Stadium of Light after another poor attacking performance.\n\nIn addition, the Uruguayan admitted his dismay at how the team looked better when playing with ten men in comparison to when the numbers were even on the bench.\n\nIncredible. When you are 11 v 11 and have a better chance, sometimes you are a little bit too relaxed because you think it is even. Then, when you find yourself down to 10 the players bring something extra. It is a shame that we didn’t do that in the first half.\n\n“We did practically nothing in the first half apart from wait for Liverpool to score. Then we had a go.\n\nThis was a bad year to be a Sunderland season ticket holder, given the number of insipid performances that the team were showing on the pitch. As it transpired, the signing of Jermain Defoe – a proven goalscorer – was a masterstroke as the veteran English striker came and scored vital goals that kept the team above relegation places as the season came to its climax.",

    "description": "Depth returns at the right moment as competition reshapes matches and raises standards",
    "fullText": "There was a period earlier this season where looking at the FC Barcelona bench felt like staring into an empty cupboard. With Raphinha, Dani Olmo, Pedri, and Fermín López all sidelined, Hansi Flick was essentially coaching with one hand tied behind his back. When the starting XI hit a wall, there was no Plan B. It was just a hope that the tired legs on the pitch could somehow find a second wind.\n\nThe contrast now is startling. Since that humbling night at Stamford Bridge, where Barcelona lost to Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League, the vibe around the squad has shifted. They have rediscovered that suffocating, high-intensity press we saw last season, but with a crucial difference: they can actually maintain it for 90 minutes. It isn’t just about a tactical masterclass from Flick. It is about having the personnel to keep the foot on the gas when the starters start to fade.\n\nNothing encapsulated this new reality better than the Supercopa semifinal against Athletic Club. It is a rare luxury to look at your substitutes and see Robert Lewandowski, Dani Olmo, Lamine Yamal, and Marcus Rashford all sitting in tracksuits. The standout, however, was Roony Bardghji. A goal and two assists in a 5-0 rout is one way to remind the manager you are here. It is no wonder Fichajes is already reporting that Liverpool are sniffing around.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting subplot in this rotation is Marcus Rashford. While his scoring touch has cooled since that hot streak in early November, his buy-in to the “Flick way” has been total. According to reports, the club is already preparing to make his stay in Catalonia permanent this summer. Flick can’t seem to stop praising the Englishman’s attitude, often calling him an “absolute professional.” The manager recently shared a snippet of a private conversation that tells you everything you need to know about the current locker room culture. When told he’d be starting on the bench, Rashford reportedly told Flick that it was only about the team and that winning was the only thing that mattered.\n\nWe saw it again in the league against Espanyol. Flick brought on Lewandowski, Pedri, and Olmo to actually change the rhythm of the game. And who scored when the match was 0-0? Well, Olmo and Lewandowski, who made it a 2-0 win.\n\nIt leaves Barcelona in an enviable, if difficult, position. Between Ferran Torres, Raphinha, and the heavyweights mentioned before, there’s always a “next man up.” For the first time in a long time, the competition for places at the Ciutat Esportiva is as fierce as the matches themselves.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter returning from a hamstring injury earlier in the season, Jalen Green suddenly suffered another hamstring injury that has sidelined him since early November 2025. The injuries have limited his contributions in his first season with the Phoenix Suns, which is a shame because they are having a fantastic campaign.\n\nDuring his two games with the Suns so far, he was quite decent. Even when he was ramping up from the hamstring injury, he was showing promising flashes. He and Devin Booker seem like a fantastic backcourt, while Green and Dillon Brooks are now longtime teammates, dating back to their Houston Rockets days.\n\nGreen is a positive acquisition for the Suns. He was the central piece of the trade with Houston for Kevin Durant, but Brooks' breakout is also a welcome sight for the Suns. Now, they are firmly in the race for a postseason spot.\n\nGreen's return is a welcome sight for Phoenix, as he will provide a huge offensive boost to Ott's system. At the same time, the rotation will be deeper, something that Phoenix has been dealing with. Apart from Booker, they have needed a player to put pressure on defenders as a three-level scorer. Green is the right fit for that role.\n\nMore: NBA insider makes bold claim about Suns coach Jordan Ott\n\nCoach Ott is pleased to see Green progressing well in his recovery. He has been sidelined for a while, but he has been present for the Suns. The chemistry is good for the Suns, which could translate well when Green does return to the starting lineup soon.\n\n\"Jalen Green’s a really good player. He’s going to play as minutes, whatever minutes that is. He'll definitely be in the starting lineup as soon as he gets back and is ready to go. We gotta see exactly how that will turn out,\" Ott said ahead of Green's return.\n\nIt has been a frustrating season for Green because he was meant to showcase why he was the central piece in the trade for Durant. He has not gotten to show his ability outside of two limited games.\n\nNow that he is progressing well and Ott has shown his belief in Green, the future is bright for the Suns. The Milwaukee Bucks have shown some interest in scooping him up, but it is unlikely because the Suns would want to see what they have before deciding on that kind of move.\n\nDevin Booker ties Larry Bird with big accomplishment in Suns-Knicks\n\nSuns reportedly looking to trade veteran center\n\nTrade rumors: Bucks reach out to Suns for Jalen Green\n\nTrae Young reveals why he wanted to be traded to Wizards\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is the cornerstone of Jordi Fernandez's offense with the Nets",

Durant’s jumper with 7:57 left in the third gave him 31,422.\n\nAvdija hit a 3 to pull the Blazers to 99-98 with 3:54 left, then made four straight free throws to give Portland a 102-99 lead with 2:43 remaining.\n\nAmen Thompson, who had 24 points and nine rebounds, dunked to make it 102-101.\n\nPortland stretched the lead to 107-103 on Sidy Cissoko's dunk and held off Houston the rest of the way.\n\nThe teams also met on Wednesday with Portland winning 103-102. Tari Eason's tip-in as time ran out for Houston did not beat the buzzer upon replay review.\n\nPortland has been resilient despite a number of key injuries. The team hasn't had starting forward Jerami Grant since Dec. 18 because of Achilles tendinitis. Jrue Holiday, out with a calf strain since mid-November, was upgraded to doubtful but did not play.\n\nAfter a tight first half in which neither team led by double figures, the Rockets took an 86-74 lead on Durant's 3-pointer in the third quarter.\n\nPortland rallied in the final period, closing to 94-91 on Duop Reath's 3-pointer. Camara dunked to get the Blazers closer, but Durant answered with a 3 to keep the Rockets in front 97-93 with 5:32 left.\n\nThe Rockets visit Sacramento on Sunday night.\n\nThe Trail Blazers host the New York Knicks on Sunday.\n\nAP NBA: https://www.apnews.com/NBA",

Don't do this in production ツ\n\nPreviously, you could only use the new built-in with types:\n\nNow you can also use it with expressions:\n\nIf the argument expr is an expression of type T, then new(expr) allocates a variable of type T, initializes it to the value of expr, and returns its address, a value of type *T.\n\nThis feature is especially helpful if you use pointer fields in a struct to represent optional values that you marshal to JSON or Protobuf:\n\nYou can use new with composite values:\n\nPassing nil is still not allowed:\n\n𝗗 spec •\n𝗣 45624 •\n𝗖𝗟 704935, 704737, 704955, 705157 •\n𝗔 Alan Donovan\n\nGeneric functions and types take types as parameters:\n\nWe can further restrict these type parameters by using type constraints:\n\nPreviously, type constraints could't directly or indirectly refer to type parameters:\n\nA typical use case is a generic type that supports operations with arguments or results of the same type as itself:\n\nNow we can create a generic container with Ordered values and use it with any type that implements Less:\n\nThis makes Go's generics a bit more expressive.\n\n𝗣 68162, 75883 •\n𝗖𝗟 711420, 711422 •\n𝗔 Robert Griesemer\n\nThe new errors.AsType function is a generic version of errors.As:\n\nIt's type-safe and easier to use:\n\nAsType is especially handy when checking for multiple types of errors. It makes the code shorter and keeps error variables scoped to their if blocks:\n\nAnother issue with As is that it uses reflection and can cause runtime panics if used incorrectly (like if you pass a non-pointer or a type that doesn't implement error):\n\nAsType doesn't cause a runtime panic; it gives a clear compile-time error instead:\n\nAsType doesn't use reflect, executes faster, and allocates less than As:\n\nSince AsType can handle everything that As does, it's a recommended drop-in replacement for new code.\n\n𝗗 errors.AsType •\n𝗣 51945 •\n𝗖𝗟 707235 •\n𝗔 Julien Cretel\n\nThe new garbage collector (first introduced as experimental in 1.25) is designed to make memory management more efficient on modern computers with many CPU cores.\n\nGo's traditional garbage collector algorithm operates on graph, treating objects as nodes and pointers as edges, without considering their physical location in memory. The scanner jumps between distant memory locations, causing frequent cache misses.\n\nAs a result, the CPU spends too much time waiting for data to arrive from memory. More than 35% of the time spent scanning memory is wasted just stalling while waiting for memory accesses. As computers get more CPU cores, this problem gets even worse.\n\nGreen Tea shifts the focus from being processor-centered to being memory-aware. Instead of scanning individual objects, it scans memory in contiguous 8 KiB blocks called spans. The algorithm focuses on small objects (up to 512 bytes) because they are the most common and hardest to scan efficiently.\n\nEach span is divided into equal slots based on its assigned size class, and it only contains objects of that size class. For example, if a span is assigned to the 32-byte size class, the whole block is split into 32-byte slots, and objects are placed directly into these slots, each starting at the beginning of its slot. Because of this fixed layout, the garbage collector can easily find an object's metadata using simple address arithmetic, without checking the size of each object it finds.\n\nWhen the algorithm finds an object that needs to be scanned, it marks the object's location in its span but doesn't scan it immediately. Instead, it waits until there are several objects in the same span that need scanning. Then, when the garbage collector processes that span, it scans multiple objects at once. This is much faster than going over the same area of memory multiple times.\n\nTo make better use of CPU cores, GC workers share the workload by stealing tasks from each other. Each worker has its own local queue of spans to scan, and if a worker is idle, it can grab tasks from the queues of other busy workers. This decentralized approach removes the need for a central global list, prevents delays, and reduces contention between CPU cores.\n\nGreen Tea uses vectorized CPU instructions (only on amd64 architectures) to process memory spans in bulk when there are enough objects.\n\nBenchmark results vary, but the Go team expects a 10–40% reduction in garbage collection overhead in real-world programs that rely heavily on the garbage collector. Plus, with vectorized implementation, an extra 10% reduction in GC overhead when running on CPUs like Intel Ice Lake or AMD Zen 4 and newer.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find any public benchmark results from the Go team for the latest version of Green Tea, and I wasn't able to create a good synthetic benchmark myself. So, no details this time :(\n\nThe new garbage collector is enabled by default. To use the old garbage collector, set GOEXPERIMENT=nogreenteagc at build time (this option is expected to be removed in Go 1.27).\n\nIn the Go runtime, a processor (often referred to as a P) is a resource required to run the code. For a thread (a machine or M) to execute a goroutine (G), it must first acquire a processor.\n\nProcessors move through different states. They can be _Prunning (executing code), _Pidle (waiting for work), or _Pgcstop (paused because of the garbage collection).\n\nPreviously, processors had a state called _Psyscall used when a goroutine is making a system or cgo call. Now, this state has been removed. Instead of using a separate processor state, the system now checks the status of the goroutine assigned to the processor to see if it's involved in a system call.\n\nThis reduces internal runtime overhead and simplifies code paths for cgo and syscalls. The Go release notes say -30% in cgo runtime overhead, and the commit mentions an 18% sec/op improvement:\n\nI decided to run the CgoCall benchmarks locally as well:\n\nEither way, both a 20% and a 30% improvement are pretty impressive.\n\nAnd here are the results from a local syscall benchmark:\n\n𝗖𝗟 646198 •\n𝗔 Michael Knyszek\n\nThe Go runtime now has specialized versions of its memory allocation function for small objects (from 1 to 512 bytes). It uses jump tables to quickly choose the right function for each size, instead of relying on a single general-purpose implementation.\n\nThe Go release notes say \"the compiler will now generate calls to size-specialized memory allocation routines\". But based on the code, that's not completely accurate: the compiler still emits calls to the general-purpose mallocgc function. Then, at runtime, mallocgc dispatches those calls to the new specialized allocation functions.\n\nThis change reduces the cost of small object memory allocations by up to 30%. The Go team expects the overall improvement to be ~1% in real allocation-heavy programs.\n\nI couldn't find any existing benchmarks, so I came up with my own. And indeed, running it on Go 1.25 compared to 1.26 shows a significant improvement:\n\nThe new implementation is enabled by default. You can disable it by setting GOEXPERIMENT=nosizespecializedmalloc at build time (this option is expected to be removed in Go 1.27).\n\n𝗖𝗟 665835 •\n𝗔 Michael Matloob\n\nThe new simd/archsimd package provides access to architecture-specific vectorized operations (SIMD — single instruction, multiple data). This is a low-level package that exposes hardware-specific functionality. It currently only supports amd64 platforms.\n\nBecause different CPU architectures have very different SIMD operations, it's hard to create a single portable API that works for all of them. So the Go team decided to start with a low-level, architecture-specific API first, giving \"power users\" immediate access to SIMD features on the most common server platform — amd64.\n\nThe package defines vector types as structs, like Int8x16 (a 128-bit SIMD vector with sixteen 8-bit integers) and Float64x8 (a 512-bit SIMD vector with eight 64-bit floats). These match the hardware's vector registers. The package supports vectors that are 128, 256, or 512 bits wide.\n\nMost operations are defined as methods on vector types. They usually map directly to hardware instructions with zero overhead.\n\nTo give you a taste, here's a custom function that uses SIMD instructions to add 32-bit float vectors:\n\nCommon operations in the archsimd package include:\n\nThe package uses only AVX instructions, not SSE.\n\nHere's a simple benchmark for adding two vectors (both the \"plain\" and SIMD versions use pre-allocated slices):\n\nThe package is experimental and can be enabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=simd at build time.\n\n𝗗 simd/archsimd •\n𝗣 73787 •\n𝗖𝗟 701915, 712880, 729900, 732020 •\n𝗔 Junyang Shao, Sean Liao, Tom Thorogood\n\nCryptographic protocols like WireGuard or TLS have a property called \"forward secrecy\". This means that even if an attacker gains access to long-term secrets (like a private key in TLS), they shouldn't be able to decrypt past communication sessions. To make this work, ephemeral keys (temporary keys used to negotiate the session) need to be erased from memory immediately after the handshake. If there's no reliable way to clear this memory, these keys could stay there indefinitely. An attacker who finds them later could re-derive the session key and decrypt past traffic, breaking forward secrecy.\n\nIn Go, the runtime manages memory, and it doesn't guarantee when or how memory is cleared. Sensitive data might remain in heap allocations or stack frames, potentially exposed in core dumps or through memory attacks. Developers often have to use unreliable \"hacks\" with reflection to try to zero out internal buffers in cryptographic libraries. Even so, some data might still stay in memory where the developer can't reach or control it.\n\nThe Go team's solution to this problem is the new runtime/secret package. It lets you run a function in secret mode. After the function finishes, it immediately erases (zeroes out) the registers and stack it used. Heap allocations made by the function are erased as soon as the garbage collector decides they are no longer reachable.\n\nThis helps make sure sensitive information doesn't stay in memory longer than needed, lowering the risk of attackers getting to it.\n\nHere's an example that shows how secret.Do might be used in a more or less realistic setting. Let's say you want to generate a session key while keeping the ephemeral private key and shared secret safe:\n\nHere, the ephemeral private key and the raw shared secret are effectively \"toxic waste\" — they are necessary to create the final session key, but dangerous to keep around.\n\nIf these values stay in the heap and an attacker later gets access to the application's memory (for example, via a core dump or a vulnerability like Heartbleed), they could use these intermediates to re-derive the session key and decrypt past conversations.\n\nThe current secret.Do implementation only supports Linux (amd64 and arm64). On unsupported platforms, Do invokes the function directly. Also, trying to start a goroutine within the function causes a panic (this will be fixed in Go 1.27).\n\nThe runtime/secret package is mainly for developers who work on cryptographic libraries. Most apps should use higher-level libraries that use secret.Do behind the scenes.\n\nThe package is experimental and can be enabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=runtimesecret at build time.\n\n𝗗 runtime/secret •\n𝗣 21865 •\n𝗖𝗟 704615 •\n𝗔 Daniel Morsing\n\nCurrent cryptographic APIs, like ecdsa.GenerateKey or rand.Prime, often accept an io.Reader as the source of random data:\n\nThese APIs don't commit to a specific way of using random bytes from the reader. Any change to underlying cryptographic algorithms can change the sequence or amount of bytes read. Because of this, if the application code (mistakenly) relies on a specific implementation in Go version X, it might fail or behave differently in version X+1.\n\nThe Go team chose a pretty bold solution to this problem. Now, most crypto APIs will just ignore the random io.Reader parameter and always use the system random source (crypto/internal/sysrand.Read).\n\nThe change applies to the following crypo subpackages:\n\ned25519.GenerateKey(rand) still uses the random reader if provided. But if rand is nil, it uses an internal secure source of random bytes instead of crypto/rand.Reader (which could be overridden).\n\nTo support deterministic testing, there's a new testing/cryptotest package with a single SetGlobalRandom function. It sets a global, deterministic cryptographic randomness source for the duration of the given test:\n\nSetGlobalRandom affects crypto/rand and all implicit sources of cryptographic randomness in the crypto/* packages:\n\nTo temporarily restore the old reader-respecting behavior, set GODEBUG=cryptocustomrand=1 (this option will be removed in a future release).\n\n𝗗 testing/cryptotest •\n𝗣 70942 •\n𝗖𝗟 724480 •\n𝗔 Filippo Valsorda, qiulaidongfeng\n\nThe new crypto/hpke package implements Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) as specified in RFC 9180.\n\nHPKE is a relatively new IETF standard for hybrid encryption. Traditional public-key encryption methods, like RSA, are slow and can only handle small amounts of data. HPKE improves on this by combining two types of encryption: it uses asymmetric cryptography (public/private keys) to safely create a shared secret, then uses fast symmetric encryption to protect the actual data. This lets you securely and quickly encrypt large files or messages, while still using the security benefits of public-key systems.\n\nThe \"asymmetric\" part of HPKE (called Key Encapsulation Mechanism or KEM) can use both traditional algorithms, such as those using elliptic curves, and new post-quantum algorithms, like ML-KEM. ML-KEM is designed to remain secure even against future quantum computers that could break traditional cryptography.\n\nI'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in cryptography, so here's an example I took straight from the Go standard library documentation. It uses ML-KEM-X25519 for asymmetric cryptography (traditional X25519 combined with ML-KEM), AES-256 for symmetric encryption, and SHA-256 as a key hash function:\n\nAs Filippo Valsorda (the cryptography engineer who maintains Go's crypto packages) says, HPKE is now the right way to do public key encryption.\n\n𝗗 crypto/hpke •\n𝗣 75300 •\n𝗔 Filippo Valsorda\n\nA leak occurs when one or more goroutines are indefinitely blocked on synchronization primitives like channels, while other goroutines continue running and the program as a whole keeps functioning. Here's a simple example:\n\nIf we call leak and don't read from the output channel, the inner leak goroutine will stay blocked trying to send to the channel for the rest of the program:\n\nUnlike deadlocks, leaks do not cause panics, so they are much harder to spot. Also, unlike data races, Go's tooling did not address them for a long time.\n\nThings started to change in Go 1.24 with the introduction of the synctest package. Not many people talk about it, but synctest is a great tool for catching leaks during testing.\n\nGo 1.26 adds a new experimental goroutineleak profile designed to report leaked goroutines in production. Here's how we can use it in the example above:\n\nAs you can see, we have a nice goroutine stack trace that shows exactly where the leak happens.\n\nThe goroutineleak profile finds leaks by using the garbage collector's marking phase to check which blocked goroutines are still connected to active code. It starts with runnable goroutines, marks all sync objects they can reach, and keeps adding any blocked goroutines waiting on those objects. When it can't add any more, any blocked goroutines left are waiting on resources that can't be reached — so they're considered leaked.\n\nFor even more details, see the paper by Saioc et al.\n\nIf you want to see how goroutineleak (and synctest) can catch typical leaks that often happen in production — check out my article on goroutine leaks.\n\nThe goroutineleak profile is experimental and can be enabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=goroutineleakprofile at build time. Enabling the experiment also makes the profile available as a net/http/pprof endpoint, /debug/pprof/goroutineleak.\n\nAccording to the authors, the implementation is already production-ready. It's only marked as experimental so they can get feedback on the API, especially about making it a new profile.\n\n𝗗 runtime/pprof •\n𝗚 Detecting leaks •\n𝗣 74609, 75280 •\n𝗖𝗟 688335 •\n𝗔 Vlad Saioc\n\nNew metrics in the runtime/metrics package give better insight into goroutine scheduling:\n\nPer-state goroutine metrics can be linked to common production issues. For example, an increasing waiting count can show a lock contention problem. A high not-in-go count means goroutines are stuck in syscalls or cgo. A growing runnable backlog suggests the CPUs can't keep up with demand.\n\nYou can read the new metric values using the regular metrics.Read function:\n\nThe per-state numbers (not-in-go + runnable + running + waiting) are not guaranteed to add up to the live goroutine count (/sched/goroutines:goroutines, available since Go 1.16).\n\nAll new metrics use uint64 counters.\n\n𝗗 runtime/metrics •\n𝗣 15490 •\n𝗖𝗟 690397, 690398, 690399 •\n𝗔 Michael Knyszek\n\nThe new Type.Fields and Type.Methods methods in the reflect package return iterators for a type's fields and methods:\n\nThe new methods Type.Ins and Type.Outs return iterators for the input and output parameters of a function type:\n\nThe new methods Value.Fields and Value.Methods return iterators for a value's fields and methods. Each iteration yields both the type information (StructField or Method) and the value:\n\nPreviously, you could get all this information by using a for-range loop with NumX methods (which is what iterators do internally):\n\nUsing an iterator is more concise.

Specifically, in Linux it uses pidfd, which is a file descriptor that refers to a process. Using the handle instead of the PID makes sure that Process methods always work with the same OS process, and not a different process that just happens to have the same ID.\n\nPreviously, you couldn't access the process handle. Now you can, thanks to the new Process.WithHandle method:\n\nWithHandle calls a specified function and passes a process handle as an argument:\n\nThe handle is guaranteed to refer to the process until the callback function returns, even if the process has already terminated. That's why it's implemented as a callback instead of a Process.Handle field or method.\n\nWithHandle is only supported on Linux 5.4+ and Windows.

It supports cancellation and can be used to connect to any of the known networks:\n\nHowever, DialContext a bit less efficient than network-specific functions like net.DialTCP — because of the extra overhead from address resolution and network type dispatching.\n\nSo, network-specific functions in the net package are more efficient, but they don't support cancellation. The Dialer type supports cancellation, but it's less efficient. The Go team decided to resolve this contradiction.\n\nThe new context-aware Dialer methods (DialTCP, DialUDP, DialIP, and DialUnix) combine the efficiency of the existing network-specific net functions with the cancellation capabilities of Dialer.DialContext:\n\nI wouldn't say that having three different ways to dial is very convenient, but that's the price of backward compatibility.\n\n𝗗 net.Dialer •\n𝗣 49097 •\n𝗖𝗟 490975 •\n𝗔 Michael Fraenkel\n\nThe default httptest.Server certificate already lists example.com in its DNSNames (a list of hostnames or domain names that the certificate is authorized to secure).

Because of this, some suggest switching code from fmt.Errorf to errors.New when formatting isn't needed.\n\nThe Go team disagrees. Here's a quote from Russ Cox:\n\nUsing fmt.Errorf(\"foo\") is completely fine, especially in a program where all the errors are constructed with fmt.Errorf. Having to mentally switch between two functions based on the argument is unnecessary noise.\n\nWith the new Go release, this debate should finally be settled. For unformatted strings, fmt.Errorf now allocates less and generally matches the allocations for errors.New.\n\nSpecifically, fmt.Errorf goes from 2 allocations to 0 allocations for a non-escaping error, and from 2 allocations to 1 allocation for an escaping error:\n\nThis matches the allocations for errors.New in both cases.\n\nThe difference in CPU cost is also much smaller now. Previously, it was ~64ns vs. ~21ns for fmt.Errorf vs. errors.New for escaping errors, now it's ~25ns vs. ~21ns.\n\nHere are the \"before and after\" benchmarks for the fmt.Errorf change. The non-escaping case is called local, and the escaping case is called sink. If there's just a plain error string, it's no-args. If the error includes formatting, it's int-arg.\n\nIf you're interested in the details, I highly recommend reading the CL — it's perfectly written.\n\n𝗗 fmt.Errorf •\n𝗖𝗟 708836 •\n𝗔 thepudds\n\nPreviously, io.ReadAll allocated a lot of intermediate memory as it grew its result slice to the size of the input data. Now, it uses intermediate slices of exponentially growing size, and then copies them into a final perfectly-sized slice at the end.\n\nThe new implementation is about twice as fast and uses roughly half the memory for a 65KiB input; it's even more efficient with larger inputs. Here are the geomean results comparing the old and new versions for different input sizes:\n\nSee the full benchmark results in the commit. Unfortunately, the author didn't provide the benchmark source code.\n\nEnsuring the final slice is minimally sized is also quite helpful. The slice might persist for a long time, and the unused capacity in a backing array (as in the old version) would just waste memory.\n\nAs with the fmt.Errorf optimization, I recommend reading the CL — it's very good.

Since its release, many projects have switched from third-party logging packages to use it. However, it was missing one key feature: the ability to send log records to multiple handlers, such as stdout or a log file.\n\nThe new MultiHandler type solves this problem. It implements the standard Handler interface and calls all the handlers you set up.\n\nFor example, we can create a log handler that writes to stdout:\n\nAnd another handler that writes to a file:\n\nFinally, combine them using a MultiHandler:\n\nI'm also printing the file contents here to show the results.\n\nWhen the MultiHandler receives a log record, it sends it to each enabled handler one by one. If any handler returns an error, MultiHandler doesn't stop; instead, it combines all the errors using errors.Join:\n\nThe Enable method reports whether any of the configured handlers is enabled:\n\nOther methods — WithAttr and WithGroup — call the corresponding methods on each of the enabled handlers.\n\n𝗗 slog.MultiHandler •\n𝗣 65954 •\n𝗖𝗟 692237 •\n𝗔 Jes Cok\n\nTest artifacts are files created by tests or benchmarks, such as execution logs, memory dumps, or analysis reports.

Now they do.\n\nThe new methods T.ArtifactDir, B.ArtifactDir, and F.ArtifactDir return a directory where you can write test output files:\n\nIf you use go test with -artifacts, this directory will be inside the output directory (specified by -outputdir, or the current directory by default):\n\nAs you can see, the first time ArtifactDir is called, it writes the directory location to the test log, which is quite handy.\n\nIf you don't use -artifacts, artifacts are stored in a temporary directory which is deleted after the test completes.\n\nEach test or subtest within each package has its own unique artifact directory. Subtest outputs are not stored inside the parent test's output directory — all artifact directories for a given package are created at the same level:\n\nThe artifact directory path normally looks like this:\n\nBut if this path can't be safely converted into a local file path (which, for some reason, always happens on my machine), the path will simply be:\n\n(which is what happens in the examples above)\n\nRepeated calls to ArtifactDir in the same test or subtest return the same directory.\n\n𝗗 T.ArtifactDir •\n𝗣 71287 •\n𝗖𝗟 696399 •\n𝗔 Damien Neil\n\nOver the years, the go fix command became a sad, neglected bag of rewrites for very ancient Go features.

    "fullText": "Today we celebrate 15 years since Elixir’s first commit! To mark the occasion, we are glad to announce the first release candidate for Elixir v1.20, which performs type inference of all language constructs, with increasing precision.\n\nIn this blog post, we will break down exactly what this means, and what to expect in the short and medium term of the language evolution (roughly the next 15 months).\n\nIn 2022, we announced the effort to add set-theoretic types to Elixir. In June 2023, we published an award winning paper on Elixir’s type system design and said our work was transitioning from research to development.\n\nOur goal is to introduce a type system which is:\n\nsound - the types inferred and assigned by the type system align with the behaviour of the program\n\ngradual - Elixir’s type system includes the dynamic() type, which can be used when the type of a variable or expression is checked at runtime. In the absence of dynamic(), Elixir’s type system behaves as a static one\n\ndeveloper friendly - the types are described, implemented, and composed using basic set operations: unions, intersections, and negations (hence it is a set-theoretic type system)\n\nHowever, I want to emphasize what the gradual typing means in Elixir. Many gradual type systems have the any() type, which, from the point of view of the type system, often means “anything goes” and no type violations are reported.\n\nOn the other hand, Elixir’s gradual type is called dynamic() and it works as a range. For example, you can say dynamic(integer() or float()), which means the type is either integer() or float() at runtime. Then if you proceed to pass it to a function that expects a binary(), you will get a typing violation. This allows the type system to emit warnings even in the presence of dynamism. Even if you declare a type as dynamic() and then proceed to use as integer() and then binary(), a type violation is still reported. We have also developed new techniques that ensure our gradual typing is sound, without a need for additional runtime checks.\n\nThe type system was made possible thanks to a partnership between CNRS and Remote. The development work is currently sponsored by Fresha, and Tidewave.\n\nLet’s see how this is turning out in practice.\n\nElixir v1.17 was the first release to introduce set-theoretic types into the compiler. Elixir v1.18 added inference of patterns and return types. Therefore, if you wrote this code:\n\nElixir’s type system will infer the drive function expects a User struct as input and returns either {:ok, dynamic()} or {:error, :no_choice} or {:error, :not_allowed}. Therefore, the following code\n\nwill emit a warning stating that we are passing an invalid argument, both in your IDE and the shell:\n\nNow consider the expression below. We are expecting the User.drive/2 call to return :error, which cannot possibly be true:\n\nTherefore the code above would emit the following warning:\n\nHowever, Elixir v1.18 could only infer types from patterns. If you wrote this code:\n\nElixir would not infer anything about the function arguments. As of Elixir v1.20-rc, Elixir correctly infers the function to be %{..., age: integer()} -> binary(), which means it expects a map with at least the age field (the leading ... indicates other keys may be present) and it returns a binary().\n\nWhile a + b works with both integers and floats, because the rem (remainder) function works exclusively with integers, Elixir correctly infers that a and b must also both be integers. If you try calling the function above with a float, you will also get a type violation.\n\nIn a nutshell, we have been steadily increasing the amount of inference in Elixir programs. Our goal is to find typing violations in Elixir programs for free, without a need for developers to change existing code. And, in the last few days, we finally wrapped up the last missing piece.\n\nElixir v1.20-rc also performs inference of guards! Let’s see some examples:\n\nThe code above correctly infers x is a list and y is an integer.\n\nThe one above infers x is a binary or an integer, and y is a two element tuple with :ok as first element and a binary or integer as second.\n\nThe code above infers x is a map which has the :foo key, represented as %{..., foo: dynamic()}. Remember the leading ... indicates the map may have other keys.\n\nAnd the code above infers x does not have the :foo key (hence x.foo will raise a typing violation), which has the type: %{..., foo: not_set()}.\n\nYou can also have expressions that assert on the size of data structures:\n\nElixir will correctly track that the tuple has at most two elements, and therefore accessing elem(x, 3) will emit a typing violation. In other words, Elixir can look at complex guards, infer types, and use this information to find bugs in our code!\n\nAs we work on the type system, we have been carefully monitoring the compiler performance. And while we have been able to develop new techniques to keep everything running smoothly, the next weeks will dramatically ramp up the amount of type information flowing through the compiler, and therefore we need your feedback.\n\nThe next Elixir release is scheduled for May. We are shipping this release candidate earlier than usual for validation. We also plan to launch at least two additional release candidates with increased type checking.\n\nThe first release candidate is out right now, with type inference of all Elixir constructs. Please give it a try. However, at this stage, we expect some false positives: the type system will report warnings which are not actual violations. We will explain exactly why in the next paragraphs. So don’t change your programs yet. The most valuable feedback we want from you is performance! If everything compiles at roughly the same speed as before, then hooray!\n\nThe second release candidate will add type inference across clauses. Let’s see some examples. Take this code:\n\nToday, we know user in the first clause has the name field (and potentially other fields). We know that user in the second clause has first_name and last_name. The code above also implies that user in the second clause does not have the name field (after all, if it had the name field, the first clause would have matched). In other words, pattern matching order becomes a source of negative type information. In the first release candidate, the type system cannot infer this information yet, but it will be implemented in the following release candidate.\n\nBesides giving us more precise types, the above will also allow us to perform exhaustiveness checks as well as find redundant clauses (note we already warn for clauses that won’t ever match since Elixir v1.18).\n\nHowever, it is worth keeping in mind the work is a bit more complex than one might think. For example, take this code:\n\nCan we say the user in the second clause does not have the age field? No, we can’t, because the first clause only matches if age is greater than or equal to 21. So the second clause will still match users with a lower age. This means we must distinguish between “surely accepted clauses” and “potentially accepted clauses”.\n\nFinally, we will ship a third release candidate, which enables type inference for function calls across your dependencies. In the current release candidate, Elixir can infer types from function calls, but such inference only applies to modules from Elixir’s standard library. Take the following code:\n\nIn the code above, we will infer x is an integer(), but if instead you call MyInteger.to_string(x) from a dependency, we only perform type checking, we won’t infer the integer_to_string function expects an integer. Once implemented, this step will drastically increase the amount of types flowing through the compiler, hence we are dedicating a release candidate for it.\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering: when can we officially claim Elixir is statically typed?\n\nWhen we first announced the type system effort, we broke it into three distinct milestones:\n\nType inference of patterns and guards: this is our current milestone which has, since then, been extended to type inference of all language constructs\n\nIntroduction of typed structs, allowing struct types to propagate throughout the system, as we pattern match on structs throughout the codebase\n\nIntroduction of type signatures, including for parametric and protocol polymorphism\n\nAssuming all release candidates above go according to plan, we will officially conclude the first milestone as part of Elixir v1.20 and start working on the subsequent ones. However, there are still challenges ahead that may prove the type system to be impractical:\n\nErgonomics: all of our improvements so far have happened behind the scenes, without changes to the language. While this has been very valuable to validate the feasibility and performance of the type system, we still need to assess its impact on the developer experience\n\nPerformance: our current implementation does not yet support recursive and parametric types and those may also directly impact performance and make the type system unfeasible\n\nOur goal is to explore these problems and their solutions in the future Elixir v1.21 (Nov/2026) and v1.22 (May/2027) releases, by implementing these operations in the compiler and using it to internally type complex Elixir modules, such as the Enum module. So while we don’t have a precise date for when we will conclude these upcoming milestones, we will likely continue to see gradual improvements on every release for the next 15 months.\n\nThe first release candidate for Elixir v1.20 is out and includes type inference of all constructs. We will have multiple release candidates before the final release in May/2026, and your feedback is very important:\n\nEvery release will have a thread in the Elixir Forum for discussion.\n\nCheck our documentation to learn more about our overall work on set-theoretic types. This release also includes our official types cheatsheet.\n\nThe complete CHANGELOG for this release is on GitHub.",

    "description": "I was unhappy with the LLM-as-a-judge instruction fine-tuning results I got when comparing my various base models.  Could I make them any better?",
    "fullText": "I'm still working on my \"extra credit\" projects after finishing the main body of\nSebastian Raschka's book\n\"Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)\".\nLast time around, I trained four base models, using the GPT-2 architecture from\nthe book, on Lambda Labs machines. I was using two ways to compare them with each\nother, with three models that I'd trained locally, and with the original GPT-2 weights\nfrom OpenAI:\n\nHere were the results I got, sorted by the loss:\n\nNow, you'd expect there to be at least a loose correlation;\nthe lower the loss, the higher the IFT score. But, while we can see a difference\nbetween the OpenAI weights and our own, within our own there doesn't seem to be a\nlogical pattern.\n\nI think that the problem is that the results from the GPT-5.1\nLLM-as-a-judge are not consistent between models. That's not a complaint about\nthe code or its original design, of course -- it was originally written as part\nof the LLM book as a way of doing a quick test on an instruction fine-tuned model that\nwe'd spent the previous 238 pages writing -- just something that was a bit more efficient than\nreading hundreds of input/output pairs ourselves. It was never meant to be a tool\nto compare models in the way I'm using it now.\n\nIn this post I'll dig into why it doesn't work for this kind of thing, and see if that's something\nwe can change.\n\nLet's spec out the problem first. The instruction fine-tuning test trains our model\non the Alpaca dataset in order to\nlet it know how to follow instructions; that comprises a series of sequences like\nthis:\n\nIn the version I've settled on,\nI fine-tune on a training set of 85% of the samples, epoch by epoch, bailing out when the\nloss on a separate validation set of 5% of the samples starts rising. I then use the\nweights from the previous epoch -- that is, before validation loss started rising --\nto generate responses to the remaining 10% of the samples.\n\nOnce that's done, the script hits the OpenAI API, using GPT-5.1, default parameters for all\nof the options (eg. no explicit temperature) with queries like this:\n\nWe do that for every model-generated response in the test set, then take the\naverage of the scores and use that as our result.\n\nTo see why that's problematic, imagine this simple instruction with no separate input:\n\nOne response I've seen from my models was this:\n\nThat's obvious garbage, and should get a zero -- and GPT-5.1 consistently does that.\n\nAnother response, from OpenAI's original weights for their \"medium\" model (larger than\nthe ones I've been training), is this:\n\nThat's correct, so it deserves 100, or perhaps 95 due to being unnecessarily\nwordy (the answer \"Jane Austen\" is the suggested response in the dataset).\n\nOne of my models came up with that gem during an earlier eval. It's completely wrong,\nso it deserves a 0, right? And normally the GPT-5.1 model does that -- but sometimes\nit's a little more generous, and gives it a low, but non-zero score. When asked for\nits reason for that, it makes the logical point that while it's the wrong answer, at\nleast Sarah Palin is a real person. It's better than the \"the book wrote itself\"\ncomplete nonsense of the first response.\n\nThe problem is that the different runs against the different models are not consistent, as\nthey're all talking to GPT-5.1 separately. One model might find it in a harsh \"mood\",\nand get a lower rating than another model that found it at a more generous moment.\n\nI came to the conclusion that the best way to fix this is to do a \"batch\" -- that is, fine-tune\neach model on the Alpaca dataset that Raschka provides, and generate responses for\nthe test set and store them in a file. Then, once we've done that for all models,\nwe can score them all at once, prompting GPT-5.1 with something like this:\n\nThe theory is that doing it that way will mean that each individual query/response pair is graded consistently\nbetween models, even if there might still be inconsistencies between query/response pairs.\nThat hopefully means we'll get more consistent results and can compare the models\nbetter.\n\nRunning the first against each of our models, and then the second against all of the\noutput files, gives us this updated table (with links to the annotated JSON files\nin case anyone else wants to take a look):\n\n(Still sorted by loss so that you can compare it more easily with the one above.)\n\nThat's really interesting! The IFT score is still not correlated with the loss.\nBut there does appear to be a pattern.\n\nIt looks like we have three groups of models:\n\nI tried running the LLM-as-a-judge scoring script a few times, just to make sure\nthis wasn't some kind of random weirdness, but the pattern was always the same:\nthe OpenAI weights, the cloud FineWeb 8x A100 40 GiB, and the two local Local FineWeb-Edu\nmodels always got the best IFT scores, though sometimes they swapped positions (apart from the\nOpenAI medium model, which was of course always at the top). The other cloud\nFineWeb models and the local FineWeb one were consistently scored much lower.\n\nA hypothesis: there are two things that contribute to how good a model is at these\nIFT tests:\n\nOr to put it another way -- some of these models are smart but not knowledgeable, while\nothers are knowledgeable but not smart, and some are neither.\nI think that could explain what we're seeing here. While OpenAI never published\ntheir \"WebText\" dataset for GPT-2, the paper\ndescribes it as\n\na new web scrape which emphasizes\n document quality. To do this we only scraped web pages\n which have been curated/filtered by humans. Manually\n filtering a full web scrape would be exceptionally expensive\n so as a starting point, we scraped all outbound links from\n Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3\n karma.\n\nNow, the FineWeb dataset is quite similar, though I think it's a tad more curated than that.\nBut OpenAI trained\ntheir models for quite some time and did lots of tricks to get the loss as low as\npossible.\n\nonly the most \"educational\" data. Models trained on it, you might think, would\nknow more facts for a given amount of training.\n\nSo we can imagine the OpenAI models are smart but not knowledgeable, as we can our\ncloud FineWeb 8x A100 40 GiB model, which (I believe due to an accidentally-near-optimal batch\nsize) worked out well in terms of loss. They were trained on relatively sloppy datasets\nbut turned out reasonably well. Their intelligence makes up for some of their lack of\nknowledge.\n\nOur other cloud trains and the local FineWeb one are dumb and not\nknowledgeable; they were trained on the low-information FineWeb dataset, but they didn't\nwind up with a particularly amazing loss. So they get low scores.\n\nAnd finally, our local FineWeb-Edu models are still dumb, but they make up for it\n\nWell, it sounds plausible ;-) And I'd like to spend some time digging in to see if there's any indication\nif it's actually true. But after an afternoon of poking around the results, I can't really get\na handle on whether it is, or indeed how you'd test that hypothesis in any real\ndepth.\n\nTBH, I think this has zoomed so far past my \"no side quests\" limit that it's not even\nvisible in the rear view mirror, so it's probably best to shelve it as a\n\"cool idea, bro\" for now. Learning about how to run sensible evals, and how to work out\nwhat they're saying, will have to be a task for another day. I will keep on doing these\nIFT tests for future models, though, just out of interest.\n\nSo: let's get back to our regular scheduled LLM training. Next up, how do we\nupload our models to Hugging Face quickly and easily so that other people can\nplay with them.",

    "description": "Jensen Huang explains artificial intelligence as a multi-layered platform, arguing its true impact extends far beyond consumer-facing language models.",
    "fullText": "Bottom Line Up Front: Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, in his role as the leader of the primary company behind the ongoing technology movement, says that many people don’t realize just how big the AI revolution is. He says there are currently over 1.5 million AI models throughout the world, from healthcare and drug discovery to more commonly known names like Elon Musk’s Grok and Sam Altman’s ChatGPT.\n\nThe Details: Nvidia founder and chief executive Jensen Huang has consistently framed artificial intelligence as an infrastructure-scale transformation rather than a single technological breakthrough. In a fireside chat hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) with President and CEO Dr. John J. Hamre, Huang continued outlining his layered view of AI, emphasizing the systems, capital, and breadth of applications that underpin the technology’s long-term impact.\n\nJeff Bezos Launched a Secretive AI Startup in 2025 That Should Give Wall Street Chills\n\nThe Top-Rated Dividend King to Buy for 2026\n\nEvercore Analysts Love UnitedHealth Stock for 2026. Should You Buy UNH Here?\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. \n\nBuilding on earlier discussion of energy, chips, and systems, Huang described the current infrastructure buildout of AI as being multi-layered. The first layer is simple: energy. Huang frames electricity buildout as the most fundamental part of the entire AI revolution.\n\nThe next is Nvidia itself: Chips. Without chips, there’s nothing to use electricity and process the AI compute needed to run the AI models.\n\nHuang then highlights the third layer, which “includes financial services, because it takes an enormous amount of capital to do what we do.” His remarks highlight that AI development at scale is not only a technical challenge, but also a financial one, requiring sustained investment in data centers, networking, and long-lived computing assets.\n\nHuang then turned to the fourth layer that receives the most public attention: the models themselves. He acknowledged the prominence of well-known systems, describing how “this is where people largely focus on when they talk about AI,” citing examples such as ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok. However, he placed those systems in a much wider context, pointing out that “those are four of the one and a half million AI models in the world.” The statement reframes popular generative models as an incredibly small subset of a far larger and more diverse ecosystem. This statement diversifies the risk away from the larger, more broadly known AI models, and instead frames Nvidia as an infrastructure play amongst a technological revolution being implemented across every industry in the world.",

    "description": "A 20-year-old woman won the lottery. How she chose to accept her winnings drew social media scorn.",
    "fullText": "A 20-year-old Canadian lit up social media after she won the lottery in the summer of 2025 and (gasp!) chose to accept her winnings in an annuity rather than a lump sum.\n\nInstead of taking a tax-free lump sum of $1 million (Canadian lottery wins aren't taxed like U.S. jackpots), Brenda Aubin-Vega, of Quebec, chose to receive $1,000 a week for life. Her decision contrasts with what the vast majority of lottery winners choose and drew criticism. Everyone seemed to have an opinion, even Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.\n\nThe fierce debate highlights, once again, the age-old question of whether lottery winners should take the lump sum or an annuity and how even to make that decision.\n\n“The reason most take the lump sum is because if you take the annuity and get hit by a bus, they feel like it’s over,” said Dan White, founder and CEO of Daniel A. White & Associates in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore deciding how to receive your prize, winners should understand what the two options are.\n\nLump sum is a one-time cash payment, usually the cash value of the jackpot. The cash value is the amount of money required to be in the jackpot prize pool, on the day of the drawing, to fund the estimated jackpot annuity prize.\n\nAnnuity is a regular stream of payments over time, either for a certain number of years or for life. Mega Millions and Powerball, the two largest U.S. lotteries, pay the annuity with an annual payment over 30 years that increases each year by 5%.\n\nIf the winner gets hit by a bus, it’s true the winner may have only enjoyed a fraction of the winnings. However, the winner can leave the missed annuity payments to heirs.\n\nAt any time, the winner or the heirs can sell remaining annuity payments if they want to receive a lump sum instead of the annuity.\n\nA 2011 study of the Powerball lottery from 2003 to 2009 showed more than 93% of jackpot winners took the lump sum.\n\nMany people on social media believe the lump sum is always better because they can invest the money and grow it more quickly than the annuity would grow. After all, the broad S&P 500's average annual return is about 10%, including dividends.\n\n“She will be better off to accept $1m today,” wrote Binance's Zhao in a social media post. But instead of stocks, he suggested she should invest the money in bitcoin and end up spending “$1k each week for the rest of her life, with millions left over.”\n\nBut that strategy can be riskier than taking the automatic annual increase in lottery annuity payments, some advisers noted. The stock market can post losses for multiple years at a time.",

Mark was the one to identify the body.\n\nAs speculation about the circumstances of Jeffrey's death began, Mark hired former NYC chief medical examiner, Dr. Michael Baden, who said the “evidence points to homicide rather than suicide.”\n\nYears later, in June 2023, the FBI and the Department of Justice said there was no credible evidence of foul play in his death, according to a DOJ report.\n\nDespite the findings, Mark has continued to voice his skepticism of the official findings, telling NBC News in July 2025, “More and more, I believe he was murdered.\" \"And everyone who looks at all the information that’s out there on facts comes to the same conclusion,\" Mark added.\n\nMark reiterated his beliefs in an appearance on News Nation Now on Friday, Jan. 9, alleging again that Jeffrey was murdered, and that \"more autopsy facts will be coming out in February that prove it.”\n\nHe told the outlet that when he saw Jeffrey’s body, the injuries “didn’t correspond to the way his body was found hanging.”\n\nMark continued, “There are only three ways to die in prison,” before adding, “Suicide, natural causes or murder.”\n\n“And Jeff was murdered. I want to know who killed him and on whose behalf?”\n\nMark also said that he believes the previous investigations and the subsequent findings are a “cover-up.” “Why the charade?\" he asked. \"Who are they trying to protect?”\n\nMeanwhile, Mark rejects Jeffrey’s longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell's August 2025 comments that she didn't “see” the murder of Jeffrey happening, although she acknowledged that it is \"of course\" possible.\n\n\"But I don't know of any reason why, and I don't believe in the blackmail or in any of this, I don't think Epstein had a hit on like that,\" she continued. \"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation.\"\n\nIn Friday's interview with News Nation Now, Mark said that he \"wouldn't trust anything\" Maxwell says, adding that she \"never saw the body or talked to Jeff before he died.\"\n\nBefore Mark spoke with NewsNation on Jan. 9, he claimed in a Nov. 18 phone interview with the outlet that an unnamed source told him that names of conservative politicians were being axed from the Epstein files to prevent Republicans from getting incriminated.\n\nDays later, on Nov. 20, he claimed on CNN’s Erin Burnett OutFront that President Donald Trump purposefully delayed the release of the Epstein files.\n\nMark also alleged that his brother had information on Trump when he was running for his first term in office in 2016, claiming that it was incriminating enough to “cancel the election.”\n\n\"He didn't tell me what he knew,\" Mark told the outlet, \"but Jeffrey definitely had dirt on Trump.\"\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nIf you or someone you know has been a victim of sexual abuse, text \"STRENGTH\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected to a certified crisis counselor.",

    "fullText": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pakistan is in the final phases of striking a $1.5-billion deal to supply weapons and jets to Sudan, a former top air force official and three sources said, promising a major boost for Sudan's army, battling the paramilitary Rapid ​Support Forces.\n\nTheir conflict has stoked the world's worst humanitarian crisis for more than 2-1/2 years, drawing in myriad foreign interests, and threatening to fragment the ‌strategic Red Sea country, a major gold producer.\n\nThe deal with Pakistan encompasses 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones for scouting and kamikaze attacks, and advanced air defence systems, said two of ‌the three sources with knowledge of the matter, who all sought anonymity.\n\nIt was a \"done deal\", said Aamir Masood, a retired Pakistani air marshal who continues to be briefed on air force matters.\n\nBesides the Karakoram-8 jets, it includes Super Mushshak training aircraft, and perhaps some coveted JF-17 fighters developed jointly with China and produced in Pakistan, he added, without giving figures or a delivery schedule.\n\nPakistan's military and its defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA spokesman for Sudan’s army did not immediately respond to a ⁠message requesting comment.\n\nAssistance from Pakistan, especially drones and jets, could ‌help Sudan's army regain the air supremacy it had towards the start of its war with the RSF, which has increasingly used drones to gain territory, eroding the army's position.\n\nSudan's army accuses the RSF of being supplied by the United Arab Emirates, which ‍has denied supplying weapons.\n\nThe sources did not say how the deal was being funded but Masood said it was possible the finances would come from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia may favour and support all the favourable regimes in Gulf for procurement of Pakistani military equipment and training,\" he said.\n\nOne of the sources said the Saudis brokered the deal but added there ​was no indication they were paying for the weapons. Another source said Saudi was not providing funds.\n\nMasood said the weapons for Sudan could be included in such an agreement, without confirming discussions with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEgypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are part of the U.S.-led quad grouping of nations that has tried to push Sudan's army and the RSF towards peace talks.\n\nOn recent visits, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan requested Saudi assistance in the war, according to Sudanese and Egyptian sources.\n\nRiyadh and Abu Dhabi are embroiled in a major feud sparked by recent events in Yemen.\n\nThe two most powerful countries in the Gulf ⁠have sharp differences on a range of volatile Middle East issues, from geopolitics to oil ​output.\n\nTheir difference burst into the open with an advance of UAE-backed southern Yemeni separatists in early December ​that brought them into conflict with Saudi-backed forces.\n\nThe deal is another feather in the cap for Pakistan's growing defence sector, which has drawn growing interest and investment, particularly since its jets were deployed in a conflict with India last year.\n\nLast month, Islamabad struck ‍a weapons deal worth more than $4 billion ⁠with the Libyan National Army, officials said, for one of the South Asian nation's largest arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.\n\nPakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on a defence deal that could includes the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, as ties improve ties with Dhaka.\n\nThe ⁠government sees Pakistan's burgeoning industry as a catalyst to secure long-term economic stability.\n\nPakistan is now in a $7-billion IMF programme, following a short-term deal to avert a sovereign default in 2023. It won IMF ‌support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.",

    "fullText": "Nebius and Applied Digital are both data center plays.\n\nSoundHound AI could see monster adoption over the next few years.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Nebius Group ›\n\nWith artificial intelligence (AI) usage skyrocketing, this sector of the market is a great place to look for stocks that could double in under a year. Many AI companies are generating explosive growth, and these are the ones to take a look at.\n\nThree, in particular, have a chance to double in value in 2026: Nebius (NASDAQ: NBIS), Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD), and SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). All three are growing at a rapid pace and could provide investors with a potential doubling of returns in 2026.\n\nNebius and Applied Digital operate in similar industries. Nebius was spun out of Russian-based Yandex after sanctions from the Ukraine war devastated the business, including the non-Russian parts. Nebius is focused on providing computing power to its various clients by renting out space in a data center and placing cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) in them. It also owns some of the locations it operates in.\n\nDemand for computing power has been unprecedented, and Nebius told investors that it has \"sold out\" all of its available capacity. As it expands capacity, it expects to have a $7 billion to $9 billion annual run rate (ARR) by the end of 2026. For comparison, its ARR at the end of Q3 was $551 million. That's explosive growth for a relatively small business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock double in 2026 as a result.\n\nApplied Digital builds and operates data centers and has two facilities in North Dakota that it operates. It is working on increasing computing capacity at these two facilities, and is a key CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) partner. It has signed 15-year leases for many of its data centers, which gives investors a long-term look into what Applied Digital's future looks like.\n\nIn the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, ended Aug. 31, its revenue rose about 84% year over year. As more computing capacity comes online, its revenue will jump, which could lead to outsize stock performance.\n\nLast is SoundHound AI. SoundHound AI blends generative AI and audio recognition to create a software platform that can be deployed in many applications. This is a key company to watch in 2026, as there could be a huge growth explosion if widespread adoption occurs. Several industries can be streamlined by deploying generative AI agents, such as customer service reps.\n\nIn its latest quarter, SoundHound AI's revenue jumped 68% year over year, and it raised the full-year outlook. We'll see if SoundHound AI's product gains momentum in 2026. But it could be a great year for the company and the stock.",

    "fullText": "Russia said Friday it used its latest missile against Ukraine for a second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, a forceful signal to Kyiv and its Western allies as U.S.-led peace talks have entered a new and crucial stage.\n\nThe hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile hit Ukraine's western Lviv region late Thursday night, although officials there did not mention any casualties. The area is near a military base in neighboring Poland, a NATO member, that serves as a key hub for ferrying Western military supplies to Kyiv.\n\nSome Moscow commentators said the attack was a warning to European leaders against proposals to deploy their troops to Ukraine as part of a prospective peace deal. Russia has said it won't accept such a deployment and would view those forces as legitimate targets.\n\nA look at the weapon and why Russia used it now:\n\nWhat’s known about the Oreshnik\n\nRussia first used the multiple-warhead Oreshnik on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the Oreshnik, which means “hazelnut tree” in Russian, streaks at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and was immune to any missile defense system.\n\nHe said the weapon is so powerful that several such missiles -- even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. He said it’s capable of destroying underground bunkers “three, four or more floors down.”\n\nThe Russian military said the Oreshnik can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and can reach any European target.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Ukraine’s military said the missile had six independently targetable warheads, each carrying six submunitions.\n\nRussian military bloggers said the submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives.\n\nSince the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has used swarms of cheap slow-flying drones and an assortment of other missiles, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said last month the Oreshnik had been deployed to Belarus and entered active service. It didn't specify how many missiles were sent to the key ally of Moscow and whether they were fitted with nuclear warheads, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that up to 10 Oreshnik systems will be stationed there.\n\nRussia previously has stationed tactical nuclear weapons inside Belarus, whose territory it used to launch the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, Putin released a revised nuclear doctrine that placed Belarus under Russia's atomic umbrella. The document significantly lowered the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons, declaring that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on the country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons.\n\nUnlike Russia's other shorter-range conventional weapons, the Oreshnik is able to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether the missile is carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.\n\nRussia's message by using the Oreshnik\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Putin described it as a response to Ukraine's Western allies allowing it to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nIts latest strike comes as the U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage and appears to underline Putin’s intention to negotiate from a position of strength as his troops make slow but steady territorial gains.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers noted that the strike in Lviv, not far from the Polish border, was a message intended for Kyiv’s allies. Those members of the “coalition of the willing” have proposed sending their troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees once a peace deal is reached.\n\nRussia has said it won't accept any European forces in Ukraine, seeing them as legitimate targets.\n\n“For the first time, NATO command has been shown a strategic weapons strike virtually on its border,” said military expert Valery Shiryayev. “This action is intended to demonstrate the determination of Russia’s military and political leadership to use such weapons with nuclear warheads if necessary.”\n\nThe attack comes less than a week after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. action as an act of aggression and sharply criticized Wednesday’s U.S. seizure of a Russia-flagged tanker.",

    "description": "In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that he would impose a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has taken another shot at big business, targeting banks this time.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said on Truth Social that he would call for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" he added. \"Coincidentally, the January 20th date will coincide with the one year anniversary of the historic and very successful Trump Administration.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The president cannot unilaterally impose such a cap; it would require an act of Congress. Similar efforts that have been advanced in Congress have yet to become law.\n\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, representatives for Chase and Citi pointed to a joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America. The statement said that the trade organizations \"share the President's goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit.\"\n\n\"At the same time, evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help,\" the joint statement read. \"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.\"\n\nTrump's announcement came hours after Sen. Bernie Sanders posted a jab against the president on X for not yet having introduced a proposal to cap credit card interest — a pledge Trump made during his 2024 reelection campaign.\n\n\"Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and stop Wall Street from getting away with murder. Instead, he deregulated big banks charging up to 30% interest on credit cards,\" Sanders wrote. \"The result? Last year, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon made $770 million. Unacceptable.\"\n\nIn the first few months of his second term, the Trump administration slashed funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency responsible for protecting consumers by ensuring that financial markets are fair and competitive.\n\nTrump's announcement, made on Truth Social, is the latest in a series of swipes at big business the president has made this week.\n\nEarlier this week, he said that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, aiming to lower interest rates and monthly payments. He also said he was barring \"large institutional investors\" from buying up single-family homes and signed an executive order that would limit defense contractors' corporate spending.",

Instead, he went to Syracuse for the last two seasons, where he’s been a special teams contributor and back end of the rotation corner.\n\nThis one for Penn State is all about the upside of McDaniels, who is a good athlete with some unique size for a DB. He’s 6-foot-3, 200 pounds and has a 6-foot-11 wingspan. So yeah, this is a big, athletic kid that if he gets the right coaching and development, could be a really good player at corner or one of the safety spots. For now though, he’ll likely be a special teamer who is a depth piece as the Nittany Lions build out some depth in the back end of the defense.",

    "fullText": "Former Oklahoma State quarterback Zane Flores has committed to Iowa State, via the NCAA Transfer Portal, per On3’s Pete Nakos. Flores spent three seasons with the Cowboys.\n\nFlores began the 2025 campaign as Oklahoma State’s backup QB, but took over starting responsibilities in Week 2 after Hauss Hejny suffered an injury in the season-opener. Flores made nine appearances this past season.\n\nHe completed 59.8% of his pass attempts for 1,490 yards and three touchdowns, while throwing seven interceptions. Additionally, Flores recorded 117 yards and two scores in the ground game.\n\nZane Flores played high school football at Gretna (NE), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 467 overall player and No. 29 QB in the 2023 recruiting cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Rankings.\n\nFlores is the 33rd player who has committed to Iowa State this offseason via the NCAA Transfer Portal. At the time of his commitment to the Cyclones, Flores was the No. 97 QB in On3’s 2026 Transfer Portal Player Rankings.\n\nIowa State is entering a new after longtime head coach Matt Campbell left the program to take over at Penn State. Campbell had been the head coach at Iowa State since 2016. In his 10 seasons at the helm of the program, he amassed a 72-55 overall record and a 50-40 mark in conference play.\n\nIn response to Campbell’s decision, Iowa State hired Jimmy Rogers to be its next head coach. Rogers was Washington State‘s HC in the 2025 campaign. He led the Cougars to a 6-6 overall record.\n\nPrior to his time at the helm of WSU, Rogers was South Dakota State‘s head coach. In just two seasons with the Jackrabbits, he led the program to a 27-3 record and a 15-1 mark in conference play.\n\nMoreover, in 2023, South Dakota State won the FCS National Championship. The team lost in the national semifinals in 2024, but won the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Now, he’ll look to lead Iowa State to similar heights.\n\n“My family and I are excited to be joining the Iowa State University community and the Cyclone football program,” Rogers said. “Iowa State has been one of the nation’s top programs for the last decade and we look forward to building upon its upward trajectory. I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity that Jamie Pollard has given me to lead the Cyclones.”\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSean McCoy doesn’t seem to have a single ounce of worry when it comes to his former team’s Wild Card matchup this Sunday.\n\nAs the Eagles are coming off of what became a controversial loss against the Washington Commanders, McCoy cannot be found on the side of those criticizing Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni for his decision to sit the starters for the regular season finale.\n\n“We don't care,” McCoy said. “Other teams you talked about, they are playing for something—first seed, they playing for divisional championships. We got the division. We won that championship. What's next?”\n\nWith a win and a Chicago Bears loss on Sunday, the Eagles could’ve locked up the NFC’s second seed behind the Seattle Seahawks. It would’ve secured home games for the first two rounds at least.\n\nThe Bears lost to the Detroit Lions, setting the Eagles up for an opportunity secure that home-field advantage, but their backups couldn’t seal the deal. If the Eagles advance to the Divisional Round, a matchup against the Bears would take place in Chicago—not Philadelphia.\n\nHome-field is obviously an advantage for most teams, but McCoy doesn’t take too much stock in that. Like Sirianni, he felt the additional rest was the right move.\n\n“We are defending champs,” McCoy continued. “Let's get healthy, right? Been a long season. Let's get our offense back together. Let's get the mental part right. Let's get physically ready to play. Got the playoffs coming up. So I don't mind that. I don't mind how my head coach runs his show, because my thing is, who we playing? That's all that matters. Line them up and we'll beat them.”\n\n\"The championship is going to Philadelphia...

The 49ers were one game better with a 12-5 finish. Yet, Philadelphia will enter the matchup as favorites, with McCoy confident as ever.\n\n“We ain’t worried about the Niners! You see the way they looked last game? We're not worried about the Niners,” the Eagles legend finished. “Niners or Green Bay, whoever it was, we're just gonna beat them anyway. Listen, man, the championship goes to Philadelphia. I know that, and so does Nick Sirianni. We ain't tripping. We don't care.”\n\nThe Eagles and the 49ers will kick off on Sunday at 4:30 PM ET.",

A win on Friday would make Indiana just the second team to beat the same team in the regular season and in the CFP in the same season.\n\nGiven the first-time experience and all that comes with it, Hoosiers fans have received quite the flowers and praise from those within the college football world on their invasion of Atlanta for the Peach Bowl:\n\nHere's a snippet of reactions from those within the college football world talking about the Hoosiers' invasion of Atlanta:\n\nI believe the ratio of @IndianaFootball fans to @oregonfootball fans is 1,000,000,000 to 6\n\n— Dana O'Neil (@DanaONeilWriter) January 9, 2026\n\nJudging by downtown foot traffic and MARTA riders, Atlanta might as well be Indianapolis today.\n\n— Pat Forde (@ByPatForde) January 9, 2026\n\nIt's early but judging from the concourse it's 75/25 IU easy\n\n— Assembly Call (⚪,🔴) (@AssemblyCall) January 9, 2026\n\nBloomington must be deserted, because Atlanta is a sea of Crimson & Cream.\n\n— Scott Van Pelt (@notthefakeSVP) January 9, 2026\n\nOne of the coolest parts of this job is when you see a fan base that hasn’t had success in a long time get to go to a big game. \n\nThere’s so much joy and excitement and “can you believe this?!” from Indiana fans in Atlanta right now.\n\n— Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) January 9, 2026\n\nThis is Indianta right now 😂😂 #CollegeGameDay pic.twitter.com/0vcXS2vyKo\n\n— Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) January 9, 2026\n\nBloomington South pic.twitter.com/ArwFNJH5u2\n\n— James Crepea (@JamesCrepea) January 10, 2026\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Indiana fans vastly outnumber Oregon fans at Peach Bowl CFP semifinal",

Without this, maybe I win the first set.\n\n“And same on the tiebreak, I think I made only two out of maybe five first serves. But second and third set, top-5 level, for sure. Amazing, not missing much, running well, serving like hell, volleys, everything.\n\n“So really happy with my level these three matches and looking forward.”\n\nMedvedev’s ranking fell to as low as 18th in the world during the 2025 ATP season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints may have a quarterback on their hands. Rookie Tyler Shough impressed in the first nine starts of his young professional career, completing 67.6% of his passes for 2,384 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions.\n\nNew Orleans was even able to win four of their last five games under the guidance of Shough, providing optimism that he can be their quarterback of the future.\n\nIn real life, Shough had to wait to have his name called until the 40th overall pick in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft. But almost a year removed, would he be picked any higher?\n\nIn a re-draft of the 2025 NFL Draft, Bleacher Report's Brent Sobleski projected Shough to go No. 3 overall to the New York Giants, since Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward were both off the board with the first two picks.\n\n\"Tyler Shough performed better than any rookie quarterback this past season. A person can even argue he should have been the No. 1 overall pick when compared to his classmates. He slides to No. 3 based on one factor: upside,\" wrote Sobleski.\n\n\"Aside from age, he originally fell into the second round because of an extensive injury history throughout his collegiate career. He remained healthy in 2025, but that concern hasn't disappeared.\"\n\nDespite Sobleski's concerns, it's impressive that a second-round pick improved his stock enough in nine games to be considered a top-three pick just nine months later.\n\nIt's safe to say the Saints are pleased with last year's selection.\n\nMock draft has Saints landing explosive playmaker to pair with Tyler Shough\n\nSaints HC Kellen Moore responds to concerns about QB Tyler Shough's age\n\nSaints 'expected' to play first international game in new European country for 2026\n\nSaints owner Gayle Benson provides stern update on potential sale of Saints, Pelicans\n\nGayle Benson delivers bad news for Saints fans on general manager Mickey Loomis",

    "description": "Wrexham's remarkable rise continues by knocking Premier League side Nottingham Forest out of the FA Cup in dramatic fashion.",
    "fullText": "\"The stories have been written in the stars, it seems. Literally.\"\n\nWhile scathing of the effort of many of his own players, even Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche acknowledged something is stirring at Wrexham as they knocked his Premier League side out of the FA Cup.\n\nIn front of co-owner Ryan Reynolds, the Red Dragons' Class of 2025-26 etched themselves into cup folklore by taking their top-flight scalp at the Stok Cae Ras on penalties.\n\nWith drama befitting their modern-day Hollywood associationwice they were two goals clear against last year's semi-finalists before being dragged, exhausted, into extra time where they produced a dramatic climax.\n\nFor a club with FA Cup upsets stitched into its fabric, this win was up there with the most climactic - and the hero of the iconic win over Arsenal in 1992, Mickey Thomas, watched on.\n\nBefore the match, manager Phil Parkinson admitted he had wished to take on a Premier League team ever since the club's journey up from the fifth tier began five years ago.\n\n\"We highlighted to the lads some of the great moments in this club's history in the FA Cup and could we make our own bit of history tonight. We've certainly done that,\" Parkinson said.\n\nThey did, and then some - beating top-flight opposition for the first time since 1999 to progress into round four.\n\nBut Wrexham are getting used to writing their own scripts.\n\n\"It's not just about the money, the fame and the people involved who have been amazing in the whole story, but to keep that edge and keep pushing as they're doing is tremendous,\" Forest boss Dyche said.\n\nAnd with a nod to Wrexham's position just outside the Championship play-offs, having been a non-league side as recently as 2023, he added: \"They might well add to the story.\"\n\n'Unacceptable to the badge' - Dyche fumes at FA Cup exit\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\n'I still think of him' - the Wrexham friendship FA Cup hero will never forget\n\nFrom \"colossus\" Arthur Okonkwo's spot-kick heroics to Ollie Rathbone's continued rip-roaring return from injury, and first club goals for both Liberato Cacace and Dom Hyam thrown into the mix, Parkinson said there were \"stories everywhere\" on a truly wild night in north Wales.\n\n\"It's a magical night. It's just a classic FA Cup game,\" said goalscorer Cacace, who was making his first start for Wrexham in more than two months.\n\nIt ensured co-owner Reynolds - accompanied by his mother who witnessed the glory of the world's oldest national football competition in full view - was not left disappointed.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll (Reynolds) be delighted to feel the emotion again inside the Stok Cae Ras,\" said Parkinson.\n\nWrexham sit just one point adrift of the Championship's top six, having won four successive matches in the second tier for the first time in their history.\n\nThe likes of Lewis Brunt, Andy Cannon, Danny Ward, Kieffer Moore and Issa Kabore are all edging ever closer to returning from injury to bolster Parkinson's ranks.\n\nThe possibility of adding to the squad in the January transfer window has not been ruled out, either.\n\nAs for Forest, it's back to the drawing board.\n\nWhile Wrexham made the most of their FA Cup opportunity, Dyche lambasted some of his players for \"not making the most of the platform\".\n\n\"We built up to the game, there was a serious edge to it, we told them about Wrexham - and we were miles off,\" Dyche said.\n\n\"Then we had three important players who came on and showed their hand and the whole thing changed and we looked like a Premier League outfit.\n\n\"The only positive - if there is one out of that first half - is it shows why I'm picking the team I am.\"\n\nForest's focus now will be Premier League survival while Wrexham's will be to join them there next season.\n\nAfter another special night at the Stok Cae Ras - the old romance with the FA Cup no distraction - Wrexham fans will wonder if the stars are aligning for their team this season.\n\nNottingham Forest: Shut Up and Show More Football",

Third-party deals, often arranged by businesses created to back the schools, are being used as workarounds this so-called salary cap.\n\nThe CSC, through its NIL Go portal, is supposed to evaluate those deals to make sure they are for a valid business purpose and fall within a fair range of compensation for the services being provided.\n\nThe CSC did not list examples of unapproved contracts, but college football has seen its share of seven-figure deals luring players to new schools since the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2.\n\nOne high-profile case involved Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who initially sought to enter the transfer portal and turn his back on a reported deal worth $4 million with the Huskies. Legal threats ensued and Williams changed course and stayed at Washington.\n\n\"Making promises of third-party NIL money now and figuring out how to honor those promises later leaves student-athletes vulnerable to deals not being cleared, promises not being able to be kept, and eligibility being placed at risk,\" the CSC letter said.\n\nThe commission listed two rules about contracts it evaluates, some of which have been termed “agency agreement” or “services agreement” in what look like attempts to bypass the rules.\n\n—\"The label on the contract does not change the analysis; if an entity is agreeing to pay a student-athlete for their NIL, the agreement must be reported to NIL Go within the reporting deadline.\"\n\n—\"An NIL agreement or payment with an associated entity or individual ... must include direct activation of the student-athlete’s NIL rights.\" This is a reference to the practice of “warehousing” NIL rights by paying first, then deciding how to use them later.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "Indiana vs. Oregon live score, updates, highlights from 2026 College Football Playoff semifinals originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Indiana vs. Oregon\n\nCollege Football Playoff schedule 2026\n\nWhen the No. 7 Indiana Hoosiers defeated the No. 3 Oregon Ducks in Autzen Stadium on October 11, Curt Cignetti and the Hoosiers finally announced their status as the new college football powerhouse. This 30-20 performance in one of the sport's most hostile environments was the season’s inflection point, cementing Indiana’s spectacular rise from historical underdog to national title contender.\n\nNow, less than three months later, the undefeated Hoosiers and the 13-1 Ducks meet again in the 2026 College Football Playoff semifinals. This is a clash of two established heavyweights, the last two Big Ten champions, led by two of the sport’s most successful and dynamic program builders, meeting with everything on the line.\n\nCignetti is the ultimate program architect, having accomplished a turnaround many call the greatest in college football history. Taking over the losingest program in the sport, Cignetti immediately installed a championship culture, leading the Hoosiers to a remarkable 25-2 record in two years in Bloomington. That run peaked just days ago with a 38-3 thrashing of perennial powerhouse Alabama in the Rose Bowl. Now in his second season, Cignetti has led Indiana to an undefeated campaign, the program's first-ever No. 1 ranking, and their first outright Big Ten championship since 1945.\n\nAcross the field is Dan Lanning, the defensive mastermind who has rapidly transformed Oregon into a consistent powerhouse, never missing a beat in a new conference landscape. Since taking over in Eugene, Lanning is a staggering 48-7, a tenure that includes leading Oregon to an undefeated season and Big Ten championship in their first year in the conference. While the Ducks experienced playoff heartbreak last season, they have since rattled off two dominating wins in the 2025 postseason to set up a rematch with the only team that has beat them this season.\n\nThe electric tension of this high-stakes rematch is amplified by the star power under center — two phenomenal quarterbacks whose seasons have carried their teams to the precipice of a national championship appearance. Fernando Mendoza became the first Indiana player ever to win the Heisman Trophy, leading the nation in total touchdowns. For Oregon, the offense flows through the arm of Dante Moore, who has orchestrated one of the most explosive and balanced attacks in the nation, thriving in Lanning’s system with pinpoint accuracy and commanding control.\n\nThe No. 1 Hoosiers and No. 5 Ducks have been, without question, two of the best teams in college football in 2025: both rank top-10 in scoring offense and scoring defense, boast explosive stars on both sides of the ball, and are guided by two of the sharpest coaches in the game. That's why they own a combined record of 27-1 and now face off for a national championship berth, with one team a win away from bringing home its first title in school history.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Indiana vs. Oregon in the College Football Playoff semifinals.

    "description": "Experts are urging guideline changes on what health professionals should wear to protect against flu-like illnesses including Covid",
    "fullText": "Experts are urging guideline changes on what health professionals should wear to protect against flu-like illnesses including Covid\n\nSurgical face masks provide inadequate protection against flu-like illnesses including Covid, and should be replaced by respirator-level masks – worn every time doctors and nurses are face to face with a patient, according to a group of experts urging changes to World Health Organization guidelines.\n\nThere is “no rational justification remaining for prioritising or using” the surgical masks that are ubiquitous in hospitals and clinics globally, given their “inadequate protection against airborne pathogens”, they said in a letter to WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\n“There is even less justification for allowing healthcare workers to wear no face covering at all,” they said.\n\nAt the height of the Covid pandemic an estimated 129bn disposable face masks were being used around the world every month, by the public and healthcare workers, with surgical masks the most widely available and recommended by most health authorities.\n\nRespirators designed to filter tiny particles – such as masks meeting FFP2/3 standards in the UK or N95 in the US – should instead be standard practice for medical interactions, they said.\n\nAs additional evidence emerged over the course of the pandemic, officials in many countries switched to recommending those masks as more effective.\n\nThe proposals would result in fewer infections in patients and health professionals, and reduce rates of sickness, absence and burnout in the health workforce, the authors contended.\n\nProf Adam Finkel of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, one of the letter’s organisers, said surgical masks were not designed to stop airborne pathogens but “invented to stop doctors and nurses from sneezing into the guts and the hearts of patients”.\n\nSurgical masks are to respirators what the typewriter was to the modern computer, said Finkel, who was chief regulatory official at the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 1995 and 2000: “Obsolete.”\n\nThe letter came out of discussions at an online conference organised last year called Unpolitics, looking at the implementation of evidence-based policies. It was authored by seven clinicians and scientists, including Finkel, and has been endorsed by almost 50 senior clinicians and researchers, and more than 2,000 members of the public, including clinically vulnerable patients.\n\nThere could be “off-ramps”, where governments or establishments decide respirators are not necessary, based on factors such as community infection rates, and ventilation or air filtration devices in a room, the letter says.\n\nWhile the suggested guidance would apply only in healthcare settings, where the risk of infection is higher, it is likely to provoke controversy. Face masks became a culture war issue during the Covid pandemic.\n\nIn December, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said she had been “slightly traumatised by all the mask wearing that we had to do during Covid” in response to comments by an NHS leader saying people with flu symptoms “must wear” a face mask in public.\n\nThe WHO cannot mandate global policies, but the signatories argue that an update to its infection prevention and control guidelines to recommend respirators could have a profound impact.\n\nThey also suggest that the WHO’s procurement infrastructure could help increase access to respirators even in poorer countries, with production of surgical masks phased down over time.\n\nSurgical masks are still “better than nothing”, Finkel conceded, with studies suggesting they block approximately 40% of Covid-sized particles in the air, compared with approximately 80% (and up to 98%) for respirators.\n\nHe says the comparative reduction in risk can be thought of like falling off a wall of four inches rather than four feet: “You can still trip and break an ankle at four inches, but you’re much better off.”\n\nCritics of the group’s arguments point to a lack of randomised controlled trials showing that physical measures slow the spread of respiratory viruses. Finkel and the other authors say such trials are inherently flawed and misleading, for example because people in a trial will not wear masks 24/7 and could be exposed to pathogens while unmasked.\n\nInstead they say physical tests showing that respirators stop particles, conducted in laboratories, offer sufficient evidence.\n\nThe WHO has been criticised for being slow to describe Covid-19 as spreading via “airborne” particles and the letter also calls for it to revisit earlier statements and “unambiguously inform the public that it spreads via airborne respiratory particles”.\n\nProf Trisha Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford, whose research is cited extensively in the letter and is one of its signatories, said: “A germ that does not get inside someone cannot make them sick. By sealing against the face, respirators force airflow to pass through them, filtering out the airborne germs. Respirators are designed to fit closely around the face and meet high filtration standards. Medical masks, in contrast, fit loosely and leak extensively.”\n\nThe letter’s supporters include members of the World Health Network, prominent US epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, and Guardian columnist George Monbiot.\n\nA WHO spokesperson said the letter required “careful review”. They said the organisation consulted widely with experts from different health and economic contexts when producing guidance on personal protective equipment for health workers, adding: “We are currently reviewing WHO’s Infection Prevention and Control guidelines for epidemic and pandemic-prone acute respiratory infections, based on the latest scientific evidence to ensure protection of health workers.”",

    "description": "Talha Tariq quickly found his company at the center of a fast-moving, high-stakes mitigation effort. The result: a bounty program, a cat-and-mouse patch fight, and a debate about open-source security coordination.",
    "fullText": "Talha Tariq and his colleagues at Vercel, the company that maintains Next.js, endured many sleep-deprived nights and weekends when React2Shell was discovered and disclosed soon after Thanksgiving. The defect, which affects vast stretches of the internet’s underlying infrastructure, posed a significant risk for Next.js, an open-source library that depends on vulnerable React Server Components.\n\nHe quickly realized he had a major problem to confront with CVE-2025-55182, a maximum-severity vulnerability affecting multiple React frameworks and bundlers that allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution in default configurations.\n\n“It’s literally the very first layer that everybody on the internet interacts with, so from a risk perspective and exposure perspective it’s basically as bad as it could be,” Tariq, the company’s CTO, told CyberScoop.\n\nTariq and his team initiated and coordinated a massive response effort with major cloud providers, the open source community and technology vendors hours after a developer reported the defect to Meta, which initially created and maintained React before moving the open-source library to the React Foundation in October.\n\nThe React team publicly disclosed the flaw with a patch four days later, after Vercel and many other impacted providers implemented platform-level mitigations to minimize damages.\n\nVercel’s deep integration with and  understanding of React meant it had an outsized responsibility to investigate and share its findings across the industry. Doing so would help validate the patch’s effectiveness and ensure downstream customers understood the potential risk once the vulnerability was disclosed, Tariq said.\n\n“Nobody slept through the weekend, nobody slept through the night,” he said, adding that it was a 24/7 response for Vercel for a minimum of two weeks — extending beyond the vulnerability disclosure into a cat-and-mouse game with attackers seeking to exploit the defect or bypass the patch.\n\nCybercriminals, ransomware gangs and nation-state threat groups were all taking swift measures to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nPalo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 confirmed more than 60 organizations were directly impacted by attacks involving exploitation of the defect by mid-December. Valid public exploits also hit an all-time high, nearing 200 by that time, according to VulnCheck.\n\nMalicious activity targeting React2Shell remains at a “sustained, elevated pace,” cybersecurity firm GreyNoise said in a Wednesday update. The company’s sensors have observed more than 8.1 million attempted attacks since the defect was disclosed, with daily volumes now ranging between 300,000 and 400,000 after peaking in the final weeks of December.\n\nVercel also responded to React2Shell with a quickly arranged HackerOne bounty program offering $50,000 for each verified technique that bypassed its web application firewall. More than 116 researchers participated, and Vercel ultimately paid out $1 million for 20 unique bypass techniques.\n\nThe company said this work allowed it to block more than 6 million exploit attempts targeting environments running vulnerable versions of Next.js. Tariq said it was the “best million dollars spent,” considering the potential impact and exposure it contained.\n\nTariq doesn’t look back on the initial response toReact2Shell with regret. Instead, he sees it as motivation to address a persistent challenge rooted in coordination.\n\nThe burden to promptly address security issues with the broader community often falls on individuals like Tariq who relied on personal relationships to coordinate an industry-wide response. This involved direct contact and communication with security leaders at Google, Microsoft, Amazon and others, he said.\n\n“We have to do better as an industry and figure out a more sustaining way to do this,” Tariq said.",

    "fullText": "Several months after Amazon bought artificial intelligence hardware startup Bee, the company said it’s working to make its $50 always-listening wearable more proactive, and indicated a larger revamp is in store.\n\nBee’s device, which can be worn on the wrist or clipped to a shirt, records and transcribes its owner’s activities, using that information to recap conversations and automatically create to-do lists in a companion app throughout the day.\n\nIt doesn’t have a display or built-in camera, and is designed to be “ambient AI” hardware that fades into the background without the user needing to constantly interact with it. The small gadget’s battery can last as long as a week before needing a recharge, according to the company.\n\nEarly AI-powered devices such as the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 have landed with a thud, owing to issues such as bugs, poor battery life and the lack of any standout features that would make them preferable to smartphones.\n\nAmazon has a spotty history with wearables and has shown less dedication to the category compared with its tentpole Fire TV, Kindle and Echo hardware. The company discontinued its Halo health tracker wristband in 2023 and has not released a new pair of wireless earbuds in almost three years. The Halo device offered some features that have carried forward with Bee, like the ability to detect a speaker’s mood.\n\nBee is trying to chart a different path from those gadgets by acting as a comprehensive daily journal that requires no prompting or manual input. Startups like Plaud have released competing gadgets with a similar purpose.\n\nThe notion of Amazon taking ownership of an always-listening accessory has made some people wary, but the startup said it maintains stringent privacy practices.",

    "description": "Cancer rates are increasing worldwide.",
    "fullText": "Cigarettes, combined with air pollution and agricultural chemicals, have led to a concerning spike in cancer in Lebanon, according to one researcher.\n\nAli Mokdad led a global survey on cancer rates, finding that his native country of Lebanon is experiencing the fastest increase in incidence and deaths. NPR summarized his research, which found that the frequency of new cancer cases in the country spiked 162% from 1990 to 2023, and cancer-related deaths increased by 80% over that period.\n\nThough pollution and agricultural chemicals are contributing to the issue, Mokdad told the news outlet that a lot of the cancer can be attributed to a strong smoking culture in the nation.\n\n\"There is no more taboo about smoking,\" Mokdad said. \"Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went with some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco.\"\n\nNPR noted that cancer rates are also increasing worldwide. While smoking may be the main culprit in Lebanon, we are now confronting a number of pollutants and chemicals that are increasing our risks for different types of cancers.\n\nFor instance, air pollution, which Mokdad noted is prevalent in Beirut, has been linked to a number of health problems, including respiratory issues and cancer. In fact, one new study found that women who live in more polluted areas suffer increased risks for breast cancer.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAirborne microplastics — which can be inhaled — also put people at risk for lung cancer, per another recent paper.\n\nIt's tough to prevent exposure to all cancer-causing pollutants, but one positive step is to quit smoking if you currently do. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has resources and tips to help smokers kick the habit.\n\nAnother thing anyone can do to reduce air pollution in our cities is to opt for carbon-free modes of transportation, such as biking, e-biking, or walking. Using public transportation can also help decrease pollution.\n\nReducing the amount of new microplastics entering the environment will help limit our exposure. The best way to do this is to stop using so many single-use plastics. Some easy swaps include reusable water bottles and shopping totes, and bringing your own sturdy container to restaurants for leftovers.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "While a salary of over $100,000 would’ve been enough for one to feel financially well off a decade ago, it doesn’t seem like enough these days.\n\nAccording to the recent Income Paradox Survey conducted by The Harris Poll, 64% of six-figure earners admitted that they felt a six-figure salary was no longer a sign of wealth and that they were in survival mode. The survey also revealed that 44% of six-figure earners felt that they were one unexpected bill away from “financial chaos.”\n\nGOBankingRates consulted with experts to determine the minimum net worth you would need to be considered rich in the U.S. right now and how you could work on getting there.\n\nFor You: Are You Rich or Middle Class? 8 Ways To Tell That Go Beyond Your Paycheck\n\nFind Out: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nHere’s what the research and experts had to say about the net worth that makes you rich in America today.\n\nAccording to Charles Schwab’s recent Modern Wealth Survey, Americans felt that you need a net worth of $2.3 million to be considered wealthy, down from the $2.5 million figure last year. The survey also found that Americans thought you needed $839,000 to be “financially comfortable,” up from the $778,000 figure in 2024. The $2.3 million net worth makes sense because one million dollars may not be enough to retire on, and you have to factor in inflation when thinking about your money.\n\n“Let’s assume that ‘rich enough’ is being able to receive annual dividends of $120,000 from your investments,” said Arie Brish, a professor at St Edwards University, board director, and investor. “At a moderate assumption of 5% per year, this equates to a net worth of $2.4 million.”\n\nBish also noted that being rich depends on your definition of it and the level you want to reach. The numbers make sense, since they’re close to what Americans perceive as rich in 2026.\n\n“You have to have a minimum net worth of one million dollars to be considered wealthy if you’re in your 30s or younger,” said Melanie Musson, a finance expert with Quote.com. “You’re only halfway through your career in your 30s, so you’re expected to still be paying off some debts while preparing for the future.” Since you still have an income and time on your side, you can continue to grow your wealth as you think about retirement.\n\nMusson also noted that the average American should have at least $1 million in retirement accounts before retiring. She warned that as you get older, you need more money to be considered wealthy because you’ll be living off that net worth without contributing to it like you did when you were employed. This is why it’s crucial that you manage your funds on a consistent basis so that you’re keeping up with inflation and your financial goals.",

    "fullText": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina has repaid the funds it drew from a $20 billion credit line with the Trump administration, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Friday, in a crucial step for Argentine President Javier Milei to restore confidence in his chronically distressed economy.\n\nIn addition to making payments to bondholders, Milei’s radical libertarian administration had “quickly and fully repaid its limited draw,” Bessent said, without specifying the amount.\n\nThe Treasury’s latest report on the status of the credit line said that Argentina’s central bank had traded pesos for $2.5 billion through the swap as of the end of October.\n\nThe Argentine Central Bank confirmed Bessent's announcement.\n\nThe contentious and largely unprecedented U.S. rescue provided dollar liquidity to the Trump administration's cash-strapped ideological ally and halted a market rout in Argentina ahead of crucial midterm elections last October.\n\nMilei’s libertarian party won a major victory in the vote, cementing support for his harsh austerity program and quelling investor concerns about the crisis-stricken country's ability to repay debts. In another sign of the revived optimism around Milei's reforms, his government issued a dollar bond for the first time in eight years last month, presaging a return to international bond markets.\n\nThanks to Argentina’s deposit, Bessent said, the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund tapped for the bailout holds no more Argentine pesos.\n\nHe praised the payment as a landmark that justified the Treasury’s bailout of Argentina, which raised doubts about the consistency of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy and drew backlash in the U.S. for putting taxpayer funds at risk. Experts have also criticized the opaque and apparently unconditional nature of the loan.\n\n“Stabilizing a strong American ally – and making tens of millions in profit for Americans – is an America First homerun deal,” Bessent wrote. “Setting the course for Latin America, a strong and stable Argentina that helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in our clear best interest.”\n\nLuis Caputo, Argentina’s economy minister thanked the Trump administration “for the trust in our economic policy.”\n\n“It is an excellent reality for our country to have been able to build this geopolitical alliance and to know that we have the explicit support of the most important country in the world,” he said.\n\nBut Argentina is not out of the woods.\n\nIts foreign exchange reserves still run perilously low. The country is set to come under further strain in the coming months from repayments on previous International Monetary Fund loans and other private debt.",

    "fullText": "A nine-year-old in Vietnam was hospitalized with a complete intestinal blockage caused by a massive hairball\n\nDoctors traced the obstruction to years of undetected hair eating linked to trichophagia\n\nThe child recovered after minimally invasive surgery and was discharged five days later\n\nA nine-year-old girl in Vietnam is recovering after doctors at the Franco-Vietnamese Hospital (or FV Hospital) removed a massive hairball that had completely blocked her gastrointestinal tract, creating a life-threatening emergency.\n\nAccording to a press release from the hospital, published on Thursday, Jan. 8, the child, identified only as H., was brought to the hospital's emergency department after several days of severe \"abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, weight loss and pallor.\"\n\nFurther examination from General Surgery, Gastroenterology, and Imaging specialists revealed a dense hairball nearly one meter long, tightly coiled from her stomach down into her small intestine.\n\n“During the examination, we noticed that the child’s hair was unusually brittle and standing upright, which prompted us to take a more detailed medical history,\" said Dr Le Duc Tuan, General Surgery Department at FV Hospital in a statement.\n\n\"Only then did the mother reveal that the child had developed a habit of pulling out and eating her hair since the age of two or three. The family had not paid much attention to it, assuming it was harmless,\" he added.\n\nAs explained in the release, hair cannot be digested, which led to the years of hair pulling and eating (a mental illness called trichophagia) to accumulate and harden into a mass that developed into an intestinal obstruction, blocking H.'s stomach outlet.\n\nPEOPLE reached out to FV Hospital for comment and did not receive an immediate response.\n\nTo remove the hairball, H. underwent a complex three-hour laparoscopic surgery, which allowed surgeons to access the obstructed segment of the intestine. At the same time, gastrointestinal endoscopy helped identify the exact location of the hairball and assisted with its removal from the gastric side.\n\nFollowing surgery, H. experienced immediate pain relief and resumed normal eating. The child was discharged from the facility five days after the procedure. In a recent follow-up, H. showed healthy weight gain and a marked improvement in both her physical condition and overall well-being.\n\nAccording to Dr Tuan, trichophagia is often associated with mild psychological disorders, habits formed in early childhood or conditions linked to stress and anxiety. For this reason, a child’s behaviour of pulling out and putting hair into the mouth should not be dismissed as “normal mischief.”\n\n“If not detected early, this behaviour can lead to very serious consequences, even becoming life-threatening,” he emphasized. \"In many cases, psychological support is also necessary to prevent recurrence.\"\n\nH.'s parents were given guidance and were advised to closely observe the child, spend more time communicating with her and seek psychological consultation if the behaviour continues.",

    "description": "The Ukranian military has relied heavily on Starlink satellites for communications since Russia invaded in 2022, but this response seems implausible.",
    "fullText": "Even if you've never used the service you're likely familiar with Starlink, the global internet service provider that depends on an array of satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO). SpaceX launched the first Starlink satellites in 2019, and since them more than 9,000 more have joined those initial five dozen. Starlink plans an eventual fleet of over 40,000, but before that can happen Russia seems interested in knocking some of them out of commission.\n\nIn late December of 2025 the Associated Press reported that \"Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation.\" The unnamed services apparently said Russia wouldn't target satellites individually or with electromagnetic pulse devices but rather employ a \"zone-effect\" weapon consisting of a cloud of dense pellets. While any unsourced reports should be taken lightly, potential Russian interest in taking out Starlink satellites could be due to Ukraine's dependence on Starlink since Russia invaded in 2022. While anti-satellite weapons aren't new, they present significant risk in the form of widespread debris fields that could threaten other satellites.\n\nA \"zone effect\" weapon like the one mentioned is akin to firing a shotgun blast at the satellites, with one major difference. While shotgun pellets are limited by physics and gravity to a few seconds of flight, debris in space continues zipping around until it hits something or is captured by the earth's gravity field. The AP quoted defense expert Victoria Samson of the Secure World Foundation as saying \"I would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\" Brigadier General Christopher Horner — who commands the Space division of the Canadian military — wasn't so sure. After confirming that his intelligence services hadn't turned up any evidence of such a weapon, he added the caveat \"it's not implausible.\"\n\nStarlink satellites travel at 27,000 km/h (almost 17,000 mph) and orbit at 550 km (341.75 miles) above the earth. Hitting even a small object at that speed can cause catastrophic damage to the delicate structures and instruments on a satellite, and Starlink's aren't the only ones in low-earth orbit.\n\nNASA defines low-earth orbit as below 1,200 miles, noting that the International Space Station occupies this level of space and that it plans to expand access to \"include government agencies, commercial providers, academic organizations, and potentially more.\"\n\nDepoloying a \"zone-effect\" weapon like the one described in Associated Press' reporting would certainly cause indiscriminate damage to these satellites. The potential risks would be obvious to any rogue state on the planet, and Russia surely has scientists who understand them. Even if Russia never plans on developing or using such a device, it's possible this story has been fabricated and leaked to deter Starlink's operational support of Ukraine. Starlink is also providing internet service in Venezuela after U.S. military operations there, although that's only through February 3.\n\nZone-effect weapons are relatively low-tech, and Russia has a dedicated space launch agency with the ability to deploy much more capable anti-satellite weapons. Among the most powerful military air defense systems in the world is Russia's S-500 Prometheus, which can take out satellites in the near reaches of low-earth orbit. The S-500 was engineered as a defensive weapon, but it's not a huge leap in logic to imagine it being used in a \"zone effect\" or other attack on Starlink satellites.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

    "description": "The team excavating in the west Nile Delta have discovered a necropolis and industrial complex dating from the Roman Period.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nArchaeologists excavating in the west Nile Delta have discovered a necropolis and industrial complex dating from the Roman Period.\n\nThought to date from around the 5th century B.C.E, the two complexes give insight on the manufacturing and burial practices of the time.\n\nHuman remains from the burials are now being analyzed to see how people of that era lived in the region.\n\nRelics of bygone eras keep surfacing in Egypt, and sometimes, these finds go beyond a single mummy or tomb. Hiding beneath the sun-baked earth of the western Nile Delta were an entire Roman Period necropolis and industrial complex that had gone undisturbed for 2,000 years before archaeologists recently dug them up.\n\nWhen archaeologists from the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities and the University of Padua excavated at the Kom el-Ahmar and Kom Wasit sites in Beheira Governorate, what surfaced was beyond anything they could have imagined. They had unearthed the remains of what was once part of a city dating back to the fifth century B.C.E. This was a period during which Egypt was influenced by Greek and Roman culture, and a merging of aesthetics is visible in artifacts such as carvings, pottery, and objects used in funerary rituals.\n\nThe Roman cemetery found in the area contained evidence of several different types of burial practices that reflected various cultural elements. The remains of 23 individuals laid to rest ranged from those buried directly in the ground to some in ceramic coffins. Bodies of children were encased in large, elongated amphorae. While mummification was still alive in this era—fusing Egyptian elements such as linen wrappings and hieroglyphs with Roman plaster funerary portraits painted with the face of the deceased—no mummies were found. At least on the outside, these remains showed that the people who once inhabited the city suffered no violence or epidemic. Ongoing bioarchaeological analysis will reveal how they lived.\n\nWhile the Nile Delta was more fertile thousands of years ago, Roman Egypt was still arid enough for both human remains and an entire trove of artifacts to survive. Archaeologists also excavated an industrial building spacious enough for six rooms. Much of that space was apparently used for processing salted fish, which was an important source of revenue, especially when it came to long-distance trade, at a time when there were few methods of food preservation available. Processing had left behind 9,700 fish bones which were dug up by the archaeological team.\n\nIn some of the other rooms, craftsmen and artisans had produced tools of stone and metal along with faience amulets. These generally inexpensive amulets were available to anyone regardless of how grand a tomb they could afford to build. Often taking on the form of scarabs or other animals, and sometimes deities, they were made of clay and glazed in bluish-green faience. These amulets were either worn by the living for protection or buried with the dead to secure entry into the afterlife. Mummies have often been found with faience amulets between their wrappings, and sometimes a scarab was placed over the heart to convince the goddess Ma’at of the individual’s purity when it came to her final judgment. Someone considered impure was thrown to the jaws of soul eater Ammit.\n\nAlso found in the ancient facility were unfinished limestone figures, some nearly complete and others that had barely been carved, which remained at its workstations when it was abandoned. There were also amphorae imported from Greece and Rome as well as fragments of Greek pottery that further reflect the influences of those cultures. Some of the best preserved artifacts, including a stunning pair of golden earrings thought to have belonged to a woman, have now been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for the living to gaze upon.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.",

    "fullText": "WARNING: This story includes reference to suicide.\n\nLawyers say a former Manitoba hockey coach who pleaded guilty in 2024 to luring and sexually assaulting a teenage player should be sent to prison for six years.\n\n\"This is a case about the profound wrongfulness and harmfulness of sexual offending against a child,\" Crown attorney Larissa Campbell told provincial court Judge Jerilee Ryle during a sentencing hearing for Madison Biluk in a Winnipeg courtroom on Thursday, where the prosecution and defence jointly recommended a six-year sentence.\n\n\"This is also a sentencing about choices — choices made by the accused that have had, and will continue to have, a profound effect on the victim.\"\n\nBiluk, now 31, was charged in November 2023 for abuse court heard happened between October 2019 and February 2021, when she groomed and sexually exploited a player on her team.\n\nBiluk was between 24 and 26 years old at the time, while the player was 15 and 16, an agreed statement of facts read in court said. The player's identity is protected by a court-ordered publication ban.\n\nCourt heard Biluk's relationship with the player started with driving her to practices and taking her skating, but later involved late-night calls and private messages on Snapchat that included explicit photographs, as well as personal discussions about sex and relationships.\n\nBiluk at one point told the player they shouldn't pursue a relationship because she was her coach, but her behaviour quickly escalated and soon involved taking intimate and nude videos and photos with the girl, and kissing and touching the player sexually, the agreed statement of facts said.\n\nIn a victim impact statement Campbell read in court, the player said what happened had a \"severe\" emotional impact on her life, leaving her with low self-worth, persistent mistrust, depression and anxiety that caused her to lose jobs and weakened her relationships with other people.\n\nThe player also said the cost of therapy \"took a huge toll\" on her family’s finances, and added she worries about running into Biluk.\n\n\"I am afraid of large public spaces for fear of seeing her or maybe somebody she knows,\" the statement said.\n\n\"I feel anxious when I see somebody who resembles her.\"\n\nWhen the girl started to move on and pursue relationships with people closer to her own age, court heard Biluk made a fake Snapchat account to send disparaging comments about the teen's new girlfriend to the teen's other friends.\n\nCourt heard Biluk and the player had ceased all contact by February 2021. But the teen, who had confided in Biluk that she was depressed and that she'd been sexually abused by a trusted adult, continued to struggle.\n\nThat resulted in a suicide attempt in early February 2023. Court heard that around that time, the girl called Biluk asking for help \"and suggested that the accused had played a role in her state of mental health,\" Campbell said. About a week later, the girl ended up at the Crisis Response Centre following another suicide attempt.\n\nBiluk’s lawyer said Thursday his client feels great remorse and never meant to hurt the girl, telling the judge the situation \"morphed from initially altruistic wishes into something that unfortunately became criminal.\"\n\nWhen given the chance to speak in court, Biluk apologized to the player for the harm she caused, and to everyone else affected by what she did.\n\n\"I'm just going to keep trying to improve myself every day and make amends however I can,\" said Biluk, who sat in the courtroom gallery with her family during sentencing arguments.\n\nThe abuse came to light after the girl posted a TikTok video in October 2023 detailing her experience with Biluk. That video came to the attention of police.\n\nThe teen later shared with police a number of photos and videos of her and Biluk together, as well as messages where Biluk referred to their relationship as \"one of the most risky things in my life.\"\n\nAfter her arrest, Biluk said she still cared for the player but that she was shocked by the TikTok video the teen posted. Biluk described the girl as a \"pathological liar,\" the agreed facts said.\n\nBiluk, who appeared in court Thursday with her right arm in a sling, is expected to return to court to be sentenced and taken into custody near the end of March, after completing scheduled surgery, court heard. She is no longer coaching and remains out on bail under conditions.\n\nCourt heard Biluk coached hockey from 2019 through 2023, and during that time drew concerns on several occasions from coaching staff who said her behaviour went beyond the professional coach-and-player relationship, Campbell said. Those concerns resulted in several warnings but did not curb her behaviour.\n\nAfter her contact with the player ended, Biluk continued coaching in Alberta and Manitoba, where her behaviour again raised concerns about inappropriate boundaries with players.\n\nWhile there were investigations into her behaviour in both provinces, no further charges were pursued, Campbell said.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling, here’s where to look for help:",

    "description": "Jonathan Gerlach was arrested Jan. 6 at the cemetery with a bag containing human remains of children and skulls, along with additional bones in his vehicle.",
    "fullText": "A Lancaster County man is facing more than 500 charges after investigators say they discovered more than 100 human skeletal remains in his home.\n\nOfficers say a Tuesday night arrest of 34-year-old Jonathan Gerlach culminated a monthslong investigation into break-ins at Mount Moriah Cemetery in Yeadon, where at least 26 mausoleums and vaults had been forced open since early November.\n\nPolice had been looking into the string of burglaries when an investigator checked Gerlach's vehicle plates and found he had been near Yeadon repeatedly during the period when the burglaries occurred. Police say the break-ins centered on sealed vaults and mausoleums containing older burials, which had been smashed open or had stonework damaged to reach the remains inside.\n\nHe was arrested as he walked back toward his car with a crowbar at the 1855 cemetery, police said, and a burlap bag in which officers found the mummified remains of two small children, three skulls and other bones.\n\nGerlach told investigators he took about 30 sets of human remains and showed them the graves he stole from, police said.\n\nInvestigators said the arrest led to a search of Gerlach's home in Ephrata, Lancaster County, where they found well over 100 skeletal remains.\n\n\"Detectives walked into a horror movie come to life the other night. This is an unbelievable scene,\" said Tanner Rouse, the Delaware County District Attorney. \"Understand, some of these are 200 years old. Some obviously much newer, there's one with a pacemaker still attached to the body.\"\n\n\"I grieve for those who are upset by this, who are going through it, who are trying to figure out if it is in fact their loved one or their child, because we found remains that we believe to be months-old infants among those that he had collected,\" added Rouse.\n\nDelaware County DA holds news conference on gravesite thefts on Jan. 8, 2026.\n\nPolice believe the remains were also taken from other cemeteries throughout the region. They are also investigating a Facebook group titled \"Human Bones and Skull Selling Group,\" where Gerlach was tagged and pictured holding a skull.\n\n\"Very simply, detectives have recovered an awful lot of bones at this point, and we are still trying to piece together who they are, where they are from, and how many we are looking at. It's going to be quite some time before we have a final answer,\" stated Rouse.\n\nAuthorities said they do not yet know if any remains were sold or why Gerlach wanted them.\n\n\"The remains were in various states,\" Rouse explained. \"Some were hanging as it were. Some were pieced together, some were skulls on a shelf.\"\n\nNeighbors were shaken after learning about the charges.\n\n\"It's supposed to be a nice, quaint little town, and here you have somebody with bodies in their house,\" said Kim Hackman, of Ephrata.\n\n\"I just wanna know the motive, like why would someone do that?\" asked Conner Barker, of Ephrata.\n\nThe gravesite is considered the country's largest abandoned burial ground, according to Friends of Mount Moriah Cemetery, which helps maintain the 160-acre landmark in Yeadon that's home to an estimated 150,000 grave sites.\n\nYeadon Police Chief Henry Giammarco called the case one of the most disturbing he has ever seen.\n\n\"Rest in peace is rest in peace, and this is definitely something that tears at your heartstrings,\" Giammarco said.\n\nPolice are working to identify the remains and notify families.\n\nThe full list of charges against Gerlach includes the following:\n\nBurglary - Not Adapted for Overnight Accommodation, No Person Present (F1) - 26 counts\n\nCriminal Trespass - Enter Structure (F3) - 26 counts\n\nCriminal Trespass - Enter Structure (F2) - 26 counts\n\nAbuse of Corpse (M2) - 100 counts\n\nTheft By Unlawful Taking (F3) - 100 counts\n\nReceiving Stolen Property (F3) - 100 counts\n\nIntentional Desecration of Public Monument (M2) - 26 counts\n\nIntentional Desecration of Venerated Object (M2) - 26 counts\n\nIntentional Desecration of Historic Lots and Burial Places (M1) - 26 counts\n\nCriminal Mischief - Damage Property (M3) - 26 counts\n\nDefiant Trespasser (S) - 7 counts\n\nHe is being held on $1 million bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for January 20, 2026.\n\nThe investigation remains ongoing\n\nThe Delaware CountyDistrict Attorney's Office urges anyone with additional information to contact Detective Leah Cesanek at 610-623-1500 or Detective Chris Karr at 610-891-4700.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge’s ruling that a Trump administration prosecutor in upstate New York was serving unlawfully has spilled into another case — with the same judge saying he can’t obtain tax return information in a criminal investigation because he lacks authority.\n\nThe ruling Thursday against prosecutor John Sarcone from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield came the same day the judge disqualified Sarcone from overseeing investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Schofield ruled that Sarcone was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York and that any “of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable.”\n\nSarcone is among the prosecutors around the country found by federal judges to lack authority after the Republican administration used unusual maneuvers to place them or keep them in their posts without U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said Schofield's ruling was consistent with previous decisions.\n\n“It does seem like more and more courts are coming around to this view,” he said.\n\nIn a separate ruling Thursday, Schofield denied Sarcone's application for a court order directing the IRS to disclose tax return information for a limited liability company as part of a criminal investigation. The application remains sealed and it's not clear who filed the tax returns sought in the Oct. 2 request.\n\nApplications for that tax information can only be made by officials holding specific positions, such as U.S. attorneys. The Manhattan judge said Sarcone lacked authority to authorize the application because he was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney — mirroring her reasoning in the case involving James.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to the northern district.\n\nCourts in New Jersey, Nevada and California have held that similarly installed acting U.S. attorneys lacked lawful authority. Trump’s former personal attorney, Alina Habba,resigned as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey in December after an appeals court said she had been serving unlawfully.",

After Trump called on Ryan Lance of ConocoPhillips to speak, Rubio could be seen passing a handwritten note to Trump while Vance, 41, seemed to look on with confusion.\n\n\"Marco just gave me a note,\" Trump told the room of executives. Rubio capped his pen and glanced down, but as the president began reading the note aloud, he immediately looked at him.\n\n\"Go back to Chevron,\" Trump read from Rubio's note. \"They want to discuss something. Go back to Chevron.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Vance was clearly amused, laughing on one side of the president as Rubio smiled in apparent discomfort on the other.\n\n\"Go ahead, I'm going back to Chevron,\" Trump said as he placed the note back down on the table.\n\nHe then patted Rubio on the back as he told him, \"Thank you, Marco.\"\n\n\"Was there a question, Mr. President?\" a voice off camera could be heard asking Trump, who then picked up the paper again as he said, \"Yes, go ahead,\" before asking, \"Marco, what was the, what are you saying here?\"\n\nSecretary of energy Chris Wright then took over, asking Mark Nelson of Chevron to share updates from the company. As Nelson spoke, Rubio took the note back and folded it up before tucking it away.\n\nRubio also made headlines in the fall for another note written to Trump, which he gave the president during an Oct. 8, 2025 meeting with conservative influencers and the press.\n\nThe contents of the note, which were captured by photographers in the room, told Trump he needed to approve a statement on social media about a tentative peace agreement between Israel and Hamas.\n\nRubio signaled for Trump's attention during the meeting before sharing the private update with the president concerning the need for him to \"approve\" a social media post, suggesting Trump hadn't written the post himself.\n\nA photo captured by The Associated Press revealed the message, which read: “You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.” Trump quickly told meeting attendees that he had good news.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we’re very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they’re gonna need me pretty quickly,” he said. “So we’ll take a couple of more questions.”\n\nAP reported at the time that Trump continued the meeting for 10 more minutes before telling the group he had to \"try and solve some problems in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Although I’m very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows,” he continued. “We don’t want to take any chances. So we’re going to go and do that.\"",

It also created a dangerous, unlivable situation involving structural and gas line issues.\n\n\"Right after surviving the Eaton fire, I lost my job, and shortly after that the bear began tearing into the structure of my home,\" Johnson said in a GoFundMe page. \"I have video footage of it twisting gas pipes, which created an extremely dangerous situation and forced me to shut off my utilities just to stay safe.\"\n\nBear Remains Under California Home After Weeks Of Failed Removal Attempts\n\nThe bear eviction finally took place after Johnson contacted BEAR League, an organization that specializes in bear removal emergencies in Lake Tahoe, located seven hours north of Altadena.\n\nBEAR League told Fox News Digital on Thursday that the organization was \"pleased to have helped Ken Johnson with this bear.\"\n\n\"A Southern California homeowner had a large male bear living under his house for more than a month before reaching out to the BEAR League for help,\" the organization added in a post on Facebook on Thursday.\n\nBEAR League told Fox News Digital that the league used paintballs filled with vegetable oil that hit the bear in the backside. The wildlife rescue group reportedly finished the job in less than 20 minutes.\n\nWild Bear Makes 'Very Polite' Surprise Visit To California Zoo Before Returning To Forest\n\n\"After earlier removal attempts by state wildlife officials were unsuccessful, BEAR League first responders Scott and Dave traveled to the Los Angeles area to assist,\" the organization added. \"Scott, one of our most experienced responders, crawled beneath the home—fully aware the bear was still there—to get behind him and encourage him to exit through the crawl space opening.\"\n\nTo prevent the bear from denning in the crawl space again, the organization said it \"loaned electric unwelcome mats to give the homeowner time to make repairs and secure the crawl space to prevent another visit.\"\n\nAccording to social media footage posted by the organization, the mat worked just as designed, and the bear scurried away when it returned.\n\nBEAR League emphasized that residents should be cautious about having open crawl spaces, noting that properly securing them helps people coexist safely with wildlife.\n\n\"We remind those who live in bear country that a poorly-secured crawl space is an open invitation for a winter visitor like this bear,\" the league said to Fox News Digital. \"BEAR League responds multiple times per day at this time of year to evict bears from under homes in the Lake Tahoe region, and we’ve done so for 30 years without cost to the homeowner.  We work hard to educate people who share space with the bears that if humans take some very simple steps, they can live in harmony with the bears.\"\n\nTuesday’s success ended a long streak of failed eviction attempts by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which had been trying to remove the bear for over a month. At one point, a trap even caught the wrong bear. Efforts that included bait, noisemakers and even a trap that caught the wrong bear all failed.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "\"I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress,\" Gates wrote in his annual letter.",
    "fullText": "Last year didn’t go the way Bill Gates hoped. As a philanthropist who has dedicated billions to improving everything from healthcare and education in poor countries to climate change action, Gates could only watch as the Trump administration slashed swathes of foreign aid contracts. \n\nThe Microsoft co-founder has criticised the cost-cutting regime, much of which was enacted under Elon Musk’s Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He warned the action could directly result in the death of children, a claim which Tesla CEO Musk demanded evidence.\n\nWriting in his annual letter this year, the Gates Foundation founder was optimistic but candid, writing: “I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.”\n\nHe added: “The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under five years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.”\n\nLast month the Gates Foundation’s Goalkeepers Report revealed an additional 12.5 million child deaths could occur by 2045 if development assistance for health (including government spending) is reduced by 20% from 2024 levels, according to bespoke modelling based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\n“Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization,” Gates wrote. “My answer is this: I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.”\n\nBut, that optimism comes with a deadline, or as Gates puts it “there are footnotes to my optimism.”\n\n“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates continued. “As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.”\n\n“I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.”\n\nIn 2025, Gates announced his $200 billion moonshot: He was donating “virtually all [his] wealth”—about $100 billion—to his foundation. It was the largest philanthropic commitment in modern history, and came with strings attached. The funds (made up of its current endowment and projected growth) must be spent in the next 20 years.\n\nWhile Gates made the announcement this year, his intentions have been clear for many years. In 2010 Gates, his wife at the time Melinda French Gates, and Berkshire Hathaway co-founder Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge, making a public commitment to philanthropy, which has since been signed by the likes of philanthropist Mackenzie Scott and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky.\n\nIn a bid to bridge a gap in government funding, Gates is calling on fellow wealthy philanthropists. He wrote: “This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.”\n\nA report on billionaires from Oxfam, released most recently in January 2025, revealed that in 2024, the number of billionaires rose to 2,769, up from 2,565 a year prior. It also said it expects at least five people to reach trillionaire status a decade from now.\n\nGates added: “I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1% of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "A Guggenheim heir is raising $50 million to back media and creator startups. Here are 4 areas he's betting on.",
    "description": "Guggenheim Brothers Media and Abu Dhabi's EIH formed a fund for media, entertainment, and creator economy investments.",
    "fullText": "A new $50 million fund is targeting media, entertainment, and creator economy startups, tapping into Hollywood networks and the UAE's growing appetite for cultural investment.\n\nUS investment firm Guggenheim Brothers Media is launching the fund with backing from Abu Dhabi-based Ethmar International Holding.\n\nThe firm is led by Dillon Lawson-Johnston and Criswell Fiordalis, who are looking to write checks of $2 million to $5 million, targeting 10 to 15 companies. They plan to seek other investors as well and hope to grow the fund to as much as $75 million.\n\nThe pair brings extensive entertainment and cultural ties. Lawson-Johnston is the great-great-grandson of Solomon R. Guggenheim, founder of New York City's famed Guggenheim Museum, and has experience from UTA, Sugar23, Untitled Entertainment, and Anonymous Content. Fiordalis has had roles at Lionsgate, MRC, Hello Sunshine, and Webtoon. The two had previously invested in Stapleview, a comedy platform, and The Lighthouse, Whalar Group's campus for creators.\n\nEIH is an investment holding company that's led by a prominent member of a UAE ruling family. The UAE, like other Gulf nations, has been pouring money into US media and entertainment as it tries to diversify away from oil. One UAE government project, Creators HQ, aims to get 10,000 creators to relocate to the country. Lawson-Johnston's family is set to open the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi in 2026.\n\n\"We're investing in creativity and culture, and we're looking to leverage this amazing museum that's being built,\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nHe and Fiordalis want to deploy the fund mainly in the US, where the creator economy is more mature. The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimated that advertisers would spend $37 billion with creators in 2025, a sum that it says is growing four times faster than overall media spending.\n\nHere are four trends the new fund is betting on:\n\nInvestors tend to shy away from backing individual creators because of the risk of overdependence on a single person, also called \"key man risk.\" That's why some big names like Steven Bartlett and Alex Cooper are building networks of complementary creators (and attracting millions of dollars in the process).\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in creators who are looking beyond themselves when building talent-related businesses.\n\nThey'll also look at companies that develop creators through talent management or other services. One example is their earlier investment in Stapleview, which manages social media-born comedians and produces with them.\n\nTraditional media companies have a lot of intellectual property that they want to give new life to in digital media. It's why Disney did a deal that'll open its vault of famous characters to OpenAI.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston, both of whom have spent time at legacy media companies, envision a mutually beneficial way for creators and Hollywood to collaborate in this area and aim to facilitate this process.\n\n\"If you're SpongeBob SquarePants, what do you do other than taking SpongeBob and slapping it on YouTube and saying, 'Oh, we now have a digital presence?'\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nBrands are clamoring to get their message out using creators, leveraging influencers' built-in distribution and popularity among younger consumers. The IAB found in November that brands were most eager to work with mid-tier creators — those with between 50,000 and 500,000 followers — because of their ability to drive sales and awareness.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston see an opportunity to back platforms that connect such influencers with brands using a mix of people and technology. They pointed to the platform Kyra, which raised $15 million in 2022, as one they admire.\n\n\"There's a lot of, not top creators, but downstream creators that have way more engagement and can drive a lot more value to said brand,\" Fiordalis said.\n\nAs more brands shift their budgets to creators, they face increasing pressure to prove that their spending has paid off. Brands have gone from just caring about a creator's follower count to looking at other ways to prove efficacy.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in companies trying to standardize how creators are measured.\n\n\"Who's standardizing the definition of value across these platforms and across pieces of content?\" Fiordalis said. \"I think the industry is getting to a point where it needs that.\"",

    "description": "Canceled flights following airspace closures have left my family stranded in the Caribbean for a week. It's been expensive, but we've made it work.",
    "fullText": "My family expected the usual post-holiday travel blues after spending Christmas and New Year's on an ultra-luxury Caribbean cruise. What we did not expect was to get stranded the moment we stepped off the ship.\n\nOn Saturday morning, we disembarked our ship in Barbados and boarded a prearranged island sightseeing tour that was supposed to drop us back at the airport for our afternoon flights home.\n\nMidway through the tour, our phones began lighting up. News was breaking that military action tied to Venezuela had triggered widespread airspace restrictions across the eastern Caribbean.\n\nOur flight from the island back to the US was far from the only one suddenly canceled.\n\nNow, we were among thousands of others in the Caribbean whose plans were affected during one of the busiest travel seasons of the year.\n\nMy family, including my mom, brother, sister-in-law, and 7-year-old nephew, suddenly needed lodging, food, and a plan on an island alongside hundreds — maybe thousands — of other people in the same boat.\n\nBecause we hadn't booked our airfare through the cruise line, there was little it could do beyond offering general guidance.\n\nAnd despite constant calls to airlines and online searches, I could not secure five seats on any commercial carrier back to any US gateway for at least seven days.\n\nAt one point, I explored chartering a private jet as a theoretical fallback.\n\nOne representative quoted me over $70,000 to fly my brother and his family from Barbados to Dallas — even so, there was no aircraft available until at least Tuesday.\n\nEven if we had pursued chartering a private jet, we would've missed much of the workweek regardless. That mattered.\n\nI'd already been away from the office for an extended holiday break and ultimately had to cancel other planned PTO and another upcoming trip to compensate for the extra time I'd be spending on this one.\n\nMy sister-in-law was able to work remotely, but my brother lost revenue while stranded. My nephew missed school.\n\nAt that point, the jet stopped being a real solution and became a signal. When disruptions hit at scale, availability disappears first, and the consequences ripple well beyond travel itself.\n\nMissed shifts, lost income, burned PTO, and disrupted schedules become part of the cost long before anyone actually gets home.\n\nSince going home that weekend was clearly not an option, we needed to find a place to stay the night.\n\nAvailability mattered more than comfort, but even that was scarce due to the surge in demand. Several hotels I called said they had nothing available until Monday at the earliest, and when options did appear online, they weren't cheap.\n\nAt one point, I saw single rooms at a high-end hotel listed for about $4,500 each. Paying nearly $9,000 a night for two rooms for our group didn't feel realistic or appealing, especially given the uncertainty surrounding when we could get home.\n\nUltimately, I used a consolidator website to find us a small two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath unit at a three-star resort for one night for $600.\n\nMy mom and I shared one room with twin beds, and my nephew slept on a couch. It wasn't ideal and didn't feel sustainable.\n\nOvernight, though, airspace and schedules stabilized, and our airline re-accommodated us on its next available flight home — seven days later than originally planned.\n\nStill, having a confirmed departure, even one a full week out, changed everything.\n\nNow, we could make deliberate decisions about how to spend our wait time instead of reacting day by day in a crowded hub with limited options.\n\nUnable to return to the US for the better part of a week, we decided to leave Barbados on Sunday.\n\nStaying in the larger hub would've meant competing with lots of other stranded travelers for a shrinking inventory at inflated prices. By going to a nearby island, we hoped we could find more available accommodations with more predictable, consistent rates.\n\nThe goal was not necessarily to upgrade our trip — it was to regain control.\n\nWe ended up spending about $600 a person on round-trip flights to Canouan, a small island in St Vincent and the Grenadines, located roughly 120 miles from Barbados. The cost almost felt reasonable given the alternatives.\n\nUnlike Barbados, where inventory had seemingly vanished overnight, it still had availability across several tiers of hotels.\n\nIt made sense given that Canouan is harder to get to and quite small.\n\nThere's no large commercial airport, minimal cruise traffic feeding the island, and far fewer daily flights under normal circumstances. In a mass disruption, that limited visibility worked in its favor.\n\nWe found entire homes and villas available that night for less than what I'd seen one room costing at some hotels in Barbados. Though prices were high, they were at least in line with luxury resorts across the Caribbean, not just inflated because of demand.\n\nCanouan is not inexpensive — most meals alone have cost a few hundred dollars — it is simply predictable.\n\nOver the next few days, the scale, calm, and thoughtfulness of the island made an otherwise stressful situation feel not just manageable, but genuinely restorative.\n\nSo far, we've spent multiple unplanned days in the Caribbean and thousands of dollars navigating cancellations, accommodations, meals, and rebooking costs.\n\nIt was far more than we budgeted for a holiday trip, and none of it was planned.\n\nAlthough travel insurance may offset costs related to flight cancellations, it wasn't able to solve the core problem of getting us home more quickly. No policy can rebook you onto a flight that does not exist.\n\nLuxury travel does not insulate you when systems fail — and sometimes, the smartest move when you are stranded is not to fight the chaos, but to be flexible.\n\nUltimately, we were fortunate to have options we could afford. Many travelers were not.\n\nThough we can't make up for the shifts missed and PTO lost, being willing and able to pivot turned our experience around.\n\nNext time I travel abroad, I'll build in more buffer days, research alternative regional hubs in advance, and think less about where I'm supposed to be and more about where I could realistically go when plans collapse.",

    "title": "How banning big investors from buying homes could affect prices",
    "description": "Big investors own a small fraction of America's single-family homes. But they're big players in certain Sun Belt markets. Trump wants to ban them.",
    "fullText": "Industry watchers on both sides of the aisle say President Donald Trump's recently announced goal of banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes won't address the root cause of high home prices: a shortage of homes.\n\nMajor investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices.\n\nThese mega landlords own only a tiny fraction of the overall US housing market, although they control a significantly larger share of single-family rental homes in certain markets, particularly in the Sun Belt. Studies have found that they may have contributed to increased home prices and rents in certain areas.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, large investors bought thousands of distressed properties, particularly in Southeastern cities. They correctly predicted that home values and rents in many of the targeted areas would rise over time with population growth.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, and interest rates dropped, investors again snapped up thousands of homes, particularly in cities across the South and Sun Belt. This sparked alarm in communities where individual homebuyers struggled to compete with all-cash offers from major investors.\n\nOverall, large investors own only about 2% of the single-family rental housing stock, according to a 2024 analysis by the GAO. And since 2022, large investors have slowed their purchasing as interest rates have spiked and home prices have remained high. Some major investors have shifted their business model to buying homes in bulk directly from homebuilders, rather than purchasing them one by one.\n\n\"You're seeing this huge increase in debt costs to buy a home, and rents have softened mostly or been flat, and then with prospects of potentially declining home prices, or at least flat home prices, it's just tough,\" said Glenn Hull, CEO of SFR Analytics, which provides software and data tools to real estate investors and others.\n\nInstitutional investors have tended to cluster their purchases, resulting in more concentrated investments in certain neighborhoods in a handful of markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, Charlotte, and Tampa. The 2024 GAO report found that they own 25% of single-family rental homes in Atlanta and 21% of those in Jacksonville. Researchers have found that mega landlords may have contributed to the rise in housing costs, particularly in areas where they're heavily concentrated.\n\n\"The studies reviewed by GAO indicate that institutional investment may increase rents and home prices, particularly in places with high rates of institutional ownership,\" the GAO report said. It added that there are some indications that big investors are more likely to file evictions.\n\nStill, the evidence isn't particularly strong that big investors charge more than smaller landlords, or that they outcompete other buyers.\n\n\"It is unclear whether institutional investors crowd out individual home buyers, and evidence about whether they behave differently than other landlords is thin,\" a 2023 report by the Brookings Institution found.\n\nTo the extent that mega landlords are hurting affordability, it's a local problem in the most affected neighborhoods, industry watchers say.\n\n\"It's not a national story,\" said Jason Lewris, cofounder of Parcl Labs, which tracks institutional investors in housing. \"If you look within those markets, it's a handful of zip codes.\"\n\nMuch remains unknown about what kind of ban Trump intends to pursue. The administration hasn't defined \"large\" institutional investor. Trump said he would ban these investors \"from buying more single-family homes,\" but it's not clear whether they would also be required to sell their current portfolios.\n\nA White House spokesman, Davis Ingle, said in an emailed statement, \"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs.\"\n\nTrump's proposed ban is part of a recent White House effort to address housing affordability concerns. The president announced on Thursday that he's directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds in an attempt to bring down mortgage interest rates.\n\nHousing economists say that banning major investors from buying additional homes would do little to improve affordability.\n\n\"Targeting a small subset of landlords without addressing underlying market conditions and policy gaps will not meaningfully improve the well-being of renters and prospective homebuyers,\" Jenny Schuetz, a former senior fellow focused on housing at the Brookings Institution, told the House Financial Services Committee during a 2022 hearing on corporate investors in residential real estate.\n\nSchuetz, in an interview with Business Insider, called Trump's proposed ban a \"red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nThat's in part because investors don't change the demand for or supply of housing.\n\n\"The housing demand is the same regardless of whether a household rents or buys a home, and housing supply is the same regardless of whether a landlord supplies the unit or a household owns it,\" researchers at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, wrote in a 2024 report in which they called institutional investors a \"scapegoat\" that distracts from the supply shortage driving higher prices.\n\n\"Periods of rapid rent increases correspond to periods of greater household formation coupled with supply shortages, not institutional investor buyers,\" they added. \"It is hard to argue that institutional rental operators drive up home prices over any reasonable period.\"\n\nInstead, economists argue that an undersupply of homes is the major underlying reason for rising prices.\n\n\"If we actually wanted to solve that problem, bringing down the cost of home ownership, what we should be doing is increasing the supply of housing,\" said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin.\n\nMom-and-pop landlords and other smaller investors own the vast majority of single-family rentals in the US. Stopping a large investor from buying a home doesn't necessarily mean a first-time homebuyer or other individual would end up purchasing the house, Fairweather said. Instead, many of these homes would be snapped up by the main competitors of big investors: smaller landlords.\n\nFrom the tenant's perspective, having a mom-and-pop landlord isn't necessarily better than renting a home from a large investor. And when it comes to enforcing laws that protect tenants, including fair housing laws, it can be easier to prove a pattern of behavior by larger landlords, Fairweather said.\n\nIf the federal government succeeds in passing a ban, enforcing it could be tricky. Large investors could break themselves up into smaller shell companies to avoid the prohibition, Lewris said.\n\nThere are other ways to stop investors from buying up more homes that could be more effective. One alternative is to discourage the behavior by raising property taxes on homes owned by institutional investors, thereby making the practice less lucrative, Hull and Fairweather said.\n\n\"In general, bans don't really work, because people find a way around them,\" Fairweather said, \"but if you tax something, at least you get tax revenue out of it that could be used to support things like first-time homebuyer programs or building more affordable housing.\"\n\nInvestors often argue that they actually boost quality housing options for lower-income people by offering rentals in neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes. Tenants tend to have far lower incomes and wealth than homebuyers. And the neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes often have attractive amenities, including good schools and jobs.\n\n\"The narrative today is that what my business does is wrong, that buying homes and renting them is a bad thing because I'm keeping people from buying homes,\" Sean Dobson, CEO of Amherst, a single-family rental company heavily invested in the Sun Belt, said at the real estate conference ResiDay in November 2025. \"It couldn't be any further from the truth, but it's a powerful message.\"\n\nInstead, he argued, his firm helps its tenants live in homes that they couldn't afford a down payment for or wouldn't qualify for a mortgage to buy.\n\nFairweather agreed that banning large landlords from owning single-family homes would mean fewer tenants could live in these wealthier neighborhoods. \"In a way, it boxes out renters and exacerbates some of the inequalities that exist in the country,\" she said.\n\nMadison Hoff contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Here's how Trump's plan to load up on mortgage bonds could impact housing affordability",
    "description": "Trump's plan has already pushed mortgage rates down, but industry experts say they're skeptical of a long-term impact on housing affordability.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump this week has zeroed in on an issue that's at the heart of America's affordability crisis: housing costs.\n\nBut it's not clear if his latest proposal, which involves instructing his \"representatives\" to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, will move the needle for the housing market in the long run, economists and analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe mortgage-bond purchasing plan, which Trump announced on Truth Social Thursday night, is a lot to grapple with for people unfamiliar with the mortgage market. But the logic behind how this could make buying a home easier goes something like this:\n\nThe plan could have a quantitative easing-like impact on the market, Oliver Allen, a senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told Business Insider. QE refers to the Fed's bond-buying program aimed at adding liquidity to the debt market and stimulating economic activity by encouraging more borrowing. However, the Fed has generally undertaken QE in times of economic turmoil, while Trump is piling into mortgage bonds while the economy is doing pretty well.\n\nThe president's plan has already moved mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped from 6.21% to 5.99% on Friday morning, according to Mortgage News Daily. That's the lowest level in about three years, and experts are optimistic that rates could fall further.\n\nZelman & Associates, a boutique housing research firm, estimated that mortgage rates could fall slightly below 6% under the new MBS purchasing plan, down from its most recent mortgage rate forecast of 6.2% for 2026.\n\nJoel Berner, a senior economist at Realtor.com, estimated that the purchasing plan could drive mortgage rates as much as 50 basis points.\n\nBut the move might be a one-time drop, and the plan may not alter the picture for housing affordability in the long run, Berner and Allen said.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump meant when he said he told his \"representatives\" to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. The timing and mechanism behind the bond purchases also remain unclear, Zelman & Associates wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nIt's also murky how much of a difference $200 billion will make in the $9 trillion MBS market, analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on Friday. The Fed, for reference, has around $2 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet, Realtor.com's Berner said.\n\nThe MBS market is the largest and most liquid in the world after US Treasurys, and buyers are plentiful. Purchasing around 2% of the total outstanding value of bonds in the market might amount to a drop in the bucket a far as impact.\n\n\"Without that same level of scale and credibility, any impact on mortgage rates would likely be modest and short-lived,\" Berner wrote.\n\n\"I don't think this policy on its own can really do very much,\" Allen said.\n\nWhile borrowing costs have been a barrier to homebuyers in recent years, the real issue is supply. A lack of available homes has been the key constraint to truly making housing affordable for more Americans, Berner said. By some estimates, the US is short 5 million homes, or 3.7% of the current supply.\n\nShould rates come down without an increase in housing inventory, that could actually worsen affordability by intensifying competition in the housing market and causing home prices to rise.\n\n\"The long-term real impact is on the supply side. So this demand boost might help in the short run, might boost sales activity, potentially might boost prices or stabilize prices at least, but we don't really see this as a long-run solution,\" Berner told Business Insider.\n\n\"I think even if you can nudge down mortgage rates at the margin, you're still going to have very high home prices and very stretched affordability as a result,\" Allen said.\n\nTaken along with Trump's ban on large investors buying single-family homes, the MBS plan shows that the administration is keenly aware that affordability is an issue for many Americans—and a potential political liability as the midterms approach.\n\nHousing has been a crucial focus for Trump all throughout his second term, but the president's zeal for making housing cheaper appears to have picked up as campaign season approaches, Allen noted.\n\n\"They're throwing a lot of darts at the board right now,\" Berner said, referring to the president's other initiatives, like introducing a 50-year mortgage and banning big investors from purchasing homes. \"I think they're just trying to pull out all the stops.\"",

    "title": "CEO Jensen Huang stepped in as criticism mounted over a key Nvidia product launch, internal emails show",
    "description": "Internal emails show Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang urging teams to to address DGX Spark backlash, highlighting its approach to responding to customers.",
    "fullText": "An internal Nvidia email chain revealed how senior executives at the chip giant — including founder and CEO Jensen Huang — mobilized in response to customer criticism of a key product launch late last year.\n\nThe thread offers a glimpse into how the company responds to public backlash as it expands products designed for individual developers and researchers.\n\nThe thread, which Business Insider has seen, centered on the launch of DGX Spark, a desktop AI system designed for developers and researchers to build AI products and work on apps for data science, medicine, and other fields.\n\nWhile much of Nvidia's business targets data center customers, Huang underscored Spark's significance in the thread, calling it the \"ultimate developer's platform — out of the box easy to run all NVIDIA.\"\n\nSpark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAnshel Sag, a Moor Insights & Strategy analyst who has tracked Nvidia launches for 15 years and was an early DGX Spark tester, said the company's long experience releasing graphics cards in the gaming industry — where products are routinely scrutinized — has made it adept at handling public feedback, with Huang typically keeping a close eye on new releases.\n\nIn recent years, the company has become even more reactive, Sag said, due to increased internal resources and \"sensitivity about the stock price and how negative sentiment can draw that down.\"\n\nIn the fall of last year, AstraZeneca executive director Justin Johnson wrote in a LinkedIn post that while the DGX Spark met performance and speed claims, the software experience was buggy and unstable.\n\nAfter an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.\n\n\"Jump on x and say you will fix,\" he wrote.\n\nSubsequently, an Nvidia engineer replied that the company had reached out to Johnson to resolve most of the issues, which were related to a version mismatch of CUDA, Nvidia's software that allows developers to build AI apps powered by its GPUs.\n\nJohnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.\n\nFollowing Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.\n\nStaffers tracked complaints and engaged directly with key critics who raised concerns about DGX Spark's performance, heating issues, and pricing.\n\nAnother incident involved the researcher Christopher Kouzios, who wrote on LinkedIn that he'd purchased DGX Spark to conduct medical research after his daughter died from a rare brain tumor, with the goal of studying cancer risk in his sons.\n\nKouzios said software incompatibility had rendered the system unusable and that he'd only received an automated acknowledgment 38 hours after filing a support ticket.\n\nAfter an Nvidia executive flagged the post, team members said they were fixing the bug, according to the emails. The executive later circulated an updated post in which Kouzios lauded Nvidia's customer support.\n\n\"While the situation initially frustrated me, Nvidia's response time was exceptional,\" Kouzios told Business Insider. \"In more than 33 years working with large technology companies, I have never seen an organization respond that quickly to public technical feedback.\"\n\nIt's often standard for hardware to ship without fully finished software, Sag said, adding that Nvidia tends to be more \"high-touch\" than other tech companies in fielding complaints — an approach that flows down from an exceptionally \"hands-on\" CEO.\n\nNvidia has previously faced some launch hiccups and early criticism for new products, such as its Blackwell rollout, which encountered manufacturing challenges.\n\nWhile a CEO's involvement is notable and Nvidia's backchannel efforts appeared to placate critics, such an approach isn't without risks, another analyst said.\n\n\"C-suite engagement during product controversies has become more common in tech, particularly for founder-led companies,\" said Kate Holterhoff, a senior industry analyst at RedMonk. \"It can signal authenticity and accountability, but it also carries reputational risk if the response is perceived as defensive or dismissive.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen will soon lose another longtime lieutenant.\n\nStuart Brown, the longtime head of trading for Viking Global, is stepping down from the $55 billion asset manager to take a career break, two people familiar with the move told Business Insider. The firm declined to comment, and Brown could not be reached for comment.\n\nBrown was at the long-running Tiger Cub, a nickname for hedge funds that spun out of late billionaire Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, for 18 years, according to his bio on the firm's website. He joined the firm after working on the corporate credit sales desk at Credit Suisse.\n\nOne of the people close to the firm said Brown's official departure date is not yet known. Brown will help the firm during a transition period, this person said.\n\nViking has lost several senior members of its team in recent years, which now numbers 275 employees, according to the firm's site.\n\nFrom the investing side, Ning Jin, the former chief investment officer of Viking, left the firm in August 2024 to start his own fund, Avantyr Capital.\n\nOn the operations side of the business, the firm's former general counsel, Andrew Genser, joined former Viking portfolio manager Divya Nettimi's fund, Avala Global, last summer. Viking's director of recruiting, Kevin Curtis, moved to Bobby Jain's eponymous fund in September 2025, and the firm's former investor relations head, Savina Boyadjieva, just started as a partner at Joshua Kushner's Thrive Capital.\n\nWhile Viking's peers include long-short equity funds such as Tiger Global, Coatue, Lone Pine, D1, Maverick, and others, the firm is not as tech-heavy as some of the other Tiger Cubs. In some years, such as 2022, this can help the manager, but when mega-stocks like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft drive a bulk of the market's returns, it can lead to Viking missing out on some gains.\n\nLast year was an example of this: Viking returned less than 9% on the year in its flagship fund, a person close to the manager said, less than the S&P 500 index.",

    "fullText": "Amazon is beefing up its physical retail game with a new big-box store concept that goes well beyond groceries.\n\nVillage officials in Orland Park, Illinois, voted on Tuesday to approve Amazon's plan to build a 228,000-square-foot mega store near Chicago. That's roughly the size of a newer, larger Walmart Supercenter.\n\nPlanning documents said the facility would offer both groceries and general merchandise, as well as other services and prepared food options. Customers would also be able to place and receive online orders on-site.\n\nKatie Jahnke Dale, an attorney for Amazon, told the planning commission that the plan is \"a more purpose-built and thoughtful\" approach to traditional big-box stores, according to the Orland Park Patch.\n\n\"This is a retail concept, a retail store, albeit with perhaps a larger storeroom in the back, which will allow us to enhance the customer experience,\" she said.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the store was one way the company is experimenting with making customers' lives easier.\n\n\"The site in question is our planned location for a new concept that we think customers will be excited about,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nIf all this sounds familiar, it's probably because hypermarkets like this one have been a staple of American retail since 1988, when Walmart opened its first Supercenter outside St. Louis. Walmart now has about 4,600 US stores.\n\nOf course, Amazon is no stranger to physical retail — at least in comparatively smaller formats.\n\nThe company operates 58 Amazon Fresh grocery stores, 14 Go convenience locations, and more than 500 Whole Foods Markets.\n\nAmazon said that more than 150 million US shoppers get groceries from the company, generating over $100 billion in sales in 2024.\n\nWhere those stores primarily focus on food, the new plan calls for a much broader range of merchandise, such as housewares or apparel, that can complement grocery shoppers' carts.\n\nAs traditional retailers like Walmart and Target ramp up their e-commerce efforts, Amazon is taking a few pages from the brick-and-mortar playbook as well.\n\nThis expansion comes a month after Business Insider reported that Amazon has been developing a \"rush\" pickup service, which would allow shoppers to collect their orders at Amazon-owned stores within an hour.\n\nThe company is also testing a fulfillment-only store concept that it expects to bring 30-minute delivery to customers in Seattle and Philadelphia.",

    "description": "The president uses digital media to get his message across — but he really loves old media like newspapers and cable TV.",
    "fullText": "Last fall, Donald Trump filed a $15 billion defamation suit against The New York Times. That suit is still ongoing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sat down with Times reporters at the White House for a 2-hour interview, where he expounded on his worldview, conducted an off-the-record conversation with the president of Colombia, and showed off new plans to renovate the West Wing.\n\nIf that surprises you, it shouldn't. Trump, and the rest of his administration, love to complain about the Times and other big, mainstream media outfits. They also love talking to them.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, key Trump advisor Stephen Miller appeared on CNN for a much-discussed interview with Jake Tapper, where he laid out a bellicose view of America's role in the world.\n\nA few days before that, Trump talked to The Wall Street Journal — another publication he's currently suing — for a story about his health and fitness.\n\nAnd last month Vanity Fair published a lengthy profile of Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, which involved multiple interviews with Wiles and portraits of her and other Trump officials, including Miller, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump has made mainstream media a target since he started running for president in 2015, calling reports he doesn't like \"fake news,\" and labeling journalists \"enemies of the people.\" He's called for a change in US libel law, so he can more easily punish journalists, and he often insists that TV networks that irk him should have their broadcast licenses revoked.\n\nAnd his rhetoric and actions have ramped up in his second term, where he has banned the Associated Press from events in the Oval Office, stocked the White House briefing room with Trump-friendly outlets, and pushed out all mainstream reporters from the Pentagon.\n\nAll of that should worry anyone who cares about press freedom — or in less lofty terms, the ability of the press to accurately tell you what's happening in the federal government.\n\nThe flip of that is quite simple: Trump is a man who grew up in a world dominated by traditional media — newspapers and television — and he still cares very much about what traditional media says about him, no matter what he says. That's why he delights in constant press appearances in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and anywhere else reporters have cameras, microphones, and notepads.\n\nI often think of an AP photo from last spring, shortly after he'd announced his initial, chaotic tariff plan, that shows him perusing the New York Post's coverage of that plan in the back of his limousine. We focus a lot of attention on Trump's ability to use Twitter, YouTube, podcasts, and other digital media to shape public perception. But he's very much an old media guy — print, broadcast, cable.\n\nAnd as long as those things still exist, Trump will want to be in them and flattered by their coverage. Which explains why he can sue them and invite them into his office at the same time.",

Discovery, have asked their staff to return to in-person work.\n\nNBCUniversal instructed thousands of employees to return to its offices starting on January 5, although it's only requiring four days a week of in-person work. As with Paramount, staffers who didn't want to return to the office were offered severance packages.\n\nRead Ellison's full memo to employees here:\n\nAs we wrap up our first week back together in our LA and NY offices, I want to thank each of you for your dedication, professionalism, and teamwork. I know that returning to the office full-time has been an adjustment for many, and I truly appreciate the flexibility and commitment you've shown. The positive energy and increased productivity that come from being together in-person are already evident, and it's great to see.\n\nA special thank you to our RTO Task Force and all the teams involved for their hard work behind the scenes to prepare for our return and to ensure the transition was smooth and welcoming for everyone.\n\nIt's hard to believe we launched the new Paramount just five months ago, and in that short time we haven't just set a strategy — we've acted on it. In the process, we've made real and meaningful progress against our North Star priorities. From day one, our goal has been clear: to transform Paramount for the future by championing great storytellers, investing in world-class technology, and making bold, thoughtful moves that position us to help define the next era of entertainment. That's exactly what we've been doing — and it's what we'll continue to do together.\n\nWhile the coming year will bring its share of challenges, it will also be exciting. We've set ambitious goals, and we're confident we have the strategy, the momentum, and — most importantly — the team to achieve them. Your expertise, resilience, and commitment give me tremendous confidence in what we can accomplish. I am grateful for your efforts and incredibly proud to work alongside you.\n\nThanks again for a great first week back together. Let's go!",

    "description": "Robotaxi reporter Lloyd Lee breaks down what he saw — and heard — on the ground at the world's largest consumer tech show, CES, in Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The race to dominate the robotaxi space may not be as close as some companies suggest.\n\nLloyd Lee, Business Insider's reporter covering robotaxis and emerging mobility tech, went to CES for the first time to check out the autonomous service from Zoox, Vay, and other providers. Lee, who has taken a few rides with robotaxis recently entering the market, said the experience sharpened his view that one company appears to be significantly ahead — and that the industry still faces major hurdles before the vehicles can truly go mainstream.\n\nIn the Q&A below with BI News Chief Steve Russolillo, Lee breaks down his biggest takeaways from CES, the most impressive tech he saw, and how the experience will shape his coverage in the year ahead.\n\nSteve Russolillo: Lloyd, this is your first time at CES. What are your impressions and biggest takeaways from the event?\n\nLloyd Lee: First, CES is a massive event. It is humanly impossible to stop by every booth no matter how militant you are with your time. Second, I was struck by how much space the convention was dedicated to automobility. I agree with what Paul Costa, a 25-year Apple veteran who worked on the company's self-driving car project and is now at Ford, told me: CES has become a car show as much as it remains a tech show.\n\nRussolillo: What's the craziest and wildest piece of new technology that you saw?\n\nLee: Hyundai Motor Group's booth had a really impressive display of how far it's trying to take autonomy — from EV charging stations and robotaxis to robotic arms and humanoid robots. Boston Dynamics, a Hyundai unit, demoed its Atlas humanoid robot at the booth. Just the way it activates and stands up is terrifying and awe-striking at the same time.\n\nRussolillo: You cover robotaxis for BI and had the opportunity to test drive two different robotaxis this week. What stood out to you the most?\n\nLee: I tried two robotaxi services for the first time, including Amazon's Zoox. There are obviously a lot of smart people working on this technology. But I have to say: Trying those services only made me realize 1.) how far ahead Waymo is or at least appears to be, and 2.) just how difficult it is to make a profitable business case for robotaxis right now.\n\nGetting autonomous driving right is only part of the challenge. There's also the operations side — like fleet scaling and management — that Waymo has had to build up to help make robotaxis feel like a real autonomous ride-hailing service you can use in your day-to-day. (That is if you live in the city Waymo operates.) And even then, we know Waymo is burning money on its service.\n\nRussolillo: What are some of the predictions you've heard from sources about tech, AI and business?\n\nLee: Chris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte with expertise in software-defined vehicles, had a few interesting points.\n\nRussolillo: What startup you never heard before really stole the show and impressed you?\n\nLee: Perhaps less stole the show, but I thought Vay, a German startup developing a driverless car rental service, reminded me that there's still room for some contrarian voices in the driverless space. Remote driving is the big bogeyman for robotaxi companies. You don't want to be caught using it. This startup's entire business model is built around it. Vay is using remote driving — with a potential to pursue autonomy in the future — for a small fraction of the overall driving experience: Getting the car delivered to a renter without a human inside. It was a \"Huh, I never thought about that\" moment.\n\nRussolillo: What did you learn that might change how you go about your tech coverage for BI?\n\nLee: Broadly, emerging technologies like humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and, more generally, AI, contain a lot of unknowns and uncertainties. And company leaders in those spaces can be evasive when you ask for specifics, or they simply don't know the answer. Possibly both. My instinct is to resolve that ambiguity, which in this space, will not always be realistic. Instead, I should write to the uncertainty, not through it. Name the ambiguity, build the story around it.",

    "description": "Sean Combs sold his private jet after raking in income by chartering it out, even while he was behind bars.",
    "fullText": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' luxe private jet is off the market after reportedly raking in millions through charters while the disgraced music mogul sits in prison.\n\nSilver Air Private Jets, a private aviation company that previously managed charters for the plane, confirmed to Business Insider in January that Combs sold the Gulfstream G550 in October 2025.\n\nIt's unclear what the plane sold for. Online listings show pre-owned G550s built that year typically sell for between $20 million and $30 million, depending on factors such as total hours and maintenance status.\n\nRegistration data shows the matte-black jet now bears the new tail number T7-OKS. The T7 prefix means the plane is registered in San Marino, a landlocked microstate surrounded by Italy known for its banking sector and tax perks for the wealthy.\n\nFederal records show the jet was previously registered as N1969C and owned by the Combs-owned entity LoveAir LLC. That tail number has been reserved by the same company since November 3, 2025.\n\nCombs' attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nThe ex-Diddy G550 was built in 2015 and features a black exterior and beige interiors. It can hold 14 passengers, is pet-friendly, and features an entertainment system, according to now-deleted charter listings.\n\nIn the months after Combs' September 2024 arrest and indictment on federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, the jet took dozens of flights to places like French Polynesia, New Zealand, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Baja, Mexico, according to JetSpy data.\n\nChartering the jet was likely a temporary money-maker for Combs.\n\nWhile the specific jet is not mentioned by name in any of the suits against Combs, several lawsuits accuse him of flying his alleged sexual abuse victims on private or commercial planes or of procuring illicit drugs via plane. Combs has repeatedly denied committing sexual assault.\n\nSince the slew of lawsuits began in 2023, Combs' business empire — which once included a lucrative deal with Diageo, a catalog of music hits, and a successful clothing line — has crumbled.\n\nCombs' trial ended in July 2025. The jury cleared him of the more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, but convicted him on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He was sentenced to 50 months in prison, plus a $500,000 fine.\n\nHe maintains ownership of a pair of mansions on Miami's Star Island, as well as valuable jewelry and art collections.\n\nCombs also owns a mansion in Los Angeles that was listed for sale for $61.5 million in September 2024, weeks before his arrest. He reportedly delisted the home in December 2025 after it struggled to sell amid its history.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in November 2024 but has been updated with the status of Combs' private jet.",

    "description": "Countries worldwide have eyes on Greenland for its natural resources, but the island only has one fully operational mine. We visited to find out why.",
    "fullText": "Greenland has no shortage of valuable minerals. What it lacks is almost everything else needed to extract them.\n\nGreenland is one of the most logistically hostile environments on the planet — a place with no roads between towns, limited labor, and weather that can shut down operations without warning.\n\nStill, world leaders and investors across the globe have their eyes on the island for its natural resources, including copper, zinc, graphite, gold, and rare earth elements that can be used in everything from construction and manufacturing to electronics and defense systems.\n\nAs the US, Europe, and other countries look to diversify supply chains away from China, Greenland has drawn renewed attention as a potential alternative. President Donald Trump's latest remarks that the US should annex Greenland for national security reasons — triggering an outcry from its citizens — have also drawn attention to the island and its strategic value.\n\nThere is only one fully operational mine in Greenland. Business Insider's Sarah Andersen visited the mine in June to see why it remains open while others have shut down — and why the island's vast mineral wealth hasn't translated into a mining boom.\n\nYou always have to plan several steps ahead when operating in Greenland, said Bent Olsvig Jensen, managing director of Lumina Sustainable Materials.\n\n\"We have to think of everything because we cannot just pick up the phone and expect spare parts to be available the next morning,\" he said in June.\n\nLumina Sustainable Materials — a private science and mining company group with operations in Greenland, the US, Mexico, and the European Union — operates the island's only fully active mine, located deep inside a fjord system with no road access.\n\nThe mine produces an industrial mineral called anorthosite, used in fiberglass, construction materials, and other industrial applications.\n\nAside from what they've built, which includes a camp, a plant, a warehouse, a harbor, and a small gym and clinic, there is no other infrastructure supporting the site. Everything, including the crew, arrives by ship during the ice-free months or by helicopter when the fjord freezes over for months on end, Jensen said. (Andersen arrived via an eight-hour boat trip from the capital, Nuuk.)\n\nWhen something breaks, there is no overnight delivery.\n\n\"Sometimes you can wait for spare parts for a week or two,\" Dennis Jensen (no relation to Bent Jensen) said during Andersen's visit to the mine. Jensen is the mine's site manager who oversees operations through the long, dark winters, where temperatures can dip to -22°F. When that happens, \"we are not working outside,\" he said.\n\nWinter storms can ground helicopters for days, delaying crew changes and keeping workers on-site longer than planned, Dennis Jensen added.\n\nOn average, \"it takes 16 years to develop a mine, right from the first idea to the actual mine,\" Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister responsible for natural resources, including minerals, said in June.\n\nFor most of that time, \"you spend money, you don't make a lot of money,\" she said.\n\nIt took Lumina 11 years, for example, to get from exploration to production. Exploration started in 2008 and reached final production in 2019, Bent said.\n\nGreenland has over 100 mineral licenses, spanning early exploration to advanced stages. Many projects stall long before reaching operation, often because they cannot secure long-term financing, Nathanielsen said.\n\nPeople mistakenly think they can begin to extract the minerals on day one, but they can't, Majken Djurhuus Poulsen, a geologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told Andersen during her visit.\n\nParts of Greenland host some of the oldest bedrock on the planet, billions of years old, Poulsen said. That history has created many different types of mineral deposits, but the conditions make exploration slow.\n\n\"You can only do exploration for three to four months a year,\" when areas are ice-free enough, she added.\n\nOn top of that, Poulsen said sites can be difficult to get to, often requiring helicopters that push costs higher. There's rarely any infrastructure, so you have to build everything from scratch — from the mine to where workers will live. After all that, identifying a promising deposit can take years, sometimes decades, she added.\n\nAs a result, mining requires investors who are willing to wait years without returns and have a high tolerance for risk. Nathanielsen said Greenland lacks the domestic capital to fund that process and depends heavily on foreign investment.\n\n\"It is quite sobering in terms of trying to keep your providers of capital,\" James Kiernan, honorary chairman of Cordiant Capital, a Canadian multinational investment management firm and one of Lumina's major backing investors, told Andersen in July.\n\nKiernan pointed to multiple examples of mines affected as market realities shifted.\n\n\"There was a mine called Ruby that was open, and they were trying to find rubies. They were open and closed and open and closed,\" he said, referring to the Greenland Ruby mine and describing the stop-start pattern that has defined many efforts on the island.\n\nAt the same time, the government has kept strict environmental and social standards.\n\nBefore any project moves forward, Nathanielsen said companies must answer two questions: Will it create jobs for Greenlanders, and how will it protect the environment?\n\n\"If the project owners cannot answer those two questions on a satisfactory level, if they cannot provide the people with a good answer, they will meet opposition,\" she said.\n\nLumina's success in navigating that process is in part due to its long planning horizons, close coordination with the government, and a business model designed around Greenland's constraints.\n\nStill, the mine has yet to turn a profit, Kiernan told Andersen during a follow-up call on Friday.\n\nBut Bent Jensen and Kiernan said that after years of operating in Greenland's challenging conditions, the company is well-positioned to apply that know-how to other mining projects, and Lumina has recently secured an exploration license to search for rare earth minerals.\n\nMore mines could unlock a new future for Greenlanders, helping pave a path toward greater autonomy as the island seeks to develop new revenue streams to eventually become financially independent from Denmark.\n\nHowever, a mining boom isn't likely at any point soon, Bent Jensen said.\n\n\"I see Greenland developing slowly because it needs to develop organically with the population, with the politicians,\" he said. \"It will be one mine at a time.\"",

    "description": "Barry Pollack represented Nicolás Maduro in court on Monday. Another attorney, Bruce Fein, says he's also the Venezuelan politician's lawyer.",
    "fullText": "When Nicolás Maduro showed up in Manhattan federal court Monday morning — having been hauled by the federal government 2,000 miles from Caracas — he was represented by attorney Barry Pollack.\n\nPollack, best known for representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange, with vast experience in both criminal and international law, told the judge in Maduro's initial appearance that he'd be raising motions objecting to the legality of how United States forces captured the now former Venezuelan president.\n\nOn Tuesday, Maduro appeared to add another experienced legal hand to his team: Bruce Fein, a former high-ranking Justice Department official during the Reagan administration, and an expert on civil liberties and international law.\n\nThe addition of Fein quickly caused a ruckus that's been playing out on the court docket.\n\nOn Thursday night — after US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who is overseeing the case, approved Fein's motion to represent Maduro — Pollack wrote that Maduro had never even spoken to Fein. He asked Hellerstein to remove Fein from the case.\n\n\"I confirmed with Mr. Maduro that he does not know Mr. Fein and has not communicated with Mr. Fein, much less retained him, authorized him to enter an appearance, or otherwise hold himself out as representing Mr. Maduro,\" Pollack wrote in a court document.\n\nPollack said he had made several attempts to contact Fein to clear up the issue, but never heard back.\n\nIn a response on the court docket Friday afternoon, Fein said that he believes he's rightfully Maduro's lawyer.\n\nHe asked the judge to personally interview Maduro in his courthouse chambers in lower Manhattan and determine who the jailed Venezuelan leader wants on his legal team.\n\nFein said he hasn't had any \"telephone, video, or other direct contact with President Maduro.\"\n\nBut, Fein said, people who were \"credibly situated within President Maduro's inner circle or family\" had indicated that Maduro wanted Fein to represent him.\n\nThe confusion, Fein wrote, may be because Maduro was apprehended \"under extraordinary, startling, and viperlike circumstances\" and was subject to \"a foreign criminal process in a foreign tongue, fraught with the potential for misunderstandings or miscommunications.\"\n\nFein wrote that he doesn't dispute that Pollack \"believes\" Maduro didn't hire him, and that the circumstances require Hellerstein to step in personally.\n\nFein did not address in his document whether he had spoken to Pollack since Thursday night. Neither Pollack nor Fein responded to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nFederal prosecutors — who have accused Maduro of narco-terrorism, cocaine trafficking conspiracy, and machine gun-related crimes — took no position in the power struggle between Pollack and Fein, Pollack wrote in a court filing.\n\nA third Maduro lawyer, David Wikstrom, made it clear to Hellerstein that he would not be working with Maduro going forward.\n\nWikstrom was automatically appointed to be Maduro's public defender after his arrest and capture. He asked Hellerstein this week to appoint him as Maduro's lawyer — but only so that he could collect legal fees for the several hours of work he performed Monday morning to prepare for Maduro's arraignment before Pollack formally joined the case.",

Nintendo in particular has a lot to celebrate this year, with big anniversaries for The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Kid Icarus, and Animal Crossing coming in addition to the games I mentioned previously. That said, both Sony and Xbox have reason to celebrate as well, as Tomb Raider turns 30 and Halo--and Xbox as a brand overall--hit 25.\n\nBut perhaps the most exciting thing to consider in light of all these anniversaries are the announcements that could be lingering just around the corner. Though we've already received confirmation that a remake of the original Tomb Raider is in the works, and other series such as Donkey Kong, Pokemon, and Resident Evil all have new or upcoming entries, there are a few games on this list that have been dormant for some time. Could 2026 be the year we get a new Kid Icarus or Castlevania? No clue, but a girl can hope, right?\n\nSo without further ado, is a round up of all the series with milestone anniversaries in 2026:",

And we'll make it just a smidge easier by handling the thinking part for you--which is to say that we'll explain each quest in detail below.\n\nAll of these quests must be completed in Battle Royale or Zero Build, and they provide pass progress only. The quests themselves don't offer XP directly, but there are three level skips you can unlock as you progress the event pass, and you can already earn one of them (worth 80,000 XP) by completing five quests. Completing four quests from a batch will award a Memberberry--collecting six Memberberries awards the Imaginationland Airship glider.",

Sorry, everybody who got their hopes up (like we did) that a secret Ice King remix was coming.\n\nThe Season 7 OG pass includes three remixes of skins from the Chapter 1 Season 7 battle pass--Voidwalker Lynx is unlocked instantly with a purchase of the pass, and you can earn Lt. Winter and Wonder Onesie by leveling up. Wonder Onesie has the most customization options of any OG pass skin thus far, as you can decorate her with any of the sprays or emoticons you have in your locker.\n\nNotably missing are the Ice King, who was Season 7's hero, and the Prisoner, who served as the season baddie. Midway through the original Season 7, the Ice King projected a gigantic magical phantom of himself standing over the island, and then unleashed a blizzard that coated the island in snow for several weeks. Presuming Fortnite OG will do that event again the way it has all the other Chapter 1 live events, it would make a lot of sense for a new Ice King skin to be on one of those hidden pages.\n\nEach of the three skins available in the Season 7 OG pass comes with a back bling, a pickaxe, a weapon wrap, a glider, and an emote. The pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and access to the pass is included while players are subscribed to Fortnite Crew, which costs $12 per month.

    "description": "I joined a mom group hoping for community, but judgment over my parenting, work, and family size pushed me to leave.",
    "fullText": "I should have sensed the judgment the minute I arrived at the first playdate with four kids in tow and another on the way. Instead, I was thrilled to finally find my \"village\" that I'd heard so much about — a group of moms who met a few times a month at nearby play spaces and coffee shops to commiserate and encourage each other.\n\nI even brushed off the first comment I was met with, which, in hindsight, should have been a warning sign. \"Wow, are they all yours?\" It wasn't the first or last time someone had a \"witty\" one-liner about my family size, which was completely on purpose and by choice, if they must know. My kids jumped into the playground with the others, and I settled in to find my new besties.\n\nThe thing about mom groups, though, is that they often aren't obviously terrible. In fact, they check all the boxes — moms at similar ages, stages, and struggles, getting together for camaraderie and community. We all had similar jogger set mom uniforms and extra-strong lattes on hand, hidden in the pockets of diaper bags to make it past \"no food or drink\" signs at indoor parks (no? Just me?).\n\nBut they aren't always necessarily a good fit. All the feelings from this almost-perfect mom group I was once a part of resurfaced when Ashley Tisdale wrote an essay in The Cut, talking openly about how her mom group turned toxic.\n\nMy first feelings that I was \"different\" came when two of the younger kids had a small collision at the bottom of a slide. They tripped, fussed a bit, and in my parenting world, were ready to get back up and carry on. I'm used to being around people with widely differing parenting styles, but not used to being judged for mine.\n\nI felt like my free-range parenting was judged by other moms who were more helicopter parents. The mom of the other kid who collided picked the child up, brushed them up, and performed a full check-up. Meanwhile, my own child popped up, whined a little, and ran off.\n\nBand-Aids and tissues were coming out to counteract tears, and a full-scale breakdown of the situation, complete with apologies and moment-by-moment recaps, had commenced. I enjoyed my coffee and didn't give it much thought. I hadn't noticed yet that my parenting style was a mismatch. To be clear, this is just my perception.\n\nSlowly but surely, questions about my family size began to infiltrate conversations. I was used to one-liners from grannies at the grocery about having my hands full, but it felt like an onslaught.\n\nIt was the same thing with my career. After the group learned I was a working mom, running my own business full-time, I started to feel like an outsider. People spoke a lot about the negative sides of daycare, and the perks of being able to be a full-time mom, Their comments made it seem they weren't interested in a different perspective, nor was there a question about why I work (because I want to) or about the immense benefits my kids have gotten through day care. I felt like there was an assumption that I was stuck in this terrible world of working motherhood against my will, with no way out.\n\nOver time, I felt like the circus spectacle, and felt I had to have all the i's dotted and t's crossed on parenting topics, to show the naysayers that I was doing just fine with many kids, rather than finding a soft landing place to vent and share.\n\nI was lonely and desperate, so I clung to my mom group. The alternative was too scary. Nobody to hang out with on a boring Saturday or text when things get tough. It's not just me — two-thirds of parents find the role isolating and lonely. But one day, I realized the abyss was better than the alternative.\n\nThis was the day they moved all the get-togethers to 10 a.m. on weekdays. They knew exactly where I'd be at 10 a.m. every weekday — working.\n\nAlthough I haven't found a similar style group, I realized that instead of looking for a whole village of besties, my village was already around me. It just didn't look like 10 moms with lattes at play group. Instead, it involves the trainer who asks if my kid is over his third bout of strep, or my mom's friend who texts me with some press-on nails she likes that would look good on me.\n\nMy real friends don't demand we have precisely only 1.5 children, helicopter around our babies, or only wear pink on Wednesdays.",

    "description": "Delete or disable apps you don't need.",
    "fullText": "Any new phone almost certainly comes with a handful of preinstalled apps you'll never use, regardless of which manufacturer you buy from or which operating system you're on. Some devices are more bloated than others: Google Pixels have a relatively \"clean\" build compared to Samsung phones, for example, and don't typically come with third-party apps and games.\n\nBut you may still want to eliminate apps and features that clutter your home screen, take up valuable space, and create a drag on performance, especially if you have alternatives you like more. On Android, that likely means uninstalling what you easily can and disabling everything else.\n\nUnfortunately, many preinstalled first-party apps can't be easily removed. This varies by manufacturer and device—for example, Pixel users can uninstall Google Play Games and Books but are stuck with Chrome, Drive, Maps, and Calculator. As HowToGeek points out, you can delete other pre-selected Google apps added during initial setup, such as the Pixel Watch app and NotebookLM.\n\nOn Samsung Galaxy phones, again, some preinstalled bloatware is locked in, but ZDNET calls out five native apps that most users should delete right away: Global Goals, Samsung Free, Samsung TV Plus, Samsung Shop, and Samsung Kids.\n\nTo uninstall an app on your Pixel, go to the Google Play Store and tap the Profile icon. Tap Manage apps & devices > Manage, select the app you want to remove, and tap Uninstall. On Samsung, go to Settings > Apps, tap the app name, and tap Uninstall > OK. You can also touch and hold the app icon on your home screen and tap or drag to uninstall.\n\nIf you're absolutely set on removing preinstalled apps that can't be deleted using the above steps, you can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), but these methods are more advanced.\n\nBuilt-in apps that aren't in use can be disabled, which hides the icon from your app drawer. They'll still take up space, but at least they'll be out of sight. Most preinstalled apps can be disabled if you don't need them, with the exception of critical system apps.\n\nOn your Pixel, go to Settings > Apps > See all apps to select individual apps, and tap Disable at the top of the screen. You can hide preinstalled Samsung apps from your home screen settings: tap Hide apps and tap the icon of the apps you want to disable, the press Done.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Kindle User Should Know",
    "description": "Get the most out of your Kindle.",
    "fullText": "The Kindle has become the default e-reader for many bookworms, and I get it. I've used Kindles for well over a decade, and I've enjoyed using my latest Paperwhite quite a bit. It helped me read more than 30 books last year, so I'm not complaining.\n\nThe basic Kindle setup is okay, but if you learn your way around the device's gestures, hidden features, and additional services, you can really get a lot out of this unassuming reading device.\n\nThere’s only one button on the Kindle. Everything else happens using touch. And like every touchscreen device, there are countless gestures you need to know to use the device. The most obvious ones are for the page turns. You can swipe or tap right to go to the next page and swipe or tap left for the previous one. If you have a Paperwhite Signature Edition, you can also double tap on the back or sides of the device to move to the next page.\n\nTap on the top of the Kindle to bring up the toolbar, where you can go back to the Home screen, change the settings, view the table of contents, and more.\n\nIf you tap the bottom left corner, you can cycle between different stats like reading progress, page number, time left in chapter, and more. Oh, and if you want to quickly change the font size, just pinch in or out to zoom in on the text (like you would zoom into images on your phone).\n\nWant to take a screenshot of what’s on your Kindle screen? Tap any two opposite corners of the screen together (top-right and bottom-left or top-left and bottom-right). The screen will flash for a second, and the image will be saved as a PNG in the root directory. Connect your Kindle to your Mac or PC to retrieve the image file.\n\nThe Kindle isn’t the easiest device to navigate, especially when you’re reading a book where you need to jump between different chapters. Here, again, a hidden gesture can help. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up a new Page Flip mode. You’ll see a slider at the bottom, which you can use to move forward and back. There are buttons to jump to the next chapter as well (I use this all the time).\n\nIf you love reading in bed, you’ll want to enable dark mode. Pull down from the top edge to bring up the quick settings panel. Here, tap the Dark Mode button to quickly invert the colors. You’ll now read white text on a black background. While you’re here, also check out the Warm Light settings (if you have a Kindle Paperwhite, Oasis, or Scribe). Use the slider to increase the warmth of the screen, making it more amber-toned.\n\nThis is especially useful for reading in the evenings or at night, but I like it so much I keep it enabled at all times. You can also set your color temperature to change on a schedule, so that the display slowly warms up in the evening hours. Do this under Settings > Device Options > Display Settings > Schedule.\n\nNot everyone needs to know what’s on your Kindle, right? If you read a lot in school, or public areas, you can lock down your Kindle using an optional setting. Go to Settings > Device Options > Security and Privacy > Device PIN. You can then set a numeric unlock code up to 12 digits long, but it might be easier to stick to a four or six-digit code.\n\nReading on your Kindle doesn’t need to be limited to books you buy from the Kindle store. In fact, you can send any PDF or DRM-free ebook to your Kindle, and wirelessly. I have previously outlined multiple methods for doing this, ranging from using an email address, to using the Kindle app. But the one I keep coming back to is Amazon’s own Send to Kindle website. Open it on any browser, sign in with your account, drag and drop a document in a supported format (.DOC, .DOCX, .HTML, .TXT, .PDF and .EPUB), and send it off. Once you sync your Kindle using Wi-Fi, these documents will be available to read on it, just like that.\n\nEvery time I set up a new Kindle, I’m surprised that this is a feature that I still need to enable manually. By default, Kindles shows a couple of images as screensavers when turned off. That's because of the e-ink display, which lets them show a static image without using power. These default screensavers, though, are boring. You can make this feature much more interesting (and useful) by showing the cover of the book you were last reading as the screensaver instead. Go to Settings > Device Options and enable the Display Cover feature.\n\nKindle’s built-in browser is pretty barebones and laggy, but you can still read long articles on it. For a smoother experience, though, you can wirelessly send articles to your Kindle, where they’ll show up in form of books, devoid of ads, formatting, and images.\n\nThe simplest way to do this is by using Amazon’s Send to Kindle Chrome extension. Visit a page, trigger the extension, and send it off to your e-reader.\n\nIf you don’t use Chrome, you can also use a dedicated service like Push to Kindle to send articles to your Kindle. You can send up to 10 articles a month for free, and a $2.99/month plan unlocks all limits.\n\nIf you’re using your Kindle to research or read non-fiction books for school or work, you’ll end up with a lot of highlights. Those highlights, just sitting in your Kindle, aren’t that useful. Amazon has a dedicated website that lists all the highlights from all the books you’ve purchased via the Kindle Store, but it's not your only option.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Clippings, which also works for content not bought from the Kindle Store. With it, you can import all the highlights and notes from your Kindle books and personal documents using a browser extension. You can view and organize all your notes from your browser, too, but if you want to export them to a document, you’ll need to pay for a $1.99/month Professional plan.\n\nThere are many places where you can rent and borrow books to read legally and for free. The most popular option is using the Libby app from Overdrive, which loans you books via your library card or student ID. In the Libby app, go to Shelf > Loans > Read With... > Kindle. Here, sign in with your Amazon account and verify your Kindle device. Then, tap Get Library Book. Voila, an ebook from your local library will instantly show up on your Kindle device.\n\nLastly, you can take inspiration from my colleague Pranay, who uses his Kindle without any Amazon services. You can set up a Kindle without an Amazon account and use it as a perfectly good e-reader. You can buy DRM-free books online from various sources and transfer them to your Kindle simply by transferring the ebook files to your Kindle storage or using the Send to Kindle feature I talked about above.",

Whatever platform you watch them on, these brief clips pull you in and don't let go, and, before you know it, you've mindlessly scrolled through hours of videos, most of which you'll never remember watching.\n\nYouTube Shorts are no exception. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, short-form content is not the main source of videos on the platform. YouTube, of course, hosts long-form videos first and foremost, and is the sole reason why many of us visit the site or app. Shorts are just an afterthought, but an afterthought that YouTube pushes hard. You might hop on to watch a specific video, or check out new content from your subscriptions, but to do so, you'll have to push past rows of \"Shorts\" all vying for your attention. God help your afternoon if you accidentally click on one.\n\nIf you like YouTube Shorts, please disregard. But for the rest of us that just want to find and watch standard videos on YouTube, there's now some respite: As part of a larger update to search filters and content discovery, YouTube is now allowing users to filter out Shorts in searches. The company is pitching this as a way to separate searches between either Shorts or traditional videos, but you'll never catch me searching specifically for Shorts. What YouTube has done here, at least for users like myself, is to create a way to exclude Shorts from any particular search.\n\nTo start, open YouTube and search for something. You should now see a series of options along the top of the display, one of which is \"Videos.\" Choose it, and you'll reload the search with only long-form videos. Huzzah. You can also do the same from the greater search filters settings: On desktop, when the results appear, select \"Filters\" in the top right then look for \"Type\" on the left of the \"Search filters\" pop-up window. On mobile, tap the three dots icon, then choose \"Search filters.\" On both platforms, you'll find the \"Videos\" option here.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't something you can set and forget: You'll need to choose this option every time you search for something, which is definitely a bummer. That said, at least there's some way to filter Shorts out of a search—especially if those Shorts were impacting your ability to find what you were looking for in the first place.\n\nYouTube might not ever let us disable Shorts completely, but there are tools to get around them. You can choose to limit how many Shorts you watch in any given day—though the guardrails aren't necessarily strict. The company also lets you tell them to show you fewer Shorts on the home page, but if that's not enough, you can also install an extension to block Shorts from your feeds.\n\nIn addition to this new Shorts filter, YouTube made some adjustments to filters and sorting options. \"Sort By\" is now known as \"Prioritize,\" and while YouTube doesn't say whether it changed the function, it does say the menu \"aims to maximize utility.\" The company also changed the \"View count\" sort option to \"Popularity.\" The menu still takes view count into consideration, but also watch time, to sort videos in a search by the algorithms' assumed popularity.\n\nFinally, YouTube is removing the \"Upload Date - Last Hour\" and \"Sort by Rating\" options from search. The company says you can still find videos uploaded most recently from the \"Upload Date\" filters.",

    "title": "The Biggest Fitness Trends at CES 2026 (and What I Think About Them)",
    "description": "Exoskeletons, rings, and smart bands were popular, but a lot of big name companies seem to be running out of ideas.",
    "fullText": "I just got back from CES 2026, and you can see my real-time reports on some of the best and weirdest things I saw in our CES 2026 live blog. I tried on six(!) different exoskeletons, perked up my ears whenever I heard about a new smart strap, and looked in vain for new models of familiar fitness tech like watches. Here are the biggest trends I noticed and some notes on what was conspicuously missing. I've included prices where possible; anything without a price is likely too far from market to have one yet.\n\nThis is a continuation of a trend that really got going in 2025. Whoop is no longer the only player in the screenless fitness strap space. Last year we saw straps from Amazfit ($99) and Polar ($199), plus a sleep band from Garmin ($169). At CES I learned about two more.\n\nThe Luna Band is likely to be the next one to market—the company’s reps said to expect it to ship sometime in the next month or two. (I plan to review it once units are available.) It will be $149, won't require a subscription, and it will use the same app as the Luna Ring, which I’m currently reviewing. Its maker, Noise, is new to the U.S. wearables market but is one of the leading smartwatch makers in India.\n\nBesides the new hardware, Noise also announced that the Luna app will soon have a system to take voice notes to give context to your health data. (This is coming to the app in the next few weeks.) For example, if you tell the app that you had a few glasses of wine, it will remember this when it sees your poor sleep the next morning, and it will adjust its recommendations accordingly—say, reminding you to hydrate, rather than telling you to take a nap.\n\nSpeediance also announced the Speediance Strap, although it doesn’t seem to be as close to market. No price has been announced, and the units at the show were clearly prototypes. The Strap will collect sleep and recovery data, without requiring a subscription to view it, although some more advanced metrics will require a premium subscription.\n\nOura has had competitors for years (and has taken up suing them to stop sales), but it seems like the number of smart rings out there is just exploding—though not all of them are fitness or health oriented. Besides Pebble’s Index 01 ($75), which is charmingly simple, there are plenty of rings that pack in more functions—NFC payments, AI voice processing, haptic alerts, and more. There are so many I can’t give a full list, but to name a few: there’s the Muse Ring One ($323), the Dreame Ring, and the Vocci AI ring.\n\nRingConn announced its third-generation ring, with blood pressure insights (I’m skeptical) and haptic alerts, including the ability to buzz for a smart alarm (I’m intrigued). This one isn’t on the market yet, and a rep at the booth asked me what price I thought it should go for. In the meantime, RingConn gave me a gen 2 ring to compare to Oura and others—watch for my review soon.\n\nThe companies that make smartwatches and fitness watches tend to be on their own release cycles, not necessarily tied to CES. Apple certainly wasn’t going to announce a new Apple Watch; Google and Fitbit didn’t show up, either. Amazfit had a new watch, the Active Max ($169) in its lineup, but it was more of a refinement to the product line than a new exciting announcement.\n\nThe only real exception I can think of is Pebble, but you’ve heard from me already on why it bucks the trend. I got to go hands-on with the Time 2 (announced last year) and the Round 2 (announced last week), which was so thin and sleek it made the Coros on my wrist feel like a big ol’ hunk of plastic. As a reminder, the Round 2 doesn’t have a heart rate monitor and Pebble is trying not to be a fitness watch brand. (I’m still looking forward to reviewing its watches anyway.)\n\nI think the main reason for the stagnation here is that watches already have everything they need to have for fitness and health tracking. There's not a lot of room left to innovate; either you give a device slightly better battery life (nice, but yawn) or you stick something else into it just to say you did—like a flashlight or a microphone. That's nothing against flashlights or microphones, which are both great in context, but we're hardly in game-changing territory anymore. Companies like Oura and Whoop are pivoting to services like blood tests that take the focus off their hardware. My colleague Stephen Johnson said it best: tech launches don't feel magical anymore, partly because we don't have many problems left that consumer tech can easily solve, and partly because every new advice adds a hassle to your life.\n\nAnd so Garmin’s main announcement this weekend was a nutrition tracking feature in its Connect+ subscription. I thought at least there was a good chance of a new watch from Garmin—nope. Garmin announced the Instinct 3 at last year’s CES, but no new hardware this year besides a camera system for truckers (I’m happy for them).\n\nA few other companies used the buzz around CES to announce non-hardware developments as well: Oura is finally shipping the charging case it promised last fall, and Ultrahuman announced a limited-time free tier of its blood testing service with 20+ markers. Its other tiers give you 50+ markers for $99, or a 100+ marker test followed by a 60+ marker follow-up test for $365. (Ultrahuman told me that the exact blood tests it's able to offer vary slightly by state, hence the vague numbers.)\n\nThere were, of course, plenty of mentions that “AI” is baked into this or that fitness app. But the companies mostly seemed to understand that while AI might help to create features their users want, users don’t buy devices for the AI. (See also: Dell executives commenting that its customers don’t seem to want AI, and that it has adjusted the marketing for its computers to de-emphasize it.)\n\nI heard at CES that apps are using AI to identify foods from photos (Garmin and Amazfit) or that AI is helping to find patterns in data (basically everybody). Merach did say it would let me try an AI-powered treadmill, but a rep apologetically told me the device wasn’t available in time to ship the prototype to CES.\n\nExoskeletons were the biggest new-to-me trend at CES. These are devices that you strap on to your body, and their motors give an added boost to what your muscles are doing. Several of the companies described them as being like an e-bike for walking.\n\nI gave myself a side quest of trying every exoskeleton that was available to demo. That ended up being a total of six: four that assisted you at the hip, one at the knee, and one at the ankle. One device made by Ascentiz ($1,299-$1,848) can be configured with combined hip and knee action, but the knee module wasn’t available for me to test.\n\nAll six devices really did give me a boost while walking (or climbing stairs—several of the companies wisely included a mini staircase in their booths to try out). But I have to wonder who the exoskeletons are really for. If you’re not a serious hiker, an exoskeleton might help you hike up a mountain and keep up with your friends. But I’d think that only a serious hiker would have $1,000+ to spend on hiking gear like an exoskeleton—and that they would probably prefer to train harder and spend the money on something else.\n\nIf I had to predict where this tech is going, I think the rental market makes the most sense. Imagine if you could borrow the Ascentiz for a scenic hike on vacation without having to train for months ahead of time, or strap on Dephy’s “powered footwear” ($4,500) to get you through a day at Disneyworld.",

    "description": "Evocative sounds from the past, complete with hiss and warp.",
    "fullText": "If you've ever been intrigued by the mystery of a dusty cassette you found in a thrift shop—or if you're just looking for a new time-sink—you have to check out Intertapes, a website that digitizes \"found cassettes\" sent in by users all over the world, then posts them in full for anyone to listen to.\n\nThe catalog is small at the moment—only 14 cassettes—but already really interesting. There's a bootleg cassette of music played at a Spanish nightclub in the late 1990s (lots of squelchy noises and relentless bass) and a 90-minute recording of New York hip hop station WBLS captured in '94 (Warren G.'s \"Regulate\" represent), amid more mysterious choices, like this haunting recording from a \"destroyed cassette tape found on the side of the coast highway near Heraklion\" in Greece; this tape full of ominous noises found in a parking lot in Tbilisi, Georgia; tape of binary code from Barcelona; and a cassette recorded in the USSR featurng 1970s pop hits.\n\nI love how each cassette is treated like an important archeological object, because in a way, they are—discreet time capsules made more poignant by the hiss and warp that speaks to the time that's passed since this audio was captured and the ephemeral nature of analogue recording. From musical snapshots to accidental field recordings, these tapes are fascinating for there mere existence in the modern day, where the question of who recorded them and why adds a layer of mystery to each one.\n\nIntertapes could be viewed as a reflection of the growing cassette tape revival, a movement that celebrates the outdated format. Since they hit the market in 1963, audiophiles have generally considered cassette tapes an inferior format to vinyl—tapes are more rugged than records, but the sound quality is markedly worse. The spread of CDs and streaming music pretty much killed off commercial cassette releases by the early 2000s, and it's easy to see why: Digital music doesn't hiss or degrade. Cassettes have a more narrow dynamic range. You can instantly select tracks on a CD or MP3 player, and it will never play at a slightly wrong speed, unspool, or melt on your car dashboard. Bonus: You never have to rewind them to hear a song again.\n\nMost people didn't see it at the time, but when tapes slipped into obsolescence, we lost something real and tangible. Dropouts, distortion, and warp are evidence of life. Cassette tape compression is a unique sonic aesthetic that conveys warmth and nostalgia. And then there's the way they impart meaning into the act of \"listening to music.\" Starting a Spotify stream is frictionless, optimized, and weightless, while cassettes are physical objects with histories that defy the disconnection of the digital space. You own the music on tapes in a way you never own information being served to you by a tech company. A friend handing you a cassette of their favorite songs is meaningful in a way a link to playlist will never be, and your Spotify playlist will never be found by the side of the road near Heraklion, to be pondered over by future people. \n\nYes, by digitizing them, Intertapes is removing some of the qualities that make these recording special—but it's also preserving them, at least for now (if you've ever tried following a decades-old weblink, you know the internet is ephemeral too).\n\nIf you're of a certain age, you probably have a dusty cassette or two hanging around somewhere. Don't let it molder in a desk drawer. Describe the origin of your recording and a background story, scan a picture of your tape, and email [email protected] to arrange you submission to the site. This collection really deserves to grow.",

    "title": "The Five Weirdest AI Inventions I Saw at CES 2026",
    "description": "AI gadgets had to get weird to stand out at CES 2026.",
    "fullText": "AI is still the big thing in the tech world, but it's no longer the big new thing. It's been around long enough that simply integrating it into your product isn't enough to make it stand out anymore, especially at the biggest tech show in the world. While I attended this year's CES, the trend I noticed over and over again on the show floor was that AI is getting weird now. From personal hologram sidekicks to a gaming monitor that basically cheats for you, here are the five weirdest AI inventions I saw at CES 2026.\n\nAt last year's CES, gaming lifestyle company Razer introduced Project AVA, an AI esports coach concept that was just a disembodied voice that lives in your laptop. Yawn. This year, the company's expanding on that by bringing AVA into the real world.\n\nIn Razer's suite this year, I held a conversation with \"Kira,\" an anime girl \"hologram\" that lives in a little USB tube you can plug into your laptop. She noticed my orange sweater thanks to a camera installed in the tube, before asking me about the show and prompting me to start up a round of Battlefield 6, where she gave me some generic loadout advice. I spoke with her using microphones also built into her tube, and she responded using her own speaker rather than the laptop's. Razer said this demo was more directed, hence why she brought up gaming right away, but that the end goal is to let the new AVA work as a convincing all-purpose AI companion, so you don't have to use it for only play.\n\nTo that end, the company says it's \"AI agnostic,\" so you can plug your own model into it. The demo I ran through was clearly using Grok, and generally felt a lot like talking to the AI companions built into that app, right down to the cringeworthy jokes. But Razer said you could theoretically use ChatGPT or Gemini instead.\n\nWhile we were chatting, Kira played animations courtesy of Animation Inc., which powers similar but more app-driven AI companions. In other words, the chatbot and the animations aren't really new here, so what you'd be buying would be the USB tube and the characters.\n\nKira isn't your only option for an AI companion here—she's a typical anime gamer girl, but I also got to briefly look at Zane, a tattooed muscle man in the deepest V-neck I've ever seen. You can kind of see the target audience for both of these characters right away, but if you want something more tame, you can also have your tube display Razer's logo surrounded by an audio waveform, which simply goes by AVA (even though the project as a whole is still called AVA). And the company's also working on celebrity likenesses, with esports star Faker and influencer Sao having already given their approval.\n\nRazer said it's still working on figuring out how it'll distribute these characters, and I was told you'd get a bundle of them with your purchase, but would probably be able to buy more down the line.\n\nAs for pricing and availability, no word on that. This is technically still a concept, so it might go back to the drawing board again. But Razer's website does say it's hoping for a release in the second half of 2026, and that you can put $20 down now to reserve your unit.\n\nIn short, if you strip away the functionality that's already baked into apps you can download now, the new Project Ava is basically a talking hologram toy for your desk. That's still not a bad pitch, but unfortunately, I'm not sure if hologram is the right word for this. Kira looked pretty flat to me, less like that one Princess Leia projection and more like she was displaying on a normal transparent screen that just happened to be stuck inside of a cylinder. I don't think the novelty quite matches the pitch yet.\n\nWhenever I play a competitive game, instead of hopping right into a match, I instead load up into a few practice sessions to warm up. It's helpful, but time consuming. The new Neurable x HyperX concept headset is hoping to change that by helping you lock in within just a few minutes.\n\nEssentially, it looks like a normal gaming headset, but built into the earcups are various sensors that can supposedly read your focus levels. These are similar to the brain-computer interfaces you might have seen in sci-fi shows, the ones with a bunch of wires and discs attached to them, but shrunken down for the consumer market, with no creepy wires in sight.\n\nThat's where the AI comes in. Shrinking down the sensors so much does mean this headset gets fewer readings than the bigger ones in labs, but Neurable claims its models are still able to pick up on trends in those readings and translate them into useful data, while also throwing out junk data.\n\nFor gamers, that means it can run you through a quick focus exercise called \"Prime,\" where you concentrate while noticing a cloud of dots shrink into a solid orb. Once this is done, which took about 90 seconds for me, you're supposedly focused up and ready to play.\n\nUnfortunately, I actually did worse in a practice shooting game after focusing than beforehand, but that doesn't mean the data was useless. I ran through the exercise with a colleague whose score improved by maybe about a third after focusing, and with such a small sample size, there could be any number of reasons I choked after focusing up. The company said that it could even be helpful to practice choking in this way.\n\nAnd at any rate, numbers are fun. That's why I'm most excited about the headset's plug-in for streamers, which allows them to show their focus levels on screen for their chat to see. I could easily imagine a community looking at that data and teasing their favorite streamer to try to distract them.\n\nThat said, it'll be a while until you can actually buy this. It's still a concept for now, with no pricing or promise of release. However, Neurable does already have a similar, non-gaming headset made with Master & Dynamic that will be shipping out soon, just without this software. For more, read my full article here.\n\nThis one is more of a hardware innovation, but it's a clever touch. This CES, Lenovo introduced a laptop with a motorized hinge that can automatically close, open, and even rotate from side-to-side. It'll be coming out later this summer, but while the company was demonstrating the unit to me, it also showed off a prototype chatbot app it's making for it. This uses ChatGPT for now, and is still just a concept and will not ship with the laptop. But it was cute.\n\nEssentially, while I talked with the app, the laptop displayed a big pair of animated eyes on screen, and used its hinge to nod or shake its head no when I asked it questions. It also displayed small animations in response to certain questions, like showing an umbrella when I asked about the rainy weather.\n\nIt's still very early days, but I was impressed that the hardware was able to recognize what an affirmative answer was and trigger the laptop to respond accordingly. A lot of AI feels pretty disconnected from the real world, so anything that can give it a physical presence is probably a good idea if you want people to take it seriously.\n\nAlso shown off at CES this year, Lenovo's AI Frame gaming monitor is probably the most practically useful item on this list, almost to the point where it feels like cheating. Essentially, this fills up most of the 21:9 screen with a regular 16:9 view of whatever's on your computer, and uses AI to show a zoomed-in look at critical game information on the rest.\n\nFor instance, in a demo showing a MOBA game (think League of Legends), the monitor zoomed in on the map. In a demo showing Counter-Strike 2, it zoomed in on the reticle. Personally, I didn't think getting a blown-up look at the map was all that helpful, but being able to constantly see what was essentially a sniper scope around my reticle was a game changer, since it worked with any gun and made targets much easier to see.\n\nI could see Counter-Strike 2 developer Valve go as far as banning this if it ever makes its way to market, since it's taken similar actions before. But this is still just an idea for now. Still, it shows that companies are starting to figure out concrete ways AI can help you in your games, beyond just feeding you advice you probably already know.\n\nFinally, probably my favorite AI invention at CES this year was XREAL's new REAL 3D technology. Built into its newest AR glasses and already added to an existing pair via a firmware update, this uses AI to automatically find depth in any 2D video source and convert it into 3D. And trying it out for myself, it practically looked official.\n\nWhen I used it to play Mario Kart World, I would have believed you if you told me Nintendo had added this mode itself. It also worked great with James Cameron's Avatar, and there was no loading time to set it up or turn it off. There also wasn't any fuzziness, like there might be with glasses-free 3D screens like the 3DS.\n\nIt's a great option for people who like watching 3D games and movies, but might have trouble finding them now that 3D TVs and the Nintendo 3DS are mostly in the past. Now, you can just watch your existing 2D library, but in 3D.\n\nThe only issue you might come across is in content that doesn't have depth. For instance, XREAL's Ralph Jodice told me the software didn't quite know what to do when he tried playing the original 8-bit Super Mario Bros. with it, and would randomly emphasize only certain game assets without any rhyme or reason. An illusion of depth does seem to work, though. Super Mario Bros. is entirely flat, but when I tried watching the pen-and-paper animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with this technology, it correctly separated characters in the foreground from scenery in the background, even though everything on screen was entirely hand-drawn.",

    "fullText": "Most people haven't actively managed a firewall in at least a decade, assuming they ever have. But keeping track of which applications are using the internet—and how much data they're using—is still useful at times, as is blocking apps from accessing the net entirely.\n\nWhile you're traveling, for example, internet access might be limited, so it's a good idea to cut off applications that constantly churn through data. But even while at home, it's a good security practice to review which applications are connecting to the internet. And while macOS comes with a firewall, it's not really a useful tool for that.\n\nWhich is why I like FireWally. This totally free application, offered by the Ukraine-based indie Mac developers Nektony, isn't a tool for power users—it's streamlined and user friendly. Click the menu bar icon and you'll see a list of applications using the internet. You can see a summary of all traffic today, in the past hour, or monitor incoming traffic in real time.\n\nBeside every application is its data usage. You can see a breakdown of inbound and outbound traffic for any application by hovering the mouse over it. You can block any application from accessing the internet by toggling the switch.\n\nWhat if you don't recognize an application? I, traditionally, ended up copying the name of the application and pasting it into a search engine. FireWally tries to save you some time by providing AI-generated summaries of each application using Apple Intelligence (assuming your Mac supports that feature). It's a useful way to quickly remind yourself what a particular application is, or to identify one you don't recognize.\n\nIt's a very streamlined application, but perfect for anyone hoping to understand a bit more about how much data their various Mac applications are using. Give it a spin if you're looking for a simple firewall application.",

    "description": "Katrina vanden...",
    "fullText": "Cora Weiss died in December at age 91. She never stopped campaigning to save the world from nuclear destruction.\n\nBetween 1958 and 1970, researchers in St. Louis collected 320,000 baby teeth. Unusual though that image might be on its own, the discovery that came out of it was far more disturbing: Fallout from nuclear weapons tests had made its way into the bodies of the very youngest Americans.\n\nIndeed, the resultant Baby Tooth Survey found that children had absorbed elevated levels of strontium-90—a carcinogenic radioactive isotope. The study attracted widespread attention, including from President John F. Kennedy. The month before his assassination, he signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963—the Cold War’s inaugural arms-control agreement.\n\nAs Kennedy, a young father, said at the time: “The loss of even one human life or the malformation of even one baby—who may be born long after we are gone—should be of concern to us all. Our children and grandchildren are not merely statistics toward which we can be indifferent.” That presidential recognition and action came at the urging of not just scientists but grassroots activists such as Cora Weiss, a New York City mother who sent her own children’s teeth to be tested and made peace her priority.\n\nCora, my friend and frequent collaborator, died in December at age 91. She was a champion of the United Nations and its mission to advance peace and women’s rights—and along with her husband, Peter, a brilliant international lawyer, she never stopped organizing to save the world from nuclear destruction. Unfortunately, in the last months of her life, that organizing became more necessary than ever.\n\nIn the fall of 2025, Kennedy’s acknowledgment of the dangers of nuclear weapons gained a grim new relevance when President Donald Trump announced that the United States might resume nuclear testing. Exactly what form these tests will take is unclear, but if Trump initiates a new era of explosive nuclear testing, it will constitute a catastrophic break from decades of hard-won restraint.\n\nThis move risks restarting a nuclear arms race, and Russia is already vowing to “take reciprocal measures” should the United States resume tests. Trump’s saber-rattling ignores the repercussions of nuclear testing that led the world to this moratorium in the first place.\n\nThis painful legacy is perhaps most acutely felt in the Marshall Islands, where the United States tested 67 nuclear weapons in the years following World War II. In 1954, the United States detonated its most powerful hydrogen bomb, Castle Bravo, on the archipelagic nation’s Bikini Atoll. The blast was more than 1,000 times stronger than those inflicted upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Only after testing, the residents were evacuated and told they could soon return. But they were not allowed home for 15 years—and even then, they were soon re-evacuated from the radioactive island, which remains virtually uninhabited to this day.\n\nIn the years since the detonations, Marshall Islanders who were exposed to nuclear fallout have experienced increased rates of cancer, leukemia, and infants born with congenital defects. On one atoll, 20 out of 29 children under 10 developed thyroid cancer. These catastrophic effects have reverberated across generations: More cancers are on the horizon for a community that has already lost so much.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nTo Trump, this death, disease, and destruction is perhaps a small price to pay for Making America Fearsome Again—and he, after all, will not be paying it.\n\nSenator Ed Markey, a longtime congressional leader in the fight for nuclear disarmament, writes for The Nation in this issue: “Instead of deterring foreign nations, renewed testing would be like throwing gasoline on the arms-race fire.”\n\nHe’s right, but can movements be mobilized to avert Trump’s march toward madness? Cora Weiss taught us the answer to that question.\n\nIt’s vital to recall the history of activists like Cora, who found the tools—and the teeth—to prevent nuclear war. In 1961, she joined a local chapter of Women Strike for Peace, a movement to end nuclear testing. Activism that started with sending her children’s baby teeth to St. Louis evolved into world-shaping leadership as the United Nations’ representative at the International Peace Bureau, and as its president between 2000 and 2006. Cora, who co-chaired the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, was a pillar of much of the anti-war organizing—including trips to return POWs, and efforts to humanize the Vietnamese people in the eyes of Americans and to convey the war’s impact on women and children.\n\nShe would go on to organize one of the largest antinuclear marches in history—1 million people who gathered in New York City’s Central Park on June 12, 1982. She also drafted the unanimously approved UN resolution affirming the importance of women’s roles in the peace and antinuclear movements.\n\n“I wasn’t making a revolution,” Cora told the Columbia Center for Oral History in 2014. “I was just working hard and long.”\n\nIt’s time to work every bit as hard and long as Cora did to create a world of peace safe from nuclear accidents, conflicts, or all-out war. It is the least we can do for the generations of people still facing the radioactive fallout of US recklessness.",

    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. US, The Nation’s justice correspondent makes the case to get rid of ICE, explores George Conway’s congressional campaign—and shares his New Year’s resolution.\n\nEvery authoritarian regime throughout history has employed a roving band of armed thugs who operate outside the law to enforce its strongman’s will. Caesar had his Praetorian Guard, Francios Duvalier had his Tonton Macoutes, Hitler had his Gestapo.\n\nDonald Trump has ICE. ICE is functionally a paramilitary organization, armed and empowered to harass citizens, brutalize opposition, and murder people who get in their way. Like any paramilitary apparatus, its chief aim is to strike fear in the population. It does this not only through feats of violence, false imprisonment, and kidnapping but also by repeatedly showing us it can’t be held accountable for its actions. ICE agents can seemingly do anything they want, and no one is allowed to stop them: They know it, and they want us to know it.\n\nWhen we look at the historical record, the horrifying reality of these thug paramilitaries is that they do not naturally melt away when the strongman is finally deposed. They stay on. They align themselves with the next strongman, or the strongman who wants to overthrow the republican government that deposed the previous strongman. The next guy in office tends to want to keep them around anyway, because having a terrorist apparatus able to operate outside the law is something that leaders of nations consistently find useful.\n\nThese paramilitaries can be dismantled, but only when the people demand it, over and over again, and refuse to support any politicians or regimes who would keep them in place. ICE can be stopped, but we do not elect people to power who actually want to stop ICE; we tend instead to elect people who want to “fund” ICE, control it, and use it for their own purposes. And that is why we fail.\n\nICE must be abolished, root and stem, by the next Democratic administration. As a stopgap, it must be defunded by the current collection of Democrats, should the party take power in the upcoming election. ICE is the one true litmus test for an incoming post-Trump administration. The Democrats will likely not be inclined to do this. Again, paramilitary thugs have their uses to leaders the world over, and Democrats are traditionally afraid of looking “weak” on immigration or actually dismantling the tools of the enemy. Democrats, if they’re going to do this, must be forced to do this, by the people whose support they seek.\n\nI’ve liked to think of myself as a single-issue voter, with that issue being Supreme Court expansion. But no longer. Abolish ICE, or GTFO of my primary.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nI’m not going to bother to tell you, as some no doubt will, that George Conway isn’t a “real” Democrat. Sure, Conway is a lifelong Republican and essentially a founding member of the Federalist Society. Sure, he switched parties and moved from Bethesda, Maryland, to run in the Democratic primary to replace Jerry Nadler in New York’s 12th Congressional District, but… whatever.\n\nWhat even is a “real” Democrat these days? A party that consistently embraces wannabe Republicans like Joe Manchin and Elissa Slotkin, that regularly gets bumfuzzled by straight-up liars like Kyrsten Sinema and John Fettermen, and that operates under the feckless and borderline complicit leadership of Charles Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries can hardly stand on intellectual or political purity. Conway is as much a “Democrat” as most of them these days. He’s a guy who’d rather make strongly worded television appearances than take radical action. He wants to reassemble the institutions Trump has smashed instead of smashing the institutions that make Trump possible. He wants to go backward, to a time before Trump, instead of boldly going forward. Oh, he’s a Democrat all right.\n\nAnd not just any Democrat. Conway represents the very worst of what today’s Democrats have to offer. His signature issue is “not Trump.” His fame is based on being a Republican who was against Trump while married to a Republican working for Trump. His positions would be banal if not for the family melodrama and the fact that so few Republicans had the basic human decency to stand up to the cretin taking over their party. He exists as a television personality because TV executives are desperate for Republicans who can maintain a veneer of respectability—or, at least, they were before they gave up and put Bari Weiss in charge.\n\nDemocrats who offer nothing beyond “Orange Man bad” are the lowest-common-denominator politicians these days. Conway takes the calculation to its irreducible conclusion. Everybody knows he stands against Trump, but do people know what he stands for?\n\nI do. Conway is basically one of the founding members of the Federalist Society. He first joined one of their boards in 1984. He’s not Leonard Leo, but he’s worked closely with the Republican judicial Svengali over the decades. There is not a single Republican on the bench that Conway has objected to: not the sexual predator Clarence Thomas or alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, not the anti-abortion stalwarts John Roberts and Sam Alito, not the stolen-seat installations Neil Gorsuch or Amy Coney Barrett. Conway was there for all of them, and most of the Republican judges appointed to the lower courts too.\n\nConway’s no longer an active member of the Federalist Society (though I don’t know if he still goes to their parties and fundraising dinners; it’s not like I’m invited over to see). His 2018 FedSoc splinter group “Checks and Balances” apparently went nowhere. But despite this apparent break, Conway is one of those “Never Trumpers”—like Nicole Wallace or the entire staff of The Bulwark—who keep their criticisms focused more on Trump than on the Trump-loving Supreme Court they helped create. While he recently said that the Supreme Court has become “intoxicated with its power,” Conway is, for my money, among the people running for office who can be trusted least to take away power from a court he spent a lifetime helping to create.\n\nConway is good on TV. He should stay there. Being wrong about everything for your entire life until yesterday is a good credential for television. It’s a terrible credential for leadership. I have no problem accepting Conway as a Democrat, but I have a huge problem accepting that Conway is the best Democrats can offer.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nOver the holiday break, I rewatched all of the Lord of the Rings movies. I was struck, once again, by one of the most famous scenes in the three films—the one where Frodo says, “I wish none of this had ever happened,” and Gandalf responds, “So do all who live to see such times. But it is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time given to us.”\n\nI usually find this scene empowering. This time I found it to be full of shit. As I ponder what to do with the awful time given to me, my intrusive thoughts tend toward, “How best to die while fighting this regime?” But the reality is that most of us will not have a choice on how or when the Trump regime will martyr us.\n\nRenee Good did not wake up one morning and decide she was ready to die opposing Trump. She just reacted as a decent person would when the bad people came to do bad things in her neighborhood.\n\nOn this most recent Lord of the Rings rewatching, I identified most with Meriadoc Brandybuck (one of the three hobbits who join Frodo on his quest). Merry didn’t set out like Gandalf to organize regime change. He wasn’t charged like Frodo to destroy the evil power. He just… tried to help his friends, and understood that if he didn’t try, his entire community would be destroyed. When Merry is at the Entmoot (the meeting of powerful but long dormant tree-creatures), literally screaming at the trees to do something, I felt like he was me talking to Democrats in Washington.\n\n“I’m a hobbit, and I know I can’t save Middle-Earth. I just want to help my friends” turns out to be my New Year’s resolution.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

The ownership is very aligned. We know it's a tough spell that we need to get through.\"",

Scrum-half Mikey Austin spotted space in behind and judged his chip over the defence to perfection for Atkinson to touch down.\n\nTrailing by 13 points at the break, Edinburgh needed the next score and they got it when Ashman, a first-half substitute in place of Harri Morris, burrowed over from close range.\n\nBarton responded with another penalty but when McConnell blasted over the line for the home side, we had a two-point game heading into the final quarter.\n\nEdinburgh tails were up and when a rolling maul was halted illegally as it hurtled towards the Gloucester line, a penalty try was awarded, Atkinson was sent to the bin and the home side led for the first time.\n\nBarton kicked flawlessly all night and his fourth penalty from long-range split the posts to bring the visitors back within two, but the hosts stood firm to secure a vital win.\n\nEdinburgh: Goosen, Graham, Currie, Lang, Van der Merwe, Thompson, Vellacott; Whitcombe, Morris, Blyth-Lafferty, Hunter-Hill, Young, McConnell, Douglas, Bradbury (capt).\n\nReplacements: Ashman, Schoeman, Hill, McVie, Dodd, Muncaster, Shiel, O'Conor.\n\nGloucester: Barton, Cotgreave, Butler, S.

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior wants to emulate \"brave\" Sir Alex Ferguson with a young Chelsea squad he believes has the potential to grow like Manchester United's famous Class of '92.\n\nThe 41-year-old replaced Enzo Maresca as head coach of the Blues after the Italian left his role on New Year's Day.\n\nMaresca had complained of pressure to select certain players - senior figures insist he was only asked to limit minutes for those carrying injuries - and highlighted the challenge of sustained success with the Premier League's youngest squad, whose starting XIs have averaged 24 years and 198 days this season.\n\nBut Rosenior will relish the opportunity to shape successful futures for an exciting crop of talent - just like Ferguson did during his trophy-laden reign at Old Trafford.\n\n\"I was a Manchester United fan and I am now massively a Chelsea fan,\" said Rosenior.\n\n\"I remember Sir Alex Ferguson was brave enough to put six or seven players aged between 19 and 21 into a title-winning team because he believed in them.\n\n\"They grew and won trophy after trophy. It was an amazing period in that club's history. Without that bravery, it doesn't happen. There is potential for that here.\"\n\nUnited legends, such as Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil and Gary Neville, famously became known as the Class of '92 as they came through the youth ranks to win multiple major honours with the club under Ferguson.\n\n\"Speak about Moises Caicedo or Enzo Fernandez or Cole Palmer or Reece James - world-class players and still very, very young,\" added Rosenior.\n\n\"That is the ultimate ambition for this club - to create that again.\"\n\nChelsea appointed Rosenior after 18 months at Strasbourg, who are part of the same Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital multi-club ownership group.\n\nThe French side fielded the youngest squad in Europe's big five leagues last season, averaging 21 years and 171 days, and finished seventh - just three points off the Champions League places, but qualified for Europe for the first time in eight years.\n\n\"If you watched the Strasbourg team I coached, everyone enjoyed watching them because they played with intensity,\" said Rosenior. \"Why? Because they were young, fit, less prone to injury. I'm going to work really hard to create that here.\n\n\"I have to train the players right, work with the medical team and look after them because they have outstanding careers ahead. But that doesn't stop you being successful now. If I thought it was impossible to win with this group, I wouldn't have come.\"",

    "fullText": "Sean Dyche has called for some of his Nottingham Forest players to \"have a look in the mirror\" after an \"unacceptable\" first-half performance in their FA Cup loss at Wrexham.\n\nForest were the first Premier League side in third-round action and the first casualty at the hands of lower league opposition.\n\nHaving made eight changes from Tuesday's Premier League win at West Ham, Dyche watched in fury as his side trailed their Championship opponents 2-0 at the break.\n\nThey fought back to make it 3-3 and force extra-time at Stok Cae Ras, but were beaten 4-3 in the penalty shootout after Igor Jesus and Omari Hutchinson had their spot-kicks saved by home keeper Arthur Okonkwo.\n\n\"The first half was completely unacceptable,\" Dyche told TNT Sports.\n\n\"I let the players know and there are certain individuals that certainly know and they have to look in the mirror.\n\n\"But the strangeness of football, some players that came on in the second half were a credit and we went on and looked like a Premier League side.\n\n\"You can't do that in the first half, it's completely unacceptable. It's unacceptable to me, but I said you have to look in the mirror because that's unacceptable to the badge as well.\n\n\"They all knock on the door and say, 'why aren't I playing?'. Well the evidence is quite honestly there for some, not for all.\"\n\nWhile Dyche praised those who came off the bench - including two-goal Callum Hudson-Odoi - for acting as a \"catalyst\" for their second-half comeback, he continued to berate his side's efforts in a poor first 45 minutes.\n\n\"I could have taken all of them off [at half-time],\" he added. \"The tempo, the mentality to take the game on was lacking so badly in the first half.\n\n\"Slow, methodical, we have done a lot of work on that. There was basically no intent, no real desire to make a difference. Second half, the changes were terrific.\n\n\"The facts of the matter are we've got to make changes. They showed their hand and won't be knocking on my door saying, 'why aren't I playing?' again, that's for sure, that first-half group.\"",
