    "fullText": "Florida State Seminoles transfer defensive back Edwin Joseph is committing to Ole Miss via the Transfer Portal, On3 has learned. He spent the previous three seasons with the Seminoles.\n\nEdwin Joseph is a native of Hollywood, Florida, where he played at Chaminade-Madonna Prep. He was a four-star recruit in the Class of 2023. Within that recruiting cycle, Joseph was the 345th-ranked player overall and the 11th-ranked athlete.\n\nWhile in high school, Joseph won back-to-back state championships. In 2022, he was also named a Nat Moore Trophy finalist.\n\nIn 2023, Joseph would play in four games, utilizing a redshirt that season. By 2024, he had played in all 12 games for the Florida State defense, and in 2025, he was a consistent starter at the safety position. For his career, he’d finish playing in 28 games for the Seminoles.\n\nDuring that time, he had 51 total tackles, 7.0 tackles for a loss, and 1.5 sacks. He would also snag four interceptions and defend nine passes. The vast majority of that production came during the 2025 season.\n\nEdwin Joseph and Mike Norvell did have a public back-and-forth during the season. That wasn’t the first time those two teams had publicly butted heads.\n\nIt was a difficult two seasons for Florida State on the whole. After winning the ACC in 2023, the Seminoles have failed to make a bowl game in the two subsequent years.\n\nThat included bottoming out to 2-10 in 2024 and going just 3-13 in ACC play during that time. Now, it appears as though the Seminoles will undergo some heavy turnover in the Transfer Portal, which Norvell will quickly need to address.\n\nNow, Joseph is going to be looking for an opportunity in Oxford. He’ll have two seasons of eligibility remaining once he gets there.\n\nMoreover, Joseph was rated as a four-star prospect in the On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings. He was the No. 75 overall recruit, and the No. 4 overall safety available after entering their name into the portal before committing to a new beginning. You can check out the full rankings HERE to see where each athlete slots in.\n\nThe 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days, spanning from Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA decided. While players have just over two weeks  to enter the portal, they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter. Traditionally, the cut-off for committing has been how late a school can enroll a player through admissions, so it varies throughout the sport.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\n— On3’s Dan Morrison contributed to this article.",

    "fullText": "FC Barcelona and Real Madrid lock horns with each other tomorrow in the Spanish Super Cup final in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt promises to be an exciting match with an added edge, considering the rivalry between the two teams as well as recent bad blood developing due to off-field issues.\n\nLamine Yamal, who is at 100% fitness and ready to start, will be a key figure for Barcelona as they chase their first trophy of the new season.\n\nAhead of the game, Real Madrid captain Dani Carvajal spoke to the media and discussed the teenage wonderkid and the incident they were involved in during the previous El Clasico.\n\nLeading up to the La Liga fixture between the two teams in October, Lamine made some statements in a humorous setting that were taken out of context and blown up.\n\nReal Madrid players were far from pleased with what was said, and Carvajal, as a result, confronted the teenager after the game ended in a 2-1 win for the Merengues.\n\nCarvajal keen on leaving Lamine incident in the past. (Photo by JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA heated altercation followed, with members from both teams getting involved. Reflecting on the matter, the Los Blancos’ skipper said (h/t SPORT):\n\n“I think Lamine is a young kid and he wasn’t entirely right in those statements, but that’s all.\n\n“As I said before with [Diego] Simeone, everyone tries to defend their own at the club level. He’s a great kid, and that’s where it ended.”\n\nHowever, Carvajal added: “I don’t wish him the best tomorrow, obviously.”\n\nTalking about the Clasico final for the Spanish Super Cup, the Spanish veteran stated that whoever wins would have a major boost for the rest of the season.\n\n“It’s always a good time to win a final, especially against Barcelona, and I imagine our opponents feel the same way. Whoever wins tomorrow will come out stronger, as is only natural,” he remarked.",

    "fullText": "Friday's usual \"Ask The Maven\" was on holiday but  \"ATM\" is running today. This week's question comes from City Island, New York. Jack Gumpert asks:\n\nHOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HOW THE TV MEDIA IS HANDLING THE RANGERS SITUATION?\n\nThe Maven replies: You have to start with the fact that whether the Blueshirts win or lose, it's all there for the public to see on the screen, in person as well as all the replays available.\n\nThere can be no cheating the viewing public.\n\nMSG Networks' analyst styles vary. Sam Rosen and Joe Micheletti, for example, were more –  shall I say – temperate in their handling of a non-playoff team. They were professional and rational which were fair enough and the fans adored them.\n\nThe very able replacements, Kenny Albert and Dave Maloney, have brought their pungent-no-kidding-around radio styles superbly to television and – I'm certain – fans find it most refreshing.\n\nEmotional – in a fan kind of way – Maloney reacts more forcefully than Micheletti while Albert\n\ncontinues to be the best play-by-play man for which a Rangers fan can root. MSG Networks employs a variety of other analyst types and some penetraiting ones.\n\nI was intrigued with a post-game schmooze the other night between the very insightful John Gianonne and Steve Valiquette. It was very revealing in terms of Vally's comments about some of the Rangers. Take a look:\n\n\"Now is the time of year where you start sitting people,\" Valiquette asserted. \"You have to get everybody's attention. You start with Lafreniere; he's pacing for 16 goals. Terrible giveaway (late vs. Buffalo) again; getting less than 15 minutes of ice time right now. You have to get more from him.\n\n\"You need to get more from your top six and I think that it sends a message to everybody that they can be next. One of the biggest challenges NHL teams have is that guys make a lot of money and you can't shame or blame a millionaire. But you can embarrass them by taking away their ice time. That's the only thing you can control.\n\nRemembering Glenn Hall Against The Rangers I have to admit that The Maven has taken the passing of Hall of Fame goalie Glenn Hall hard. Tearful hard.\n\n\"You can control the narrative in your room if you do that. You can go there. Sometimes during a game, you miss a shift. Panarin not backchecking on the empty net goal should cost  PP time in the next game.\n\n\"You have a meeting with him (and say) 'Look, you didn't skate at the end of the game on the PP.'\"\n\nToday, we'll see who comes through and who doesn't and I expect that the MSG Networks' pros will tell us what we need to know!\n\nOh, yeah, by the way, they need two points!",

    "description": "WWE Hall of Famer Bully Ray explains why he is not too keen on how the company promotes its young and rising stars.",
    "fullText": "Real recognizes real. And in the case of Bully Ray, the idea of a younger talent looking up to a veteran in this business is admirable, but it needs to be toned down, in his opinion. In an open discussion hours before Cody Rhodes lost the Undisputed WWE Championship to Drew McIntyre this past Friday on \"WWE SmackDown,\" the idea of how \"The American Nightmare\" could potentially bounce back from this loss was on the minds of \"Busted Open\" hosts Dave LaGreca and Ray. But before they delved into where they think WWE should take this storyline, Ray had this to say about rising stars being taken under veterans' wings.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of the WWE treating a lot of their talent like children,\" the WWE Hall of Famer said. \"You see it a lot, where a lot of younger talent [is] like, 'Oh, I'm just happy to be in the ring with you. Oh, this is a dream come true,' like with Lyra [Valkyria] and Becky [Lynch]. It worked, but...it's becoming a little too much where a lot of younger talent are deer in the headlights when it comes to the veterans.\"\n\nWhat sparked this remark from Ray came from LaGreca's take that, perhaps, Randy Orton should help train Rhodes to become a three-time Undisputed Champion, similar to how Apollo Creed trained Rocky Balboa in \"Rocky III.\" With the promise that \"The Viper\" is owed a future title match. Indeed an interesting proposal, Ray thought oppositely.\n\n\"I want Cody to eventually be looked at and talked about in the same light as everybody else, and not just because he becomes the same age as them, but because he becomes them and surpasses them as an athlete and a professional and as an entertainer and as a wrestler,\" he added. \"I don't necessarily wanna see Cody have to be taken under anybody's wing. I don't want to look at Cody as a child. I wanna look at Cody as a full-blown man.\"\n\nRhodes reclaimed the Undisputed Championship from \"The Never Seen 17\" John Cena on Night Two at SummerSlam this past August. His second reign ended at 159 days.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Busted Open Radio\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Liverpool look beyond Semenyo as Kevin Schade enters transfer thinkingLiverpool’s pursuit of attacking reinforcements has taken another turn following confirmation that Antoine Semenyo will be headi...",
    "fullText": "Liverpool’s pursuit of attacking reinforcements has taken another turn following confirmation that Antoine Semenyo will be heading to Manchester City. As Anfield Watch outline, this was a deal Liverpool clearly admired but ultimately could not land, prompting a familiar recalibration rather than panic. Under Arne Slot, recruitment remains measured, analytical and rooted in long term fit rather than short term noise.\n\nAs Anfield Watch note, “How keen and how serious the club’s interest was in comparison to Man City remains moot. We may never know how close Liverpool got to completing this deal, or just how far away they were from it.” That uncertainty defines much of modern Transfers, where even strong interest does not always translate into decisive movement.\n\nLiverpool’s admiration for Semenyo was well established. “They clearly like Semenyo, and have been wanting to add a similar profile to him for a while.” With that profile still a priority, attention has turned to a player long tracked by Liverpool scouts.\n\nAccording to Anfield Watch, “The club has added Kevin Schade to their shortlist for the summer window. The German international has been followed by Liverpool scouts for over five years now and back when he started to emerge as an exciting youngster at Freiburg, the Reds did already consider making a move for him.” That line speaks volumes about Liverpool’s recruitment philosophy, patient, informed and rarely impulsive.\n\nJurgen Klopp’s admiration for Schade’s style is also noted in the report, although the eventual move never materialised due to valuation concerns. Schade instead joined Brentford, where he has steadily developed into a key Premier League performer. Now 24, he is approaching his peak years with tangible output to match his raw attributes.\n\nSchade’s appeal lies not only in goals and assists but in traits that Liverpool currently lack in abundance. As Anfield Watch explain, “Predominantly a left-winger, Schade is very much of the Semenyo mould.” He is an inverted forward, capable centrally and across the line, offering tactical elasticity that Slot values highly.\n\nHis pace is striking. “During his first season in the league, Schade clocked in a top-speed of 36.37 km/h which was faster than the likes of Alphonso Davies and Erling Haaland in the Bundesliga.” That speed has translated to England, where “he has clocked in a top-speed of 34.8km/h for Brentford, which is the fastest for the club in the Premier League this season.”\n\nCrucially, Schade runs beyond defences rather than always demanding the ball to feet. “Right now, Liverpool don’t really have this kind of profile.” With Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah preferring play in front of defensive lines, Schade would stretch opponents vertically and horizontally.\n\nAnfield Watch conclude that Schade offers “a new element and new dimension to Liverpool’s attack.” That assessment feels accurate. His pressing, channel running and positional flexibility align neatly with Slot’s emphasis on speed and intensity. Added to that, “for most of his career in the Bundesliga, he played as a right-winger so he can play across the front three.”\n\nLiverpool rarely move without conviction. Schade’s presence on the shortlist suggests quiet groundwork already laid, positioning Liverpool well should summer opportunities arise.\n\nMissing out on Semenyo hurts in the short term, but the idea that Liverpool already have alternatives like Kevin Schade under serious consideration speaks to continuity in recruitment.\n\nSchade feels like a Slot player. Pace, pressing and positional intelligence are non negotiable under this regime, and the Brentford winger ticks those boxes. Fans have often called for more runners in behind, particularly against low blocks, and Schade’s speed profile directly addresses that gap.\n\nThere is also comfort in the timeline. Liverpool tracking him for over five years shows this is not opportunism but strategy. Supporters have seen how well that approach has worked with past Bundesliga imports. The concern, as ever, will be cost. Brentford sell hard and sell well.\n\nYet if Liverpool are serious about evolving the attack post title win, adding variety matters as much as adding goals. Schade might not arrive with fanfare, but he feels like the kind of signing that quietly raises the ceiling of the squad.",

    "fullText": "At a time when Real Madrid desperately required the stability of a top midfielder, Eduardo Camavinga has been anything but.\n\nThe Frenchman is coming on the back of a turbulent 2025 that was dominated by injuries and lack of form, which even saw him move below Arda Guler in Real Madrid’s midfield pecking order.\n\nUntil the turn of the year, he had started in just six of 25 matches (24%), spending more time in the infirmary than on the pitch. However, everything appears to have changed with the arrival of 2026.\n\nAccording to AS, the Real Madrid coaching staff now views the Frenchman ahead of Guler in the pecking order and as the superior option alongside Aurelien Tchouameni and Jude Bellingham.\n\nThis was confirmed when Alonso chose Camavinga to start against Real Betis and repeated the decision in the Super Cup semi-final against Atletico Madrid. Not to mention, the team also rejected an offer from Liverpool.\n\nCamavinga has earned the trust of Real Madrid coaching staff. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nCamavinga offers a physical presence and ground coverage that Guler currently lacks, making the team feel more compact and solid defensively.\n\nWhile Alonso has previously stated the need to invest heavily in Guler, the Turk’s defensive contribution has dipped, costing him his spot in the high-stakes matches. The player has overall failed to impress in the last few months.\n\nKeeping that in mind, Camavinga is now the clear favourite to start in Sunday’s El Clasico final against Barcelona.\n\nHe has completed a remarkable turnaround from an injury-prone afterthought to a guaranteed starter in the season’s biggest game so far.\n\nCamavinga, therefore, will be keen to impress on Sunday. A solid performance against Barcelona could go a long way in making him a crucial component in Xabi Alonso’s midfield during the second half of the campaign.",

    "description": "The Cleveland Browns head coaching search seems likely to include John Harbaugh based on Saturday’s report",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns are officially in on trying to hire John Harbaugh to be their next head coach and replace Kevin Stefanski. Once Harbaugh became available, the Browns would have been failing if they had not done at least their due diligence to see if the former Baltimore Ravens head coach was interested in their job. Oftentimes, behind-the-scenes conversations are had before any official or unofficial request becomes public.\n\nThere are a few reasons that Harbaugh might want to come back to his home area to coach Cleveland, but the veteran delayed any immediate interviews for a chance to make a plan. Harbaugh reportedly has high demands for his next employer, but none of those should dissuade the Browns.\n\nNow, reportedly, we have proof that Cleveland is interested in Harbaugh and at least has some belief that the Super Bowl-winning coach would be willing to sit down and talk to them:\n\nYou can officially add the Cleveland Browns to the list of teams that have reached out to John Harbaugh to set up an interview for their open head coach position, per source.\n\n— Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) January 10, 2026\n\nThat report is notable as the Browns would not have made it known that they reached out, nor would Harbaugh benefit from leaking that information, unless they believed they had a shot with the top candidate in this cycle. It also means Cleveland’s ownership and decision makers are not put off by any of the demands/requirements made from the coach’s side.",

    "fullText": "The Jacksonville Jaguars host the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Wild Card round on Saturday.\n\nThis year may look like Josh Allen's best path to the Super Bowl, but my Bills vs. Jaguars predictions don't think he'll get past the opening round.\n\nHere are my best NFL picks for this playoff clash on Sunday, January 11.\n\nBills vs Jaguars Best bet: Jaguars +1.5 (-120)\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are small road favorites, but they really shouldn't be since the Jacksonville Jaguars enter the playoffs red-hot, going 8-0 SU and ATS in their last eight games.\n\nThe Jaguars finished the regular season with one more win than Buffalo, despite facing a tougher schedule, and are also slightly higher in the DVOA ratings.\n\nJacksonville is fifth in the league in defensive EPA and has been strong against both the run and pass. On the other side of the ball, Travis Etienne will churn out yards against a Bills run defense that is near the bottom of the league in every metric.\n\nThe Bills are just 31st in the league in defensive rush EPA and DVOA. Etienne finished the regular season with 1107 rushing yards, and the Jags will lean on their ground game to keep Buffalo's explosive offense off the field.\n\nJosh Allen's passing numbers wildly fluctuate due to game script and weather conditions. Since we have the Jags covering, Allen will have a neutral or negative game script, and this is the nicest weather he's played in since Week 12.\n\nTravis Etienne Jr. Over 64.5 rushing yards\n\nJosh Allen Over 225.5 passing yards\n\nJags QB Trevor Lawrence has scored nine touchdowns in his last 13 games and isn't afraid to run in high-leverage situations.\n\nTravis Etienne Jr. Over 64.5 rushing yards\n\nJosh Allen Over 225.5 passing yards\n\nTrevor Lawrence anytime touchdown\n\nSpread: Bills -1.5 (-102) | Jaguars +1.5 (-120)\n\nMoneyline: Bills -110 | Jaguars -106\n\nOver/Under: Over 51.5 | Under 51.5\n\nSince I'm taking the Jags on the small +1.5 spread, I'd also be willing to bet them on the moneyline. After all, they have the better defense and home-field advantage against a Bills squad that can't stop the run.\n\nScore prediction: Jaguars 25, Bills 24\n\nThe Bills have gone 4-9 ATS in their last 13 games as a favorite.

    "fullText": "Aston Villa want to bolster their attack this winter to help keep pace with Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\nVilla are looking to re-sign Tammy Abraham to keep their title challenge alive, per The Telegraph’s Mike McGrath.\n\nAbraham spent the 2018-19 season on loan at Villa Park, when he scored 26 goals in 40 appearances to help the Midlands side secure Premier League promotion.\n\nHowever, signing him again would be complicated as the English striker is on loan at Besiktas from AS Roma.\n\nThe move will be made permanent for £11.2 million if certain conditions are met.\n\nAbraham’s wages could also be a stumbling block as he is currently earning around £115,000 per week.\n\nVilla have made an impressive start to the 2025-26 campaign, collecting 43 points from 21 league games to be third in the table.\n\nDespite the 4-1 thrashing at Arsenal, the Lions are only six points behind the leaders.\n\nTargeting Abraham shows their intent to hunt down the Gunners in the title race.\n\nOllie Watkins has been excellent for the Midlands outfit this campaign, scoring seven goals in 28 matches across all competitions.\n\nBut manager Unai Emery wants to bring support for the 30-year-old, who has started all but three of Villa’s Premier League fixtures.\n\nAbraham could be a superb addition for them, as he is highly rated for his physical presence, movement and finishing ability.\n\nHe has scored 12 goals in 24 games for Besiktas this season so far.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City’s progress into the FA Cup fourth round was swift, emphatic and utterly unforgiving. Exeter City, buoyed by occasion and travelling support, were instead met by a level of intensity that turned a cup tie into a long and chastening afternoon. By the final whistle, Man City had struck 10 times, leaving Exeter with little more than a memory of the stage and a harsh lesson in elite efficiency.\n\nPep Guardiola watched from the stands as he served a touchline ban, but his presence was felt in the structure and seriousness of City’s approach. This was no experimental outing. A strong XI, captained by Rodri, played with the rhythm and purpose of a side intent on making the evening decisive early.\n\nCity’s dominance was established within minutes. Max Alleyne, an academy product, opened the scoring after 12 minutes, reacting sharply to poke the ball over the line. It was a moment that reflected both opportunity and assurance, traits that would define the rest of the contest.\n\nRodri soon followed with a 30 yard strike that effectively ended the contest as a competition. Two unfortunate own goals from Jake Doyle Hayes and Jack Fitzwater before half time deepened Exeter’s troubles and underlined the relentlessness of City’s pressure. For all that, Exeter had their moments. Liam Oakes came close inside five minutes, his header forcing a sharp save from James Trafford, a reminder that the hosts were not entirely untroubled.\n\nMuch of the intrigue centred on Antoine Semenyo, handed a debut days after completing his £65m move from Bournemouth. Thrown straight into the starting line up, he offered directness and composure, growing into the game as spaces widened.\n\nHis influence was decisive after the break. Rico Lewis converted from Semenyo’s cross, before the Ghanaian forward marked his debut with a composed finish of his own. It was a return that hinted at why City moved quickly to secure him, a blend of physical presence and calm execution.\n\nThe second half became an exercise in damage limitation for Exeter. Tijjani Reijnders curled home, Nico O’Reilly headed in, and Ryan McAidoo drilled a finish as City’s rotation options continued to deliver. Yet amid the collapse, Exeter found a moment of pride. Nineteen year old George Birch struck a fine late consolation, greeted warmly by the 7,800 travelling supporters.\n\nThere was still time for Lewis to complete the scoring, smashing in City’s tenth to seal a 10-1 result. For Man City, progression felt inevitable. For Exeter, the scoreline was brutal, but the experience will linger far longer than the numbers.",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals requested an interview with San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh earlier in the week.\n\nWe’re going to go out on a limb and say that Saleh won’t take the chance in his second head coaching stint in the NFC West, where three of the best coaches in the NFL reside. Not to mention, the Cardinals have had three total wins in the division during the past three seasons—just a hunch.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Baltimore Ravens requested Saleh for their head coaching vacancy after firing John Harbaugh after 18 seasons.\n\nIn December, it was reported that Saleh would be patient and not jump at the opportunity to coach again if it wasn’t a fit. On Thursday, Saleh was asked about his focus on the playoffs with the NFL coaching openings. Saleh said, “The league has done a nice job structuring the interview process, allowing focus on the job at hand. Haven’t thought about it. I know things come in but don’t have to deal with it until next week.”\n\nThe Ravens’ job has to be intriguing for anybody. They have one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL when healthy, and play in a division that pales in comparison to the NFC West. Baltimore also has building blocks, like Kyle Hamilton, and has generally a playoff team since Lamar Jackson took over as the starter.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Atlanta Falcons and Tennessee Titans also requested an interview for Saleh. So, he’s once again a popular candidate during this coaching cycle.\n\nKyle’s update, 9:56 a.m. PT: NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported the Miami Dolphins put in a request to interview 49ers’ DC Robert Saleh, making it his fifth interview during this cycle. He’s close to interviewing for every head coaching vacancy. The Dolphins going from the former Niners offensive coordinator to their defensive coordinator would be entertaining.",

    "fullText": "A thrilling AFC Divisional Round game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills at the end of the 2021-2022 NFL season led the league to change the overtime rules for playoff games, giving both teams a chance to possess the football. Previously, the team that won the coin toss could elect to receive the kick, and would win the game with a touchdown on their first drive.\n\nThe outcry after Josh Allen and the Bills lost that playoff game without getting a chance to touch the football in overtime led to the revised rules.\n\nSo as the 2025-2026 NFL Playoffs get ready to begin, let’s revisit those rules, because you never know when you will need to know them.\n\nAll playoff games that advance to overtime will follow these revised rules:\n\nIf a game is tied at the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nBoth teams will have an opportunity to possess the football. This is the big change. Previously, as we saw in the 2022 AFC Divisional Round game between Kansas City and Buffalo, if the team that started with the football scored a touchdown, the game was over. Under the new rules, in that scenario, Buffalo would get a chance to match with a touchdown of their own, and if they did, the game would continue. Once both teams have had possession, the game then becomes sudden death. In addition, if the team that starts with possession scores and kicks the extra point to take a seven-point lead, the second team can win with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession is still in progress — the teams will play another overtime period. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nIf the game remains tied after two overtime periods, there will be a second half. The captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be a third coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII made a little history under the revised playoff rules.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII became the first playoff game under the league’s new overtime rules for the postseason, and those changes guaranteed each team a chance to possess the football in overtime. After the San Francisco 49ers kicked a field goal — more on that in a moment — Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs drove down the field and scored the game-winning touchdown on the final play of Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nThat made Super Bowl LVIII the first Super Bowl to see a lead change on the final play of the game.\n\nLooking back at how that unfolded, many wonder if the 49ers should have approached things differently.\n\nSan Francisco won the coin toss, and made the decision to receive the kickoff, despite a prevailing theory that under the new rules it made more sense to defer. With both teams guaranteed a possession, knowing what you need to score to win the game offers a competitive advantage, similar to how teams in college want to start on defense in overtime, so they know what they need to do on offense to win.\n\nInstead, the 49ers began on offense, and could only manage a field goal. That opened the door for the Chiefs to win the game on their guaranteed possession with a touchdown, which is exactly what they did.\n\nSpeaking after the game, San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan stated that the team had run through the various scenarios, and thought by starting on offense they would have the advantage if the game advanced to a third overtime possession, and sudden death.\n\n“None of us have a ton of experience with it,” Shanahan said. “We went through all the analytics and talked to those guys. We decided it would be better getting the ball because if both teams matched and scored, we wanted to be the ones to have a chance to go win it.”\n\nThe problem? The game never got to that third overtime.\n\nLast year, none of the playoff games advanced to overtime, so fans were not treated to another situation like Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nNor did they get a chance to see what, if anything, teams and coaches learned from how that game ended.\n\nAhead of the 2025 NFL season, the league decided to align the overtime rules for the regular season with the approach for the playoffs. However, that change was made “subject to a 10-minute overtime period in the regular season.”\n\nMeaning regular season games could still end in ties, unlike postseason games.\n\nLessons learned from Super Bowl LVIII seemed to come into play during overtime periods in the regular season. One example comes from when the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys went to overtime back in September. Green Bay won the coin toss ahead of overtime but elected to kick, since they were now guaranteed a possession even if Dallas scored a touchdown.\n\nGreen Bay held Dallas to a field goal, giving the Packers a chance to win the game with a touchdown. But when their drive stalled deep in Cowboys’ territory, Green Bay was forced to settle for a game-tying field goal.\n\nOther example from this past regular season indicate that teams will defer in overtime under the new rules. In October the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams went to overtime, with Los Angeles winning the coin toss. Sean McVay and the Rams chose to kick, giving the 49ers possession first.\n\nSan Francisco settled for a field goal, but the Rams were stopped on 4th-and-1 to end the game.\n\nIn November the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons went to overtime, with Carolina winning the toss. Quarterback Bryce Young declared “we want to kick that way,” which was incorrectly granted by the referee. A team can choose to kick, or which end zone to defend, but they cannot choose both.\n\nBut the Panthers indeed started on defense, forced a punt, and then kicked a game-winning field goal on the next drive.\n\nOne scenario that has not been tested yet? The impact of the two-point conversion. After Super Bowl LVIII Kansas City indicated that if necessary, they would have gone for two at the end of their possession to try and win, rather than kick an extra point and extend the game to a third overtime possession.\n\nShould overtime arise in this year’s playoffs, will the two-point conversion come into play?\n\nI guess we will have to wait to find out.",

    "fullText": "Kamaru Usman has publicly addressed the backlash after a private conversation with British boxer Anthony Joshua was accidentally shared online, calling the experience “heartbreaking” and taking full responsibility for the error.\n\nThe former UFC welterweight champion explained what happened and offered a candid response on social media as the situation drew widespread attention across the MMA and boxing communities.\n\nThe video, which included a private FaceTime call between Usman and Joshua, surfaced in a behind-the-scenes clip from preparations for The AKO Show in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nIt quickly spread online, prompting reactions from fans and pundits as the intimate moment was not intended for public view. The leak occurred at a sensitive time, as Joshua was still recovering after a serious car crash that claimed the lives of two of his closest friends.\n\nUsman addressed the incident on his official social media account, writing: “After seeing what’s being written it’s quite heartbreaking. Being on camera that whole day in preparation for The AKO show, it completely slipped my mind that my conversation was recorded.\n\n“I realized after and asked about it. I take full responsibility for not properly watching the video that was released and keeping my private conversation with my brother, AJ private. SMH big L on me. That’s not something I would ever do to a friend/ brother.”\n\nThe former UFC welterweight champion made it clear that the shared footage was not intentional and that he regretted the oversight.\n\nUsman acknowledged that he should have reviewed the video more carefully before it was posted, and stressed that he would never knowingly violate the trust of a close friend or associate.\n\nHis statement sought to address both the mistake and the feelings surrounding it, rather than offer a simple apology without context.\n\nThe public reaction to the leaked video was mixed. Some fans criticised Usman, believing that private conversations should be protected, especially during emotionally vulnerable moments.\n\nOthers took a more measured stance, suggesting the leak may have been an unintentional error in the editing and posting process, rather than a deliberate decision to expose Joshua’s personal moments.\n\nDespite the differing opinions, Usman’s willingness to address the situation directly on social media was seen by many as a responsible move.\n\nFormer champions and commentators have highlighted the importance of confidentiality and respect among fighters, both in and out of competition.\n\nWhile this incident brought unexpected scrutiny, his response demonstrates an understanding of the responsibilities that come with his status, and a commitment to maintaining trust in his personal and professional relationships.",

This is the first time since 2008 that the Titans have had two members named first-team All-Pro. Simmons, who has always been a dominant force on the defensive line, took his game to another level this year. He lost a bunch of weight in the offseason and was much quicker this season.\n\nSimmons finished the season with a career high 11 sacks in just 15 games. The Titans have a lot to do this offseason, but somewhere near the top of the list should be signing Simmons to a contract extension. He also took a big step forward as a leader this season.\n\nDike led the league with 2,379 all-purpose yards this season, which was the most in NFL history for a rookie. He also returned two punts for touchdowns. Mike Borgonzi found a steal when he selected Dike in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft.",

    "title": "Future Broncos: Pathways to approach the 2026 NFL Draft",
    "description": "The Denver Broncos have a quality roster which gives them ultimate flexibility in approaching the 2026 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos finished their 2025 regular season with a 14-3 record, an AFC West title, and a first-round bye. Today, six members of the team were announced to have earned All-Pro honors. It’s been a long time since the Broncos have had a roster this strong. A big tip of the cap to Head Coach Sean Payton, General Manager George Paton, and the pro and collegiate scouts for helping reforge this roster in relatively short order despite significant limitations due to the implications of the failed Russell Wilson era.\n\nWith second-year signal caller Bo Nix on a rookie contract, ample cap space with the ability to create more, and at least five picks in the top four rounds, the Broncos certainly have great flexibility in how they approach the 2026 NFL Draft. However, what the Broncos eventually do come late April will be highly dependent on what happens in free agency.\n\nAs of now, several defensive starters or players who earned meaningful snap time are scheduled to be unrestricted free agents. Alex Singleton and Justin Strnad at inside linebacker, John Franklin-Myers at defensive end, and safety P.J. Locke. Another significant contributor, standout nickelback Ja’Quan McMillian, is scheduled to be a restricted free agent. I’d expect the Broncos to tender him at least at a second-round level which would give him a big pay raise next season.\n\nAdditional #Broncos to get All-Pro votes:\n\nFB Adam Prentice\nWR Courtland Sutton\nLG Alex Palczewski\nRT Mike McGlinchey\nOLB Nik Bonitto\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian\nPR Marvin Mims Jr.\nLS Mitchell Fraboni\n\n— Aric DiLalla (@AricDiLalla) January 10, 2026\n\nIf Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph winds up being hired for one of the head coaching positions available, it’s safe to say there could be some big roster changes pending who the new defensive coordinator would be. I’d assume that would be Assistant Head Coach and Passing Game Coordinator Jim Leonhard, who is widely regarded as a rising star in the coaching community.\n\nKeeping him in the fold would likely allow for a smoother transition, opting to keep a lot of the same verbiage in place, but adding some more of his unique wrinkles and personalities into the mix defensively. Given the above, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Broncos once again opt to utilize their first-round selection on the defensive side of the ball. Inside linebacker, unless they sign someone in free agency, seems like the easiest position on the roster where you could find a quality return on investment and immediate impact from a draft prospect.\n\nFor those of you who have followed Future Broncos segments this year—you all know it’s one of the better off-ball linebacker classes in ages. The Ohio State duo of Arvell Reese and Sonny Styles played tremendously this season and will likely both be Top 15 selections. Though Texas standout Anthony Hill Jr. and Georgia star CJ Allen would very well be in play for the Broncos where they are currently slated to pick. Either of those two would be phenomenal selections that would definitely brighten Denver’s long-term future at the position.\n\nTexas LB Anthony Hill Jr. will enter the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHill is a projected day 2 draft pick. pic.twitter.com/x6pxGkoluW\n\n— Dane Brugler (@dpbrugler) December 8, 2025\n\nThe Broncos will pick no earlier than 25th overall pending a move up the boards in April. If Joseph is hired by another team as I discussed above, that would give the Broncos a third-round compensatory selection and six selections in the top 150 selections. That’s a lot of draft capital to round out the roster and address future needs.\n\nI’d expect the Broncos to continue their trend of focusing on the trenches. It’s been a premium point of investment since Payton was hired. Garett Bolles and Mike McGlinchey played great this season, but they aren’t getting any younger and it’s been ages since Denver has opted to invest in drafting a tackle. With extra early round selections, I would like to see that finally happen. If Franklin-Myers walks in free agency, finding another defensive end might be wise. Though I’ll say I’ve been impressed with Eyioma Uwazurike this season and think platooning him and Sai’vion Jones next year to replace Myers wouldn’t be a bad idea.\n\nDon’t be surprised to see Denver also add some depth to their secondary. At safety, Brandon Jones and J.L. Skinner will be in the final years of their contracts in ‘26. Additionally, Riley Moss and the aforementioned McMillian will be scheduled to hit free agency after next season as well. Part of the reason Jahdae Barron was selected last season was planning ahead, but the Broncos should be diligent finding another prospect with starting potential on the backend of their defense.\n\nAnd of course, the Broncos’ offense could always use more playmakers. Whether it’s running back, tight end, or wide receiver—raising the floor and long-term prospects of all those position groups would be wise. With extra picks on hand, finding a way to surround Nix with more talent would be a smart call.\n\nWhat do you think, Broncos Country? Do you have an early philosophy for Denver’s 2026 NFL Draft approach? Are there any particular players you are banging the table for with their first-round pick? Sound off in the comments and let me know.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League has a habit of calling its own back. For Conor Gallagher, that call may arrive just 18 months after he left Chelsea for Atletico Madrid. According to reporting credited to talkSPORT, Aston Villa are exploring a deal to bring the midfielder back to England, potentially on loan with an obligation to buy. It feels like one of those stories shaped as much by timing as by tactics.\n\nGallagher is 25, soon to be 26, experienced but still with something to prove. Villa, meanwhile, are a club pushing against their own ceiling, chasing Champions League football and silverware under Unai Emery. That alignment matters.\n\nEmery’s long standing interest in Gallagher is key. He “has been keen to sign Gallagher since he was at Chelsea”, a line that hints at continuity of thought rather than opportunism. Villa’s season has not been without bumps, including a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal, yet they remain six points off the leaders and firmly in multiple competitions.\n\nThe FA Cup looms as a genuine opportunity. Villa reached the semi finals last year, losing to Crystal Palace, and Emery knows how thin the margins are. Gallagher’s versatility, energy and Premier League grounding could help Villa sustain challenges on several fronts, including the Europa League, where they are among the favourites.\n\nGallagher’s time in Spain has hardly been a misstep. Since joining Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2024, he has played 51 La Liga games and made 27 appearances in all competitions this season alone. Life under Diego Simeone has clearly resonated.\n\nHe told the FA’s website, “It was amazing, a really good experience. It was a really warm welcome, and it made me feel at home straight away.” On Simeone, he added, “He wants everyone to work as hard as possible… He is one of the best managers in the world.”\n\nYet international football complicates the picture. Gallagher “would welcome a return to England to help his hopes of forcing his way into Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup squad”. Since Tuchel’s arrival, his England involvement has been limited to a 3-1 defeat to Senegal, while Elliot Anderson has surged into contention. Proximity matters, and Premier League visibility still counts.\n\nManchester United’s reported interest feels theoretical for now, given their managerial uncertainty following Ruben Amorim’s exit. Villa, by contrast, offer clarity. Gallagher is not surplus at Atletico, Simeone values him, but football careers often hinge on moments like this.\n\nA return would not diminish his Spanish education. Instead, it could sharpen his relevance at exactly the right time.\n\nFrom an Aston Villa supporter’s perspective, this link makes a lot of sense, even if it comes with understandable nerves. Gallagher feels like an Emery player in spirit. High intensity, tactically disciplined, comfortable pressing and recovering, but also capable of arriving late into the box. Villa have built their rise on structure and energy, and Gallagher fits that profile neatly.\n\nThere is also a sense of maturity about this potential move. This is not a reclamation project or a gamble on potential. Gallagher has 136 Premier League appearances behind him, plus European and La Liga experience. For a squad juggling league ambition, Europa League nights and domestic cups, depth with reliability matters.\n\nSupporters might worry about disrupting midfield balance, especially if the deal carries an obligation to buy. But Emery has shown he can integrate profiles intelligently, rotating without diluting standards. Gallagher’s hunger to re enter the England picture could even work in Villa’s favour, driving performance levels higher.\n\nUltimately, Villa fans want players who see the club as a destination, not a stepping stone. Gallagher’s decision, if it comes, will say a lot about how far Villa believe they have travelled, and how far they still intend to go.",

    "fullText": "France has decided to delay this year’s Group of 7 Summit in order to avoid a scheduling conflict with UFC’s upcoming White House event on June 14, which will also be President Donald Trump’s 80th birthday.\n\nWhile UFC fans are excited for 2026 as a whole as the promotion moves from ESPN to Paramount+, a lot of discussion has revolved around the upcoming UFC fight card on the White House lawn this summer. After all, it’s turning out to be a once-in-a-lifetime event full of incredible spectacles, UFC champions, and world-class guests.\n\nThe event is expected to garner such attention and attract dignitaries from around the world that France isn’t willing to go head-to-head with UFC on Trump’s birthday. Can you blame them?\n\n🚨 France is delaying this year’s G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event on June 14 👀\n\n(via @politico) pic.twitter.com/0XXqSHM8IS\n\n— Championship Rounds (@ChampRDS) January 9, 2026\n\nAccording to a recent report by news outlet Politico, France will move its annual G7 Summit — which seven major industrial countries discuss key global policy issues — from June 14-16 to June 15-17. This clears the way for UFC’s White House card and Trump’s birthday bash on June 14. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office declined to confirm that the rescheduling is directly related to the UFC event and said the change of date is “the result of our consultations with G7 partners.”\n\nWhen asked about the G7 Summit delay a White House official told Politico: “As the leader of the free world, our partners believed that President Trump’s attendance at the G7 Summit was essential. They kindly shifted dates to accommodate the U.S. president’s schedule.”\n\nDana White reshares the news that France has delayed the 2026 G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event. 😅 pic.twitter.com/xKiSKRSgx3\n\n— MMA Orbit (@mma_orbit) January 9, 2026\n\nFor more UFC White House 2026 news and coverage click HERE.",

    "title": "The Story Behind WWE's Supermarket Brawl Between Stone Cold Steve Austin & Booker T",
    "description": "In late 2001, WWE stars \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin and Booker T took part in a brawl filmed at a supermarket, creating an unforgettable segment.",
    "fullText": "From the moment Booker T made his 2001 WWE debut, he was at odds with \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. Though their feud never resulted in the pay-per-view blow-off that it deserved, it did lead to one of the promotion's most off-the-wall segments: the \"Supermarket Brawl.\"\n\nTaking place months into their rivalry, after Booker had not only interfered in several of Austin's matches but also stole his truck, Austin decided he would attack Booker on sight wherever he could find him. As it turned out, that included the grocery store.\n\nThe segment began with WWE cameras capturing Booker's trip to a genuine supermarket in California. As Booker shops, a voice comes over the store intercom that sounds suspiciously like Austin, and Booker takes notice. After attacking a random bald man that he mistakes for Austin, Booker is ambushed from behind by Austin, alerted just seconds before by the sound of his rival cracking open a can of beer.\n\nWhat ensues is roughly six minutes of absolute chaos inside the grocery store. Highlights include Austin tossing Booker into a display of oranges as Jerry Lawler cries out in dismay on commentary, and Booker getting doused with mustard before Austin pours various baskets and bowls of nuts on top of him.\n\nThe one-sided action continues into the storage area, as Austin pelts Booker with eggs. Finally, Booker is able to counter Austin with a kick and he takes control, successfully tossing Austin into the milk cooler. Unfortunately for Booker, Austin climbs out through the milk cartons, treats himself to a half-gallon, and continues the beatdown. The segment ends with Austin leaving Booker in a heap at the cash register as police sirens signal that it's time for him to leave.\n\nMore than 20 years later, the segment is still fondly-remembered. Booker has spoken at length about the brawl, including in a 2024 interview with former WWE star Maven Huffman. Logically, Booker and Austin only had one shot at filming, and they were largely allowed to do whatever they wanted in the store. The two knew how things were going to go until Austin attacked Booker, and nearly everything from that point on was improvised.\n\n\"I give Steve Austin a lot of credit, just because he was able to go out there ... and have that innate ability to be able to work on the fly,\" Booker said. \"All that stuff was ad-libbed. We had no script at all, you know what I mean? The pizzeria song he was singing – I was like, 'Where do you get this stuff from?'\"\n\nThe wrestler confirmed that some of the grocery store shoppers who watched the brawl were locals that were allowed to watch the filming, while others were \"plants\" who were meant to fulfill a certain role. As for the fact that Austin got nearly all of the offense in the segment, Booker doesn't have a problem with it, noting that the brawl was meant to be the moment that Austin finally got his revenge after many weeks of torment.\n\n\"One thing about this business, man – I look at myself right there and I say, 'This is the position in professional wrestling that, if you don't find yourself in one time, you haven't been in professional wrestling,'\" Booker stated. \"This is the embodiment, for me, as far as professional wrestling goes, because it is to be embellished to whatever we want it to be for our fans.\"\n\nTo this day, Booker said fans come up to him to share that this is their favorite match of his, only for the WWE star to remind them that it wasn't a match at all.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Newcastle United have been offered the chance to complete a transfer for Celta Vigo defender Oscar Mingueza, according to a report by Daily Mail’s Simon Jones.\n\nJones reported that Newcastle are among the clubs informed of Mingueza’s availability as his contract nears its end next summer, with Celta looking for a lower-money fee now instead of losing him for nothing in July.\n\n“Newcastle United have been offered the chance to sign Celta Vigo defender Oscar Mingueza,” Jones wrote. “The 26-year-old can play at centre-back and full-back and is out of contract in the summer. His club are pushing for an £8m fee this window and he has also been proposed to Aston Villa and West Ham.”\n\nOn Friday, Spanish outlet Estadio Deportivo already reported Celta’s plans to sell now, and the Spanish club’s memo was sent to Olympique de Marseille, Aston Villa, West Ham, Newcastle, Atalanta, Milan, and Como as part of their plan to foster a deal.\n\nMingueza joined Celta from Barcelona on a free transfer in July 2022 and has since rebuilt his reputation in La Liga. He has made more than 100 appearances for the Galician club, contributing seven goals and 12 assists, while operating across the back line.\n\nThe defender comes as a versatile one, as he can be used at both full-back roles as well as in the middle of the line.\n\nFrom Newcastle’s perspective, Mingueza’s profile fits with their broader market approach and strategy under Eddie Howe.\n\nThe Magpies, on top of everything, are light in defensive depth due to injuries and have some uncertainty around longer-term plans on the flanks of the defensive line, with Kieran Trippier now in his mid-30s and his future beyond next season unclear.\n\nA short-term deal for a player entering the final months of his contract, like Mingueza is, at a relatively modest fee, would also align with Newcastle’s stated desire to be opportunistic rather than commit to major spending.",

    "fullText": "Alex Cora sends six-word message to Alex Bregman amid Red Sox pursuit originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox may not have signed any outside free agents this winter, but they've made a couple of trades with the St. Louis Cardinals and old friend Chaim Bloom, and have one free agent they're courting.\n\nThat player is, unsurprisingly, Alex Bregman. But this has been a very slow winter for the top free agents, Bregman included. There's an offer on the table from the Red Sox, and time will tell if Bregman is coming back or not.\n\nTim Healey of The Boston Globe shared Alex Cora's comments on the Bregman free agent process. Cora shared a six-word message that now puts the onus on Bregman to make a decision.\n\n\"The ball is in his court,\" Cora said of Bregman. The free agent third baseman likely has a few offers on the table, but as of now, the Red Sox are waiting for his decision.\n\nBregman is still a free agent, and while there are some clubs likely interested in him, his return to the Red Sox seems to be the most likely outcome.\n\nWith the Philadelphia Phillies emerging as serious contenders for Bo Bichette, Ketel Marte being taken off the trade block, Kyle Tucker continuing to be strongly linked to the Toronto Blue Jays, and Cody Bellinger and the New York Yankees in discussions, Bregman coming back to Boston has a strong chance of happening.\n\nMore: Tigers urged to sign 1 or 2 future Hall of Famers for Detroit reunion\n\nBut, as Cora mentions, it's now on Bregman to decide what he wants to do this offseason. He could accept the Red Sox's deal, return to Boston, or try looking for more money elsewhere.\n\nWhile the All-Star third baseman is one of the more coveted names this offseason, a lot of the potential options have dissipated due to other signings or trends in recent weeks.\n\nFor now, Cora and the rest of the Red Sox organization will have to wait for Bregman's decision. They don't need to bump up their offer, which, as Cora put it, puts the ball in Bremgan's court this offseason.\n\nRoyals predicted as dark-horse landing spot for .814 OPS free agent from Yankees\n\nNo one is talking about this team as a sleeper in Cody Bellinger's free agency market\n\nGiants linked to 296-HR free agent slugger as potential signing\n\nDiamondbacks get good news on signing Paul Goldschmidt in free agency\n\nPhillies have 3 teams competing for J.T.

    "title": "Kyle Dake welcomes ‘any UFC guy’ to challenge him in RAF, details long-awaited rematch against Olympic rival",
    "description": "Kyle Dake faces Mahamedkhabib Kadimagomedov at RAF 5 in a rematch from their first encounter at the 2020 Olympics",
    "fullText": "Kyle Dake is one of the most accomplished American wrestlers in history but even at 34 with multiple Olympic medals, World Championships and NCAA titles on his resume, he’s still looking to challenge himself.\n\nOn Saturday at RAF 5 in Florida, Dake actually has a chance to right a past wrong when he faces Mahamedkhabib Kadimagomedov, who defeated him in a stunning 11-0 upset at the 2020 Olympics. Favored to win the gold medal, Dake suffered a tech fall loss but rebounded to claim bronze, although he never forgot about that match with Kadimagomedov and thanks to Real American Freestyle, he’s getting another shot at him.\n\n“So I wrestled ‘Kadik’ in 2021,” Dake said about the original match that happened at the Olympics. “I wrestled, I didn’t really train for the week leading up to it. I was just cutting weight. Because I couldn’t. I was on a bike all week just trying to get down in weight because I was injured. That’s no excuse. You go out and compete with what you have. Nobody cares how you’re feeling. I went out and I competed and I lost but I came back and got the next best thing the next day and got a bronze medal and I’m very proud of that. But a few weeks later, I won the World Championships and he wasn’t there. The next year he was there, I won and he didn’t place. The next year, I was there I made the finals and he didn’t place. The Olympics in Paris, I took bronze, he didn’t place. So we just didn’t run into each other. I’ve been looking for that match for a long time.\n\n“At the Olympics in Paris on the second day we were actually sitting in the sauna together and I asked him what his plans were and what he planned on doing and he said he wanted to keep wrestling and continue. I knew I was probably not going to go 74 kilos again just because it was a hard weight cut for me. As I get older, just not as quick to recover and a two-hour weigh-in is pretty tricky. I told him that I was probably going to go up to 86 [kilos] and he said ‘I’m probably going to go up to 86, too.’ We didn’t hit in any other tournaments but now we have this opportunity to actually compete. We are guaranteed this match. We know this match is going to happen and I’m really excited for it.”\n\nAfter he took silver at the Olympics, Kadimagomedov actually signed with Bellator MMA with the intention to fight but nearly three years later, he’s never actually set foot in the cage. Instead, he’s gone back to wrestling where he recently scored a win in RAF, which set up the rematch with Dake on Saturday.\n\nOf course, Dake understands that losses are part of the sport so he’s not holding onto any undue animosity from his previous encounter with Kadimagomedov but he’s still looking to show that he’s a much better wrestler than when he fell in such shocking fashion.\n\n“I don’t know that it’s a revenge match for me,” Dake explained. “I just love to compete and it’s a chance to compete against another cool opponent. But it’s still meaningful. Every time I step out on the mat, it’s meaningful. Because I want to put my best foot forward. I want to be the guy who can always go out and compete their best and no matter the circumstance.\n\n“I’ve been thinking about the match for a while. It would be really cool now we have the ability to make these matchups to get some of these guys. He was definitely at the top of the list of somebody I wanted to compete against. Obviously, I’m really thankful to have the ability to compete and just have all the blessings that I do. It’s really exciting.”\n\nDake praised RAF for giving wrestlers the ability to compete in these kinds of matches because circumstances and timing just never allowed for him to cross paths with Kadimagomedov again until now.\n\nWhile he’s usually waiting months between tournaments on the international wrestling circuit, Dake appreciates that RAF is keeping him busier and presenting him with these kinds of unique opportunities.\n\n“Normally you take eight weeks between matches and now we have like three or four weeks,” Dake said. “When we were high school, we were wrestling every weekend. When we were in college we were wrestling every weekend or every two weekends. Now Real American Freestyle allows you to do that so I’m really thankful that I have those opportunities. Because of those opportunities, I feel like I’m even sharper than I have been.”\n\nIf he gets through Kadimagomedov at RAF 5, Dake knows there’s no shortage of potential opponents he could face next including fellow American wrestler Zahid Valencia, who beat him in back-to-back matches to punch his ticket to the 2025 World Championships.\n\nThere’s also the intrigue about possibly facing a UFC fighter interested in wrestling just like the RAF 5 main event with Colby Covington facing Luke Rockhold or former champion Belal Muhammad taking his shot on the mats at RAF 4.\n\nSeveral years ago, Dake actually proposed a grappling match with then UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov but nothing ever came to fruition.\n\nDake loves the idea of running that back now or welcoming any other top notch UFC fighter who might want to see how they’d do against a wrestler of his caliber. So far, the vast majority of UFC veterans competing in RAF haven’t found much success but Dake is keeping the door open that somebody might step up to the challenge.\n\n“That’s a lot of fun,” Dake said. “You get these guys who transition from wrestling or grappling early in their career to go into MMA. There’s always these ‘what ifs?’ Oh if so and so would have stuck with this, how great would they be? If they just continued down this path, they’d be an Olympic champion. Well let’s see. Let’s see where they’re at. If they can compete, let’s go.\n\n“I would love to compete against any of those guys. I’m willing to compete against anybody. So if there’s any UFC guy that wants to throw their hat in the ring, let’s do it. I’m all for it.”\n\nThe inclusion of UFC veterans in RAF also helps build anticipation for the entire sport of wrestling and Dake knows how much that helps other athletes attempting to get attention away from the Olympics, World Championships or other international tournaments that just don’t attract as much attention.\n\n“It brings more notoriety to the sport,” Dake said. “People are like oh, Colby Covington’s wrestling. Arman Tsarukyan’s wrestling. Luke Rockhold is wrestling. Yoel Romero is wrestling. I know them from fighting. I didn’t know them from their past [in wrestling].\n\n“Unless you’re a super fan but if you’re just a casual fan, you’re like I know these names and I want to watch them compete but I also get to watch a person like Kennedy Blades, I get to watch Kyle Dake, I get to watch Wyatt Hendrickson. I get to watch all these people and see who they are.”",

    "description": "GM needs to be chief decision maker and not defer to the next head coach",
    "fullText": "Minority owner Tom Brady and general manager John Spytek are the duo tabbed to lead the Las Vegas Raiders into a new era this offseason.\n\nBrady has the name recognition being dubbed the GOAT quarterback with his on-field accolades and as a well-paid color commentator/analyst for Fox Sports. Spytek is the fledgling general manager that brings promise but just completed a rocky 2025 campaign.\n\nBut as mentioned above with Brady: He’s entrenched as a an analyst and on TV.\n\nAnd that renders him an occasional presence at team HQ in Henderson and on the sideline at Allegiant Stadium. Unlike owner Mark Davis who, through the misery and fleeting success, remains a constant presence.\n\nWhich makes it time for Spytek to lead as the Silver & Blacks GM. Spytek is the day-to-day presence all-thing Raider. And when he and Brady decide on the next head coach, it’ll be the general manager working side-by-side with the newly hired head man. Even if Spytek is a conduit for Brady, it’s the former that will have constant communication with the selected head coach.\n\nRaiders owner Mark Davis says GM John Spytek, minority owner Tom Brady to lead head coaching search after Pete Carroll sackedhttps://t.co/9YFJ9S5GXe pic.twitter.com/4BcoI50HL0\n\n— Around The NFL (@AroundTheNFL) January 5, 2026\n\nBut Spytek wasn’t shy about stating the connection he has with Brady and noted that while the minority owner isn’t a daily attendee, the two do indeed talk on a consistent basis.\n\n“I know you’re kind of on this. I talk to him a lot. He’s aware of what we’re doing. I don’t bore him with the mundane transactions or all that, but any big decision, I’ve talked to him about,” Spytek said during his season-ending press conference this past Monday. “Any vision, I’ve talked to him about. He’s a great resource for me. He’s a great partner in this for me. I would be not doing a good job and be a fool if I didn’t talk to him. He’s been supportive of me. He can’t be here every day right now, but I promise you I talk to him a lot, and he and I are on the same page.”\n\nBeing on the same page is mission critical. Las Vegas appeared to have several points of contention this past season that culminated in a 3-14 overall record — but the No. 1 overall pick. And it’s those two key decisions: The eventual head coach and top pick in the April’s draft which make it vital for Spytek to be the boots-on-the-ground decision maker. While Brady is slated to have his influence alongside and through Spytek, the future hall of fame quarterback’s day job eats a lot of his availability. And it’s the lack of bandwidth which puts a spotlight on the 45-year-old general manager.\n\nInside #Raiders 2025 lost season: How things fell apart under Pete Carroll, Tom Brady's influence and a cycle of dysfunction in one of the worst years in franchise history. https://t.co/LhDSY1ahsz\n\n— Ryan McFadden (@ryanmcfadden_) January 6, 2026\n\nThe Raiders are embarking on their head coach search and hire. The team reportedly interviewed Denver Broncos quarterback coach Davis Webb and defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, and former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski. Expect more names on tap as the offseason and playoffs continue.\n\nLas Vegas search will likely be deliberate and take its time. And, despite dysfunction and haphazard track record, the Raiders do have assets that should be attractive for prospective coaching candidates. Namely the top pick along with 10 other selections, significant cap space (over $100 million projected), and core talent in defensive end Maxx Crosby, left tackle Kolton Miller, tight end Brock Bowers, and running ack Ashton Jeanty.\n\nOnce a new coach is hired, the team will pivot to who will be taken No. 1 overall and, in parallel, see if any other team is offering a bounty to move into that slot and trade key assets. Considering the Raiders got a lackluster season out of Geno Smith after acquiring the veteran quarterback via trade and Indiana signal caller Fernando Mendoza is lighting up the College Football Playoffs, there’s a notion the Silver & Black aren’t going to deal the top pick and take the Hoosier QB.\n\nSpytek laid out a shared vision he and Brady have putting the Raiders together from here on in.\n\n“Well, it’s about team before self. It’s about discipline. It’s about accountability. It’s about work ethic. Winning is fun, but it comes at a price, and it is required every day, otherwise this league is far too competitive,” the general manager explained. “And he’s felt it, I’ve felt it. You can feel like you’re close, but if you’re off by a couple different things, you can end up at three and 14, and we’ve got to put a process and a system in place that demands the best of our players, of our coaches, of our entire football operations, and really the entire building every day.\n\n“And I’ve been here a year now, I’ve got to know MD (Mark Davis), ownership. I know what the expectations are. I’ve got to know the building, I think, really well, and we’ve got a plan in place, and we’re going to start working on it, and the goal is constant, meticulous improvement so that this organization and the Raider Nation can be proud when they walk into Allegiant Stadium.”\n\n#Raiders GM John Spytek asked if Maxx Crosby is untradeable, says Crosby “didn’t love the idea” not playing the last 2 weeks. “I love Maxx. He embodies what a Raider is. I’ve been pretty up front with that from the day I sat up here a year ago and I continue to believe that.” pic.twitter.com/wxRkx2RjSY\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) January 5, 2026\n\nBrady will have his influence from afar. And until he’s there day-to-day — former quarterback and CBS Sports analyst Matt Ryan quit his role as a broadcaster to become the new Atlanta Falcons president of football on Saturday, for example — the Raiders minority owner appears more as resource or sounding board. Which brings us back to Spytek.\n\nHe and the head coach will be making key decisions, be the face that runs the place, and have the face-to-face contact and interactions not only with each other, but everyone else involved from executives, coaches, and players.\n\nSpytek hit nail on head during his media session this past Monday about being realistic. He doesn’t expect the new coach to come in like gangbusters and win 10 games out of the gate in 2026 — although that’d be nice and other teams have done it. This is a ground-up rebuild in Las Vegas and tempered expectations are a must.\n\nHence why the focus should be on Spytek, who’ll revolve around everything Raider on the ground. Not Brady who is being pulled in multiple directions.",

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers are roughly 28 hours away from their playoff game against the Philadelphia Eagles. On Saturday, there are a pair of NFC games in the Wild Card round. Let’s walk through how the Divisional Round would look based on Saturday’s results if the Niners can pull off the upset this weekend.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams played their starters in Week 18 after Sean McVay felt like his team needed to play better. They travel east to take on the Carolina Panthers. This game is a rematch from Week 13, when the Panthers shocked the Rams at home 31-28.\n\nThe Rams only had five third downs in that game, outgained the Panthers, made the red zone six times, but turned it over three times. Carolina went 3-for-3 on fourth downs, hit all their big plays, and that was the difference.\n\nThis time around, it feels like the Rams have a better chance of winning by three possessions than losing. With that said, the Rams leave a lot to be desired defensively.\n\nThe night game will be the third meeting between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers. Both teams split their games over three weeks. The Packers won by a touchdown in the first matchup after having a 14-3 lead at halftime. There were 652 combined yards in that game. Chicago won the rematch 22-16 after recovering an onside kick to send it to overtime. There were 784 yards in that game.\n\nThis time around, it feels like the Packers won’t be on the wrong side of an onside kick, lose their quarterback, and come away victorious. With that in mind, Caleb Williams is streaky, and the Packers’ run defense is leaky.\n\nThe following scenarios all assume a 49ers win on Sunday.\n\nIf the Packers and Rams both win, the Niners would travel to SoFi next weekend to face Los Angeles.\n\nA Green Bay win and a Panthers upset would take San Francisco to Carolina in the Divisional round.\n\nThe Bears winning, along with the Rams, means we’d have a Week 1 rematch with the 49ers heading north to take on the Seahawks.\n\nIf both home teams win on Saturday, the Niners are still destined for a trip to Seattle.\n\nThere are no outcomes in the Wild Card round that would lead to the 49ers playing Chicago in the Divisional round.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal’s January transfer window is expected to be a quiet one, but they could still benefit financially from a deal made in the past.\n\nThe Gunners have shown interest in Marc Guehi, but beyond that, there’s little expectation of any major activity this month.\n\nAndrea Berta will still be monitoring the market and won’t hesitate to move if an opportunity comes up – whether it’s bringing someone in or letting someone go.\n\nBut while Berta is currently managing things, it’s actually a move made by his predecessor Edu Gaspar that could end up providing Arsenal with an unexpected financial boost.\n\nNuno Tavares isn’t exactly remembered fondly by many Arsenal supporters.\n\nThe left-back never really found his footing at the Emirates. After a loan spell at Lazio under Edu, he moved there permanently in the summer of 2025, just as Andrea Berta was coming in.\n\nAccording to Alfredo Pedulla – quoting the Besiktas president – Tavares is expected to join the Turkish club in a deal worth around £15m. With a 35% sell-on clause included when he left for Lazio, Arsenal stand to pocket a significant sum from this move.\n\nBerta’s role includes improving Arsenal’s sales strategy as well as attracting new talent, and deals like this show how the club is working on building more sustainable income streams over time.\n\nTavares has been the source of frustration for fans in recent years, often cited as one of the club’s most disappointing signings.\n\nThe Portuguese left-back hasn’t found a consistent place in any squad yet and is only now looking at a permanent move that could help him finally settle.\n\nHe’s managed to play fairly regularly since leaving the Gunners, though it’s been inconsistent.\n\nHis best run came with Marseille, where he scored six goals in 39 appearances. But his loan spell at Nottingham Forest the following season didn’t go as well.\n\nOver the past year, he has made 40 appearances for Lazio, which helped pave the way for his potential move to Turkey.\n\nGiven Arsenal initially paid £7m for him and are now set to recoup another £5m just a year after his departure, it looks like they’ve come out of the deal reasonably well.",

    "fullText": "The NFL's Wild Card weekend is upon us, and the Eagles will host the No. 6 seed San Francisco 49ers on Sunday in the wild-card round, which could be their only home playoff game at Lincoln Financial Field unless other scenarios play out in the NFC.\n\nWhile the Eagles won't play until Sunday, all eyes in Philadelphia on Saturday will be on the FOX and Amazon Prime screens as key scenarios unfold, and a win on Sunday could put the Birds in position to host a divisional-round playoff game on January 17 or 18.\n\nWith kickoff just hours away in Carolina, we're looking at the wild card round rooting guide that can set Philadelphia up to play host in the divisional round with a win.\n\nThe No. 1-seeded Seahawks would host the lowest-seeded remaining opponent. If the highest seeds are victorious, the Panthers would travel to Seattle, while Philadelphia would travel to San Francisco. A Green Bay win over Chicago, and the Packers would travel to play the Seattle Seahawks, the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and the Eagles would play the winner of the Carolina Panthers (No. 4 seed) vs. Los Angeles Rams (No. 5 seed) game at home in the divisional round.\n\nIf the Rams defeat the Panthers and Eagles defeat the 49ers, Philadelphia would travel to Chicago, and Seattle would host Sean McVay's team. If the Eagles lose to San Francisco, Seattle would host the Niners if Chicago defeats the Packers.\n\nThe two teams previously met in Carolina on November 30, as Bryce Young completed 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards and three touchdowns — two of them coming on fourth down, including a go-ahead 43-yard score to rookie Tetairoa McMillan with 6:34 left — as the Carolina Panthers forced three Matthew Stafford turnovers to beat Los Angeles 31-28 to snap the Rams' six-game winning streak. A Bears win over Green Bay would put the Eagles in line to host the winner of this game. With all the offensive firepower in Los Angeles, and the Panthers just getting their playoff feet wet, we'll be cheering on the Panthers in the upset despite being the higher seed.\n\nRoot for Bryce Young and Carolina.\n\nThis will be the third meeting between the two teams, with the home team securing victories. While the hate for both organizations is strong, and the Birds aren't ducking any opponents, if the Eagles want to host another playoff game, they would need the No. 7 seed, the Green Bay Packers, to beat the Bears. A Green Bay win over Chicago, and the Packers would travel to play the Seattle Seahawks, the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and the Eagles would play the winner of the Carolina Panthers (No. 4 seed) vs. Los Angeles Rams (No. 5 seed) game at home in the divisional round.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Wild Card rooting guide: How Eagles can host a divisional round game",

They last played in the NFC Championship Game in January of 2021, losing to Tom Brady and the Buccaneers.\n\nAfter Rodgers left, LaFleur oversaw a quick turnaround of the roster and took the youngest roster in the NFL to the playoffs in each of the last three seasons. He has also helped nurture Jordan Love into one of the best quarterbacks in the league.\n\nTrading for Micah Parsons put Green Bay among the Super Bowl favorites entering 2025, but a slew of injuries, including an ACL tear for Parsons, contributed to a final stretch of the regular season in which the Packers lost their final four games, finishing 9-7-1 and as the NFC’s No. 7 seed.\n\nBut despite the disappointing end to the regular season, it does not seem as though a bad result on Saturday night will impact LaFleur’s standing with Policy, who was part of the process of hiring the head coach back in 2019.\n\nRapoport said Saturday that the team “likes LaFleur, respects him and believes he’s a great fit both in the organization and in the community” and that all being well, they hope he remains in place as head coach “for a long time.\"\n\nLaFleur’s reign has not been perfect and has not achieved the ultimate goal of bringing a title back to Titletown.\n\nBut it seems sensible thinking will prevail and based on his excellent track record of getting Green Bay in the dance, LaFleur will be backed by Policy with a new long-term contract and given the chance to eventually get the Packers over the hump.\n\nFrom @NFLGameDay Morning: #Packers coach Matt LaFleur is not coaching for his job. The latest on LaFleur’s future, plus how the #Rams avoided any drama with Matthew Stafford this offseason. pic.twitter.com/79HTZbRsTD\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 10, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Matt LaFleur 'not coaching for his job' vs. Bears per Ian Rapoport",

    "description": "I've had a Raspberry Pi Zero W for a few years and it's been a marvelous multi-purpose utility gadget. For...",
    "fullText": "I’ve had a Raspberry Pi Zero W for a few years and it’s been a marvelous multi-purpose utility gadget. For awhile, I was using it as a Pi-hole on my network, then it was later relegated to being a security camera. Awhile ago, it was finally replaced in that capacity. After having it sitting unused for a few months, I came across a YouTube video by “Lee” aka leepspvideo about using a Raspberry Pi as a “sidecar” for an iPad. While I don’t have a direct use at the moment, I thought I’d try it out and add a bit of capability to my iPad mini.\n\nUnlike remote access tools like VNC and SSH that access a Raspberry Pi from across your network, or tools like Orion that turn your iPad into an HDMI display for a Raspberry Pi, this method configures the Raspberry Pi in “gadget” mode, creating a private link that appears as a wired Ethernet connection over a USB cable. The Pi’s address will never change, either as it is also a DHCP server for the iPad. As an added bonus, the same cable powers the Pi, creating a setup as simple as plugging the Pi into your iPad and waiting for it to appear, rather than needing a network.\n\nI followed a mix of the instructions on the aforementioned YouTube video and the instructions from Ben Hardill (which was also the source material for the video.) First, I grabbed this build of Rapberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), used the Raspberry Pi Imager on my Mac and ended up setting things like enabling SSH and my user name ahead of time. From there, I threw the SD card in my Pi Zero W and started it up with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse attached.\n\nOnce started up and logged in to the Pi, I went down each of the bulleted items on Hardill’s instructions (these assume you have basic *nix skills—I used nano for editing the files):\n\nauto usb0\n\nallow-hotplug usb0\n\niface usb0 inet static\n\naddress 10.55.0.1\n\nnetmask 255.255.255.248\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/\n\nmkdir -p pi4\n\ncd pi4\n\necho 0x1d6b > idVendor # Linux Foundation\n\necho 0x0104 > idProduct # Multifunction Composite Gadget\n\necho 0x0100 > bcdDevice # v1.0.0\n\necho 0x0200 > bcdUSB # USB2\n\necho 0xEF > bDeviceClass\n\necho 0x02 > bDeviceSubClass\n\necho 0x01 > bDeviceProtocol\n\nmkdir -p strings/0x409\n\necho \"fedcba9876543211\" > strings/0x409/serialnumber\n\necho \"Ben Hardill\" > strings/0x409/manufacturer\n\necho \"PI4 USB Device\" > strings/0x409/product\n\nmkdir -p configs/c.1/strings/0x409\n\necho \"Config 1: ECM network\" > configs/c.1/strings/0x409/configuration\n\necho 250 > configs/c.1/MaxPower\n\n# Add functions here\n\n# see gadget configurations below\n\n# End functions\n\nmkdir -p functions/ecm.usb0\n\nHOST=\"00:dc:c8:f7:75:14\" # \"HostPC\"\n\nSELF=\"00:dd:dc:eb:6d:a1\" # \"BadUSB\"\n\necho $HOST > functions/ecm.usb0/host_addr\n\necho $SELF > functions/ecm.usb0/dev_addr\n\nln -s functions/ecm.usb0 configs/c.1/\n\nudevadm settle -t 5 || :\n\nls /sys/class/udc > UDC\n\nifup usb0\n\nservice dnsmasq restart\n\nMake /root/usb.sh executable with chmod +x /root/usb.sh\nAdd /root/usb.sh to /etc/rc.local before exit 0\n\nOnce completed, reboot your Raspberry Pi and double-check that everything is still working. If it is, connect it to your iPad—in the case of my Pi Zero W, I used the micro-USB port that was located closer to the mini-HDMI port (almost 1/3 across on the device) and this micro-USB-to-USB-C cable.\n\nAfter a minute or two, the iPad will display a new “Ethernet” option in the Settings app. This is actually the Raspberry Pi creating a wired network over the USB connection. As we set up DHCP on the Pi, it’s got the address of 10.55.0.1, while giving the iPad a lease in the 10.55.0.2-10.55.0.6 range (almost always you’d get 10.55.0.2.) If you have a network with 10.55.0.X, I’d recommend using a different range in the instructions above. From there, you can fire up your favorite SSH client and connect to 10.55.0.1, entering in the credentials you selected when creating the image or the default Raspberry Pi combination of raspberry/pi.\n\nFrom here, you can control the Pi just as you would if it were a separate device on your network—it won’t be able to get out to the internet unless you connect it to a Wi-Fi network (or wired if you have a standard Pi) as it is still operating as an independent device and the iPad is merely acting as a console for it. At that point, you have a full-blown Linux computer working in tandem with your iPad and the iPad acting as a directly-connected console that is also providing power.\n\nWhat if you want a full desktop environment? If you start with the full version of the Raspberry Pi OS instead, you can enable VNC and connect to the same 10.55.0.1. If you started with the lite version, running sudo apt install raspberrypi-ui-mods -y when your Pi is connected to the internet will download and install the GUI. Finally, you’ll have to install a VNC server—I used RealVNC by running sudo apt install realvnc-vnc-server realvnc-vnc-viewer. I’d recommend doing this with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse attached to the Pi, as it is much easier to get everything configured. After enabling VNC, I was able to open my VNC client of choice (although a good, free alternative exists) and after a few seconds, was navigating the Pi’s desktop on my iPad.\n\nAt this point, this is mostly a proof-of-concept for me with no real use case (sometimes you need to do that!) The Pi Zero W is severely underpowered and struggles to open a browser, but I could see doing this with a Pi 4, Pi 5, or Pi Zero W 2 and being able to have a “real” computer for those stubborn sites that I need a desktop browser for, mobile web development/testing, or just being able to do things from a secondary machine that “lives” within an app on my iPad. I’d guess that this configuration could also be good if you have a Pi that you may need to manage off-network without having to track down a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.\n\nAs so much of this is subject to change, I’d recommend treating this as an idea/starting point, but if you have a spare Raspberry Pi lying around and want to expand your iPad’s capabilities, it’s a fun little project.",

    "description": "See how vLLM’s throughput and latency compare to llama.cpp's and discover which tool is right for your specific deployment needs on enterprise-grade hardware",
    "fullText": "Following our previous analysis of Ollama and vLLM, we are extending our comparison to another giant in the inference space: llama.cpp. While vLLM is known for its Python-based, throughput-oriented architecture, llama.cpp is renowned for its lightweight C++ core, which promises exceptional efficiency.\n\nllama.cpp is a standout in the LLM ecosystem for its efficiency and portability. Written in pure C/C++ with no external dependencies, it offers plain-vanilla inference that can run on a wide range of hardware, from powerful servers and GPUs to edge devices like laptops and phones. Its CPU-first design philosophy and support for various quantization methods (from 2-bit to 8-bit integers) make it exceptionally versatile.\n\nA key feature of llama.cpp is its use of the GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format), a custom file format specifically designed for rapid loading and memory-mapped execution. This allows models to be loaded almost instantly and contributes significantly to the engine's fast startup times and low resource footprint, making it a favorite among developers running models on consumer-grade hardware.\n\nIn this post, we put these two high-performance engines to the test in a head-to-head benchmark to help you choose the right tool for your specific deployment needs on enterprise-grade hardware.\n\nTo ensure a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison, we created a controlled testing environment on Red Hat OpenShift, using full-precision models for both engines and using the latest generation of NVIDIA hardware.\n\nWe used a fixed dataset of prompt-response pairs to ensure that every request sent to both servers was identical. This eliminates variables from synthetic data generation and allows for a direct comparison of the engines themselves. Each test at a given concurrency level was run for 300 seconds.\n\nFor TTFT and ITL, we used P99 (99th percentile) as the measure. P99 means that 99% of requests had a TTFT/ITL at or below this value, making it a good measure of \"worst-case\" responsiveness.\n\nThis comparison evaluates the latest upstream versions of vLLM and llama.cpp. Recognizing that the default setting for llama.cpp is not intended for high-concurrency scenarios, we tuned its settings for our environment.\n\nTo ensure llama.cpp fully leveraged the available GPU hardware, we used the -ngl 99 flag to offload all possible model layers to the NVIDIA H200 GPU. Additionally, we used the --threads and --threads-batch flags to increase the number of threads available for prompt and batch processing. We empirically determined that a value of 64 for both was the stable limit for our llama.cpp deployment.\n\nThe difference in how the two engines handle a growing user load was immediate and stark. vLLM's throughput scales impressively as concurrency increases, demonstrating its ability to efficiently manage a high volume of requests. In contrast, llama.cpp's throughput remains almost perfectly flat, indicating it processes a steady but fixed amount of work, regardless of the incoming load. See Figure 1.\n\nThe bar chart for Output Tokens per Second (Figure 2) reinforces this finding. While llama.cpp shows comparable performance at a concurrency of 1, vLLM's total generative power quickly surpasses it and continues to grow with the load.\n\nConclusion: For multi-user applications where maximizing throughput and scalability is the goal, vLLM is the clear winner. At peak load, vLLM delivered more than 35 times the request throughput (RPS) and more than 44 times the total output tokens per second (TPS) compared to llama.cpp. llama.cpp's architecture is suited for single-user or low-concurrency tasks.\n\nThe latency metrics reveal the different architectural priorities of the two engines.\n\nThis benchmark comparison on the NVIDIA H200 GPU highlights that vLLM and llama.cpp are both excellent tools with different strengths.\n\nFor performance-critical applications on modern, enterprise-grade GPUs, vLLM demonstrates a clear advantage in our tests. It is a scalability powerhouse, leading in every performance category we measured—throughput, responsiveness, and single-request generation speed. For teams building scalable, high-performance AI applications, this data shows that vLLM is a powerful and robust foundation.",

    "fullText": "As you may already know, I love containers. I think they are truly a magical and amazing piece of technology because of the freedom and ease of use they afford. However, using containers (or Kubernetes) can add complexity to your workflow. When we stick our software in a container, we naturally add a bit of a barrier between our local development environment and the software we’re building, unless of course you’re using a Dev Container in which case things get pretty meta…but I digress.\n\nOne particular area where using containers or Kubernetes adds friction is in debugging workflows. That FastAPI app that you’re running with Docker Compose or Kubernetes? Yeah, the debugger isn’t going to just magically connect after configuring your launch.json file and running it in VS Code anymore. Maybe you’ve ended up setting up some kind of sidecar service to run your debugging in your cluster. Or, maybe you’ve added debugpy to your code, configured it to wait for connections, restarted your pod, set up port-forwarding, and hoped your app is still in the right state by the time you connect. Oh yeah, and throw a uvicorn --reload in there and…aaaaaaa. Setting all of that up is a true headache and honestly, pretty peripheral to the task at hand! You were just trying to debug that app you’re building anyway!\n\nSo, I built a tool that I’m calling debugwand - a zero-preparation remote debugger for Python applications running in Kubernetes clusters or Docker containers. With debugwand, there’s no sidecar pod, no application code changes, and virtually no setup required (okay, just a teeny tiny bit…it’s just configuration!).\n\nContainers hate to see me comin'\n\nHow, you might ask? This brings me to perhaps the single coolest feature in Python 3.14 that makes this all possible (okay, okay…I’m being dramatic – this is like picking a favourite child!): sys.remote_exec(). With sys.remote_exec(), we can execute a Python script inside another running process all without restarting it. The script runs with full access to the target’s memory, modules, and state, which is exactly what you need to start a debug server on-demand.\n\nWhen you run wand debug, the CLI goes out and:\n\nFinds your target - For Kubernetes, it discovers pods for your service (and handles Knative, because of course you’re using Knative). For Docker, you just point it at a container.\n\nPicks a process - It finds all the Python processes running in the pod/container with CPU and memory stats, so (tries to) choose the right one. Running uvicorn --reload? It’ll detect that automatically too (you can always override the choice if you want to debug a different process).\n\nInjects debugpy - Here’s where sys.remote_exec() does its thing. debugwand writes a small script that starts a debugpy server and injects it into your running process. No restart. No code changes. Your app keeps serving requests like nothing happened.\n\nSets up the connection - For Kubernetes, it handles port-forwarding automatically. For Docker, you just need to expose the port when you start the container.\n\nYou connect your editor - Point VS Code (or nvim, or whatever DAP client you like) at localhost:5679 (you can choose whatever port you’d like as well) and you’re debugging. Set breakpoints, inspect variables, step through code - the works.\n\nThe whole flow to get everything set up should only take a few minutes to configure things and then you should be off to the races! Pretty neat, huh?\n\nA quick note: This tool is experimental and intended for local development. Enabling SYS_PTRACE capabilities has security implications you’ll want to consider before using this anywhere near production (don’t do that!).\n\nWhile I built this primarily out of curiosity and for our workflow at work, you’re welcome to give this a shot! If you’re running Python 3.14, give it a spin by uv tool install debugwand (see PyPI here).\n\nAnd then you’re off to the races! Just start your debugger and set some breakpoints!",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nArchaeologists in Egypt discovered a full monastery covered by the desert, revealing daily life from the Byzantine era.\n\nThe monastery site featured a church, residential halls, and communal dining areas.\n\nArtifacts scattered across the monastic compound include storage containers designed to hold ancient writings.\n\nWhen archaeologists stripped away the desert sand in Upper Egypt’s Sohag province, they uncovered a Byzantine-era monastery, complete with a church, residential halls, communal dining spaces, and artifacts up to 1,400 years old.\n\nThe discovery wasn’t a one-off structure, but an entire integrated residential complex for monastic living, complete with a variety of mudbrick structures, according to a translated statement from Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, part of the government’s Supreme Council of Antiquities.\n\nMohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the find adds new information to the understating of monastic life in Upper Egypt during the Byzantine era, while showing a pattern of settlement and everyday living. The Byzantine era was the height of Christian living in Egypt, stretching from the late Roman era of 330 C.E. to the Arab conquest in 641 C.E.\n\nThe popular Nile Valley construction method of using mudbrick for structures was clear, according to Mohamed Abdel Badii, head of the Egyptian Archaeological Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities. He said the excavation revealed mudbrick buildings stretching west to east, ranging in dimensions from 23 feet by 26 feet to 46 feet by 26 feet.\n\nBuildings with rectangular halls also featured a semicircular vaulted apse on the eastern end and small, brick-vaulted alcoves throughout, likely used as individual worship retreats for monks.\n\nBadii said the structures house trusses and wall beams, while including layers of tiling on the walls and floors. Some of the structures featured entrances on the southern side that were near the remains of small circular buildings. These lost structures may have been the monk’s communal dining areas.\n\nThe team found a 46-by-32-foot mudbrick building they believe was the main church. It featured three key sections of a typical Coptic-style church design with a sanctuary nave, a home for the choir, and apse designs on both sides. Mudbrick pillars found in the nave suggest a central dome once covered the main sanctuary.\n\nThe excavation revealed ruins of buildings featuring red brick and limestone plaster basins covered with a layer of red tiles for waterproofing, which were likely used to store water or for an industrial activity that took place on the site.\n\nAlong with the buildings, the team located plenty of artifacts from when the monastery was inhabited. Amphorae found were once used for storage, some inscribed with Coptic letters, numbers, or names that could have delineated the type of writings stored inside. Limestone ostraca pieces featured the Coptic language and may have even featured architectural information.\n\nSharif Fathi, minister of tourism and antiquities, said such a find can deepen our understanding of Egyptian history across eras while helping develop a tourist attraction for those interested in the history of civilization and religions.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said the state faces a $2.9 billion budget deficit this year, an amount significantly lower than what legislative budget analysts projected.\n\nThe deficit, though small, could still require cuts and means the Democratic governor doesn’t have money to advance new programs during his last year in office.\n\nIt’s the fourth year in a row that the nation’s most populous state faces a multibillion-dollar budget deficit. This year's shortfall comes despite growing revenues fueled by stock market gains and investments in artificial intelligence.\n\nNewsom's office outlined a behemoth $349 billion budget, though his proposal for how to spend all of that money is far from final. Lawmakers and the Democratic governor will spend the next several months fighting and negotiating over priorities — and cuts. Last year Democrats had to roll back their ambitious program to provide free health care to immigrants without legal status in the face of a $12 billion deficit.\n\n“This budget really is about an eye towards ensuring that we have a sustainable fiscal plan going forward,” Finance Director Joe Stephenshaw said during a Friday briefing.\n\nThis year, they will also face a $1.4 billion loss in federal funding after new federal policy changes to health care and food assistance programs for low-income people. Lawmakers have said repeatedly California is in no position to backfill that money. The budget doesn't fully address the federal funding loss.\n\nNewsom will try to safeguard some of the progressive policies that have defined his tenure as he considers a presidential run. But lawmakers have to consider the looming structural deficit that could climb to $22 billion the following year. Newsom can't seek a third term and will leave office in January.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office in November projected California to face a $18 billion shortfall this year. Their estimate and Newsom's sometimes differ.\n\nNewsom's administration said some of the deficit was offset recently after the state racked in billion of dollars \n\nStill, State Controller Malia Cohen this week warned lawmakers that the state is already spending nearly $6 billion more than expected six months into the fiscal year. She urged them to take “a disciplined approach.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers said the problem is nothing new. They have little say in the budget process because Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers.\n\n“California families have to balance their budgets and make tough choices. The state government should be held to the same standards,” Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said they're committed to addressing deficits.\n\n\"During these times of uncertainty, we must craft a responsible budget that prioritizes the safety and fiscal stability of California families,” state Senate President Pro Tempore Monique Limón said in a statement.\n\nNewsom on Thursday during his State of the State address said his budget will include “the most significant investments” in public education.\n\nHe plans to fully fund transitional kindergarten programs for all students, spend more than $27,000 per student next year and provide $1 billion to high-need schools. Based on a complex set of formulas, roughly 40% of the state's budget is required by California law to go to schools every year.\n\nNewsom also proposed to move the Department of Education into the executive branch. The state superintendent of public instruction is an elected position, and it's not immediately clear whether Newsom will ask voters to approve the change.\n\nHe doesn't propose any new funding to local governments to address homelessness. Last year, Newsom and lawmakers agreed to set aside $500 million for the local programs but it's not guaranteed.\n\nCounty officials worry the lack of new funding will hurt efforts to reduce homelessness. The programs are working, California State Association of Counties CEO Graham Knaus said, pointing to a 9% drop in unsheltered homelessness that Newsom touted earlier this week.\n\n“It would make no sense to then stop the most successful program that is doing that,” he said Friday.\n\nNewsom also calls for the state to rebuild its reserves after withdrawing roughly $12 billion in the last two years to solve budget problems.\n\nHe wants to deposit roughly $3 billion into the state’s rainy day fund, $4.5 billion into a special fund for economic emergencies and $4.1 billion in schools' reserve funds.\n\nHe also wants the state to use $3 billion to pay down debt.\n\nThe budget proposal includes $200 million to create a rebate program to make buying an electric car more affordable.\n\nThe money comes from revenues generated by the state’s cap-and-trade program and an air pollution regulation fund. The goal is to backfill federal tax incentives for electric vehicles that were slashed by Trump’s massive tax and spending cut bill.\n\nNewsom also wants to give more money to the state's Department of Justice to help the state fight the Trump administration's agenda. California has sued the administration more than 50 times since last year.",

    "description": "A new study theorizes that evolution ticks at different speeds, especially when a big group of organisms first appears.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe molecular clock theory posits that genetic changes happen steadily and gradually, offering a reliable means for peering into the past and theorizing when complex life first emerged.\n\nHowever, there is a mismatch between the fossil record and the theory, including the introduction of a 30-million year gap between the arrival of complex life and the first fossil (which is dated to around 530 million years ago).\n\nA new study suggests a model that injects some variability into the ticking clock of evolution, and proposes that the process speeds up with the emergence of a big group of organisms.\n\nThe famous analogy goes that if all of Earth’s geologic history was compressed into a single calendar year, modern humans wouldn’t make an appearance until around 11:50 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. Recorded human history appears even later than that. Considering our planet’s immense past, it’s downright remarkable how much our humble species has learned with those last few minutes before midnight.\n\nHowever, as is always the case when it comes to understanding where we come from, there is much more to learn, and while we’ve developed a reliable model to explain how life emerged from single-celled organisms to the complex web we see today—in the form of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution—questions remain. Chief among them is the apparent fossil gap between when scientists believe complex life emerged and when we see the very first fossils (in this case, in the form of a worm-like creature from the genus Treptichnus, which is dated to around 538 million years ago).\n\nUsing the idea of the molecular clock—which, at its most basic, is working backwards through the genetic record on the assumption that genetic changes occur steadily—scientists estimate that there is a roughly 30-million-year gap that’s currently unexplained by what we see in fossils. Of course, fossils are difficult to find in the first place, and one theory is that these first animals were simply incredibly small due to low oxygen levels (and therefore hard to find). But a new study published in the journal Systematic Biology takes issue with the molecular clock itself, and suggests that evolution doesn’t “tick” as steadily as we might expect.\n\nGraham Budd (a palaeontologist from Uppsala University) and Richard Mann (a mathematical ecologist from the University of Leeds), both of whom have long analyzed the molecular clock and even developed mathematical models to determine how major animal groups rise in evolution, present an idea called the Covariant Evolutionary Tempo model to help explain some of the inconsistencies between the molecular clock and the fossil record.\n\n“This model predicts that diversity is dominated by a small number of extremely large clades at any historical epoch including the present; that these large clades are expected to be characterized by explosive early radiations accompanied by elevated rates of molecular evolution; and that extant organisms are likely to have evolved from species with unusually fast evolutionary rates,” the authors wrote.\n\nIn an article for The Conversation, evolutionary biologist Max Telford from University College London breaks down the model by explaining how this variable tempo could dramatically decrease the gap in time we expect between the emergence of complex life and the first observable fossils. Telford explains that humans and chimps, for example, are separated by six million years of evolution. To simplify things, if there are six genetic changes between these two species and the molecular clock is constant, this suggests one genetic change per million years.\n\nHowever, the Covariant Evolutionary Tempo model suggests that when a big group of organisms appear, evolution actually speeds up. This would make it appear like more time was passing when evolution was really on fast-forward, differentiating into various groups that eventually appeared in the fossil record.\n\n“While the speeding clock idea needs testing,” Telford wrote, “it could explain other mismatches between molecular clocks and the fossil record.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — A week in which longtime tensions between neighbors China and Japan ratcheted up economically and politically drew to a close with no sign of improvements Friday as the Chinese ambassador in Tokyo rebuffed his host nation and the Japanese reported delayed shipments to suppliers in China because of the spat.\n\nThe two developments capped a week where China made clear its displeasure with Japan by instituting new export controls, condemning what it called Tokyo's renewed militarism and cozying up to another regional neighbor, South Korea, during its leader's visit to Beijing.\n\nOn Friday, the Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, kept the jabs coming.\n\n“New militarism will lead Japan back into the abyss,” it said in an editorial. “History serves as a stark warning, yet the Japanese right wing is repeating its old tricks.”\n\nIt was the latest in several days of pointed Chinese criticism toward Japan after its prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested in November that she wouldn't rule out intervening if China used military force against the island of Taiwan. China views self-governed Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has said it would take it by force if needed. It staged large-scale military exercises nearby late last month.\n\nChina keeps its export controls\n\nOn Thursday night, the Chinese embassy in Japan said it had rejected a petition from Japan's Foreign Ministry to retract the new export controls on “dual-use items” that the Japanese military might be able to use in weaponry. The ambassador, Wu Jianghao, insisted that China's move was “entirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful” — and vital to national security.\n\nAlso Friday, Japanese officials said they are closely watching if Japanese exports of agricultural, fisheries and other goods are appropriately handled by China without delays. The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that outgoing shipments of sake and processed food from Japan to China were being held up because of the diplomatic tensions, widening the ripples of the dispute.\n\nOfficials at the government-affiliated Japan External Trade Organization told The Associated Press that the shipments had been delayed in customs on the China side starting in late November. Kyodo, quoting trade industry sources, said they believed sake may have been targeted as “a symbol of Japan.”\n\nJapan’s chief cabinet secretary, Minoru Kihara, said he was aware of reports that some of the Japanese exports to China have been held up. He wouldn’t comment on individual commercial transactions.\n\n“It is important that agricultural, fisheries and other exports from Japan are smoothly carried out,” Kihara said. “We will closely watch the situation and take appropriate measures.” He didn’t say what those might be.\n\nJapan and China have a fraught history haunted by the Japanese colonization of Taiwan in 1895. The nations have fought two wars, and the imperial government in Tokyo brutally occupied parts of China in the first half of the 20th century. The countries maintain diplomatic relations and work closely together on many fronts but occasionally use government apparatus to condemn each other when disputes arise.\n\nChina's choice of wording in the People's Daily editorial and other rhetoric was noteworthy. It avoided casting a broad brush on the Japanese people and specifically targeted the country's right wing, which Takaichi belongs to. A report Thursday about Japan's nuclear ambitions repeatedly mentioned the right wing, and the People's Daily editorial beseeched the “peace-loving Japanese people” to be “highly vigilant” toward their government.\n\n\"Japan’s future lies not in the dangerous fantasies painted by the right wing, but in the thorough reckoning with its history of aggression,\" People's Daily said.\n\nRare earths as a pressure point\n\nKihara, the government spokesman, said Chinese export controls of rare earths already in place have caused “serious impact on global supply chains.” “We believe that international trade of rare earths should be carried out smoothly,\" Kihara said.\n\nIndustry and Trade Minister Ryosei Akazawa did not confirm whether China’s dual-use goods ban included new action on rare earths. Azakawa said the impact on Japanese industries is already significant because about 70% of rare earths, used in a wide range of products such as electronic parts and autos, are imported from China.\n\n“Rare earths are extremely important minerals, and the export controls have already affected our country tremendously,” Akazawa said. He wouldn't comment on whether Japan would consider retaliating.\n\nChina also pointedly expressed positive feelings about South Korea during the visit this week of its president, Lee Jae Myung, who met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. After the signing of millions in new export contracts, Lee heralded “a new chapter in the development of Korea-China relations.\"\n\nAs he visited, Chinese state media — which recently warned that travel to Japan by Chinese citizens might be dangerous — provided splashy coverage and said outgoing Chinese traveler to South Korea during New Year's had surpassed those to Japan.\n\nRelations between Beijing and Tokyo showed at least one tiny positive sign Friday. At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesperson Mao Ning was informed that a one-time Japanese ambassador to China had died. She expressed the country's condolences.",

    "fullText": "Salad bar-style buffet chains have suffered financial distress since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSalad buffet restaurant chain Souper Salad has declined from about 150 locations to just three.\n\nFormerly defunct Sweet Tomatoes plans to open two locations after going out of business during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe rise of salad bar restaurant chains in the 1980s accelerated in the 1990s and early 2000s, as the restaurant concept became popular.\n\nSalad bar buffet restaurant chains Sweet Tomatoes and its sister Souplantation, which were founded in San Diego, and Dallas-based Souper Salad both launched in 1978. Another popular chain, Fresh Choice launched in California in 1986.\n\nI remember the beginning of the salad dining craze in the early 1980s, as I dined at a casual restaurant called The Salad Bar along Sacramento's K Street mall in 1982.\n\nUnfortunately, the restaurant did not last long, but other restaurants chains with salad bars, such as Sizzler and Wendy's, filled the void until the industry prospered.\n\nSouper Salad had expanded to over 150 locations by the early 2000s, but industry headwinds and a downturn in consumer confidence led to a 2011 bankruptcy filing and continued restaurant closings, according to Nation's Restaurant News.\n\nThe restaurant chain only has three locations today in Lubbock, Pasadena, and El Paso, Texas.\n\n6703 Slide Road, Lubbock, Texas\n\n5822 Fairmont Parkway, Pasadena, Texas\n\n8900 Viscount Blvd., El Paso, Texas Source\n\nFresh Choice filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 24, 2012, according to PacerMonitor, and shut down its 20 remaining locations in December 2012.\n\nSweet Tomatoes and Souplantation's owner filed Chapter 11 in 2016, and then four years later, the buffet restaurant chain filed for Chapter 7 liquidation and permanently closed down its 97 locations, after the Covid-19 pandemic had forced a shut down, according to Nation's Restaurant News.\n\nSweet Tomatoes announced a comeback in 2025, as new owners ST Three LLC said they would open new locations in Tucson, Ariz., and Fort Myers, Fla., Gulfshore Business reported.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic devastated the salad bar/buffet dining concept in 2020, as buffet-style restaurants shut down across the nation as the pandemic forced strict health requirements upon restaurants and consumers became frightened of the thought of eating at such establishments.\n\nAfter Fresh Choice disappeared in 2012, another salad restaurant concept launched in Gilbert, Ariz., in 2013 — Salad and Go's fast-food drive-thru chain that rose to over 140 restaurant locations by May 2025.",

    "fullText": "Actor and director Timothy Busfield is facing two counts of sexual abuse involving a minor in New Mexico after an arrest warrant was issued on Friday.\n\nThe investigation involves twin boys who were actors on the TV series “The Cleaning Lady” in 2022, on which Busfield was director. One of the boys told an investigator last fall that Busfield touched his “private areas” when he was seven years old, and again when he was eight, while they were on set.\n\n'Cleaning Lady,' 'Alert: Missing Persons Unit' Canceled at Fox\n\nProduction Designers Behind 'The Sympathizer,' 'Shogun' and More Discuss Creating the Look of Sprawling Asian Cities\n\n'The Cleaning Lady' Renewed for Season 4 at Fox\n\nAccording to an Albuquerque police affidavit, the boy said he was “very afraid of Tim and was relieved when he was off set.”\n\nThe “Field of Dreams” and “Thirtysomething” actor directed six episodes of “The Cleaning Lady,” which aired on Fox from 2022 to 2025.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Busfield spoke to police by phone in November. He was asked if he had “any physical contact” with the boys and if he had picked them up and tickled them.\n\n“Timothy said it was highly likely that he would have,” the affidavit states.\n\nBusfield then said that the boys’ parents would be around, and it would not be “weird.” He later said he did not recall picking those boys up.\n\n“I don’t remember those boys,” he said. “No, I don’t. I don’t actually, I don’t remember it, if it happened. I don’t remember overtly tickling the boys ever, but it wouldn’t be uncommon for me.”\n\nThe 2nd Judicial District Attorney’s office declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Warner Bros. conducted an investigation in 2025 after SAG-AFTRA received an anonymous complaint about a separate incident in December 2024.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Busfield had kissed a boy on the face in the hair and makeup trailer, and that he would tickle and caress the heads of the boys. Warner Bros. contracted with an outside investigator who was not able to substantiate that claim.\n\nAlbuquerque Police Det. Marvin Brown alleged in the affidavit that Warner Bros. “made it very difficult to obtain information for this case.” The detective obtained a search warrant to get a copy of the investigative report, but it was not turned over until three months later, he wrote.\n\nWhen the detective reached out to other child actors on the show to ensure their safety, he was advised by Warner Bros. that he would have to go through its lawyers to talk to employees, the affidavit states.\n\nWarner Bros. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen Busfield joined the series, he “grew closer to the boys,” the affidavit states, continuing, “It was reported that Timothy would tell his children to call him ‘Uncle Tim.'”\n\nA police officer first spoke with the parents and the boys in 2024, after police received a report from their doctor. At the time, the boys did not disclose any sexual contact to the officer, and the police declined to pursue charges.\n\nHowever, in September 2025, one of the children reported to his counselor and later to his pediatrician that Busfield had “touched him on his penis and bottom.”\n\nThe other brother said “he did not like being touched, but did not say anything because he did not want to get in trouble,” according to the complaint.\n\nIn his interview with the police, Busfield said he had heard from Elodie Yung, the lead actress on the show, that the boys’ mother “wanted revenge” because her sons were not brought back for the final season.\n\nYung declined to speak to the police, saying she “does not want to be involved in the investigation,” the affidavit states.\n\nThe arrest warrant was issued by a judge on Friday afternoon. Busfield’s legal representative did not respond to request for comment.\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

    "title": "Scientists Find Drinking This Juice Lowers Blood Pressure in as Little as 2 Weeks",
    "description": "Beet juice lowers blood pressure in older adults if you sip it daily, according to one study. Here, experts explain the connection, plus if you should try it.",
    "fullText": "Drinking beet juice may be helpful for people trying to improve their heart health, according to one study.\n\nResearchers found that drinking the juice twice daily lowered blood pressure in older adults.\n\nThe effects appear to come from the relationship between the nitrates in beets, how they impact blood pressure, and the oral microbiome.\n\nIf left untreated, high blood pressure can lead to a host of health problems, eventually increasing your risk for heart attack, stroke, and heart failure, per the American Heart Association. While medication can help, simple lifestyle changes can also go far toward lowering blood pressure. So when a study found that drinking beet juice lowers blood pressure, we had to interrogate it. Below, discover what the study found, how a cardiologist and registered dietitian interpret the findings, and whether you should start sipping beet juice as part of your heart-healthy lifestyle.\n\nMeet the Experts: Padma Shenoy, M.D., a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and LabFinder.com contributor and Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N., a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of City to Sea Nutrition.\n\nIn the small randomized double-blind crossover study, which was published in Free Radical Biology and Medicine, researchers linked beetroot juice consumption with lowered blood pressure in older adults. Over three two-week trial periods (with two week breaks in between each one), study participants were instructed to either drink nitrate-rich beet juice or a placebo beet juice twice daily or rinse their mouths with mouthwash twice daily for 30 seconds, aside from the last day, which prompted one final drink or rinse. The beet juice and placebo drinkers did not use mouthwash during their assigned juice-drinking periods. Participants were divided into two demographics—younger adults (aged between 18 and 30) and older adults (aged between 67 to 79). There were 42 young adults and 36 older adults, making for a small, combined cohort of 78 people.\n\nThe goal was to analyze how bacterial changes within the oral microbiome may influence blood pressure levels. So, researchers monitored both the whole time. Participants were not medicated for any pulmonary, cardiovascular, or metabolic conditions, nor did they have ulcerative colitis, renal disease, or active oral disease or dentures. People who smoked and people with stage 2 hypertension or those who had used antibiotics within three months prior to the study were also excluded.\n\nThe testing began after an overnight fast and the avoidance of strenuous exercise, alcohol, and caffeine for 24 hours. Other than drinking their assigned drink (70 milliliters of beet juice or placebo morning and evening, or that 30-second twice-daily rinse), participants proceeded normally with all their other habits.\n\nAfter the three trials were compared, researchers concluded that drinking beetroot juice may help lower blood pressure in older adults (the blood pressure-lowering effect was not seen in the younger group). According to Padma Shenoy, M.D., a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and LabFinder.com contributor, this was “likely by changing the composition of bacteria in the mouth.”\n\nMore specifically, researchers discovered that drinking beet juice led to “a decrease in certain bacteria (like Prevotella) and an increase in others (such as Neisseria and Rothia) that are better at converting dietary nitrate into nitric oxide, a compound that helps blood vessels relax,” explained Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N., a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of City to Sea Nutrition.\n\nWhat happened in the study seems to be based on the relationship between nitrates, blood pressure, and the oral microbiome. Nitrates are chemicals found naturally in the environment, vegetables, and preserved meats. With the help of the aforementioned bacteria that live in the mouth, dietary nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, which can improve heart health by relaxing blood vessels and boosting blood flow, said Dr. Shenoy. In fact, nitrates are commonly found in blood pressure-controlling medications, she added. “That’s why diets high in nitrate-rich vegetables, like spinach, arugula, and beets, are consistently linked with better vascular health,” concluded Adrian.\n\nThe question mark hanging over these findings is the role of the oral microbiome, but it does appear to have one. “We are still learning about the connection between the oral microbiome and blood pressure, but it is possible that certain bacteria in the mouth could turn nutrients into substances that lower blood pressure,” Dr. Shenoy explained.\n\nYou may have previously heard of concerns regarding excess nitrate consumption and the potential cancer risk associated with it. Those concerns are largely linked to processed food (like deli meats and cheeses) and water sources with added nitrates that aim to prevent bacteria growth and improve food’s taste and color. Naturally occurring nitrates in vegetables are considered safe to eat (and are found in some of the healthiest foods, like leafy greens, beets, and celery).\n\n“According to this study, only older adults experienced a slight drop in blood pressure from drinking beetroot juice, and more studies are needed to explore which individuals will respond,” said Dr. Shenoy. “Eating more vegetables like beetroot may help heart health, but it is important to remember that is just one part of a healthy lifestyle. More research is needed to support strong recommendations to consume beetroot as a blood-pressure lowering therapy.”\n\nWhile it does not appear that drinking beet juice will hinder your efforts to lower your blood pressure, Dr. Shenoy stressed that it's only one tool in your toolbox. \"Other components of a heart-healthy lifestyle include eating a varied diet, limiting sodium intake, and exercising regularly,\" she said. The combination of these healthy choices—plus personalized recommendations from your physician—will have the largest effect on your blood pressure and heart health overall.\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "description": "Vince McMahon's wrestling business model may be monopolistic, but according to this WWE Hall of Famer, the McMahons' tactics were just good for business.",
    "fullText": "For many years, WWE was the definition of a professional wrestling monopoly, with its complete dominance of the professional wrestling market, industry-shaping practices, and strict closed-door policy to outside promotions. While the wrestling scene has since diversified, some may argue that the McMahon dynasty's ruthless business practices were a good thing — one of those advocates being WWE Hall of Famer Dory Funk Jr.\n\nFunk Jr. was interviewed on a recent episode of News4Jax's \"Going Ringside,\" and amidst questions about his decades-long career in the professional wrestling business, Funk Jr. was asked about Vince McMahon's total takeover of the professional wrestling business. Funk Jr., coming from a pre-WWE era of several, individual, fragmented promotions, praised McMahon's business tactics.\n\n\"Yeah, Vince bought everything. It was good for the business,\" Funk Jr. admitted.\n\nWhile Funk Jr. approved of McMahon's business model, he did not dismiss the importance of rival promotions to the professional wrestling ecosystem. While he did not name any specific competitors, Funk Jr. reasoned that the emergence of new companies — both those working with and against WWE — broaden the professional wrestling world, and contribute to its overall success.\n\n\"And then, other, new companies would come along, and be working with Vince, or working against him. It was good for the wrestling business,\" Funk Jr. elaborated.\n\nFunk Jr. confirmed he keeps up with professional wrestling in the present day, though to what extent the Hall of Famer follows the current product is unclear. He applauded modern wrestling as \"good business,\" and praised today's talents for their work ethic.\n\n\"Everybody works hard to give the fans what they would like to see,\" Funk Jr. concluded. \"And...I see the fans very, very eager to get behind professional wrestling.\"\n\nWhile Funk Jr. is advanced in his years, he still contributes to the professional wrestling world through limited in-ring activities and his wrestling school.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Dom Jones has been interested in Asian culture since she was a child. She moved to Taiwan and thinks it's an under-appreciated gem of Asia.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dom Jones, 39, a teacher and entrepreneur who moved from the US to Taipei, Taiwan, in the fall of 2025. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAsia has always drawn me in. I grew up in the Los Angeles area, and one of the cities that I lived in was Long Beach, California.\n\nLong Beach has probably one of the largest Cambodian populations in the world outside of Cambodia itself. I went to school with a lot of Asian classmates in a very diverse community. So it was my life.\n\nI will never forget, my neighbors were a Cambodian family and they had a daughter, and I was about seven to nine years old.\n\nThey would always cook food, and the food that they would cook would smell very different to the American palate. Everyone walked by like, \"Oh God, it's so crazy.\" But as a kid, it intrigued me.\n\nI remember the little girl would play with me outside and one day she said she's going to eat and her mom told me to come in and eat with them. I went and I sat at their table and laid out right in front of me was a whole fish with an eyeball.\n\nInside the little me was like, \"Oh, what is this?\" The mother cut off the piece from the belly and put it on my plate and said, \"Eat.\"\n\nI said, \"I think I like this.\" And after a minute, I just started really eating a lot.\n\nAs time goes on, I'm literally knocking on this family's door every day asking for some funky food. And that was the beginning of a love affair with the Asian diaspora — and it wasn't just Cambodia.\n\nI was a Christian missionary for many years and I was called into the work of the Vietnamese community. In college, I went to Vietnam on a J-term and it changed my life. I learned Vietnamese and Tagalog as well. Later on in life, in my late 20s, I had the privilege to travel for the first time to Japan. And Japan, of course, many Americans fall in love with Japan.\n\nEvery kind of Asian community has always been a part of my journey.\n\nAfter I went out of the country for the first time in college, I knew I was destined to live outside of the United States.\n\nAsia has been my primary place in the world that I love the most — and I've been everywhere.\n\nI thought that my final migration would be to Vietnam as a part of my purpose in my life, but as life shifted things, Taiwan was presented to me in a way that I didn't expect.\n\nI first came to Taiwan as a layover during Christmas time 2019 — it was a long layover, basically 24 hours.\n\nI came out of the airport into the city and tried to do as much as I could, and I really just felt a connection to the energy of Taiwan in a way that I didn't feel in other places.\n\nI went back home. Then I immediately came back and I said, \"I'm going to stay there for like a month and really try to enjoy it.\"\n\nI began to explore the community and realized that this is kind of an untouched pearl and maybe an under-appreciated pearl of an island in Asia that has a lot of culture and a lot of beauty and a lot of peace.\n\nThe focus wasn't, is it a digital nomad hotbed? The focus wasn't, can I speak English there?\n\nThere was the immeasurable level of peace that my soul felt. That was the draw.\n\nI've been traveling back and forth to Taiwan for the last six years. I just did my final migration here this past September.\n\nI did consider living in Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. But Taiwan offered me that combination that I felt was unique to here, which is safety, infrastructure, affordability, and that cultural depth that really aligned with my life and where I want to build.\n\nSafety is, for me, one of the first things that I noticed when I came to Asia. For me, it's not just about crime, it's about the felt experience of safety.\n\nI can move through the city here in Taiwan at all hours of the day and night — I'm talking from 10 p.m. all the way to when the sun rises. I can use public transportation very easily.\n\nAnd when we talk about convenience and the way the infrastructure is built for the citizen, it is absolutely incredible. I can live my life here every day without the constant vigilance of, \"Is this area OK, where's my bag, where's my purse?\"\n\nAnd listen, no government is perfect. However, the safety, the convenience, the manner in which one can live one's life that is carved out by the institutions that are laid out here, it feels like the way we all want to feel about our government — which is we feel cared for and supported.\n\nAlso, healthcare is so accessible. When I say it's accessible, it's not like they're giving you healthcare that's just basic. No, you get premium healthcare here.\n\nIt kind of shocked me moving here, getting my visa, and them telling me that my visa comes with the same national free healthcare that all the other Taiwanese residents get. I was in shock. I didn't expect that.\n\nTaipei, Taiwan, specifically, is like the New York of Asia. It's extremely expensive — it's certainly expensive by Taiwanese income standards.\n\nThe average Taiwanese person is paying less than NT$ 25,000 in rent. That's equivalent to paying less than about $800 a month. They're not paying anywhere near what we pay for a nice, comfortable apartment.\n\nI did want to live in a very convenient, walkable area, so then the price drives up dramatically.\n\nHowever, the drive up is still doable for us with American pockets because our dollar stretches here. So for me, I was able to get what's considered to be a very desirable Taiwan apartment right in the middle of Taipei, Taiwan, and I pay less than $2,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bath unit.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't say that I have a very nuanced and insider's perspective on why one would leave the United States. But for me, this was always going to happen one way or another. So I wasn't running from something, I was moving toward a different way of living.\n\nLeaving the US, for me, was a matter of logistics, honestly, but the motivation was very intentional expansion, not rejection of the US. I still feel connected to the US professionally and culturally.\n\nMaybe I was raised to believe — perhaps in America, we're all raised to believe — that opportunity only exists in one place, which is America.\n\nBut relocating helped me to realize that you can love where you're from and still choose something different. For me, Taiwan wasn't this exit, it was more of an arrival.",

    "description": "As a GenXer, I believed that I would be financially successful if I just worked hard. But I'm still facing debt and unemployment. Will I ever retire?",
    "fullText": "Last year, I sat in my office staring at the three monitors on my desk. On the screens were my online bank accounts — all of which were channeling Whoopi Goldberg's character from the movie \"Ghost.\"\n\n\"You in danger, girl,\" they seemed to be saying, mocking me.\n\nI spent decades building a career, collecting titles, degrees, and glowing reviews. Yet the numbers on my bank statements told a different story. The stability I assumed would come with age and experience kept slipping through my fingers, and I realized there's a thin line between \"doing well\" and \"barely holding on.\"\n\nI came of age believing that if I worked hard enough, stayed loyal, and continued to improve, stability would naturally follow. Instead, at 52, I'm still struggling financially and facing debt.\n\nFor nearly 20 years, I served as an educator and instructional coach in Atlanta. My career felt solid. My reputation was earned. My work mattered. I believed I was building something that would carry me comfortably into the second half of my life.\n\nThen 2018 arrived. Three months after my 45th birthday, a sudden heart attack and complications led to permanent disability. Suddenly, in a profession where I was once well respected, I found myself being ghosted after interviews. Months turned into years, and even though I am married, I racked up credit card debt to stay afloat.\n\nThankfully, in 2022, after a brief stint as an online instructor for a virtual high school, I finally caught my break. I landed a government contracting role with the CDC, where I used my background in teaching and writing to begin a new career as an instructional designer and communications specialist.\n\nI earned more than I ever had, and I was able to tackle some of the debt with a plan in place. That should've felt like success. Some days it did.\n\nOther days, it felt like I was trying to empty water from a rowboat with holes in it. My student loan balance was still in the six figures, the debt from my years of unemployment lingered, and my savings were minimal.\n\nLast year's 43-day federal shutdown shook my financial situation even more. Many contractors like me did not receive back pay, and each day without work felt like slipping into the same uncertainty I was still clawing my way out of.\n\nI kept thinking, \"I just got steady. How am I right back in danger of sliding under?\"\n\nI have endured multiple recessions and life-altering crises, but I'm still not financially stable enough to retire. I was frustrated.\n\nI do not want another reset at 52. I want the stability I grew up believing was a natural reward for hard work. Nevertheless, I have learned a few truths.\n\nFirst, reinvention is not a luxury for a Gen Xer like me; it's my survival skill. I've reminded myself how many times I've had to rebuild my career. Sometimes it was because I failed, and other times it was because I had to do what I had to do.\n\nSecond, credentials and experience are valuable, but they do not guarantee protection. I hold multiple degrees, possess decades of leadership experience, and have a distinguished professional record. But I still faced long-term unemployment, medical crises, and debt.\n\nThird, financial recovery in midlife can be a slow process. That doesn't mean I am irresponsible. It means life happened to me in ways my younger self could never have predicted.\n\nThe shutdown ended, but so did my contract. I am unemployed again. My debt is still there. My savings are still small. My concern about the next unexpected disruption remains very real. Yet I am choosing to move forward anyway. My skills have not disappeared. They've just been refined, so I'll repurpose them again.\n\nStability at this age looks nothing like what I imagined in my 20s. Instead, it looks like adapting quickly and refusing to give up on myself. It looks like rebuilding (again) one day at a time.\n\nI do not know how this season will end. I only know I'm still learning how to navigate a future I never imagined having to rebuild. But I'm still here. For now, that will have to suffice.",

It is unclear what moves the president could make to bypass this.\n\nIn a new post on Saturday, Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, said Trump's \"goal of reducing credit card interest rates\" was a \"worthy and important one,\" but he reiterated his concerns over a 10% cap.\n\n\"I have no investments in the credit card space so I am not the expert, but the market for credit cards appears highly competitive,\" Ackman continued. \"The best way to bring down rates would be to make it more competitive by making the regulatory regime more conducive to new entrants and new technologies.\"\n\nTrump, who pledged to \"immediately bring prices down\" in office, has recently honed in on the topic of affordability.\n\nNew York City mayor Zohran Mamdani swept to victory in November after running a campaign focused on voters' cost-of-living concerns.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Robin Singh was feeling stuck in his job and needed a creative outlet, so he and his wife bought an RV park in Oregon and turned it into a hotel.",
    "fullText": "Overall, Singh, 32, was happy. He loved living in San Jose, California, and he was planning to propose to his then-girlfriend, Sharan Samra, 28, by the end of the year.\n\nHis work as an engineering lead at Google, though, wasn't completely fulfilling him.\n\n\"I was feeling very frustrated with the way the job was going, the way that things were completely out of my control,\" he told Business Insider. He added that he wanted a creative outlet and a project he could have more control over.\n\nAs he considered his situation, Singh decided it might be time to make a long-held dream come true.\n\n\"Having a little bed and breakfast has been a dream of mine for 10 years,\" he said. \"I was like, 'You know what? Now's the time. If I'm gonna preserve my sanity, I need something I really, really, really love.'\"\n\nSoon, Singh started looking at properties in Northern California and Oregon, hoping to find a location where he could bring his dream to life while continuing to work full time at Google.\n\nSamra, the head of marketing at a startup, was supportive of Singh's goal, but she didn't realize how serious he was about it until he took her to a property in Oregon that he had fallen in love with.\n\nSingh was open-minded about where his B&B might be, but he started his search along the coast of Northern California and Oregon because of a long-held love for the area.\n\n\"That area, I think, is one of the most beautiful stretches of the entire country,\" he said. \"Having gone there a bunch of times, I've always wanted a place that's really cool that I can stay at, and I knew that was something I was really missing.\"\n\nThen, he found a listing for an RV park and motel called Fish Mill Lodges and RV Park, located just outside Florence, Oregon, in the town of Westlake. The property, which dates back to the 1940s, was about a 10-minute drive from the coast and sits on Siltcoos Lake. When he saw it, Singh said he felt like his dream was finally coming together.\n\n\"As soon as I pulled up, I was in love with the place,\" he said.\n\nFish Mill Lodges and RV Park was home to six one-bedroom cabins, one larger cabin, and a bigger house. The 2.5-acre property is situated on the water, with a bridge providing access to the docks.\n\nSingh said when he first toured the property, the walls of the cabins were rotting, the floors were creaking, and algae was growing in the toilet bowls.\n\nThe exterior wasn't doing well, either. Singh said there were untended blackberry bushes that had grown to be nearly 10 feet high, and the docks weren't safe to walk on.\n\nThe place was going to need a lot of work, but Singh was ready to take it on anyway. Samra needed to see the space in person before she was sold, too.\n\n\"I just had so many doubts,\" she told Business Insider. \"We've never owned a small business. We don't have experience in hotels, and we both have full-time jobs that we need to keep, and we live so far away.\"\n\n\"Everything seemed so impossible,\" she added. \"And then we went up there, and I just fell in love with the place.\"\n\nSingh said he had money saved to put toward the land, and he and Samra were planning to continue working their day jobs to help pay for the property's renovation. Still, he struggled to get a loan from a bank for the initial purchase.\n\n\"I had banks and stuff lined up, and all of them backed out in the end, saying, 'Hey, it's a tough time in hospitality right now. And if this thing fails, we're going to have a building that is in a state of disrepair,'\" Singh said.\n\nSingh and Samra ultimately worked with a hard money lender to finance the purchase, and they were able to close in November 2024 — just a few days before Singh proposed to his now-wife.\n\nBecause securing financing took a bit longer than he anticipated, Singh said he was able to get almost completely prepared for renovations before they even closed on the property.\n\nSingh doesn't have a background in design, but he had a clear vision for what he wanted the hotel to look like, drawing out designs himself.\n\n\"Robin's not an artist,\" Samra told Business Insider. \"Even the drawings that he's talking about, imagine a 3-year-old scribbled something. That's what the drawings are.\"\n\nSingh was able to give those drawings to professionals, who created renderings of rooms or furniture designs. He said he even flew to India just four days after he proposed to Samra to start working with custom furniture designers.\n\nSingh planned to focus the renovation on the cabins and big house, deciding not to rehab the RV hookups.\n\nThe one-bedroom cabins had a lot of potential, but Singh and Samra said they weren't too appealing for modern travelers before the renovation.\n\n\"Originally, when you walked in, you would open the door, and you would walk straight into the kitchen, which we thought was a little odd,\" Samra said of the cabins.\n\nSamra and Singh also said the kitchens were dated, with older appliances and decor.\n\nThey liked the setup of the main living area, though, which featured windows that overlooked the property and a Murphy bed attached to the wall. The cabins also had separate bedrooms that needed facelifts.\n\nAlthough the windows that overlooked the lake at the cabins were great, Singh and Samra thought they were too small.\n\n\"One of the very first things we did was replace all those windows with floor-to-ceiling windows so that you can actually enjoy the lake view,\" Samra said.\n\nThe process was a bit intensive, particularly because they found that some of the cabins had rotting wood, which meant they needed to replace entire walls. They collaborated with their contractor, Rafael Gonzalez of Home Remodel Specialist, and his team to implement the changes.\n\nIn addition to the cabins, the property included a larger house that was also in disrepair when Singh and Samra purchased it. They said the floors were rotted and moldy, and that birds had once lived in the house, leaving their mark all over the place.\n\nThere were also four studio apartment-style rooms in a structure together on the property, which needed a facelift as well.\n\nSingh and Samra told Business Insider it feels like work on the hotel will never be completely done, but by June 15, all of their rooms were open and rentable. However, they started opening rooms in April 2025 so they could do some testing.\n\n\"We gradually opened so that we could test out the concept to see if it would be successful or not,\" Samra said.\n\nBoth said their experience in the tech and startup worlds made them easily adaptable and ready to pivot when needed, allowing them to learn as they opened new rooms over time.\n\nFor instance, they said that cleaning rooms after guests left took them close to two hours when they first opened, so they had to strategize on how to make that process more efficient while maintaining quality.\n\n\"I'm grateful that we opened one at a time so we could give that really personalized attention to one person, and then two people, then three,\" Samra said.\n\nRegardless of the theme, for the six cabins, Singh and Samra made the large windows they added to the structures the focal point of each living room. For instance, the living room of the Vanilla Villa (photographed above) offers the best views of the water, according to Singh and Samra.\n\nEach cabin has one bedroom, but the couple also kept the original Murphy beds that are in the living areas because they offer such stunning views.\n\n\"We encourage everyone to sleep on the Murphy bed because when you wake up, the first thing that you see is the gorgeous view,\" Samra said.\n\nTo make it so you don't walk right into the kitchen in each cabin, Singh and Samra added a small entryway to each space, separating it from the kitchen with an archway.\n\nThe kitchens also got major updates, with counters and cabinets lining the hallway-like space. Singh and Samra made the counters into a DIY project to help cut costs.\n\n\"Having blown all the budget on buying the place, everything had to be very, very creative,\" Singh said.\n\nThey said they wanted marble counters, but they knew they couldn't afford them. Instead, they installed epoxy countertops to create the perfect colors that matched each room.\n\nIn addition to the Murphy beds in the living area, the cabins feature a private bedroom and bathroom, which Singh and Samra have made some changes to.\n\nMuch like they did in the kitchens, they decided to separate the vanities from the shower and toilet in their cabins.\n\n\"We were thinking that a lot of times when we go to hotels, we really appreciate the places that have the sink and vanity outside the shower and toilet area,\" Samra said. \"If one person's showering or using the bathroom, you can still have the vanity area to get ready.\"\n\nThe countertops on the vanities match those in the kitchens as well.\n\nThe Funky Fortress, which costs $337 a night as of January, wasn't previously rented out to guests, but Singh and Samra said they knew immediately they wanted to make it a rental property.\n\n\"That's where the managers used to live and stay to run the place, but we converted that into a rental as well because it has the best views,\" Samra said.\n\n\"It has panoramic views all around because the hotel sits on a peninsula,\" Singh said. \"We're right at the tip of it, so when you're sitting here, just in every direction you see the lake.\"\n\nThe Funky Fortress is full of color, from a blue curved couch that Singh had custom-designed to bright artwork.\n\nIt can also sleep eight, as it has a queen bed and a queen-sized bunk bed.\n\nSingh and Samra said the landscaping at the Florentine was in disrepair, with vegetation overgrown and the dock falling apart.\n\nAs they brought it back to life, the couple made some discoveries.\n\n\"All the blackberries being gone is the biggest thing we've done,\" Singh said, adding that it was so transformative that they discovered seven metal boats hiding underneath the thick bushes as they removed them.\n\n\"We still have them,\" Singh said of the boats. \"We gave away two of them to our friend who helped us cut down some of the blackberries.\"\n\nSingh and Samra used their income to finance the bulk of the renovations, but they said when their budget got tight, their community rallied to help bring the hotel to the finish line.\n\n\"I had to take out extra home equity and everything to actually fund the construction and also borrow from other friends and family when we ran out of that budget,\" Singh said.\n\nSingh said Gonzalez also worked with him when cash got tight, rather than putting the project on hold.\n\n\"Rafael, my home remodel specialist, gets so much credit for this place because he worked with me on everything,\" Singh said. \"He prioritized this project over everything else that he had, and we grew to be such great friends over this.\"\n\nSince they were fully operational by June, Singh and Samra were able to host guests at the hotel for the duration of summer, which is the busy season on the Oregon Coast.\n\nThe couple told Business Insider they were booked to capacity for the majority of the summer.\n\n\"Our first summer has been beyond expectations, and we're so grateful for that,\" Samra said.\n\nFor the moment, Singh and Samra aren't thinking of the money they make from the Florentine as profit.\n\n\"Any money that we make just goes back into everything that needs to happen to the place,\" Singh said, including additional projects they hope to take on in the coming months.\n\nAlthough they're glad the hotel has had a steady stream of guests, Singh and Samra said making a dream a reality was the real win.\n\n\"It was a passion project, and it was so gratifying,\" Singh said. \"It wasn't numbers. It was heart and soul into it.\"\n\nNow, their attention is on how to keep growing their business and help the community they have come to love thrive.\n\n\"We're working with the local community, Dune City, the city of Florence, and the county to try to see what we can do to make the entire area attractive to where visitors want to visit year-round,\" Samra said. \"We're working with all the local business owners because everyone has this mindset of when one business succeeds, or we bring people to the whole area, we all win.\"\n\nAs they look back on the work on the hotel, Singh and Samra — who got married in November 2025 — say that the experience of becoming business owners together has only helped them grow as a couple.\n\n\"It made our relationship stronger,\" Samra said. \"I'm grateful to say that.\"\n\n\"I think our strengths and weaknesses go really hand in hand,\" she added. \"Creativity is his zone, and thinking of the big ideas and bringing them to life is my zone.\"",

    "fullText": "Karoline Leavitt landed a White House internship as a college student during President Donald Trump's first term. In his second term, she serves as the youngest-ever White House press secretary.\n\nA former college athlete who spent her summers scooping ice cream in New Hampshire, Leavitt, 28, quickly rose through the ranks of Republican politics through communications jobs with former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik.\n\nDuring her tenure as the 2024 Trump campaign's national press secretary, she traveled the country while pregnant and returned to work four days after giving birth to her son.\n\nLeavitt has also acknowledged her \"atypical love story\" with husband Nicholas Riccio, a 60-year-old real-estate developer. The couple is now expecting their second child.\n\nHere's what to know about Trump's White House press secretary.\n\nThe White House Press Office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLeavitt's parents owned an ice cream stand where she worked during the summers.\n\nShe attended Central Catholic High School in Lawrence, Massachusetts.\n\n\"Having a Catholic education really formed who I am,\" she said on an episode of The Catholic Current podcast in 2021.\n\nShe continued, \"It taught me discipline, it brought me closer in my own relationship with God, and it also taught me the importance of public service and giving back to your community.\"\n\nLeavitt was admitted to Saint Anselm College on a softball scholarship and played as an outfielder on the women's softball team, the Saint Anselm Hawks.\n\nLeavitt's extra-curricular activities included founding the Saint Anselm Broadcasting Club, volunteering at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, and writing articles for the college newspaper, The Saint Anselm Crier, defending Trump's travel ban and criticizing the \"liberal media.\" She also spent a semester studying abroad at John Cabot University in Rome.\n\nIn 2018, she interned at the White House during Trump's first presidency as a presidential writer in the White House Office of Presidential Correspondence.\n\nShe was the first member of her family to earn an undergraduate degree.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, Leavitt worked as an assistant press secretary, helping McEnany prepare for briefings.\n\nStefanik served as the House Republican Conference Chair from 2021 to 2025.\n\n\"I could no longer sit back and watch as our conservative principles — that make America the greatest country in the world and New Hampshire the best state in the union — fall under attack,\" Leavitt wrote on her campaign website of her decision to run for office.\n\nLeavitt won the Republican primary, but lost the general election to the Democratic incumbent, Rep. Chris Pappas, who is the first openly gay man to represent New Hampshire in Congress.\n\nLeavitt held press conferences outside Manhattan Criminal Court during Trump's hush-money trial. Trump was found guilty on all 34 felony counts, but was not sentenced with any punishment due to the US Supreme Court ruling granting presidents criminal immunity protections.\n\nTrump maintained his innocence throughout the trial and often referred to it as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nLeavitt had a TV studio built in her home so that she could appear on television shortly after giving birth.\n\n\"I felt compelled to be present in this historic moment,\" she told The Conservateur. \"The president literally put his life on the line to win this election. The least I could do is get back to work quickly.\"\n\nAs press secretary, Leavitt established a \"new media seat\" in the White House briefing room reserved for podcasters, social media influencers, and other independent content creators who, \"despite being some of the most viewed news websites in the country, have not been given seats in this room,\" she said at a briefing.\n\nLeavitt was introduced to Riccio, a real-estate developer, at a campaign event by a mutual friend during her 2022 run for Congress.\n\nThey announced their engagement on Christmas in 2023 and welcomed a son, Niko, on July 10, 2024.\n\nLeavitt and Riccio wed on January 4, 2025, days before Trump's second inauguration. Leavitt spoke about their 32-year age gap in a February 2025 interview on The Megyn Kelly Show.\n\n\"I mean, it's a very atypical love story, but he's incredible,\" she said of Riccio, adding, \"He's the father of my child, and he's the best dad I could ever ask for. And he is so supportive, especially during a very chaotic period of life.\"\n\nIn a November interview with Miranda Devine on the podcast \"Pod Force One,\" Leavitt spoke about her parents' reaction to her \"unusual\" relationship with Riccio, who is older than her mother.\n\n\"It's definitely a challenging conversation to have at first,\" she said. \"But then, of course, once they got to know him and saw who he is as a man and his character and how much he adores me, I think it became quite easy for them.\"\n\nOn December 26, Leavitt announced that she and Riccio are expecting a baby girl in May, making her the first-ever pregnant White House press secretary.\n\n\"My husband and I are thrilled to grow our family and can't wait to watch our son become a big brother,\" she wrote in an Instagram post.",

    "description": "I flew first class with Delta for the first time. I was surprised by the food, in-seat amenities, and bathroom products.",
    "fullText": "I've been seeing Sky Priority signs in Delta terminals for years, but I never stopped to read them before flying first class.\n\nSky Priority is essentially a fast lane through check-in and security for Delta Medallion Members and premium-class passengers. Although not all of these perks are available at every airport, both were present at John F. Kennedy International Airport, where I flew out of. My first-class ticket also included two checked bags, but I didn't have any.\n\nI have TSA PreCheck, which was faster than the Sky Priority security lane, according to the airline employee I spoke with. Still, I thought this was a nice perk for travelers who aren't enrolled in the program.\n\nBeing among the first to board the aircraft was a completely new experience for me. Once inside the first-class cabin, I spotted a mini water bottle at every seat. As I was settling in, a flight attendant came by to take our beverage orders.\n\nI wasn't expecting such quick service, and I hadn't considered what other drink I'd want. I was also nervous as a first-timer in the cabin, so I just blurted out \"no, thank you\" without thinking. The attendant handed me another bottle of water anyway.\n\nAs the economy passengers began filtering in, many passengers in my cabin were already sipping on coffee or soda.\n\nI'm used to finding power outlets, USB ports, and audio jacks on the seat in front of me. In first class, all of these amenities were above my armrest.\n\nBefore meal service, flight attendants asked us to pull out our tray tables. This is when I realized there was no tray table on the seat in front of me. Confused, I observed the passenger beside me pull theirs out from the armrest and unfold it. It was bigger than any tray table I'd ever used.\n\nThe flight included complimentary breakfast, and a flight attendant came around with a basket of snacks before and after meal service. There seemed to be no limit on how many we could take.\n\nI thought the complimentary breakfast menu would be basic — maybe an egg sandwich or oatmeal. So I was surprised when the flight attendant listed the options: a potato and bacon frittata, Greek yogurt with chia pudding, or a dark chocolate pistachio bread pudding.\n\nCraving a balanced meal, I ordered the frittata, and I'm glad I did. Unlike most airplane food I've tried, the dish was well seasoned with a variety of textures and flavors. There was a side of bacon with a sweet maple glaze, sautéed spinach, and cherry tomatoes that paired well with the potato-filled frittata.\n\nThe meal also came with two sides I didn't anticipate — yogurt and a croissant.\n\nI didn't even need to use the bathroom during the short flight, but I had to see if it was any different from the ones in economy class.\n\nIt had the same small size and layout, but there was one key difference — the products. The hand soap and lotion were from Grown Alchemist, a luxury skincare brand. These products are exclusive to first class, a Delta representative told Business Insider.\n\nTypically, I consider the start of a vacation to be when I arrive at my destination. The flight is nothing more than a means to an end.\n\nHowever, with VIP treatment, flying first class made me feel like I was on vacation from the moment I stepped on board. And to me, that was the biggest surprise of all.",

    "fullText": "First came Russia’s “turtle tank”, a metal shed rumbling across the battlefield. Then Ukraine laughed at the so-called “hairy tank”, coated in long, wavy metal wires.\n\nNow the “dandelion tank” has arrived.\n\nMoscow’s latest crude design, which features flexible metal rods arranged in branched layers, attempts to shield the body of the tank from the ever-present threat of small kamikaze drones.\n\nIt may look ridiculous, but analysts say the Oduvanchik (dandelion) anti-drone armour might offer the best protection currently available for the expensive vehicles.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of odd-looking Russian inventions that have appeared over the past week, each inspiring some level of mockery online. They include a camouflage net disguised as rubble and a patent for giant rotating propellers to protect Soviet-era vans.\n\nBut in such a protracted and largely static war, which demands endless innovation at cheaper and cheaper costs, any edge may save lives at the front.\n\nThe unorthodox dandelion-inspired modification was pictured for the first time last week, covering a Russian T-90M tank inside a warehouse. It is unclear when it will be deployed for combat, but Russia’s defence ministry recently patented the design.\n\nThe reinforced metal rods are welded together to form a tree-like structure that branches out into several tiers, forming a three-dimensional barrier, like the florets of a dandelion. In any gaps, a high-strength mesh is stretched between them.\n\nIf an explosive-rigged FPV (first-person-view) drone flies towards the tank, the rods should detonate it at a distance, shielding the hull from most of the blast. For every extra inch the drone is kept away, the tank has a better chance of survival.\n\nOn top of a T-90’s significant base armour, Russia often adds explosive reactive armour and metal cages. Pair this with the dandelion defence and “you’ve got the best passive anti-drone protection currently available,” David Axe, a military correspondent, wrote on his blog, Trench Art.\n\nIt is an upgrade of the “hedgehog” armour, of thick broom-like bristles protruding from a vehicle’s side, used across the front by Russian forces last year, and later by the Ukrainians.\n\n“At the front, anything you can experiment with, all different kinds of spikes, chains, cages, or a mixture of all, that can save the lives of soldiers is worth doing,” said David Kirichenko, a Ukraine-Russia weapons expert.\n\n“Ukrainian soldiers once mocked the Russians for putting cages on their vehicles; now they are doing it too,” he told The Telegraph.\n\nUkrainian forces were pictured earlier this week showing off a new design on a large infantry fighting vehicle that featured dandelion-like anti-drone armour, hair-like bristles, and metal sheets hanging from chains.\n\n“It is a part of [the] endless development of experimental and wacky inventions by both sides,” said Mr Kirichenko. “There is a constant race to identify weaknesses, produce measures and countermeasures and adapt to changing battlefield conditions.”\n\nYet, as with many other anti-drone systems, there are drawbacks. All the extra gear adds to the vehicle’s weight, slowing it down and leaving it more exposed to the drones that haunt the front.\n\nPlus, the dandelion armour is far from impregnable. Ukraine is proving increasingly efficient at flying drones beneath tanks and vehicles to strike them from below, where the armour is weakest, or to use FPVs to drop mines in their path.\n\nValerii Riabykh, a Ukrainian weapons analyst and editor of Defence Express, also pointed out how such protection was “ineffective against traditional weapons, such as an artillery shell, especially a high-precision one.”\n\nBut when it comes to drones, he said: “It may be effective for some time until the opposing side picks up the key to this protection, or breaks it.”\n\nIt can disguise gun, artillery or infantry positions underneath a rug of fake smashed-up bricks that look like rubble and rubbish, hiding equipment from Ukrainian drone operators.\n\nMr Riabykh said that, like the dandelion tank, it would probably only be useful for a limited time.\n\nWith the rise of AI and image processing tools installed within drones, its specific features could automatically highlight the nets to drone operators, he said, becoming an “unmasking feature which will lead to even faster destruction of those who use them”.\n\nAnother rudimentary tactic that emerged last week is the use of large propellers mounted on the roof, front, rear and sides of civilian vehicles used at the front.\n\nShort on modern armoured vehicles, Russia has for two years been using vans, trucks and jeeps for front-line tasks. Such unprotected vehicles are easy targets for Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a Russian patent, when the drone attempts to attack a protected vehicle, “there is a high probability that he will enter the rotation zone of one of the blades”.\n\nAnalysts The Telegraph spoke to largely dismissed such a design, owing to how much of the van is exposed and the fact that the propellers probably cost more than the vehicle they are intended to protect.\n\nYet any modifications, no matter how seemingly trivial, could allow either side to buy time, said Mr Riabykh, “and time on the modern battlefield is everything”.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "China can narrow its technological gap with the U.S. driven by growing risk-taking and innovation, though the lack of advanced chipmaking tools is hobbling",
    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 10 (Reuters) - China can narrow its technological gap with the U.S. driven by growing risk-taking and innovation, though the lack of advanced chipmaking tools is hobbling the ​sector, the country's leading artificial intelligence researchers said on Saturday.\n\nChina's so-called 'AI tiger' startups MiniMax and Zhipu ‌AI had strong debuts on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week, reflecting growing confidence in the sector as Beijing fast-tracks AI and ‌chip listings to bolster domestic alternatives to advanced U.S. technology.\n\nYao Shunyu, a former senior researcher at ChatGPT maker OpenAI who was named technology giant Tencent's chief AI scientist in December, said there was a high likelihood of a Chinese firm becoming the world's leading AI company in the next three to five years but said the lack of ⁠advanced chipmaking machines was the main ‌technical hurdle.\n\n\"Currently, we have a significant advantage in electricity and infrastructure. The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,\" Yao said at an AI ‍conference in Beijing.\n\nChina has completed a working prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine potentially capable of producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips that rival the West's, Reuters reported last month. However, the machine has not yet produced working chips and may not do ​so until 2030, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nYao and other Chinese industry ‌leaders at the Beijing conference on Saturday also acknowledged that the U.S. maintains an advantage in computing power due to its hefty investments in infrastructure.\n\n\"The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours. But I see that whether it's OpenAI or other platforms, they're investing heavily in next-generation research,\" said Lin Junyang, technical lead for Alibaba's flagship Qwen large language model.\n\n\"We, on the other hand, are relatively strapped for ⁠cash; delivery alone likely consumes the majority of our computer infrastructure,\" ​Lin said during a panel discussion at the AGI-Next Frontier Summit ​held by the Beijing Key Laboratory of Foundational Models at Tsinghua University.\n\nLin said China's limited resources have spurred its researchers to be innovative, particularly through algorithm-hardware co-design, which enables AI ‍firms to run large models ⁠on smaller, inexpensive hardware.\n\nTang Jie, founder of Zhipu AI which raised HK$4.35 billion in its IPO, also highlighted the willingness of younger Chinese AI entrepreneurs to embrace high-risk ventures - a trait traditionally associated ⁠with Silicon Valley - as a positive development.\n\n\"I think if we can improve this environment, allowing more time for these risk-taking, intelligent individuals ‌to engage in innovative endeavours ... this is something our government and the country can help improve,\" ‌said Tang.",

    "title": "I review TVs for a living, and these are the new models and display trends I'm most excited about in 2026",
    "description": "Samsung, TCL, Hisense, and LG all revealed new TVs at CES 2026. Here are the top display models and tech advancements announced at the show.",
    "fullText": "The CES trade show is the premier event for showcasing extravagant new consumer tech concepts and prototypes. This year's show, held in Las Vegas from January 6 to 9, was no different. But mixed in with all the spectacle were plenty of announcements for products you'll actually be able to buy, including an assortment of brand-new TVs.\n\nI've been reviewing home theater gear for over a decade, so I know that not every display breakthrough sticks. With that in mind, I've separated the real upgrades from the marketing fog to find the top TVs and display trends from CES. And this year, one takeaway is clear: TV brands are pushing Micro RGB. This type of display promises a significant upgrade in color performance. At the same time, OLED makers are coming out swinging with brighter panels, and brands are continuing to expand their extra-large screen offerings with TVs as big as 130 inches.\n\nBelow, I've detailed the top five TV advancements I'm most excited about from CES, outlining a few clear themes that could shape what you'll be shopping for in 2026. Though exact pricing and release dates are still pending, all of the TVs highlighted below are expected to be available this year. For more display recommendations, be sure to visit my complete guide to all of the best TVs you can buy right now.\n\nIf I had to pick one trend to represent the TV industry's biggest push for 2026, it would be Micro RGB. Samsung, Hisense, LG, and TCL are all offering some variation of this technology, and it dominated the announcements out of CES.\n\nMicro RGB TVs, also called RGB Mini LED TVs by some companies, are a type of LED TV that use a new kind of backlighting system designed to offer a big boost in color performance. Rather than using a backlight with white or blue light and then relying on a filter to produce colors, Micro RGB TVs have individual red, blue, and green LEDs. Hisense is taking this approach even further by adding cyan to certain models. Using a backlight system like this enables purer color production and a wider range of hues. At the end of the day, this should translate to a more colorful and brighter image than you'd see on a typical LED, QLED, Mini LED, or OLED TV.\n\nThe first two Micro RGB TVs from Samsung and Hisense actually hit the market last year, but they were limited to a 116-inch and 115-inch model that cost a staggering $30,000 each. Though pricing hasn't been confirmed yet, brands are releasing a bigger lineup of Micro RGB TVs this year, with sizes starting at 55 inches. This is exciting since it should translate to much more affordable options. Most notably, shoppers should keep an eye on the Samsung R85H series, the Hisense UR8 and UR9 series, and the TCL RM9L Series, which have the best chance of featuring this new tech at consumer-friendly prices.\n\nAlthough most brands are promoting Micro RGB as the next big thing in TV technology, TCL is taking a different approach. The company is still releasing Micro RGB models this year, but it's positioning a different kind of TV as its flagship offering. TCL refers to this display type as \"SQD,\" which stands for Super Quantum Dots.\n\nIn essence, SQD TVs are an evolution of QLED TVs. They still use white or blue backlights but incorporate a layer of super quantum dot crystals, which are larger than the standard type, along with an Ultra Color Filter. That's a lot of tech jargon, but in practice, TCL says this combination results in colors that rival or surpass those of Micro RGB TVs while avoiding potential flaws that RGB backlight systems can introduce. SQD TVs can also get incredibly bright, with TCL stating that its premium model can reach up to 10,000 nits, which would match the highest brightness that any consumer TV has achieved.\n\nTCL's first SQD TV, the X11L, is already available for preorder in an 85-inch size ($8,000). A 75-inch ($7,000) and 98-inch ($10,000) size are also set to launch soon. Though far from cheap, those prices aren't unreasonable for a new high-end TV technology, and TCL is known for offering huge discounts throughout the year. Likewise, SQD technology will also be used on the brand's step-down QM8L and QM7L, which are expected to be released later this year and will likely cost substantially less.\n\nI'll be reviewing the X11L soon, so check back for full details on its performance.\n\nThough I'm excited to check out new Micro RGB and SQD TVs this year, it's important not to forget about OLEDs. The best OLED TVs remain some of the most impressive displays you can buy, and I don't see that changing in 2026. Both LG and Samsung announced new flagship OLED models that promise boosts in brightness and new design perks.\n\nThe LG G6 will succeed the G5, which was my favorite high-end TV of 2025. LG says the G6 can get 20% brighter than the G5. Since the G5 was already the brightest OLED available, that's a notable improvement. The G6 will also boast improved reflection handling via a new polarizer filter, which LG says will cut reflections in half while maintaining deep black levels. Reflections have been a pain point for some LG OLED buyers, so this could be a big perk. LG is also bringing back its striking Wallpaper OLED in the form of the new LG W6. This ultra-thin TV is only 9mm thick and uses a wireless connection box to keep your wall free from cables.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung is launching the S95H as the successor to its S95F. Samsung says this new model can get 35% brighter than the S95F, which could make it even brighter than the G6. In addition, the TV uses a new metal art-style bezel that gives it a look \n\nUltimately, I expect new Micro RGB and SQD TVs to have an edge in color and brightness over top OLEDs, but the G6 and S95H will deliver higher contrast, which could still result in better overall image quality. Time will tell, but I'm excited to see how the latest premium OLEDs stack up against 2026's other new TV offerings.\n\nOver the last few years, TV brands have been expanding their extra-large screen offerings, with an increasing number of 75-inch and larger options. In 2025, we saw more 98-, 100-, 115-, and 116-inch models than ever before. That trend will continue in 2026, and some brands are taking it even further with massive 130-inch screens.\n\nSamsung's 130-inch R95H is the most notable super-sized TV set to be released this year. This is Samsung's flagship Micro RGB model, so it should offer some of the most impressive brightness and color capabilities of any TV in 2026. And it will offer that incredible performance in an absolutely massive screen size. It also boasts a unique stand that Samsung calls its \"Timeless Frame\" design, which makes it appear as though the TV is floating within the stand that surrounds it. Pricing details have not been revealed, but I expect this one to be exclusive to luxury buyers.\n\nAlso of special note is a new 98-inch Samsung LS03H Frame TV, the largest Frame TV the brand has ever produced. Frame TVs are popular for their art-style designs with thin wall mounts and magnetic bezels. However, unlike previous Frame models, this new 98-inch option will have its ports built into the TV, rather than using a separate box. It will also come with a bezel rather than requiring buyers to purchase one separately.\n\nSamsung's Frame TVs are popular displays for design-focused shoppers, and brands like Hisense and TCL both offer their own take on art-style TVs. At CES 2026, LG revealed its own entry into the frame TV market with the new Gallery TV.\n\nThe Gallery TV features all the essentials that other art-inspired sets offer, including the ability to mount flush on your wall, an anti-glare screen to help mimic the look of canvas, and support for magnetic bezel attachments, allowing you to alter the frame style. LG is also launching a new Gallery+ service with access to more than 4,500 works of art, pieces of animation, and other images. The Gallery TV will use a Mini LED panel, but it's not clear if it will have any kind of dimming capabilities. Based on what has been announced so far, it appears poised to compete with Samsung's higher-end Frame Pro model.\n\nAlthough the Gallery TV with frame is unlikely to substantially outperform any existing frame-style TVs in overall image quality, the arrival of another art-focused TV is an exciting development for design-focused shoppers seeking more options. Pricing is still pending, but the Gallery TV with frame will be available in 55- and 65-inch sizes later this year.",

    "description": "If you're visiting Switzerland for the first time, avoid these common travel and itinerary mistakes that'll cost you money, time, or joy on your trip.",
    "fullText": "Though I'm a US citizen, I've spent the past five years living in Switzerland.\n\nAs a semi-recent transplant, I know there's much more to this amazing country than what visitors typically come to see. It's one best experienced thoughtfully and authentically — not by mindlessly racing through \"Top 10 \" lists.\n\nIn terms of mistakes tourists make, here are a few things I suggest you know — and avoid — before visiting Switzerland for the first time.\n\nZermatt, Lauterbrunnen, Interlaken, and Lucerne are popular, jaw-dropping locations, but they're not the only spots worth visiting in Switzerland.\n\nInstead of only seeing the few places on every tourist's list, consider branching out to smaller, lesser-visited ones for at least a day trip. Fortunately, many are easily accessible by public transportation out of some of the area's main hubs.\n\nFor example, close to Interlaken are the mountain villages of Frutigen, Kandersteg, and Adelboden, which offer gorgeous alpine views combined with fewer crowds and more authentic experiences.\n\nIn Switzerland, dining out can seem expensive — in part because the cost of production, labor, and relevant service charges are typically already included in the price of the meal.\n\nPersonally, I find the prices easier to stomach when I remember you're often paying for high-quality, regional fare, and restaurant staff here are typically earning a fair wage.\n\nAnd although tipping servers 15% to 20% of a bill is standard practice in places like the US, it's not the norm here. If you enjoyed the meal and the service, it's customary to round up a few francs or leave a tip between 5% and 10%.\n\nSwitzerland is a popular travel destination throughout the year, and its major attractions can fill up quickly — especially seats on our world-famous scenic routes.\n\nIf you plan on riding the Glacier Express or Bernina Express, book your train tickets as far in advance as possible.\n\nHowever, don't fret if you realize it's too late to book a seat on a scenic route. You'll be just fine on our \"regular\" trains, which tend to run faster, not book up as quickly, and still offer beautiful views.\n\nWhen traveling by train, it's important to double-check your ticket class and location. (And, if you have a paper ticket, get it validated.)\n\nSignage indicating first or second class can be found both outside and inside each car. Oftentimes, the class is also noted on the headrests of the seats themselves.\n\nTicketing agents on board will not hesitate to issue an on-the-spot fine for tourists seated in the wrong class. In addition to a fine of about 100 francs, you'll also have to pay the difference in price for the ticket.\n\nAlso, pay attention to where your seats are before entering each car so you won't have to lug an oversized suitcase through the entire train.\n\nSwitzerland is one of the smallest countries in Europe, at about 16,000 square miles. However, I've seen tourists mistakenly assume they can just zip through and see everything it has to offer in just three or four days.\n\nFor example, Zurich may seem close to Geneva on a map, but they are actually about three hours apart by train. Sure, you could also opt for a one-hour flight — but my point is that trying to see so many cities in a short period won't allow you to truly get a feel for each.\n\nTravel is about experiencing a place, not just visiting to check it off a bucket list. If you've only got a week in Switzerland, I suggest you limit yourself to exploring two or three cities instead of trying to cram six or seven single-night stays in new places into your itinerary.\n\nSwitzerland is composed of 26 cantons, and each of these administrative regions has its own distinct culture, government, and history. They also don't all speak the same languages.\n\nAlthough you'll find English speakers throughout the country — especially in popular tourist areas — Switzerland actually has four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh.\n\nIt's helpful to learn a few basic greetings in those major languages and ensure you use them in the appropriate region.\n\nAlso, it's handy to become familiar with some of the commonly used symbols — especially when it comes to trash cans.\n\nThe Swiss are conscientious recyclers, so take a beat to look up the symbols printed on the bins before tossing something in them if you are confused. Your mindfulness will be appreciated",

    "description": "The 77-year-old psychologist Dale Atkins shares six practical rules she uses to build healthier relationships with her grandchildren.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dale Atkins, author of \"The Turquoise Butterfly.\" It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI learned everything I know about being a grandparent from watching my own mother with my sons. She loved spending time with my kids, doing anything and everything they wanted to do. We were lucky that she was active and engaged until she died at 98.\n\nToday, I'm 77, and I'm a grandmother myself to six teenagers and young adults — all of whom remember their great-grandmother. As a psychologist, I'm very interested in intergenerational relationships. They have so much potential, but can also be fraught with challenges.\n\nI use these six steps to build healthier relationships.\n\nThe best way to build rapport with your grandchildren is by simply showing up and showing interest. My mother did this, traveling to swim meets and holiday parties, even when she would have rather been in her garden. Even if you're not interested in the same things as your grandkid, it's OK to pretend — they'll appreciate it.\n\nIf you're sharing an experience, like taking your grandkid to a museum, don't try to teach. Instead, sit back and see what catches their interest. Later, bring that up and see where the conversation leads.\n\nThe role of a grandparent is to support their children and grandchildren. Really try to understand how you can be helpful. Sometimes, that means putting your own wants aside.\n\nI worked with a mother of three who was planning her daughter's birthday. One grandmother visited from far away, and the little girl was fascinated with her, like a new toy. The local grandmother was so upset at being second fiddle that she sulked through the party, adding to the stress for the mother. Ultimately, the grandmother's selfish behavior only damaged her own relationship with her daughter.\n\nIt's OK to have expectations in a relationship, but they can create conflict if they're not clearly articulated. I see this all the time between grandparents and their own children. A grandparent might feel that paying for a child's schooling gives them the entitlement to critique educational decisions, for example.\n\nIf you choose to give, it's best not to expect anything in return. If you do expect something — like weekly family dinners in exchange for occasional babysitting — convey that to your family, and have an honest conversation. It's OK to ask for things, but not to demand or threaten.\n\nWhen we're talking about grandparents and grandkids, we're discussing people who come from different eras, belief systems, and cultural traditions. It's essential to acknowledge that each family member — child, parents, and grandparents — brings their own unique experiences.\n\nSome experiences and values we're able to share. Others, we're not. It can be frustrating if your grandchildren aren't interested in a story you feel is important, but oftentimes, they can't understand it the same way you can, having lived through it.\n\nOlder people are the keepers of memories, and we often feel pressure to pass those stories on to the next generations. Yet, for many children, these stories are boring. Instead of launching into a family history lesson, share little snippets that really pique the kids' interests. If you leave them wanting more and sharing the history, it will become more fun for all of you.\n\nWhether it's with your grandkids or children, asking more questions is always beneficial. Instead of saying \"That's not how we did it in my day,\" ask with genuine curiosity about a new parenting approach you're seeing. If you truly want to know more, your family will recognize that and be happy to share.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's $100 billion plan to invest in Venezuela's oil industry was met with a muted response from US energy executives on Friday.\n\nWhile the promise to revive Venezuela's oil industry drew praise from many in attendance at the White House meeting, no concrete pledges were made, and Exxon CEO Darren Woods went as far as to describe the country as \"uninvestable\" at present.\n\n\"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela — today, it's uninvestable,\" Woods said.\n\n\"Significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system,\" he continued. \"There has to be durable investment protections, and there has to be change to the hydrocarbon laws in the country.\"\n\nWoods said he was nevertheless \"confident\" the US could help bring about the necessary changes, adding that Exxon would look to send a technical team to Venezuela to assess the state of operations.\n\nTrump has been pushing for major US oil firms to pump money into Venezuelan energy infrastructure since the capture of Nicolás Maduro last week.\n\nTrump, who promised companies \"total safety and security\" to operate in Venezuela, previously said the US could reimburse oil companies for expanding their operations in the South American nation, which has the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nHarold Hamm, the founder of Continental Resources and a longtime Trump supporter, appeared to dodge a question on whether his firm would be entering the country, saying it presented \"challenges\" but that it excited him \"as an explorationist.\"\n\nTrump appeared unfazed by the notes of caution, but he reminded those present that he had \"25 people that aren't here today that are willing to take your place.\"\n\nMark Nelson, the vice chairman of Chevron — which partners with Venezuela's national oil company PDVSA on production projects in the country — sounded a more positive tone.\n\nNelson said Chevron was \"committed\" to the country and that it may increase production by around 50% over the next 18 to 24 months.\n\nThe oil industry had gathered with Trump and other senior figures from his administration to discuss how the US planned to move forward in Venezuela following the ouster of Maduro.\n\nThe US has said the raid on Caracas was a law enforcement operation and has indicted Maduro on drugs and weapons charges.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Denise Warner. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor the last 39 years, I've had the same photo either emailed or texted to me on every single February 18th, the date my dad died.\n\nIt's a photo of an old, unopened can of Miller Lite sitting in the fridge, from my dad's best friend, Tommy. It's from the last pack of beers they shared together.\n\nWhen I was a young teenager, Tommy, who worked with him at a factory in Niagara, New York, and my dad would sit on lawn chairs in our open, single-car garage with a couple of beers, watching me and all the neighborhood kids play sports.\n\nWe had a huge yard, and all the kids — several of whom were family members of mine — gathered at my place to play softball, football, baseball, hockey, and basketball. Dad and Tommy would provide a running commentary, always super funny.\n\nI adored my dad as a teenager, but we hadn't always been close.\n\nAs a young child, I don't remember seeing my dad a lot — he was always working at the factory or at sporting events after dinner. I often wondered where he was.\n\nBut when my mom moved to Florida when I was 14 to open a restaurant, traveling back and forth between the two locations, it forced my dad and me into a closer relationship.\n\nI remember watching football with him, ordering pizza on repeat for dinner, and him learning to cook. He perfected his Fettuccini Alfredo recipe — it's still the best I've ever had.\n\nOnce, I skipped school with friends, hoping we wouldn't get caught by anyone in the street. The doorbell rang while we were watching daytime soap operas, and when I looked out the window, I saw my dad's friend Joey, who owned a pizzeria, outside holding a pizza. He told me my dad had ordered it for us. How he knew we had skipped school — I still will never know.\n\nDuring these years, my love for my dad grew exponentially.\n\nSo when he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer when I was 18, I was devastated. He was only 43. He'd had a lot of stomach problems for years, but wouldn't go to the doctor. When he finally did, they said he had a tumor at the base of his stomach, where it meets the esophagus. When they opened him up to operate, they decided it was too big to operate on. They started him on chemo and radiation, but months later, he died.\n\nTommy was the one who drove my family home from the hospital after Dad breathed his last breath.\n\nSoon after, Tommy sent me a photo of the beer can. It was part of the last pack of beers he'd bought to drink with my dad in the garage. He now sends me the same photo every year on the day my dad died.\n\nFebruary 18 could be a sad day for me every year, a reminder of my dad's death. But instead, it's a reminder of the endless happy memories I had in our front yard with my dad. I honestly can't recall one bad memory from those years when it was just my dad and me.\n\nAs an adult, I appreciate that it was my dad out there on the streets playing with us kids. Other parents have been doing very responsible things in the house — working, cleaning, or sorting — but dad was where the fun was at.\n\nEveryone knew him, and everyone loved him. And that beer can is a yearly reminder of just how special my dad was. Such a simple gesture — sending that photo — but it has kept my dad's memory alive for nearly 40 years.",

    "description": "One of Crystal Roure's last acts alive was to tell her 12-year-old son to get out of the house and call 911. Her family believes it saved his life.",
    "fullText": "As a single mom, Crystal Roure was fiercely protective of her children.\n\nSo when she started dating a handsome man from church, Crystal didn’t introduce him right away. In fact, she waited until they had dated for a full year before he met the kids.\n\n“She took her time,\" Crystal's sister, Stephanie Roure, told USA TODAY this week. \"She did have a happy glow that I haven't seen in a long time ... My sister trusted him and fell in love with him. She finally found her happy ever after.\"\n\nBut on Dec. 22, just two years after Crystal married Jason Kenney, he would end up killing her and shooting her 13-year-old daughter in the face in their Florida home − all over an argument about watching a football game three days before Christmas, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Kenney later fatally shot himself.\n\nThe crime during the December holidays shocked the nation.\n\n“The 13-year-old girl begged not to be shot – ‘Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me,’” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a news conference the week of the attack. “And he shot her twice.”\n\nNow as Crystal's family reels from grief and shock, USA TODAY is telling her story and how she used her final moments alive to save her children.\n\nFrom an early age, Crystal Roure showed ambition and a commitment to hard work.\n\nHer sister Stephanie recalled how Crystal did well in school and thrived when she got her first job at T.G.I. Friday's as a teenager, quickly graduating from hostess to server.\n\n\"What set her apart from others was she didn't just work for a paycheck ... she worked for the experience,\" Stephanie said. \"She worked for the knowledge. She worked to prove to herself she was able to do things and not give up.\"\n\nBut when she became a mom at the age of 25, \"everything she did from that moment on was for her children.\"\n\n\"She worked harder and longer,\" Stephanie said. \"And somehow she was superwoman. She managed to hold down a full-time job and being a full-time mother.\"\n\nThough Crystal had to juggle work and the kids all while being single, she didn't miss a school function, award ceremony or field trip. She also managed to buy a house all on her own, \"because she was a smart woman,\" Stephanie said.\n\n\"Her children were her world. She worked hard for them, to provide for them. She protected them,\" she said. \"They came first before anything.\"\n\nEarly in the relationship, Facebook photos show the pair smiling and kissing each other in many selfies. Other show them and the kids looking like a picture-perfect family, posing in front of a Christmas tree and at a baseball game.\n\nBut sometime after they married on Nov. 4, 2023, Stephanie said: \"My sister lost that glow she had.\"\n\nAt first, Stephanie chalked up the change to the fact that Crystal became pregnant with her third child pretty quickly after the wedding.\n\n\"I remember asking her, 'Are you OK?'\" Stephanie said. \"She said, 'Yes,' it's just this pregnancy was really kicking her butt because she was much older.\"\n\nThough Stephanie said she always had an \"ehh\" feeling about Kenney, she thought her sister was happy and safe.\n\nThat is until she got the worst phone call of her life.\n\nCrystal and her three kids spent the evening of Dec. 22 by the Christmas tree at their home in Highland City, just east of Tampa. Meanwhile Kenney was in his shed, drinking and watching Monday Night Football until about 11 p.m., Sheriff Judd said.\n\nWhen Kenney went inside the home and wanted to continue watching the game, a fight ensued. It became so scary that Crystal told her 12-year-old son to run to a neighbor's house and call 911, Judd said.\n\nAs the boy ran out, he heard the first gunshot. Responding deputies found Crystal dead inside, her 13-year-old daughter shot in the face and shoulder, and Jason Kenney gone. They also found a letter Crystal wrote to her husband telling him: \"You're drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God.\"\n\nThe 1-year-old daughter the couple shared was unharmed. The 13-year-old survived the gunshot wound after the bullet hit the bridge of her nose and deflected through the top of her head, Judd said.\n\nAfter shooting his wife and step-daughter, Kenney drove in his truck to his late father's home and called his sister to say he had \"done something very, very bad\" and that it was the last time they would ever talk, Judd said.\n\nDeputies tracked Kenney down to a shed on his father's property. When they called for him to come out, they heard a single gunshot and found Kenney dead inside.\n\nJudd said that a relative told deputies that Kenney had been beating on Crystal \"for a while,\" though the sheriff's office has no records of any domestic violence calls or charges. Jason Kenney had no criminal history, Judd said.\n\n\"He absolutely destroyed a family,\" Judd said. \"When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under the tree, just like the nuclear family should be ... and it ends up this way.\"\n\nCrystal's family is leaning on each other as they absorb the shock of her murder and raising funds for the children. Crystal's 13-year-old daughter \"is doing well on her recovery\" and \"it really is a miracle that the bullet missed every major thing,\" Stephanie said.\n\nAs for any abuse leading up to the tragedy, Stephanie said it's possible but she wasn't aware of any.\n\n\"After they were married I know she said he was drinking a lot more but she said that he was going to stop and said he would get help with it. Obviously that didn't happen,\" she said, adding that when she went over to visit, Kenney would \"sit outside in the shed playing games on his phone and smoking his cigarettes.\"\n\n\"If there was abuse happening he must have scared her to the point not to say or do anything because the type of person my sister was she would have left at the first sight of trouble because she would protect her kids,\" she said. \"But that's a question we'll never have answers to.\"\n\nStephanie said she's angry that Kenney killed her sister and tried to kill her niece but that she's so proud of Crystal and her nephew's actions that night.\n\n\"My sister died a hero for protecting her children and getting my nephew out of the house to make the 911 call,\" she said. \"She did that. She saved their lives and by doing so my nephew saved his sister's life, and thank God the baby was untouched.\"\n\nStephanie said she is going to do her best to teach her 1-year-old niece all about who her mom was.\n\n\"I will never let these kids forget the love and strength and courage she had for them,\" she said. \"They will always know that she loved them and put them first.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Florida mom of three killed by husband over NFL game 'died a hero'",

    "fullText": "Following the publication of a report in The New York Times on Friday night revealing that the Washington National Opera will be leaving the Kennedy Center, members of the Trump administration immediately began scrambling to reframe the news as not only a positive, but their idea.\n\nKennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi, who has been hard at work lashing out at artists for canceling scheduled performances at the once-revered venue, posted a statement to X claiming that the center’s relationship with the opera group has “presented ongoing financial challenges for well over a decade” that “long predate the current leadership.”\n\n“Given the longstanding financial strain, it has become necessary for us to part ways to protect the best interests of the Center,” Daravi wrote.\n\nThe statement was then amplified by the venue’s Donald Trump-appointed executive director Richard Grenell, who elaborated on the difficulties surrounding exclusivity agreements.\n\n“Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety,” Grenell wrote on X. “We approached the Opera leadership last year with this idea and they began to be open to it.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, he wrote, “The exclusive Opera contract cost the Trump Kennedy Center $64 million over the last 10 years—with their expenses being double their revenues.”\n\n“We were very pleased that the current Opera leadership was so willing to end their exclusivity,” he noted.\n\nThe New York Times report states that the decision to sever ties was made by the Washington National Opera, with the board of trustees approving a resolution on Friday that will enable the group to terminate its agreement with the venue.\n\n“Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” a statement provided to The New York Times said.\n\nOpera officials told the paper that new venues in Washington D.C. have been lined up but that no leases have been signed. They declined to name specific venues.\n\nWith the passing of the resolution, the WNO will now seek to move its performances out of the center’s opera house and reduce the number of performances staged there.\n\nThe decision marks the end of a partnership between the Kennedy Center and the WNO that dates back to 1971.\n\nWhile the WNO did not mention the Kennedy Center’s MAGA rebrand as the reason for its departure, they have noted disagreements with new requirements that have been made under the cultural center’s new management.\n\nSeveral well-known performers have canceled planned events since President Donald Trump’s takeover of the center, which saw him fire the board in order to populate it with his allies and install himself as chair.\n\nTrump further ignited tensions when he attempted to rebrand the center to bear his name, ignoring the fact that any formal change requires congressional action. A lawsuit was filed shortly after, challenging the rebrand.\n\nIn response to Trump’s actions, several artists have canceled planned appearances at the performing arts venue, including comedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, and Grammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck.\n\nOn Thursday, singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos canceled her Feb. 7 performance at the Kennedy Center, citing her Mexican heritage and the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the reasons behind her decision.\n\n“As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,” the Grammy-nominated musician wrote on Thursday. “Unfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.”",

    "fullText": "If you are considering buying a new vehicle in 2026, the White House just gave you some great news.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 7, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the government is working on a significant tax break that would offer some much-needed relief to car buyers who are struggling to afford a new vehicle.\n\nGM: 2.83 million vehicles (+5.1% year over year); 17.3% market share\n\nToyota: 2.52 million vehicles (+8.4% YoY); 15.5% market share\n\nFord: 2.18 million vehicles (+5.6% YoY); 13.4% market share\n\nHyundai: 1.84 million vehicles (+7.9% YoY); 11.3% market share\n\nHonda: 1.42 million vehicles (+0.6% YoY); 8.8% market share\n\nThe Treasury announced it is implementing a No Tax on American Car Loan Interest rule that offers eligible taxpayers a $10,000 deduction per year in auto loan interest for cars purchased during Trump’s second term.\n\n“For millions of Americans, a car isn’t a luxury, it’s how you get to work, school, and childcare,” Bessent said on X.\n\n“This deduction helps lower monthly costs and makes car ownership more affordable when families need it most. The tax cut also supports American workers by applying solely to U.S.-assembled vehicles, strengthening domestic manufacturing,” he said.\n\nBessent explained that the Treasury and the IRS are issuing clear rules on the tax break “so taxpayers know exactly how the deduction works.”\n\nBut only certain cars will be eligible for the tax break. Here are the criteria for taking advantage of the new rules.\n\nIn his X announcement, Secretary Bessent stated that U.S.-assembled vehicles purchased between 2025 and 2028 will be eligible for the tax credit; however, the program is somewhat more restrictive than the announcement suggests.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, lays out the requirements for new car buyers to receive the relief. Individual car buyers making more than $100,000 and couples making more than $200,000 would see the benefits begin to phase out.\n\nThe tax credit will only go to buyers who purchase cars assembled in the U.S. So even if you’re buying a Toyota, as long as it’s one of the nearly 2 million vehicles the company builds in the States annually, you’re eligible.\n\nBut popular imported models, even if they’re imported by one of the U.S. Big 3 automakers, are not covered.\n\nNew cars, SUVs, vans, pickup trucks, and motorcycles weighing under 14,000 pounds are eligible, but to qualify, the vehicle must be purchased for personal use, not business or commercial purposes, and its final assembly must be done in the U.S.",

    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A use-of-force review board cleared the Ohio police officer who shot and killed 21-year-old Ta’Kiya Young, a pregnant Black mother who had been accused of shoplifting, according to a statement from the police department's chief released this week.\n\nThe five-member review board, empaneled by Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford, found that Officer Connor Grubb did not violate department policy when he fatally shot Young on Aug. 24, 2023, during an encounter in a Kroger parking lot in a Columbus suburb.\n\n“The deaths of Ta’Kiya Young and her unborn child were a profound tragedy for her family, our department, and the community,” Belford said in a written statement. “After receiving the complete investigation and evidence from BCI, the Use of Force Review Board conducted a thorough policy review and found no violation of department policy by Officer Grubb.”\n\nPer the department's policy, the board convened in December after a Franklin County jury acquitted Grubb on all counts, including murder, involuntary manslaughter and felonious assault in the death of Young.\n\nFour of the board's members work at law enforcement agencies in Franklin County, and one is a township trustee from Brown Township, according to Ryan Stubenrauch, a spokesman for the Blendon Township police.\n\nSean Walton, an attorney representing Young's family, said the review board's results are “unsurprising” and the department's policies are “a clear and present danger to everyone who encounters their officers.”\n\n“He (Grubb) chose escalation over de-escalation. He chose to create danger and respond to the danger he created. Now his department has cleared him instead of sending a message that would protect lives in the future,” Walton said.\n\nBodycam recordings showed Grubb and Sgt. Erick Moynihan had approached Young’s car outside a Kroger about a report that she was suspected of stealing alcohol from the store. She partially lowered her window and protested as both officers cursed at her and yelled at her to get out. On bodycam video, Young could be heard asking them, “Are you going to shoot me?”\n\nThen, she put on a turn signal and her car rolled slowly forward toward Grubb, who fired a single bullet through her windshield into her chest, the bodycam recording showed.\n\nIn the statement, Grubb said he positioned himself in front of Young’s vehicle to provide proper backup. He said he drew his gun after he heard Young fail to comply with Moynihan’s commands. When her car moved toward him, he said, he felt the vehicle hit his legs and shins and begin to lift his body off the ground as he shot.\n\nMoments later, after the car came to a stop against the building, the officers are seen breaking the driver’s side window. Police said they tried to save her life, but she was mortally wounded. Young and her unborn daughter were subsequently pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nA full-time officer with the township since 2019, Grubb was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting.",

Lee (@henrykleeKTVU) January 10, 2026\n\nThe couple rushed home from Tahoe to clean — and to cry, upset they'd been taken advantage of by someone claiming they were a couple who needed their home at the last minute because they were visiting a sick relative at the hospital.\n\n\"We haven’t slept for two days,\" Eric said.\n\nOne interloper stole the couple's beloved Mini Cooper.\n\nThey also suspect the intruders brought women over to have sex.\n\n\"I mean, this is, these people are on the lowest level of the overall crime ring that came into our house,\" Jenny said.\n\nOne man even brought a dog and fed it with the couple's dog food.\n\n\"They brought a dog, and then they washed their dog in our tub, and they used like a brush, one of our brushes, and it’s full of dog hair,\" Jenny said.\n\nHis voice quavering, Eric said, \"It’s hard work maintaining a home. We work hard, we’re teachers, we contribute to our community.\"\n\nJenny said, \"I just get through it by being grateful and recognizing that we have a beautiful house, we have each other.\"\n\nThe couple says HomeExchange has promised to make them whole by paying for their expenses, including for a locksmith. The company did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\n\"I just hope that they really take this as a wake-up call, and they do the right thing,\" Jenny said.\n\nOakland police are investigating this as a burglary, fraud and grand theft auto.\n\nHenry Lee is a KTVU crime reporter.

    "fullText": "Nick and Brooke Shirley have for years published conspiracy-minded takes on hot-button rightwing issues\n\nYouTube influencer Nick Shirley, whose viral video alleging fraud by daycare centers servicing Minneapolis’s Somali American community came days ahead of the Trump administration’s declaration of a national funding freeze, has for years published conspiracy-minded takes on hot-button rightwing issues.\n\nHe also has close ties to the White House, Republicans, and to representatives of an earlier generation of rightwing partisan “ambush journalists” such as James O’Keefe. He worked with Minnesota Republicans to produce the viral video on Somali-run daycares.\n\nShirley has collaborated closely with his mother and fellow influencer Brooke Shirley, with the pair traveling together to flashpoints elevated by rightwing discourse online and in conservative media, and publishing across platforms including TikTok and YouTube.\n\nTheir US destinations have included the southern border, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, but they have also traveled overseas for big-ticket rightwing and anti-immigrant events including the Tommy Robinson-organized “Unite the Kingdom” rally last September.\n\nShirley’s videos frequently sensationalize conflict, or focus on street violence. The titles of recent videos include Dearborn Michigan has Fallen… Christians and Muslims Battle, Portland has Fallen… ANTIFA has Taken Control of City, and I Confronted Dangerous Migrant Scammers in NYC | Canal Street, the latter of which highlights a physical confrontation between Shirley and a street vendor in New York.\n\nShirley’s 26 December video, which targeted Minnesota’s Somali community with allegations of widespread fraud, became the basis for a torrent of anti-immigrant and anti-Somali content across social media, including in Truth Social posts by Donald Trump.\n\nFollow-up reporting by local outlets including CBS Minnesota and the Minnesota Star-Tribune, has found little factual basis for Shirley’s claims that daycare centers were claiming federal funding without caring for any children.\n\nMore than 90 people in Minnesota have been charged since 2022 in a $250m Covid-19 relief fraud scheme involving a non-profit that falsely claimed to provide meals to children, and a federal prosecutor estimated that $9bn or \n\nBut no fraud charges have been filed against the daycare centers featured by Shirley, though state records show some had code violations unrelated to fraud\n\nShirley’s latest video was the culmination of a years-long, peripatetic effort by the mother-and-son pairing to entrench themselves at the head of a burgeoning milieu of Maga-verse content creators.\n\nBrooke Shirley, 55, has posted hundreds of videos to her TikTok account beginning just two weeks after the January 6 protests at the United States Capitol, which Nick Shirley filmed himself attending.\n\nShe has also publicly defended the veracity of her son’s work. In November she told the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) that “what Nick is doing is journalism”, adding: “He’s documenting what is going on in America and in the world. And independent journalists are the ones that are out there.”\n\nThey also have a shared self-perception as truth-telling citizen journalists.\n\nThe Guardian contacted Brooke Shirley for comment via voice and text message on a cellphone number identified as an active connection in her name by several data brokers. Nick Shirley was contacted for comment via the contact email listed on his YouTube page, and which he has invited people to send tips on in the description field of his videos.\n\nPetros Iosifidos, professor of media and communications policy at City St George’s, University of London, and the co-author of the 2021 book Digital Democracy, Social Media and Disinformation, said: “Such a usage of social media does not aid democratic representation and instead contributes to a greater destabilisation of modern politics.\n\nHe added, “The situation has worsened in more recent years with widespread mis/disinformation that deprives the public of their fundamental right to have access to reliable, accurate information so to make informed decisions.”\n\nNick Shirley has emerged in the last two years as one of a new crop of news influencers who achieved a new level of salience at the tail end of the Biden years and have been actively cultivated by Trump’s White House.\n\nShirley was one of the invitees to a White House Antifa roundtable in October, at which influencers and administration officials aired their grievances about the amorphous social movement that has served as a Maga target since Trump’s first presidency.\n\nShirley dutifully posted a video of his speech at the event on his YouTube channel.\n\nReportedly, the attention from Shirley and other news influencers such as Savanah Hernandez led to an Ice sweep of the vendors, which was met by resistance from New York residents, and earned a rebuke from Zohran Mamdani, then a mayoral candidate, who called the tactics “aggressive and reckless”.\n\nOne media report quoted a resident of the Chinatown district where the vendors have been located for decades as saying that Ice “just take advantage of this because suddenly the rightwing media and online influencers came down into the area”.\n\nIn November, Shirley was awarded the “citizen journalist of the year” at the Citizen Journalism Gala held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, and hosted by James O’Keefe.\n\nThe month after the Mar-a-Lago ceremony, Shirley was collaborating with Minnesota Republicans to put the issue of purported fraud in the state’s Somali immigrant community on the national agenda.\n\nOn 29 December, House Republican leaders held a press conference in the wake of his videos.\n\nAt that conference, Lisa DeMuth not only backed the veracity of the video, telling reporters: “By now, everyone has seen the viral video that in under an hour exposed more than a million dollars in fraud.”\n\nShe also added: “Our caucus has been working to expose fraud for years, including working with Nick Shirley and agency whistleblowers to get the information out to the public and to hold the Walz administration accountable.”\n\nThe Guardian emailed DeMuth to ask for specifics on the collaboration, and whether the apparent inaccuracies unveiled by subsequent reporting were Shirley’s alone, or as a result of information provided by the caucus.\n\nA spokesperson referred to a man who appears prominently in the video, referred to only as “David” by Shirley, but who was later identified by the Minnesota Star-Tribune as David Hoch, a Minnesotan whose several paid political campaigns included an incident in which he campaigned “in nothing but shorts and a sandwich board on Minneapolis’ Nicollet Mall”.\n\nThey wrote: “Some of the information they used, including daycare locations, CCAP numbers, violations, etc, was given to David by caucus staff who found it in the official DHS licensing database and other publicly available sources.”\n\nShirley reportedly built his channel with shock and prank videos in the late teens, while he was still a high school student. After graduating in 2020, Shirley, a Mormon, took a hiatus during 2021 and 2022 while he completed a religiously ordained mission.\n\nAfter he returned from his mission in 2023, according to NPR, Shirley’s content took on a more sharply political and partisan character.\n\nPer Columbia Journalism Review reporting, this pivot was encouraged by Brooke: “It was Brooke – who was a former journalism student and a content creator herself – who pushed her son to cover the southern border,” the topic of several Nick Shirley videos in 2023.\n\nBrooke Shirley not only encouraged her son to make such content, but arguably led the way for him, having published pro-Maga content to TikTok since late January 2021, according to a Guardian review of the account.\n\nShe has also been closely involved in his work. In his acceptance speech at Mar-a-Lago, according to CJR, he thanked Brooke “for filming many of his videos”.\n\nEach has registered companies that appear to be related to their public output.\n\nAccording to Utah company records, Shirley was the organizer of Honey Badger LLC, whose purpose was “online media and related activities”, which was registered in April 2024 and administratively dissolved on 21 September 2025. Brooke Shirley, meanwhile, is the organizer of BT Outlook LLC, whose purpose is “social media and related activities”, which was incorporated on 30 September 2024.\n\nBoth companies were registered at the same residential address in suburban Farmington, Utah. It’s not known if BT Outlook LLC is the underlying entity for the pair’s news influencer activities.\n\nWhile Nick Shirley promotes his YouTube channel as being “here to entertain and bring the truth to all”, on Brooke’s TikTok account, which at the time of reporting had more than 290,000 followers, Brooke describes herself as a “boots on the ground Citizen Journalist!”, adding, “follow me for true news!”.\n\nBrooke’s boots frequently tread the same ground as Nick’s.\n\nThe pair’s video output indicates that they travel to the same places that have been the focus of conservative media and social media, and produce often-inflammatory content that reinforces conspiracy narratives about locales, individuals and groups that have been demonized in rightwing discourse.\n\nNick Shirley’s videos are usually longer, more complex, and more intensively edited than his mother’s, but the pair often cover the same ground.\n\nOn 28 October, for example, Nick Shirley published a video on YouTube which purported to offer an account of events on the ground in Portland, Oregon. His video played up stereotypes of the city which have emerged during the Trump era, focusing on homeless encampments, and scuffles outside the city’s ICE facility, which has been a focus for protesters and counter-protesters since the summer, and attracted a Trump-ordered national guard deployment, which has since ended after the supreme court judged it unconstitutional.\n\nIn a section of the video Shirley entitled “ANTIFA receives a new shipment”, Shirley showed a U-Haul truck resupplying protesters with barbecue ingredients and inflatable animal costumes.\n\nBetween 12 and 16 October, Brooke Shirley published five TikTok videos shot in the city. In one published on 17 October, Shirley features footage of the same costumes, groceries and charcoal grills highlighted by Nick in his longer YouTube video.\n\nIn the video, which features throughout a text insert reading “Antifa camp receives gear in Portland”, Brooke Shirley intones over footage of the set-up outside the ICE facility: “I’m in Portland, Oregon, and I’m going to show you what the ICE facility looks like,” adding: “Right over there you can get inflatables to put on. There’s food to eat. There’s tents to take a nap in, I guess.”\n\nAnother of Brooke Shirley’s Portland videos published on 15 October is focused on protesters wearing Tyrannosaurus rex costumes.\n\nIn that video, over footage of the blow-up theropods dancing with other protesters, Shirley asked viewers to “imagine if for 100 days this has been going on in front of your apartment complex. Because this has been going on for more than 100 days, 24/7”.\n\nThe same pattern repeats itself in the pair’s trips throughout the US and beyond to cover hot-button rightwing issues and events.\n\nOn 15 September, Nick Shirley posted video taken at the anti-immigrant Unite the Kingdom rally in London held two days earlier, where interviewees included a woman in a Union Jack bikini, and a man with severe facial contusions who was later seen confronting police officers.\n\nThe video also heavily featured the far-right activist and convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, who was one of the rally’s key organizers.\n\nShirley published a separate sit-down interview with Robinson.\n\nAround the rally, Brooke Shirley published interviews with attenders who offered praise for Donald Trump and the recently assassinated Charlie Kirk. The previous year, on a separate trip, Brooke Shirley published her own interview with Tommy Robinson.\n\nFollowing established practice, Brooke Shirley posted versions of the Minnesota story to her TikTok channel.\n\nOn 27 December, she posted a video captioned “The Somalians are masters at fraud and the government is dumb enough to allow it to continue to go on it. It’s easy to find the fraud. All you need to do is a little bit of research and visit the businesses. #minnesota #minneapolis”.\n\nA text insert on the video, which shows Brooke Shirley standing outside a purportedly empty ABC Learning daycare center in Minneapolis, reads: “Somalian-run Daycares all over Minnesota are closed yet collecting millions every year from the government.”\n\nIn the video, Brooke Shirley says: “This daycare right here, ran by Somalians, has taken in from the Minnesota government $1.1m.”\n\nShirley adds: “This daycare says it can hold up to 40 children. I went up to the door. The door is locked, and as you can see, the windows are blacked out. I can’t hear any children inside this daycare.”\n\nShirley continues: “It’s midday right now. You’d think there’d be children in there playing, being taught, but no one is in there.”\n\nFurther on, she asserts: “The Somalians are robbing the taxpayers in Minnesota blind.”\n\nNick Shirley’s identical claims about ABC Learning Center have been refuted by multiple outlets, including CBS Minnesota, who found timestamped security footage of children arriving on the day they visited the facility, with reporters seeing children being cared for when they visited.\n\nBrooke Shirley’s video had been viewed almost 360,000 times at the time of reporting.\n\nIn the past, Brooke Shirley has credited her son for her success on TikTok.\n\nOn 18 January 2025, following a brief TikTok shutdown arising from Biden-era legislation aimed at forcing the site’s Chinese parent company to divest, Shirley posted a video whose caption explicitly credited her son for her success on the platform.\n\n“I am saying goodbye for a moment hopefully we will be back! Thank you my TikTok family and friends!” Shirley wrote, adding “Thank you to my amazing son @Nick Shirley for making my dreams come true here on TikTok!!”\n\nThe accompanying video, soundtracked by Green Day’s Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), featured a montage of still images of Shirley interviewing migrants at the southern border and cities around the country, attending Trump rallies and student protests, and standing outside homeless encampments.\n\nDespite persistent concerns about the quality of the information passed on by self-described “citizen journalists” like Shirley, Pew research suggests that one in five Americans regularly get news from social media content creators.",

    "fullText": "Ministers warn platform could be blocked after Grok AI used to create sexual images without consent\n\nElon Musk has accused the UK government of wanting to suppress free speech after ministers threatened fines and a possible ban for his social media site X after its AI tool, Grok, was used to make sexual images of women and children without their consent.\n\nThe billionaire claimed Grok was the most downloaded app on the UK App Store on Friday night after ministers threatened to take action unless the function to create sexually harassing images was removed.\n\nResponding to threats of a ban from the government, Musk wrote: “They just want to suppress free speech”.\n\nThousands of women have faced abuse from users of the AI tool which was first used to digitally strip fully clothed photographs into images showing them wearing micro bikinis, and then used for extreme image manipulation.\n\nPictures of teenage girls and children were altered to show them wearing swimwear, leading experts to say some of the content could be categorised as child sexual abuse material.\n\nSome users began to demand to see bruising on the bodies of the women, and for blood to be added to the images. Women were shown tied up, gagged and shot.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, said on Friday that ministers were looking seriously at the possibility of access to X being barred in the UK.\n\nShe said she expected Ofcom, which said this week that it was seeking urgent answers from the platform, to announce action within “days not weeks”.\n\n“X needs to get a grip and get this material down,” she said. “And I would remind them that in the Online Safety Act, there are backstop powers to block access to services if they refuse to comply with the law for people in the UK. And if Ofcom decides to use those powers, they would have the full backing of the government.”\n\nThe UK government’s concerns were echoed by the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Speaking in Canberra on Saturday, Albanese said that “global citizens deserve better”. Australia recently banned the use of social media for under-16s.\n\n“The use of generative artificial intelligence to exploit or sexualise people without their consent is abhorrent,” he said.\n\n“The fact that this tool was used so that people were using its image creation function through Grok is just completely abhorrent. It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility.”\n\nSome rightwing political figures have tried to frame this as a free speech issue. Responding to the news X faced a potential ban, the former prime minister Liz Truss said: “Starmer is really losing it now.”\n\nX partially restricted access to Grok on Friday. Its public account lost the ability to generate images at the request of free users, leaving the function available only to paid subscribers. It also appeared to have stopped creating bikini images.\n\nThe Grok app, however, which does not generate images publicly, is still able to create sexually explicit material from women’s pictures.\n\nOther nudificiation apps are still available. The Labour MP Jess Asato, who campaigns against the sexual abuse and harassment of women, said legislation to ban such apps was urgently needed.\n\nShe posted on social media: “It’s not just XAi. This nudification tool was advertised yesterday on @YouTube.\n\n“No rules had been broken @Google said on reporting.\n\n“Our nudification legislation needs to be expedited.”\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Bowen, Thornton, Assiratti, Thomas Cons: Sheedy 2, Beetham Pens: Sheedy 2\n\nTries: Ravutaumada, Prisciantelli, Pens: Gibert\n\nCardiff took a huge step in guaranteeing their Challenge Cup knockout place with a hard-fought European bonus-point home victory against Racing 92.\n\nTries from wing Tom Bowen and centre Ben Thomas and rare scores for lock Rory Thornton and prop Keiron Assiratti were supplemented by 10 points from fly-half Callum Sheedy.\n\nRacing 92 responded with tries from Fiji wing Selestino Ravutaumada, who was shown a yellow card after only about seven seconds, and Argentina full-back Geronimo Prisciantelli.\n\nCardiff's final 16 Challenge Cup spot will be confirmed tomorrow if Ulster avoid defeat against South African side Cheetahs.\n\nCardiff travel to face Exeter in the final group game on Sunday, 18 January.\n\nCardiff had started the campaign with a defeat in Paris by Stade Francais before a last-kick win against Ulster.\n\nCoach Corniel Van Zyl freshened up his side with eight changes to the side that lost 33-22 at Ospreys, while Racing made 12 alterations to their starting side from the past league game.\n\nFrance centre Gael Fickou, Fiji powerhouse Josua Tuisova, Wallaby prop Taniela Tupou, former Wales lock Will Rowlands and England forwards Johnny Hill and Nathan Hughes were missing, but they still fielded Prisciantelli, France prop Demba Bamba and England Under-20s lock Junior Kpoku.\n\nCardiff captain Liam Belcher led the side out on his 100th appearance before Ravutaumada was shown a yellow card straight from the kick-off.\n\nIt was for a high, dangerous tackle on number eight Alun Lawrence, who was forced off the field for 10 minutes, after coming into start for the injured Taulupe Faletau.\n\nRacing opened the scoring with an Antoine Gibert penalty before the hosts made the extra man tell.\n\nBowen scored where Ravutaumada might have been defending as the Cardiff wing latched into a pinpoint Sheedy chip kick, before finishing expertly for his seventh try in seven games this season.\n\nRavutaumada made an immediate impression on his return when he strolled over to give Racing the lead.\n\nBowen, who was overlooked by Cardiff for the festive fixtures with Wales wings Josh Adams and Mason Grady preferred, demonstrated his ability to lift the Arms Park faithful by almost scoring another breakaway try.\n\nIn contrast, some soft Cardiff defending allowed Ravutaumada to power through the home defence before the ball was moved to Prisciantelli to cross.\n\nThe Argentina play-maker missed the conversion after also failing with an earlier penalty attempt, with Racing 92 failing with three kicks in the first half.\n\nFull-back Jacob Beetham's impressive 50:22 attacking kick established the platform for Thornton to cross for his first try in two years and bring the home side within one point at half-time.\n\nFrance lock Romain Taofifenua came on to add more power but his sizeable presence counted for little in a second half that Cardiff dominated.\n\nThe hosts provided the first flowing attack of the half which eventually resulted in an Assiratti try, only his second for Cardiff and first since December 2023.\n\nSheedy converted and added two penalties as Cardiff overwhelmed their French opponents.\n\nIt was left to the classy Thomas, named player-of-the-match, to secure a late bonus point with a gliding run with Beetham slotting over the final conversion.\n\nThis impressive win could precede an important week in Cardiff's future. It is an uncertain time in the domestic game in Wales, with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) proposing to cut one of its four men's professional sides.\n\nWelsh rugby's governing body has said it proposes to grant three licences for men's professional clubs.\n\nThere will be one in Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west, which could result in a survival fight between Swansea-based Ospreys and Scarlets in Llanelli.\n\nAfter temporarily going into administration in April 2025, Cardiff were taken over by the WRU with the governing body expecting to sell the organisation to fresh investors in the next few weeks.\n\nOspreys' owners, Y11 Sport & Media, have been linked with taking over Cardiff, which could result in the desired three professional sides.\n\nThe WRU and Y11 have both declined to comment on this possibility, fuelling fears of Ospreys supporters about their side's future, while Cardiff fans have been vocal against any such proposed takeover deal.\n\nThere is another consortium looming on the horizon with former Cardiff director Martyn Ryan joined by a party that includes three television and film producers based in the United States of America.\n\nIt will be decision for the WRU about what is best for Cardiff and what is more beneficial to the governing body's final plans.\n\nThe final bids are required by Monday with a potential decision expected by the end of January at the latest.\n\nCardiff: Beetham; Stephens, Smit, B Thomas, Bowen; Sheedy, A Davies; Barratt, Belcher (capt), Assiratti, Nott, Thornton, Mann, Basham, Lawrence.\n\nReplacements: D Hughes, Domachowski, Sebastian, McNally, Botham, Bevan, Jennings, Millard.\n\nRacing 92: Prisciantelli; Ravutaumada, James, Ashvetia, Donguy; Gibert, Carbonneau; Njocke, Leota, Bamba, Kpoku, Joseph (capt), Baudonne, Zinzen, Dayimani.\n\nReplacements: Tarrit, Julien, Kharaishvili, Taofifenua, Albuisson, Tagitagivalu, Labarbe, Espeut.\n\nAssistants: Harry Walbaum (Eng), Jamie Parr (Eng)",

And that was a meaty French pack, but we stood up to the test.\"\n\nNewcastle Red Bulls: Obatoyinbo, Wade, Hearle, Arnold, Spencer, Grayson, Cruz; McCallum, McGuigan, Palframan, Cardall, de Chaves, Usher, Christie, Gordon.\n\nReplacements: Fletcher, Brocklebank, de Bruin, Baker, Neild, Elliott, Hutchison, Greenwood.\n\nPerpignan: Dubois, Petaia, Poulet, Paia'aua, Granell, Reus, Ecochard; Devaux, Montgaillard, Ceccarelli, Yato, Warion, Chinarro, Diaby, Velarte.\n\nReplacements: Lotrian, Gallardo, Roelofse, Tuilagi, Tanguy, Dvali, Aprasidze, Kretchmann.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal manager Renee Slegers says time-wasting by goalkeepers in the Women's Super League can harm the \"attractiveness\" of the game.\n\nSlegers' side were held to a 0-0 draw by Manchester United, who were reduced to 10 players at Emirates Stadium for almost 30 minutes on Saturday.\n\nFollowing United full-back Jayde Riviere's sending off, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce went down requesting medical attention and it allowed her team-mates the opportunity to speak with coaches on the sidelines for several minutes.\n\nArsenal fans cheered when she was later booked for perceived time-wasting\n\nUnited boss Marc Skinner said Tullis-Joyce \"had something and the doctors went on to see it\" but admitted he could understand \"the cynical side\".\n\nAsked whether he would welcome the introduction of a rule which helps prevent time-wasting, Skinner said: \"I think the referees have tried to put things in place.\n\n\"If one of our [outfield] players gets injured by an accidental challenge, they have to come off for 30 seconds so you lose an advantage there. So I think it's hard.\n\n\"But from my perspective, I'd happily explore it because we regularly face it ourselves.\"\n\nArsenal were dominant for large spells of the game but were wasteful in front of goal on a frustrating afternoon.\n\nBut Slegers said the breaks in play affected their momentum and made the game less attractive to watch.\n\n\"When you look at the bigger picture, there are so many people investing to come and watch us in the stadium or on TV,\" said Slegers.\n\n\"The product needs to be attractive and this is one of the areas that probably brings the entertainment down a little bit.\n\n\"I haven't had much time to think about the exact solution but I think there are other people who are thinking about that... hopefully!\"\n\nOne suggestion has been to only allow club captains to go to the side of the pitch and prevent the squad huddling around coaches for tactical advice.\n\nWhen that idea was put to Slegers, she said: \"Yeah, I've heard that suggestion. That could be an example. But I think there is so much at stake that teams, players and coaches are always looking at how they can stretch the rules.\n\n\"What is important is that I think we keep the game attractive.\"",

    "fullText": "Inter vs Napoli is shaping up to be a stark contrast in attacking options, with Antonio Conte facing major limitations and Rasmus Hojlund the only fully fit forward available.\n\nAccording to Corriere dello Sport, the entire build-up to the Scudetto showdown can be summed up by Napoli’s offensive situation.\n\nConte is preparing the match “with only Hojlund at peak physical and mental condition in attack. A unique specimen,” the paper notes.\n\nAmong the already known absentees, even David Neres remains a serious doubt.\n\nDespite being considered the true attacking partner for the Danish striker.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – DECEMBER 06: Cristian Chivu, Head Coach of FC Internazionale Milano, looks on prior to the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and Como 1907 at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on December 06, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nThe picture is very different on the Inter side.\n\nCristian Chivu is dealing with what the newspaper calls “the comfortable embarrassment of abundance.”\n\nIn a 3-5-2, he can choose from Lautaro Martinez, Marcus Thuram, Pio Esposito and Bonny.\n\nIndeed, even a wrong initial choice would come with proven in-game solutions.\n\nHowever, with goals conceded level at 15, the real difference lies in production.\n\nInter have scored 40 goals to Napoli’s 28.\n\nNapoli have shown resilience, but arrive at San Siro with limited solutions.",

They scored 28 points off of turnovers (1 pick-6, 2 fumbles, 1 blocked punt) and physically dominated Oregon at every available opportunity.\n\nWith the win, Indiana moves to 15-0 and looks to secure their first National Championship next Monday night.

Miami were favorites against Ole Miss, since I know some people think I missed that one. I did not.\n\nAfter beating Ole Miss, Miami is an underdog in the National Championship Game.

    "description": "The Barça coach spoke to the press on Saturday",
    "fullText": "Barcelona manager Hansi Flick spoke to the press in Saudi Arabia ahead of Sunday’s Spanish Super Cup Final against Real Madrid, as Barça look for their first El Clásico win of the season to defend their Supercopa crown against their eternal rivals.\n\nFlick spoke about Kylian Mbappé, who is expected to play after recovering from a minor knee injury, confirmed that Lamine Yamal is ready to start on Sunday after playing only 20 minutes in the semi-final against Athletic Club due to illness, and also talked about the decision of starting either Eric Garcia or Frenkie de Jong in midfield against Los Blancos.\n\nHere’s a summary of the best quotes from Hansi’s presser:\n\nKylian Mbappé\n“Currently, Mbappé is the best striker. He has scored a lot of goals and has world-class talent. We watched the semi-finals together, the whole team.\n\n“How many Clásicos have we played in the last year and a half? And how many have we lost? We’ve lost one. That’s what it’s about. I know Mbappé is a fantastic player and that he’s phenomenal when he has space behind the defense. We’ll adapt some things, as we always do. But not specifically because of Mbappé. We’re focused on our philosophy, on our ideas.”\n\nLamine Yamal\n“Yes [he can start], all the players are ready to be on the team. It’s great to have everyone together. Especially Gavi and Christensen.\n\n“We’ll decide [the starting XI] after the last training session. The important thing is that we have options in every position, and they’re all good. Everyone wants to play and be a starter. The key is the team. We have to make the right decision.”\n\nEric or Frenkie in midfield\n“I was very pleased with Wednesday’s performance. But we also have other options. Frenkie and Eric can play. Gerard is having a fantastic season. Today we have our final training session; we’ll see what we need. Everyone is available. We’ll decide then.”",

    "description": "Everything you need to know about the Chargers facing the New England Patriots in the AFC wild-card playoffs, including how to watch and a score prediction.",
    "fullText": "Both quarterbacks have had outstanding seasons and will meet on a huge stage Sunday night, each looking to pick up his first victory in the NFL playoffs.\n\nWhereas Herbert is 0-2 in Chargers postseason games, Maye is making his first postseason appearance for the New England Patriots after assembling a most valuable player-caliber season.\n\nHerbert hasn’t gotten as much MVP mention but has been elite, especially considering the state of his injury-riddled offensive line, which has a new configuration virtually every week.\n\nJim Harbaugh and the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel are two of the league’s most talented coaches too, and this figures to be a balanced matchup.\n\nThe Patriots won 14 games — a whopping 10 more than the year before — but didn’t play a lot of great quarterbacks, a middler’s row that included Cam Ward, Spencer Rattler, Dillon Gabriel and a 40-year-old Joe Flacco.\n\nTwice the Chargers have lost playoff games at New England, falling short in the AFC championship game to end the 2007 season and a divisional game in 2018.\n\nHow the Chargers can win: The Chargers need to put the Patriots on their heels by slowing the running game, which has been New England’s key to winning lately, and force the pass. Maye's receivers don’t have a lot of big-play potential. On defense the Patriots are solid but not overwhelming. The Chargers need to be effective on third down — need to stay in third-and-manageable — to keep drives alive and keep that Patriots defense on the field. Of course protecting Herbert is a priority and it’s a challenge with an offensive line that’s constantly being reshuffled. If the Chargers score early and often, they can take the crowd out of the game.\n\nHow the Patriots can win: New England has to stay out of obvious passing situations against an opportunistic Chargers defense. That means leaning on the running game, something the Patriots have done the last month. The Patriots need to shore up the defense against the run, although the Chargers don’t thrive on that with a banged-up Omarion Hampton and backups. If the Patriots can avoid the turnovers and establish a methodical tempo, they can inch away with field goals.\n\nChargers: WR KeAndre Lambert-Smith (hamstring, out); S Kendall Williamson (ankle, out); RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, questionable); OLB Bud Dupree (hamstring, questionable); DB Elijah Molden (hamstring, questionable); OT Austin Deculus (oblique, questionable); LB Del’Shawn Phillips (hamstring, questionable), TE Tucker Fisk (ankle, questionable).\n\nPatriots: DT Khyiris Tonga (foot, out); OT Thayer Munford Jr. (knee, questionable); WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring, questionable); LB Harold Landry III (knee, questionable); CB Alex Austin (wrist, questionable).\n\nThe Chargers and Patriots play Sunday at 5:15 p.m. PST at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. The game will be shown on NBC, Peacock and Universo (Español). In Southern California fans can listen to the game on 640 AM and 105.5 FM (Español).\n\nSam Farmer’s pick: The Patriots haven’t faced many elite quarterbacks — they went 1-1 against the Josh Allen-led Buffalo Bills — so Herbert will be a challenge. Still, if they can get to him behind that battered offensive line, it will be hard for the Chargers to consistently move the ball. The cold weather shouldn’t be a huge factor unless the wind starts whipping. Maye has been outstanding.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Inter vs Napoli will also be defined by the duel between Lautaro Martinez and Rasmus Hojlund, with the two centre-forwards set to lead the line at San Siro.\n\nAccording to La Repubblica, the matchup carries extra edge for Lautaro, whose last encounter with Napoli ended badly.\n\nThat night brought defeat for Inter and heated exchanges on the pitch, including friction with his former coach Antonio Conte.\n\nThis time, the Argentine arrives in a very different frame of mind and form.\n\nLautaro is already on 10 league goals this season and currently tops the Serie A scoring charts.\n\nHis consistency has once again made him the reference point of Inter’s attack and one of the most decisive players in the division.\n\nNAPLES, ITALY – OCTOBER 01: Rasmus Hojlund of SSC Napoli celebrates after scoring his side first goal during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Phase MD2 match between SSC Napoli and Sporting Clube de Portugal at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on October 01, 2025 in Naples, Italy. (Photo by Francesco Pecoraro/Getty Images)\n\nThe newspaper highlights how the Inter captain came away from Parma midweek almost surprised not to have scored, having found the net in each of his previous five matches.\n\nIt underlines numbers that are now routine rather than exceptional.\n\nSince arriving in Milan in 2018, brought in by Diego Milito and Javier Zanetti from Racing Club, Lautaro has scored 167 goals for Inter.\n\nHe now sits just five goals behind Roberto Boninsegna on the club’s all-time scorers list, with another historic milestone firmly within reach.\n\nHojlund represents Napoli’s main threat at the other end, but the contrast in attacking depth is clear.\n\nFor Inter, the battle of the number nines could once again tilt the balance on a night that may prove decisive in the title race.",

    "fullText": "Super Wild Card Weekend in the NFL is built for chaos — and chaos creates opportunity for bettors willing to chase longshot value.\n\nOur experts have identified four longshot NFL picks with the potential to boost your ROI as three straight days of knockout football take center stage.\n\nTrevor Lawrence 3+ passing TDs (+350 at FanDuel)\n\nTommy Tremble anytime TD (+650 at FanDuel)\n\nDalton Schultz first TD (+850 at FanDuel)\n\nEach team to score 1+ rushing touchdown (+12500 at FanDuel)\n\nTrevor Lawrence 3+ passing touchdowns (+350)\n\nTrevor Lawrence has thrown three or more scores in three of his last four games. He’s also piled up 10 passing TDs over his last three home starts, with this pass-catching group playing its best football of the season.\n\nParker Washington has 347 yards over the last three games, Jakobi Meyers continues to move the chains, and Brian Thomas remains a matchup problem. Add in Brenton Strange and Travis Etienne as a receiving threat, and there are plenty of ways for this offense to score.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are banged up in the secondary, with rookie Maxwell Hairston out and Jordan Poyer questionable, plus linebacker Terrel Bernard missing practice. If the Bills sell out to stop the run, Lawrence should be forced to throw — and that sets up well for another strong passing day.\n\nTommy Tremble anytime TD (+650)\n\nThis is a massive price for a clear-cut TE1 on a team that should be throwing more than usual as a double-digit home underdog.\n\nIn his first game without Ja’Tavion Sanders, Tremble stepped into the TE1 role and caught three of four targets for 38 yards and a TD at +500. Tommy Tremble ranked third in route share and logged a 90% snap rate, second among pass catchers.\n\nHe’s clearly involved yet priced like a TE2 with minimal usage. With Sanders still on IR, this should be closer to +300 or +330.\n\nAfter missing Week 18, Nico Collins returns to the Texans' lineup on Monday. But even with their star wideout back, we still need to consider tight end Dalton Schultz a live option to score the opener against the Steelers.\n\nHe’s only scored three times all season, but two of those have come in the past month. He ranks second on the Texans roster in red-zone targets across the year.\n\nWith the Steelers giving up 11 touchdowns to TEs this season, tied for third-most in the league, it could be a good Monday for the former Stanford man.\n\nEach team to score 1+ rushing TD (+12500)\n\nYou can’t write a longshot article without one true lotto ticket, and Wild Card Weekend sets up perfectly for a swing like this.\n\nAcross the six-game slate, we’re looking at a mix of run-heavy offenses, potential weather spots, and elite ground games capable of dictating terms through both scheme and talent.\n\nThis bet leans on proven touchdown producers like Kyren Williams (10), Rico Dowdle (6), Josh Jacobs (13), D’Andre Swift (9), James Cook (12), Josh Allen (14), Travis Etienne (7), Trevor Lawrence (9), Christian McCaffrey (10), Saquon Barkley (7), Jalen Hurts (8), and TreVeyon Henderson (9).\n\nIt’s a sprinkle-only play — but if Wild Card chaos hits the right way, this is the kind of ticket that can cap the weekend with a massive ROI.\n\nMake your NFL bets at FanDuel, America's No. 1 sportsbook! \n\nChargers vs Patriots predictions\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Who: Calgary Flames (18-22-4, 40 points, 7th place Pacific Division) @ Pittsburgh Penguins (21-12-9, 51 points, 4th place Metropolitan Division)\n\nHow to Watch: Broadcast locally Sportsnet Pittsburgh and SN/TVAS, streaming on ESPN+\n\nPens’ Path Ahead: The busy stretch continues tomorrow with a 5 p.m. ET game in Boston. Then it’s back to Pittsburgh for three home games next week, starting with the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday and followed by division matchups against the Philadelphia Flyers and Columbus Blue Jackets on Thursday and Saturday, respectively.\n\nOpponent Track: It’s been a dispiriting stretch in Calgary. The Flames are on a four-game losing skid, and they’ve been held to just one goal in each of their last three games (while getting outscored by a total of 18-3). Calgary most recently dropped a back-to-back set in Montreal and Boston earlier this week.\n\nSeason Series: This is the first time the Flames and Pens have met this season. They’ll see one another later this month, when the Pens head to Calgary on Jan. 21 as part of a four-game West Coast road swing.\n\nHidden Stat: The Flames are heading into this matchup with the worst road points percentage in the NHL, going 6-15-2 (.304 points percentage) in 23 away games so far this season.\n\nHidden Stat II: Courtesy of Pens PR, the Penguins are 13-1-4 in games where at least one member of the current fourth line (Connor Dewar, Blake Lizotte and Noel Acciari) records a point.\n\nJonathan Huberdeau – Nazem Kadri – Joel Farabee\n\nBlake Coleman – Mikael Backlund – Matt Coronato\n\nConnor Zary – Morgan Frost – Yegor Sharangovich\n\nRyan Lomberg – Justin Kirkland – Adam Klapka\n\nYan Kuznetsov / MacKenzie Weegar\n\nJoel Hanley / Hunter Brzustewicz\n\nGoalies: Dustin Wolf, Devin Cooley\n\nPotential scratches: Zayne Parekh (day-to-day upper body injury), William Stromgren, Brayden Pachal\n\nInjured Reserve: Jake Bean, Samuel Honk, John Beecher, Martin Pospisil\n\nFlames fans haven’t gotten to see rookie defenseman Zayne Parekh since he set a record for Canadian World Juniors defensemen with 13 points in seven games of the 2025 tournament. The 19-year-old was sidelined for Calgary’s back-to-back earlier this week.\n\nDustin Wolf has made eight straight starts for the Flames, including in the team’s losses to the Habs and Bruins on consecutive days last week. Backup Devin Cooley has been dealing with an illness, according to head coach Ryan Huska, who admitted it has not been “ideal” to be playing Wolf this much. Whether Wolf (3-5-0 over this stretch) gets a ninth straight start against the Pens could depend on Cooley’s health status.\n\nThe Flames are about to hit a crossroads at the trade deadline. Right now, they’re in no man’s land. They’re ostensibly still in the playoff race (six points back of a Western Conference Wild Card spot with 38 games left in the season). They had a resurgent December (9-4-0) before their January slump (0-4).\n\nThey’re playing veterans and keeping young players on a tight leash— rookie winger William Stromgren made his NHL debut on Wednesday, but skated just over eight minutes before getting scratched for Thursday’s matchup with the Bruins.\n\nThe Flames are also the lowest-scoring team in the NHL with 2.13 goals for per game, and they’re allowing the fifth-most goals against (3.57 per game). The Calgary power play is ticking along at just 12.5 percent.\n\nBlake Coleman has been tied to the Montreal Canadiens by TSN’s Pierre LeBrun. Rasmus Andersson is an obvious trade chip given that he’s playing on an expiring contract.

    "fullText": "Date: Saturday, January 10, 2026\n\nLocation: Hope Coliseum — Morgantown, West Virginia\n\nAnnouncers: Brandon Gaudin and LaPhonso Ellis\n\nStreaming: FOX Sports (TV provider login required)\n\nRadio: Mountaineer Sports Network (Radio Affiliates) | SiriusXM Channel 380 and Streaming Channel 970 | WVU Gameday App (Apple | Android)\n\nRadio Announcers: Tony Caridi (PBP) and Brad Howe (analyst)\n\nReminder: It is against site policy to post links to illegal streams in the comments.\n\nGet in on the action with our friends at FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nWest Virginia: +3.5 points | +158 ML\n\n(As of 12:30AM ET/January 10, 2026)\n\nWest Virginia is back at home this afternoon, hosting Kansas after picking up a 62–60 win over Cincinnati earlier this week. The Mountaineers (10–5, 1–1) had to mount a late comeback to get through that one, but they pulled it off and avoided an 0–2 start to Big 12 play.\n\nHonor Huff carried the offense against the Bearcats with 24 points, knocking down six threes, while Treysen Eaglestaff provided what would be the game winner with a late three that put WVU back in front for good. Chance Moore added 14 off the bench, continuing to give the Mountaineers a reliable presence when the offense needed a jolt. WVU shot well from the perimeter, though rebounding and second chances again became an issue during extended stretches.\n\nKansas comes to Morgantown at 11–4 overall and 1–1 in Big 12 play. The Jayhawks dropped their opener at UCF before rallying from a 16-point deficit to beat TCU, 104-101, in overtime earlier this week. Overall, they’re averaging 77.7 points per game while shooting 47 percent from the floor.\n\nFreshman guard Darryn Peterson has been the star of the show. After returning from a hamstring injury, Peterson scored 26 and 32 points in his last two games and is averaging 22.5 points in limited action. Ross Hodge noted this week that Peterson doesn’t need much help to create offense, which puts pressure on the entire defensive group to stay disciplined over long stretches.\n\nKansas isn’t short on help around him. Tre White, Flory Bidunga, and Melvin Council Jr. all average double figures and give the Jayhawks multiple options when possessions break down. Kansas has been most comfortable when games open up, particularly when they’re able to score before defenses are set.\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nSaturday’s game will be the 30th meeting between West Virginia and Kansas since the Mountaineers joined the Big 12 in 2013. The series has produced a number of close finishes and notable moments, particularly in Morgantown, where WVU holds a 7–5 record against the Jayhawks.\n\nWest Virginia has won two straight in the series, including last season’s 62–61 victory at Allen Fieldhouse and a 91–85 win in Morgantown two years ago. Other home highlights include a 91–79 win in 2021 and buzzer-beaters in 2015 and 2019. WVU’s largest margin of victory came in 2017, a 16-point win during the “Press Virginia” era against a Kansas team ranked No. 2 nationally.\n\nKansas has more ways to score, especially if Darryn Peterson is comfortable early. West Virginia has generally played well defensively at home, but they’ve also had stretches where the offense slows and extra possessions creep in.\n\nIf WVU can avoid long dry spells, this should stay tight into the second half. Kansas’ depth shows up late more often than not, and that’s usually enough to create some separation.\n\n.redcircle-link:link { color: #ea404d; text-decoration: none; } .redcircle-link:hover { color: #ea404d; } .redcircle-link:active { color: #ea404d; } .redcircle-link:visited { color: #ea404d; }\n\n.redcircle-link:link { color: #ea404d; text-decoration: none; } .redcircle-link:hover { color: #ea404d; } .redcircle-link:active { color: #ea404d; } .redcircle-link:visited { color: #ea404d; }",

    "fullText": "Italy legend Roberto Baggio still carries a ‘weight’ for missing a decisive penalty kick against Brazil in the 1994 World Cup Final: ‘I lost three World Cups on penalties, not easy to digest.’\n\nItaly legend Baggio said his penalty kick miss in the 1994 World Cup Final was “the greatest bitterness of my football career.”\n\n“I grew up with the dream of a World Cup Final against Brazil. I don’t have a clear memory of why this goal has stayed with me since I was very young, through my entire life,” Baggio told Forbes Italia via Gazzetta.\n\n“I have always considered myself an ordinary person. Just like everyone else. I never saw myself as special. I only had this uncontrollable passion for football. A passion that stirs something inside you from morning to night. I slept with the ball.\n\nItalian former football player Roberto Baggio (R) and Argentine-born Italian former football player, David Trezeguet (L) gesture before the beginning of the Argentina 2023 U-20 World Cup final match between Uruguay and Italy at the Estadio Unico Diego Armando Maradona stadium in La Plata, Argentina, on June 11, 2023. (Photo by Alejandro PAGNI / AFP) (Photo by ALEJANDRO PAGNI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“I would have given up everything else to win that World Cup. I was representing Italy. It was the goal I was always chasing. The last thought before going to sleep was how to win that World Cup. Maybe by scoring a bicycle kick.\n\n“Then it turned out in a way I never would have imagined, and I will never be able to forget it. Just one step away from the finish line. The greatest bitterness of my football career, an unbelievable personal tragedy, I still carry that weight inside me.”\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JUNE 03: Roberto Baggio looks on during a press conference at Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano on June 03, 2024 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Claudio Villa/Getty Images)\n\nBaggio took part in three World Cups. The Azzurri finished third in 1990, runners-up in 1994 and were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual winners France in 1998.\n\n“I played in three World Cups. In Italy [1990], we finished third, winning six matches and drawing one. I lost three World Cups on penalties, not easy to digest,” he concluded.",

Ohio State, which was picked to finish ninth in a preseason conference media poll, averaged a 25-point margin of victory during a six-game winning streak earlier this season.\n\nThe Huskies (1-3 Big Ten, 9-6 overall) are starting a tough three-game homestand against the Midwestern stalwarts of the Big Ten. After Ohio State, Washington will welcome No. 2 Michigan and No. 12 Michigan State next week.\n\nWashington leads 8-5 over Ohio State in the series, including a 6-0 record in Seattle.\n\nMore information below on Ohio State and Washington and how to watch the game.\n\nThe Buckeyes feature an efficient offense that ranks in the top 25 nationally in field goal percentage (50.6) and is fifth in the Big Ten at 84.6 points per game. Ohio State also makes 78.4% of its free throws (eighth in the country) but struggles from distance, converting only 34.3% of its 3-pointers.\n\nIn the win over Oregon, all five starters scored in double figures. Devin Royal and Christoph Tilly each had 14 points, senior leader Bruce Thornton had 12, John Mobley Jr. added 13, and Amare Bynum chipped in with 10.

    "fullText": "Arsenal return to Fratton Park for an FA Cup tie steeped in recent history, as Mikel Arteta prepares his side for a tricky trip to Portsmouth with memories of one of the most surreal nights of his managerial career still lingering.\n\nThe last time Arteta stood in the Portsmouth dugout, in March 2020, football, and the world, was on the brink of shutting down. Arsenal won that evening en route to lifting the FA Cup later that summer, but for their head coach, the memory is a deeply personal one.\n\n“I wasn’t feeling great, to be fair,” Arteta recalled. “The moment we scored, I was desperate to go home. I was shaking.” Within days, football would pause entirely as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold, making that night on the south coast an unlikely landmark at the start of an extraordinary period.\n\nFour years on, Arsenal return as a far more established force, but Arteta is keen to stress that past achievements count for little as the current side continues its pursuit of silverware.\n\n“We get judged for what we do today,” he said. “Last week is not important. We’ll be judged for what we’re able to do at the end of the season.”\n\nThat relentless focus underpins Arsenal’s approach to this season’s FA Cup, a competition Arteta famously won in his first year as a manager, albeit in virtually empty Wembley Stadium. The desire to lift trophies in front of supporters remains a powerful motivator.\n\n“And the big ones as well,” he added. “That’s what we are chasing. That’s the purpose of this team.”\n\nTeam news ahead of the Portsmouth tie offers encouragement, particularly around Kai Havertz, who is closing in on a return for the first time this season. Arteta confirmed the forward has stepped up his training load and is responding well.\n\n“If everything goes well, I think he’s going to be in the squad again in the next few days,” he said. “He trains well; he’s coping with that really well.”\n\nArteta was quick, however, to underline the standards awaiting any returning player. “When a player has the chance to put our shirt on and compete for us, the demands are excellence and that’s it.”\n\nRotation is likely with a heavy run of fixtures looming, including four away games across competitions in the coming weeks. Arteta acknowledged the need to manage minutes carefully, while still maintaining momentum.\n\n“We have to make sure everybody is participating, we continue to perform and win games,” he said.\n\nGoalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has impressed in the League Cup, is among those pushing for a start, while Riccardo Calafiori is expected to miss out as the tie comes too soon in his recovery. There is also uncertainty around Piero Hincapie’s fitness after he was forced off against Liverpool on Thursday night, potentially opening the door further for Myles Lewis-Skelly to stake his claim.\n\n“He’s playing and he’s doing well,” Arteta said. “He needs to continue to do that.”",

It’s nice to know that big clubs are following you,” Rahman said.\n\n“Even when he was at Bari, Inter and Benfica had already made enquiries about Elia.”\n\nThe comments further underline Inter’s long-standing appreciation of the Verona-born shot-stopper, who has continued to grow since joining Cagliari.\n\nCAGLIARI, ITALY – AUGUST 24: Elia Caprile of Cagliari in action during the Serie A match between Cagliari Calcio and ACF Fiorentina at Stadio Sant’Elia on August 24, 2025 in Cagliari, Italy.

    "description": "Toyota has high expectations from the TR010 Hybrid as it enters the 2026 WEC",
    "fullText": "Toyota has outlined its objectives for the 2026 World Endurance Championship, stating it wants to end its Le Mans 24 Hours victory drought and reduce operational errors.\n\nOnce the benchmark in the WEC’s top division, Toyota went the first seven rounds of the 2025 season without scoring a race win, before finally breaking through in the season finale in Bahrain.\n\nIt is now three years since the marque last won Le Mans and two since it claimed the drivers’ title, while 2025 marked the first time it didn’t win the manufacturers’ title in the Hypercar era.\n\nBut the Japanese manufacturer is aware of its shortcomings and has developed a heavily revised version of its Le Mans Hypercar, which was officially launched earlier this week under the TR010 Hybrid name.\n\nIt is the third major evolution of the car that originally debuted as the GR010 Hybrid in 2021, with a particular focus made on aerodynamics to maximise its speed under the Balance of Performance framework.\n\nToyota Racing vice-president Kazuki Nakajima admitted that the brand has been frustrated by its results at La Sarthe in recent years, but is confident the TR010 Hybrid can help reverse that trend.\n\n“The biggest objective is clearly to win Le Mans,” Nakajima told Motorsport.com. “After three years of frustrating results in Le Mans, this is clearly the biggest target, as well as winning the championship, because we always look for these two big targets.\n\n“But if I have to rate between two, I think Le Mans comes first priority.”\n\nToyota was long regarded as the strongest operational outfit in the WEC, often winning races through superior execution – even as competition intensified in the Hypercar era.\n\nBut the Cologne-based team’s usual clinical approach faltered on several occasions in 2025, as it tried to overcome what it felt was an unfavourable BoP at times.\n\nThe Lone Star Le Mans round proved particularly costly, with Toyota making a series of errors, including an ill-timed call to fit slick tyres on the #7 GR010 Hybrid while the track was still damp late in the race.\n\nNakajima admitted that the team hasn’t been on top of its game this year and has made addressing this weakness a priority for 2025.\n\n“The team's execution like strategy, pit stop, drivers’ performance, not making mistakes and things like that, these are a big part of the performance factor in the race,” he said. “We just need to focus on this part.\n\nToyota reveals new-look WEC Hypercar for 2026 amid wider revamp\n\nWEC Hypercar and IMSA GTP: Who is introducing updates in 2026 and who isn't?\n\n“We have to admit that we have not been at the level that we are aiming for in terms of team execution this year [2025].\n\n“In some races, we really performed well as a team but in some [other] races, we made mistakes. So, as a team we still need to improve ourselves, and this is a clear target for next year.”\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "The Denver Broncos are focusing on the details and hoping last year’s playoff experience will have them better prepared this time around.",
    "fullText": "We will know in just a few days who the Denver Broncos wind up playing in the 2026 NFL Playoff Divisional Round. Their 2025 regular season was a banner campaign. By notching fourteen wins, the Broncos are back to the top of the AFC West. Even better? They have the perks of a first-round playoff bye after securing the number one seed.\n\nIt wasn’t always pretty, but Denver showed a lot of toughness and tenacity this season. Embarking on multiple comeback wins, their penchant for fourth quarter comebacks coupled with a stellar defense propelled them to the best regular season record in the AFC in ‘25.\n\nThat’s something to be proud of. But now, everyone that made the postseason has a clean slate and an opportunity to etch their names into the NFL record books by winning Super Bowl 60. Everyone is back to square one.\n\nIn order for the Broncos to secure their fourth Lombardi Trophy, they will certainly need to work on the finer details. Over the course of the season, the Broncos struggled to be consistent—especially on the offensive side of the ball. Fixing that will be crucial in order for the Broncos to make a deep postseason push. Veteran right tackle Mike McGlinchey was vocal on what the team needed to address offensively to take care of business next weekend.\n\n“First and foremost, the obvious thing is executing in the red zone. You have to turn field goals into touchdowns. That’s how you win games, especially this late in the year and especially as you go through the playoffs,” stated McGlinchey.\n\nIn addition to red zone performance, being better on a down-to-down basis was next up his list of things to address over the next week. I think all us fans can all agree slow starts were an issue for the Broncos this season. Their erratic and inconsistent performance across the board was one of the most frustrating aspects of an otherwise impeccable season.\n\n“We have to be better on third down by being better on first and second down. It’s kind of a whole, as you go through these things, there are the ups and downs of the season. You just got to clean up the details, and we’ll be fine.”\n\n🔙 to work.\n\n👀 on the Divisional Round. pic.twitter.com/eN6SNec3lV\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) January 9, 2026\n\nOne primary factor that has contributed to their lack of consistency has been penalties. Denver had plenty of during the regular season. On top of that, the Broncos were one of the teams that ranked highest in drops. It’s hard enough beating another team each and every weekend, but even more arduous by shooting yourself in the foot. By fixing those things, they should be able to hit their stride like McGlinchey is hoping for. If so, I’d be very optimistic about their chances next weekend—whoever they end up facing.\n\nBut it isn’t just cleaning up the finer details that the Broncos are working on. They’re also trying to learn from last year’s playoff experience as a tool to help put themselves in a better position this time around. Very few players on the roster last year had ever experienced the bright lights of the postseason.\n\nWith virtually most of their roster experiencing last season, Denver is certainly more experienced in 2026 and far more battle-tested to know what’s at stake next weekend. And the players know having a hometown crowd cheering them on will certainly be an advantage.\n\n“That it’s a tournament for a reason. It’s do or die. I think last year, it was our first taste of it going into the playoffs as a Wild Card team, but now we have home-field advantage, which is different,” stated shutdown cornerback Patrick Surtain II.\n\nMaybe I’m just bullish on Denver, but this year’s team just feels different. Better prepared, far more diligent, and a knack for gutting out close victories. That is something they hadn’t done in a very long time. They also seemed to play with a chip on their shoulder after all the preseason shade that was thrown their way.\n\nThe power of belief is a strong thing. For the most part, the Broncos had the right mindset and approach versus their opponents on a week-to-week basis. By harnessing this past years’ experience coupled with learning from last year’s early Wild Card Round exit, Denver should be better poised to weather whatever storm heads to Empower Field at Mile High next weekend.\n\n“We have to definitely prep the right way and not take this thing for granted. Earlier on we talked about it, this is probably the last time that this whole team is going to be together, knowing how the league works. I feel like for this moment here, for all the marbles and stuff like that, we all have to buy in and understand that,” added Surtain.",

    "description": "The Super Bowl is a month away, and everyone wants to know which two teams will play. Some say the Super Bowl logo predicts it. Here's what to know.",
    "fullText": "As the 2026 Super Bowl creeps closer and closer, fans have started to make their predictions as to which two teams will play in the big game.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed, while the Denver Broncos are the AFC's No.1 seed. Yet there's a lot more to winning than just rankings; it takes team chemistry, skill and just the perfect amount of luck to make it to the Super Bowl.\n\nHowever, some fans believe that none of that matters because the two teams playing in the big game can be predicted by the year's Super Bowl logo.\n\nHere's the story behind the theory and what teams might be on the way to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe theory is that the colors included in that year's Super Bowl logo are the colors of the two teams that will play in the Super Bowl that year.\n\nThe theory came to be after fans started to notice that teams that made it to the big game had their colors incorporated into the big game logo for that year. The NFL Super Bowl logo is released a year before the big game, so there's no way anyone could accurately predict which teams would be playing each year.\n\nSo this isn't just an arbitrary theory, there is some evidence to it ... or coincidences, believers say.\n\nFor Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the logo featured red, orange and yellow tones. The two teams to play that year were the Los Angeles Rams, sporting blue and yellow uniforms, and the Cincinnati Bengals, wearing orange and black.\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LVII in 2023, which was played in Glendale, shows a red-rock desert background with pink, teal and orangey-red colors. The two teams that played that year were the red Kansas City Chiefs and green Philadelphia Eagles, which are similar enough to the logo colors for the theory to continue.\n\nHowever, the Super Bowl LVIII logo in 2024 featured a purple and pinkish-red color, which did not predict the showdown between the Chiefs and the 49ers, as both teams' colors are red and do not incorporate any purple. True believers of the conspiracy theory think this happened because the purple Baltimore Ravens had to be eliminated to make way for Travis Kelce's Chiefs and his pop-star girlfriend, Taylor Swift, to draw more fans to the big game.\n\nThe Super Bowl LIX logo in 2025 was green and red coloring to it, and once again, the Chiefs and Eagles played in the Super Bowl, keeping the theory alive.\n\n🚨JUST IN: NBC HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THE OFFICIAL 2025 SUPER BOWL LOGO.\n\n👀👀👀 \n\nWow… pic.twitter.com/Lr9JBjGURl\n\n— MLFootball (@MLFootball) February 10, 2025\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LX was revealed in February 2025 and features a multitude of bright colors, making it difficult to narrow down which team it could represent.\n\nPink and blue are the main colors featured in this year's brightly colored logo; however, since no teams have pink in their jerseys, the main colors to look for are blue, green, and yellow.\n\nTo narrow down what this could mean for the logo theory, here are some teams that incorporate those colors into their uniforms.\n\nOut of that list, the teams that are currently still in the playoffs are: Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, Los Angeles Chargers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Texans, Seattle Seahawks, Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Philadelphia Eagles, San Francisco 49ers, Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams.\n\nWith all the differing colors and teams these colors could represent, there are many theories as to what this logo could mean.\n\nThe discord between logo theorists will continue until it's really revealed which two teams will play in the big game.\n\nThe Super Bowl LX is on Sunday, February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Who will play in the 2026 Super Bowl?

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos secured the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs after going 14-3 in the regular season. They now enter the NFL playoffs, and there's no room for error in the win-or-go-home format.\n\nLast year, the Broncos made the playoffs for the first time since 2015, but they were promptly eliminated in the wild-card round. Now back in the postseason, they're looking to make a deep run with home-field advantage.\n\n“It’s just a mindset, I believe,\" cornerback Pat Surtain said when asked what changes for a player in the playoffs. \"We all realize in a tournament it’s do or die. It’s really almost zero margin of error once you’re in the tournament. We feel like, as a team we have a lot to correct and a lot to adjust, but at the end of the day, we are glad we have home-field advantage. You need as much of an advantage going into the playoffs. That’s a huge part of it, securing the No. 1 seed and getting home-field advantage. That’s big time for us. I feel like we aren’t a finished product. We aren’t where we want to be yet. Like I said before, I feel like we are very dangerous knowing that we have home-field advantage right in front of us.”\n\nAfter a first-round bye, Denver will host the lowest advancing seed from the AFC in the divisional round next week. The Broncos will face either the Los Angeles Chargers (No. 7), Buffalo Bills (No. 6), Houston Texans (No. 5) or Pittsburgh Steelers (No. 4) on either Jan. 17 or Jan. 18.

He was a member of the Kansas City Super Bowl LIV championship team and recently officially retired with the franchise.\n\nThe former Tennessee Volunteer was selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft after his illustrious collegiate career. He spent 14 seasons in Kansas City before joining various teams in the final stretch of his career.\n\nFor 15 seasons, Colquitt experienced the franchise's highs and lows.

    "description": "Stephen Ross has a new GM (Jon-Eric Sullivan). If he can land John Harbaugh, it will redefine his ownership of the Miami Dolphins.",
    "fullText": "Fourth-and-goal, 8-yard line, five seconds left in the Super Bowl, down by four. If that’s enough to make your palms sweaty, good.\n\nIf it’s enough to make Stephen Ross’ palms sweaty, even better.\n\nAaron Brewer is about to snap the ball to you, Steve. What you do with it will cement your legacy, that’s all. You’re not just cleaning house for the Miami Dolphins, but rebuilding it from the ground up. Get it right and much of the past 17 years becomes a footnote. Maybe not forgotten, but forgiven. They say this is a “what have you done for me lately?” world, so all you have to do is nail these hirings the way you have so often done in the business world.\n\nJon-Eric Sullivan is the new general manager. Within days, John Harbaugh will be the new head coach, at least if the collective will of South Florida has anything to say about it. Together they’ll represent a sweeping change the likes of which this franchise hasn’t undertaken in forever.\n\nMore Dolphins: New GM pledges Dolphins will be physical, tough and resilient. | Schad\n\nIf their results also produce sweeping change — if the Dolphins become relevant again this time of year — it will rewrite the book on Ross’ ownership of the Dolphins, which started in 2009. All those years of mediocrity. Of missing the playoffs. Of seeing coaches such as Joe Philbin come and Dan Campbell go. Of failing with the wrong quarterbacks and flailing at the right ones. Roll it into a ball and give Ross a pass if on fourth-and-goal, he seals the deal.\n\nRoss said after last season that status quo was a no-go. He followed by firing general manager Chris Grier on Halloween and coach Mike McDaniel two days after the season. That’s how things go in the cutthroat world that is the NFL, although doubt creeps into one’s mind wondering if those fans celebrating their departures would do so if they actually knew either man. (Illegal use of sentiment, I know.)\n\nWe’re just getting to know Sullivan, who will be leaving his role as vice president of player personnel in Green Bay. He has spent 22 years in the Packers’ organization, so we know he’s loyal, experienced in making shrewd decisions and about to ditch his ice scraper. He learned from some of the best, including Ted Thompson and Brian Gutekunst. And he learned where his strengths lie.\n\n“You’ve got to know who you are,” he said in a YouTube video on “The Unsung” while explaining why he’s not a coach. “I think I’m a better evaluator than I am a patient teacher.”\n\nTrust your eyes more than your numbers. “Analytics are not going to supersede the film,” he said.\n\nDon’t rely on other teams’ rejects. “You build through the draft,” he said. “It’s a young man’s game. You want to make sure you’re acquiring young, talented players that fit your culture. I think you experiment through free agency. … Those are dangerous waters to tread in all the time because teams typically aren’t moving from good players that are healthy and good in the locker room.”\n\nCollaboration (that often-overused word inside the Dolphins’ facility) has its limits. “If we are all agreeing, nobody is thinking, you know what I mean?” he said. “If I’m a decision-maker and have a bunch of guys in the room tell me what I want to hear, that’s not very valuable to me.”\n\nWhereas earning a wild-card spot has been cause for celebration in Miami, it’s nothing new to Sullivan. The Packers won the Super Bowl in 2010, a year after Ross took over the Dolphins. Green Bay qualified for this year’s playoffs, as it has all of the past seven seasons except one. That leaves Dolphins fans in a bind, knowing Sullivan’s hire looks smarter with each successive Packers victory, but each victory postpones when Sullivan can toss half his wardrobe and start fixing the Dolphins.\n\nOne more thing. Might as well address the elephant in the room: What’s with the hyphenated name?\n\n“I’m still wondering about that,” Sullivan said. “I’m not sure why my parents did that to me. … At this point nobody calls me Jon. But nobody calls me Jon-Eric, either. It’s either J.E. or Sully, which I’m OK with, because Jon-Eric’s a lot to spit out. I don’t like introducing myself as Jon-Eric because I see people tilt their head and wonder, ‘Is this your first and middle name? Is this your whole first or last name?’ ”\n\nThat brings us to J.W. Harbaugh, better known as John.\n\nNo sense putting too much on reports that the Dolphins haven’t yet contacted him. Word is Harbaugh won’t begin sorting out his next chapter until next week. And so much of this business can be a matter of semantics. If Ross called an end-around and his people contacted Harbaugh’s people using the Cone of Silence buried inside a back channel, does that constitute “contact”? And while it would be nice for Harbaugh to know he’s very much wanted here, is there even the slightest chance, given Ross’ longstanding ties to the Harbaugh family, that a man as sharp as John doesn’t already know that?\n\nThe real pickle is what happens if Harbaugh’s next stop is elsewhere, say a team with a stable quarterback situation or a salary cap that isn’t drowning in red ink. Would Ross have fired McDaniel anyway? Would that bring, say, Jacksonville defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile back into the picture? Or has Ross had enough of first-time head coaches and does he go with Mike McCarthy?\n\nWe just witnessed quarterback Carson Beck carry the Miami Hurricanes into the end zone in a scenario not unlike the fourth-and-goal test Ross now faces.\n\nThere can be no question Ross will happily meet Harbaugh’s price.\n\nDoes he get to write the check, and with it, a new narrative on his ownership of the Dolphins?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Beach Post: Dolphins' Stephen Ross hits legacy-defining moment on John Harbaugh",

    "description": "Former New York Times writer Harvey Araton's novel reveals a raucous life of a youth athlete, and lessons we can all learn from it.",
    "fullText": "It’s a statement but also a question we can ask ourselves as sports parents.\n\nIt’s driven into our kids very early, often by us.\n\nOr is it to just enjoy the experience?\n\n“Dad, according to Mom, asked the parents in our group not to worry about how good we were, or weren’t,” writes author Harvey Araton, through the eyes of a kid named “Z,” in a new middle-grade novel.\n\nZ’s dad was the coach of the boy’s first soccer team. It’s a neighborhood collection of grade school buddies. Dad didn’t just roll out the ball, though. He orchestrated drills that mimicked game situations that gave everyone a shot at the action.\n\n“You scrimmage too much, and the same kids, the stronger players, will dominate the ball, and then how do the other kids get better?” Z overhears his dad telling his mom early in the book.\n\nEveryone notices, in fiction and reality, when others don’t have this growth mentality.\n\nZ and his teammates hear opposing parents scream for blood, or at least a foul, when his team, once a doormat, incrementally starts to get better and begins to dominate.\n\nThe kids of manic youth sports parents, one of whom Araton admits to once being himself, is whom he wants to reach. The veteran sportswriter, most recently with The New York Times for 25 years, covered the Danny Almonte age scandal at the 2001 Little League World Series, and the ensuing escalation of Little League World Series coverage into American living rooms.\n\nHe has pondered or written about (or both) kids choosing between club and high school soccer and early sports specialization.\n\nHe also played the role of sports dad to two now-grown sons (36 and 32).\n\n“Kids learn playing sports,” Araton tells USA TODAY Sports. “I think there's a joy in that. I just feel, especially at these early years, it's becoming infected with this ambition that there could be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and I think too many parents become obsessed with turning their children into potential cash machines.”\n\nAraton launched the book last week with a signing at his local bookstore in Montclair, New Jersey. He made sure to also include a panel discussion about youth sports. He spoke with us about how his novel imitates the raucous life America lives within it, and the lessons he has gleaned from it.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nAraton is from Staten Island, which he describes as New York City’s last developed borough. It still has large swaths of parks and fields, where his story is set.\n\nHe had grown up on the basketball courts near his public housing development. The free play felt natural as it took him to the local Jewish community center and high school. He eventually played at a health club in Brooklyn as an adult and even worked in Madison Square Garden, where he covered the Knicks, the team he had idolized as a kid.\n\nHis competitive juices carried him into fatherhood when his older son, Alex, was in first grade and had the option of going out for a travel team. It’s a decision many of us have faced.\n\n“I remember asking him if he wanted to try out,” Araton says. “And he was kind of a naturally cautious kid and said, ‘Not really,’ and I remember being disappointed, a little deflated. Maybe I already was thinking, ‘If he doesn't go into this next level, he'll fall behind and never catch up, (and) there will go any chance of playing in high school.’ I mean, I could look at my kids, look at their size even at that age and know that they weren't likely to be D1 college athletes.\n\n“But I remember being disappointed and over the next couple of weeks, I came up with five or six different ways to pose the same question. Well, Nick's trying out, you sure you don't want (to)? And he kept saying no. And then the last time that I asked, he said, ‘No, dad.’ And then he looked at me and said, ‘But if I don't play travel, can I still play in the town league?’\n\n“And I remember feeling this sensation of shame because I realized in that moment that I was projecting my own ambitions and my own sports values onto this 6-year-old kid. And all he wanted to do at that point in his life was just run around and play with a bunch of kids he knew and maybe take one or two things out of any game and feel good about himself and look forward to the snacks.”\n\nThe book’s central character, who tells the story in the first person, is a combination of Araton’s two sons. Charly, Alex’s younger brother, was 4-foot-11 when he entered high school but played on the basketball team for four years.\n\nZ is left-footed with really good field vision like Alex and he’s small and feisty like Charly was. It doesn’t seem to bother Z when his young team is losing because he knows he will celebrate the things they all did well, or at least enjoyed, at Big Mitch’s restaurant afterward.\n\nBig Mitch is the father of his friend and teammate, Lloyd.\n\n“You only let in, like, seven or eight goals on an undefeated travel team,” he tells Lloyd, the team’s goalie, in the book. “Do you think a kid who was out of shape could do that?”\n\nZ becomes less comfortable when sports becomes more and more competitive. His father has a horrific accident and the team eventually gets a coach from England, who adopts a similar skills-first mindset with the kids. Kevin, the coach, who has also had a traumatic experience with his father, takes Z under his wing.\n\nAs the boys and girls on the team continue to rise in competition level, and travel further and further away from Staten Island, Z gets a much more transactional coach.\n\nHe feels himself immersed in a world over which he has less and less control, similar to the experiences Araton observed and felt as a soccer dad.\n\n“The reason why I chose soccer is because I probably was most closely involved with that, whether it was as coaching them in the early grades or just being at the games and kind of like, living for it a little bit,” he says. “I understand why parents are so heavily involved. After a week of work you really look forward to the experience of the games. It's like an adrenaline rush but also I think, it created a whole social network with the parents of their teammates and friends and everything. So I get the temptation, and the seductiveness, of it all, but (it) all got completely out of control, as well.”\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nWhile Araton was growing up on Staten Island, the borough’s Mid-Island Little League won it all in Williamsport. Years later, as a sportswriter, Araton caught up with Danny Yaccarino, who came within one strike of a perfect game during that 1964 Little League World Series against Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nHe wrote a column, (‘After Perfection at the Age of 12, What's Next?’) detailing how Yaccarino became a very good high school pitcher and reached the Baltimore Orioles organization and yet, he was always haunted by the feeling of coming so close to near-perfection as a Little Leaguer and not getting it.\n\n“Not only did he get a lot of bench jockeying and all that stuff throughout his career, but he also put incredible pressure on himself,” Araton says. “He turned out to be a minor league pitcher and he never went very far. But he told me that he finished his career feeling like an abject failure.”\n\nZ feels an emptiness, too, at the climax of the book. It's a feeling that can be induced by us.\n\n\"Parents, being vulnerable, and easily manipulated into spending vast sums of money, (wind) up treating their children like they are speculating on a stock, an investment,\" Araton says. \"They're not stocks that will pay off at 8 or 9 or 10 years; they're developing human beings.\"\n\n“Z, we’re running behind,” his mother yells upstairs, trying to get him moving for his U-13 fall season-opening game. She’s now the team’s driven parent-manager.\n\n“The construction of this story is really about Z coming to an understanding of what role sports should play in his life,” Araton says. “And when I say that, I mean, at that particular time, kids are always subject to change. He's at a point in his life where he's experienced family trauma, and, when he looks around, he doesn't see the friends who he loves, the kids that he grew up playing with. He sees a lot of strange kids. And that's not what he wants. More than playing at an elite level, he wants to play with kids who know him, who know what he's gone through.\n\n“He realizes that he still loves the game, but will only play it under his terms.”\n\nIsn’t that what we all want? What about our kids, too?\n\n“You could offer them the higher-level stuff,” Araton says, “but if it's being forced upon them, and if you're calling up to their bedroom every time there's practice, then it's clear that they don't really want to do it.\n\n“I wouldn't deny an exceptional child that kind of pathway any more than you would, say, if you had a child who (was) a mathematical genius or a classical violinist, you would want them to have the best teachers to best capitalize on their special talent. But the temptation is so great because sports is the most visible thing in the community. …\n\n\"It'll become pretty obvious to a parent if they have someone special. But this whole notion that they can create one by spending significant sums of money, I think it's really overstated.”\n\nAraton points to another interview he did, with Yael Averbuch, the general manager of the New Jersey/New York Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She played for an exclusive club team in high school, won two national championships playing for the University of North Carolina and was drafted professionally.\n\nHer mother said she never had to yell upstairs for practice. Yael was the one yelling to them.\n\nAraton’s sons, like Z, had to figure out where sports fit into their lives. It worked out for them, too.\n\nAlex, who played high school soccer, is a special education teacher and Charly, the high school basketball player (who has grown to about 5-foot-9 today), works in marketing strategies for a fashion brand. He still plays in men’s leagues.\n\nAraton says those middle-grade age groups – 8 to 12, give or take – are the ages where people know the least amount about who their children are as athletes.\n\n“Don’t be disappointed if at the age of 8, they are not willing to do all this stuff and make all that sacrifice,” he says. “They might be ready when they're 11. Kids do things on their own time schedules. So just accept who they are and let them experience sports in the way they want to. They’ll enjoy it more and get more out of it.\n\n“If they're not playing for the idea of feeling good about themselves, about learning to be a coachable kid, and be a good teammate, to play with kids from all different backgrounds and develop their skills at the fundamental level at the age of 7, 8, 9, 10,” Araton says, “then they're playing for the wrong reasons.\n\n“Each shall develop at their own rate. I just think that parents have to chill and let the kids experience it for themselves.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 running back room could feature a new face from the transfer portal, and while Baylor transfer back Bryson Washington made his way to College Station this weekend, Washington is now in the mix for the Texas native, which have have made a significant push this week. However, this doesn't rule out the Aggies landing a transfer running back, as a new name has emerged.\n\nAccording to AggieYell insider Jaxson Callaway, Texas A&M is now targeting Michigan State transfer running back Makhi Frazier, who is reportedly coming off a Friday visit to Ohio State. While this may seem daunting, the Aggies have won multiple transfer battles against the Buckeyes this month. Still, adding another running back isn't A&M's top priority compared to other programs.\n\nWashington is still the No. 1 running back target for head coach Mike Elko and his staff, and Callaway is right to state that the rest of the RB portal market will depend on Washington's choice regarding which way the Huskies will go.\n\n\"At the moment, much of the running back market appears to be waiting on Washington’s decision.\"\n\nFocusing on Frazier, the McKinney, Texas native is listed at 5'10\" and nearly 220 pounds, and is coming off an impressive 2025 sophomore campaign after rushing for 520 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.5 yards per carry.\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Frazier earned a solid offensive grade (74.8) and a rushing grade (77.6), which bodes well for his future as a potential starting or No. 2 running back. Frazier will continue to be a name to watch, but until Bryson Washington makes his decision, both players will be the top backs on the Aggies' radar.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Transfer RB Makhi Frazier has emerged as a Texas A&M target",

    "description": "Joel Embiid discusses the win for the Philadelphia 76ers over the Orlando Magic as well as the rewarding feeling of playing again.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- The Philadelphia 76ers picked up an important 103-91 win over the Orlando Magic on Friday night. Not only did the win keep the winning vibes going for Philadelphia as it has won five of its last six games, but the win secured the all-important tiebreaker for the Sixers as they clinched the season series 2-1 over the Magic.\n\nThe win also pushed Philadelphia a game and a half ahead of the Magic in the standings. Everything in the Eastern Conference is so bunched up, and even though it's still early in the season, every win counts and it's important for the Sixers to win these types of games.\n\n\"It's still early in the season,\" said Joel Embiid who finished with 22 points and nine rebounds in the win. \"It's kind of hard to start thinking about tie breaks and all that, but it's good. Obviously, we’re right there with them. Our aim is to keep winning and keep climbing up the standings, and they happen to do the same thing, and if that's needed. I guess that's a good thing.\"\n\nSpeaking of Embiid, he played in his sixth straight game on Friday. It's the first time the big fella has played in six straight games was from Jan. 15, 2024 to Jan. 25, 2024. It's a big leap for Embiid as the 2023 MVP winner continues to get his rhythm and get back on track as a player.\n\n\"Yeah, it feels good,\" Embiid smiled after the win. \"That's why, even with fatigue that you're feeling from your body getting used to it's just that fact of just being on the floor and playing basketball. That just makes me so happy.\"\n\nEmbiid's main thing when asked about his availability all season has been \"gotta keep it going\" as he brushes off the idea of playing in so many consecutive games as some big deal. However, he thought about it and realized how much of a big step this is for him.\n\n\"Obviously, one thing I learned, especially the last two years being in this moment, I enjoy it,\" Embiid added. \"I know I usually say, ‘Oh, got to keep building on it,' but this is a moment where I'm like, I'm sure maybe not of a lot of people out there never thought this would happen again. So, got to keep playing and put in the work to keep that going.\"\n\nWith that being said, this hasn't been a walk in the park for Embiid. The big fella is certainly feeling it in the middle of playing so many games after so much time off.\n\n\"I feel OK, physically,\" he finished. \"It was one of those nights that I haven't been two or three years playing as much. So, I kind of felt it before the game and start the game, but you push through it. That's how you get better. You get used. You get used to it that grind again.\"\n\nEmbiid and the Sixers will finish this quick 3-game trip with a back-to-back against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Joel Embiid talks Sixers' win over Magic, rewarding feeling of playing",

Peetz, 42, has spent the past two seasons with the Seahawks as its offensive passing game coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC and a first-round bye in this year's playoffs after finishing with a 14-3 regular-season record and capturing the NFC West title with a Week 18 win at San Francisco.\n\nWorking alongside Seattle offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, Peetz and the Seahawks boast the NFL's No. 8 total offense (351. yards per game), its No. 8 passing offense (228.1 passing yards per game) and its No. 3 scoring offense (28.4 points per game).\n\nThe #Lions will interview #Seahawks passing game coordinator Jake Peetz for their OC job, source says.

That frustration has led to some protests, including various banners demanding change being flown over MetLife Stadium.\n\nOther fans have taken their anger directly to the desk of Giants co-owner John Mara, writing him letters of disgust -- something he, like his late father, will often read and respond to, personally.\n\nThat frustration continued to grow in 2025, but with one caveat: In September, Mara revealed he had been diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"I have recently been diagnosed with cancer and have been following the treatment plan recommended by an outstanding team of doctors,\" Mara said in a statement. \"I'm feeling strong and optimistic, and I'm committed to seeing this through to a positive outcome.\n\n\"I plan to remain active with the team throughout my treatment, and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by incredible support -- personally, professionally, and medically. I ask that you respect my privacy and my family’s privacy at this time.\"\n\nAs he battled cancer, Mara was less visible around the team.

    "fullText": "Liverpool may have managed to edge out a draw against Arsenal on Thursday but that doesn't mean that they performed well.\n\nThe Anfield outfit may have kept Mikel Arteta's men at bay but that doesn't excuse their poor attacking performance.\n\nIndeed, players such as Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike are currently absent from Arne Slot's team so their attack is severely weakened.\n\nHowever, the fact that they had zero shots on target is a massive cause for concern, especially since players such as Florian Wirtz and Cody Gakpo were on the pitch.\n\nAs mentioned, many of Liverpool's attackers aren't able to play for the club at the moment.\n\nThis means that those who are available need to prove that they have what it takes to plug the gaps when their teammates aren't around.\n\nAnd, while some players stepped up, Gakpo wasn't one of them with the attacker putting in yet another lacklustre performance in their draw against Arsenal.\n\nAlthough the Dutchman started the game as Liverpool's left-winger, he often drifted into the centre of the park and while he may have caused the odd problem or two for the Gunners, his finishing isn't good enough for him to be a striker.\n\nIndeed, there have been times in the past when Gakpo has played well as a number nine but more often than not, he's let the team down.\n\nThursday's game was no different either with the attacker often falling at the final hurdle or when entering Arsenal's box.\n\nLast term, he massively benefitted from Salah and Luis Diaz pushing ahead of him but, since the Reds don't have many options available to them at the moment, he's the one Arne Slot is turning towards to lead his attack.\n\nIt's clear that this isn't going to work with Thursday's outing further proving this.\n\nOne thing that has been made abundantly clear this season is that Slot favours certain players, even if they're not in good form.\n\nGakpo has been one of the Reds' worst-performing attackers this term but he's still started more games than most of his teammates.\n\nAnd, as per Sofascore, his lack of form continued in their recent 0-0 draw with Arsenal on Thursday.\n\nDespite playing an advanced role throughout the clash, Gakpo only managed to hit one shot towards David Raya.\n\nAdditionally, he only managed to maintain a pass accuracy of 77 per cent and he also failed to make any key passes.\n\nGakpo only had 42 touches of the ball despite staying on the pitch for the entire game with the Dutchman also losing possession of the ball 10 times.\n\nDefensively, the winger was just as bad with the former PSV star only winning 44 per cent of his ground duels.\n\nNot only do these statistics prove how poor he was against the Gunners but they also make questions about Slot's decision-making arise.\n\nHere's hoping he can learn from his mistakes and improve over the next month or so.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have brought in some of the most legendary players ever to play the game, but they’ve also seen plenty of big names slip through their fingers during transfer windows.\n\nManchester United are linked with plenty of potential signings every year, and 2026 is no different.\n\nWith the January window open, United haven’t been quick to make any new signings. Ineos appears content to wait until summer for their main targets.\n\nThey missed out on Antoine Semenyo, who joined Manchester City earlier this week.\n\nIn midfield, Carlos Baleba was a failed target from Brighton and most of the other midfielders they are looking at aren’t available yet.\n\nIf anyone does end up leaving during the season, United may look to bring someone in. Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte have both been mentioned as potential departures as they look for more playing time ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nUnited have had several big near misses when it comes to transfers.\n\nFrom Wesley Sneijder and Thiago Alcantara to Ronaldinho and Patrick Kluivert, United have missed out on many top players down the years.\n\nJavier Zanetti, who spent 19 seasons with Inter Milan, has now shared his experience of turning down an approach from Sir Alex Ferguson. Speaking to the Daily Mail, the Argentina legend recalled:\n\n“We met at an airport,” said Zanetti. “He told me that he wanted me to go to Manchester United and I thanked him.”\n\n“Manchester United is one of the most important clubs in the world and Ferguson one of the most important coaches in the history of football,” he added. “But I told him that my footballing life would be through Inter, I wanted to play for them until the end of my career. And he understood that.”\n\nZanetti stayed loyal to Inter throughout his career, becoming a club icon much like how Ferguson valued loyalty within his own squads.\n\nZanetti won five consecutive Serie A titles with Inter from 2005/06 to 2009/10. The club also lifted the Champions League trophy in 2010 under Jose Mourinho, along with a FIFA Club World Cup title.\n\nMourinho clearly valued their time together too. When he picked his all-time best XI from players he’d managed, Zanetti was named as his right-back:\n\nZanetti ranks Mourinho highly among the managers he played for during his career.\n\nUnder Mourinho, Inter achieved a historic treble in 2010, featuring one of the strongest squads in the club’s history.\n\nWhen asked about Mourinho, Zanetti described him as one of the best he’d worked with.\n\nHe said: “We won everything with him but beyond winning it was his personality, his ability, his intelligence, his capacity as a coach. He was very important in my career.”",

    "fullText": "Are the NFL's overtime rules needlessly complex? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNFL overtime was supposed to make games fairer. Instead, it has become one of the most confusing and overbuilt systems in professional sports — especially in the playoffs, where the rules quietly change again and grow even more complicated.\n\nWhat should be a simple extension of the game now feels like a rulebook within the rulebook.\n\nOvertime still begins with a coin toss, and the winner isn’t just choosing who gets the ball — they can also choose to defer or even pick which end of the field to defend. Before a single snap is played, layers of strategy and technicalities are already in motion.\n\nUnder the current system, both teams are guaranteed at least one possession, even if the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown. That team must then kick off and allow the opponent a chance to respond. The only way the game can end immediately is if the defense scores a safety on the opening possession — another rare and oddly specific exception that fans must remember.\n\nThe postseason adds even more complexity. Overtime periods are 15 minutes instead of 10. If a team’s guaranteed possession is still ongoing when time expires, it simply carries over into another overtime period. The game is treated like a continuation of regulation, complete with three timeouts per team, two-minute warnings, and end-of-half clock rules. If the game remains tied, teams line up for yet another kickoff, with only a brief two-minute “halftime” if a second overtime is reached. And in the extremely unlikely event that four overtime periods are played, another coin toss resets the format yet again.\n\nAll of this exists in the name of fairness — but fairness has slowly been confused with overcorrection.\n\nThe NFL has rewritten its overtime rules multiple times over the years, most notably after Josh Allen never touched the ball in the Bills’ playoff loss to the Chiefs. That game sparked the guaranteed-possession rule, fundamentally changing overtime strategy. But in doing so, the league didn’t just tweak a flaw — it created a system that increasingly minimizes the need to actually play defense. Now, if you win the toss and have a capable offense, you’re almost guaranteed to at least extend the game, regardless of whether your defense can get a stop.\n\nAt some point, the league has to ask whether it’s designing rules for competition — or designing them around star players who feel they were wronged.\n\nIf the NFL is going to adjust overtime every time a high-profile quarterback is unhappy with how a season ended, it might as well take the next logical step and adopt the NCAA overtime model. College football’s system is cleaner. It’s clearer. And most importantly, it’s more exciting. Both teams know exactly what they’re getting: equal opportunities, immediate pressure, and a true test of execution in scoring situations.\n\nFootball thrives on simplicity — move the ball, stop the ball, score more points, win the game. The current NFL overtime system has drifted far from that. What was meant to be fair has become bloated, confusing, and increasingly disconnected from the core of the sport. If overtime is going to feel this manufactured anyway, the league may as well choose a model that fans can actually understand — and enjoy.",

    "description": "A trade of three sub-replacement players with Cleveland — and somehow the South Siders end up on the short end",
    "fullText": "1940 \nIn a trade of sub-replacement players, the White Sox sent second baseman Ollie Bejma and shortstop Johnny Gerlach to Cleveland for second baseman Skeeter Webb. Bejma and Gerlach would never play a game for Cleveland, nor ever in the majors again. However, Cleveland got the best of this deal: Webb played for four seasons on the South Side, providing sound defense but an utterly abysmal bat that netted -2.4 WAR and a 46 OPS+.\n\nSomehow, Webb played for four more years in the majors after leaving Chicago.\n\n1945 \nDespite not even holding a Hall of Fame vote in 1943 or 1944, the BBWAA fails to elect a single player, despite several worthy candidates that include legendary White Sox hurler Ed Walsh. Walsh’s 66.5 WAR career (at the time, if the metrics existed, Walsh was the 13th-best starting pitcher ever per JAWS and STILL ranks 37th all-time) was deemed good enough for the Hall by only 55.5% of voters.\n\nWalsh would in fact fail on his final attempt at getting voted in (his seventh ballot, in 1946, back when players could be considered for just 10 years after retirement), falling back to just 40.3% support. In some weird twist, Walsh ended up getting elected along with 10 others via an “Old Timers” vote that same year.\n\n1992 \nIt was one of the worst deals in White Sox GM Ron Schueler’s career, as he traded pitcher Melido Perez and minor hurlers Bob Wickman and Domingo Jean to the Yankees for Steve Sax. Schueler envisioned a devastating 1-2 punch at the top of the order in Tim Raines and Sax, followed by Frank Thomas and Robin Ventura. It never happened, as Sax suddenly forget how to hit and was gone from the team by late April 1994. Making matters worse is that Wickman would go on to become a top relief pitcher and two-time All-Star, winning 63 games and saving 267 in his MLB career.\n\nSax did have one moment of glory with the White Sox. On May 5, 1993 in Milwaukee he made an incredible catch in left field on a ball hit by Bill Doran with the lead run on base. It happened in the eighth inning, when Sax broke back and to his left on the drive and caught the ball with his right arm extended. The angle and momentum caused him to tumble, and he lost the ball out of his glove on the way down. Just before hitting the ground, he snagged the ball with his bare left hand, holding it up to the umpire after he hit the grass. That saved a run, and the Sox won the game, 3-1, on a Ventura home run in the top of the ninth inning.\n\n2011 \nThe White Sox signed reliever Will Ohman to a two-year, $4 million deal. The southpaw had a solid enough 2011 (4.22 ERA/103 ERA+, 0.5 WAR in 59 games) for the underachieving White Sox. However, Ohman’s 2012 was so bad (6.41 ERA/67 ERA+, -0.3 WAR in 32 games) that the White Sox released him on July 3 and ate the last million of his contract.\n\nOhman would not reach the majors again.\n\n2019 \nAs the next step in their ill-fated “Manny Machado Friends and Family” caper to cajole the prime free agent target to Chicago, the White Sox signed journeyman outfielder Jon Jay to a $4 million deal. Jay was a close Machado friend, who along with Machado and Machado’s brother-in-law, Yonder Alonzo, fashioned the so-called Miami Baseball Brotherhood, training together in the offseason.\n\nDespite immediate, embarrassing spins like Machado or no Machado, Jon Jay Brings plenty to White Sox, there was nothing about Jay’s mediocre career, or -0.3 WAR and 68 OPS+ in 2018 with the Diamondbacks, that warranted $4 million — beyond being Manny’s caddy.\n\nThe experiment was a disaster, as Machado spurned the White Sox for San Diego (with Jay and Alonzo rubbing in salt by praising their friend’s decision!) and Jay played just 47 games in Chicago, somehow surpassing his awful 2018 with -0.7 WAR as a White Sox.",

    "description": "Guide on coding a bare metal program with UART output for RISC-V and running the emulation with QEMU. Brief overview of the RISC-V boot process.",
    "fullText": "Today we’re going to explore how to write a bare metal program for a RISC-V machine. For reproducibility, the target is a QEMU riscv64 virt machine.\n\nWe will briefly cover the initial stages of the RISC-V machine bootup and where you can plug in your custom software to program the bare metal machine!\n\nAt the end of this article, we will write a bare metal program for our RISC-V machine and send a string ‘hello’ to the user, without depending on any supporting software on the running machine whatsoever (OS kernel, libraries, anything).\n\nMachine bootup and running the initial software\n\nWriting a custom “BIOS” for RISC-V\n\nFeel free to skip the section on general concepts if you are familiar with how computers boot\n\nWhen a real machine is powered on, the hardware first runs the health checks and then loads the first instructions to run into its memory. Once the instructions are loaded, the processor core intializes its registers and the program counter points to the first instruction. From that point on, the software can run.\n\nIn simpler setups like small microcontrollers, this is all the software there is, just a single binary blob of instructions. The processor will execute just that going forward. In a more complex setup like a laptop or a phone, there are more stages to the startup.\n\nIn those more complex setups, traditionally, the first instructions are the BIOS, whose task is to subsequently load the bootloader into the memory and hand-off the control to it. The bootloader is usually small and easy to load into the running memory and the processor can easily start running its code. It proceeds to load the operating system kernel into the memory (implementing the bootloader though is a science of its own).\n\nEach machine loads the initial software in its own way. For example, the BIOS can be stored on a separate storage chip and upon powerup, the contents of the storage are simply filled into the memory at a fixed address and the processor just executes starting from that address.\n\nriscv64 virt machine, even though its virtualized, still has its own boot sequence. It goes through multiple stages, and at the moment, we will not be exploring them all. Please stay tuned for the follow-up articles with those details.\n\nThe key to understanding this virtual machine is that, obviously, it has no chip attached to it from which to read the software (it is virtual) so QEMU simulates this in some way. You might have seen the flag -bios for QEMU examples before and hopefully now you have a strong intuition what it could be. If you’re guessing this is passing the very first instructions that your virtual RISC-V core is executing upon the startup, you are almost correct.\n\nOnce you power on this virtual machine, QEMU fills the memory at 0x1000 with a few instructions and sets the program counter right to that address. This is the equivalent of a real machine having some hardcoded ROM firmware on the board (tucked away in some chip) and just dumping the contents into the RAM upon the bootup. You do not have the control over these instructions, i.e. they are not a part of your software image, and generally, I do not see a reason why you would want to override those, and they are actually quite useful for more complicated setups (I promise we will cover them in a follow up article). For the curious ones, these few instructions are the Zero Stage Bootloader (ZSBL). The ZSBL sets up a few registers for reasons we’ll explore in the future (right now, you can basically ignore this register setup) and jumps to the address 0x80000000 which is where the action truly begins!\n\n0x80000000 is where the first user-provided instructions to QEMU are running, and they are loaded there as soon as the virtual machine starts. If you don’t pass anything, QEMU will use the default and load up a piece of software called OpenSBI. The next article in this blog will be exactly what is the concept behind SBI in RISC-V and what exactly OpenSBI is. It’s important to note that SBI on RISC-V isn’t really BIOS, but something very similar. My personal guess is that the QEMU authors simply recycled the flag that was available and representing BIOS on other architectures like x86. Anyway, something to keep in mind is that SBI is generally very similar to BIOS in terms of what it does, and more importantly, it is something you can customize.\n\nThe -bios flag is the ELF a binary file containing instructions and potentially some other data, organized in sections. ELF is the standard binary format for Linux, and the details of the ELF file format are way outside the scope of this article, but a sufficient mental model here is that it is simply a key-value map where key is the starting address of a section, and the value is the bunch of bytes that need to be loaded into the memory at that address. Therefore, the ELF file provided to the -bios flag should fill out the memory starting at 0x80000000 (and this is indeed what QEMU’s default OpenSBI image does).\n\nIf you have been booting an operating system with QEMU before (e.g. Linux), you have likely used the -kernel flag. It is basically the same thing as the -bios flag: you can pass it an ELF image which covers some other memory region, and conceptually it will just dump the bytes in the memory. We won’t be using this flag today, we’ll cover its usage in the following articles.\n\nEven though conceptually ELF files represent just ways to fill in the memory, they are definitely not super simple that you can write a quick parser in one afternoon. A careful reader may wonder how does the machine then know to parse out the contents mapped to some address 0x12345678 from the ELF file and load the memory with those. This would be a great observation — in our case, we are using a virtual machine and we are basically simulating a machine which conceptually has such intelligent digital circuitry or amazingly complex initial software bootloader that is available in the machine’s memory right upon the powerup. That is, of course, not what happens in the real machines. The software that is loaded upon the powerup is stored on the machine storage as a flat binary blob that is blindly just dumped into the memory upon the powerup, there is really no parsing involved, but since we’re dealing with a virtual machine here, the sky is the limit, we are not bound by the complexities of manufacturing the hardware that does any of this.\n\nWe have established that 0x80000000 is the location of the first user-provided instruction that the machine executes. I provided it as just a fact, and if you really want a little more background as to why this might be so, you can start from here. Basically, what we see here is that DRAM is mapped to start at the 0x80000000 in the address space (if you don’t know what this means, don’t worry, it will not be too relevant for the rest of this article).\n\nLet’s begin by building an ELF file that will lay some processor instructions at address 0x80000000 that will give the user a message ‘hello’!\n\nThose who have done embedded systems programming in the past are surely familiar with the concept of UART. UART is a very simple device used for the most basic form of input/output: there is one wire for input (receiving, known as RX) and one wire for output (transmit, known as TX), and one bit goes onto the wire at the time. If you’re connecting two devices to speak to each other over UART, one device’s TX is the other device’s RX, and the other way around. If you’re reading this article and have not done anything with UART before, I strongly suggest at least getting the cheapest possible Arduino and having it speak to your computer through a USB-to-UART cable. The concept would be identical to what we’re doing here, but you would be doing it for real, and it will make more sense, since the scenario here is entirely virtualized.\n\nQEMU virtualizes an UART device on the virtual machine, and our software can access it. When you open the QEMU’s serial port (UART) section, what happens is basically when you press a keyboard button, the code for that button is sent out of your host’s TX to the VM’s RX and when the VM outputs something on its TX, it will be rendered to you graphically in the terminal (so you don’t have to otherwise decode the electrical signals from the simulated board :)), e.g. if the VM sends out 8 bits representing 65, your QEMU will render the character a, since that is its ASCII code.\n\nWe know that QEMU maps UART at the address 0x10000000 (you can check it in their source code) and the device that is virtualized here is NS16550A. The details do not matter here: for the purposes of the article, what this means is if you send an 8-bit value to that address from your software, that will be sent out on the TX wire of the virtualized UART device. Practically, that means if you go to QEMU’s serial port, the character you wrote to 0x10000000 will be rendered in your console.\n\nWith all this knowledge in mind, now we can write the code. The ELF file we are about to build will lay out a few instructions at 0x80000000 to print the characters, ‘h’, ‘e’, ‘l’, ‘l’ and ‘o’ in succession to the address 0x10000000. Finally, the code should then get stuck in an infinite loop (so that QEMU doesn’t crash for any strange reason and we can inspect the output)\n\nYou can save this file as hello.s. Let’s assemble this file into the machine code. In my case (and likely in yours), I am using a cross-platform toolchain, meaning that I am developing on a platform different from the target platform. Concretely, I am developing this software on an x86 machine and building for a riscv64 machine.\n\nTo assemble this file, I run the following:\n\nThe exact command may be different depending on what kind of assembler you have for riscv64, this is the tool I have obtained through my system’s package manager for Debian. I leave it to the reader to obtain the correct toolchain for building riscv64 software, it should generally be a matter of just obtaining the right software package from the Internet.\n\nNow, the code is only assembled, meaning that we have the software instructions in the machine code format, but this binary is still not ready to go and act as our fake BIOS. We need to use a linker and drive its behavior with a linker script to ensure that the instructions we have generated will be laid out at 0x80000000 as we intended. Let’s write the linker script.\n\nWe won’t be covering what all this means, but tl;dr is we now have a way to put those instructions exactly where we want them. Let’s verify with objdump.\n\nQEMU can now be fired up by running the following command:\n\nTo see what happens on UART, click the View button in the top menu and switch to the serial port view. The output should be like this:\n\nHead over to the Github repo for this article, run the make command and that will do everything we described above. You can then launch QEMU.",

    "fullText": "About three months ago I started using Jujutsu (JJ), a new Version Control System, for my personal projects. It took me a while to get used to it after more than a decade of using Git, but now I’m quite comfortable with it. Working with Jujutsu requires a shift from the mental model of Git. However, it is not as daunting as it may seem on the first day.\n\nLooking back, I don’t actually use all the fancy things JJ provides, and you may not need to either. In this post I list my most used JJ commands and how I use them. It is not meant to be a tutorial, or even a comprehensive list, but it should be enough to get you started.\n\nThis post assumes that the reader knows how to use Git.\n\nJJ uses Git as a backend. This means that you can still use Git commands in your repo, and push them to Git remotes. Your coworkers can keep using Git with shared repos without ever being aware that you use JJ.\n\njj git init initializes a new Jujutsu repository. You do this once, and you’re ready to start working. I usually run it with the --colocate option, which allows me to use Git commands as well in the same repo. If you want to work in an existing Git repo, you should run it with --git-repo . in the repo directory, to make JJ aware of it. Afterward, you don’t need to use Git commands.\n\njj git clone clones a Git repo and initializes it as a JJ repo. You can supply the --colocate option if you want.\n\njj config configures user settings. You can edit the user-level JJ config file by running jj config edit --user. You can also override settings at repo level. For example, to set a different user email for a repo, run jj config set --repo user.email someone@example.com. You can also run jj config list to list the current config in effect.\n\nThis is an area where JJ differs a lot from Git. JJ has no staging area, which means that every change you make is automatically and continuously staged. This came as a big surprise to me when I was getting started.\n\nIf you are planning to use JJ with an existing Git repo, get rid of the untracked files either by committing them, or deleting them, or adding them to .gitignore. There is literally no concept of untracked files in JJ; a file is either committed or tracked or ignored.\n\nJJ has the concept of commits, same as Git. However, the workflow is different. Since there is no staging area, you start with creating a commit. That’s right! The first thing you do is create a commit, and then fill it by changing your files. Once you are done, you finalize the commit, and move on to a new fresh commit. JJ prefers to call them “changes” instead of commits to distinguish them from Git commits.\n\njj new creates a new change. If you know what your change is about, you can start with a commit message: jj new -m \"Fixes XYZ\", but JJ does not mandate it. You can start making changes without worrying about the message.\n\nOne useful variation that I use a lot is jj new -A '<change-id>'. This creates a new change after the given change but before all the change’s descendants, effectively inserting a new change in the commit tree and rebasing every change that comes after it at the same time.\n\nOnce you are done, you can add a commit message to the current change by running jj describe. You can also provide the message inline: jj describe -m \"Fixes XYZ\". As I mentioned, you don’t need to add a message to start working on a change, but you do need it before you push the change to a Git remote. You can run it any number of times to change the current change’s message.\n\nAlternatively, you can run jj commit to describe the current commit and start a new one. It is equivalent to running jj describe followed by jj new.\n\nI use a mix of new, describe and commit, depending on the situation.\n\nLike the git status command, jj status tells you the state your current change is in. It lists the changed files and their individual statuses (added, modified, etc).\n\nThis is where JJ immensely shines over Git. Moving commits around or editing them is a massive pain in Git. However, JJ makes it so easy, I literally do it tens of times every day.\n\njj edit '<change-id>' switches you over to the given change so you can modify it further. You use this when you’ve already committed a change but you need to tweak it. By default you can edit only the changes that are not pushed to the main branch of your repo’s remote. After you edit files, all the descendant changes are automatically rebased if there are no conflicts.\n\njj squash simply combines the current change with its parent. It is useful when you commit something, and realize that you forgot to make some small changes. Another use for it is to resolve conflicts: create a new change after the conflicted change, fix the conflict, and squash it to resolve.\n\njj split is the opposite of jj squash: you use it to interactively split the current change into two or more changes. Often when I’m working on a feature and I find some unrelated things to fix, such as linter warnings, I go ahead and fix them in the same change. After I’m done with all the work for the feature, I use jj split to split the change into unrelated changes so that the project history stays clean.\n\njj restore restores files to how they were before the change, pretty much same as git restore. You can run it in interactive mode by adding the --interactive option. You can also restore the files to how they were in a different change by specifying a change ID with the --from option.\n\njj rebase moves changes from anywhere to anywhere. You can use it to move individual changes between branches, or rearrange them in the same branch like so:\n\nWhen you move single changes like this, their descendant changes become invalid, but you can move them also in the same way. Or you can move entire branch of changes:\n\nIt mostly works without any issues, but if there are conflicts, you’ll need to resolve them. I actually use rebase all the time. When I’m working on multiple features, and I find something that is more suited to be done on a different feature branch than I’m currently on, I finish working on the change, and then just move it to the different branch. Another use is to rebase feature branches on the main branch every day, like so:\n\nHere, oy, st, om, and tk are shorthand change IDs of the roots of various feature branches.\n\nYou can also use rebase to splice changes/branches in the middle of other branches using the -A (after) and -B (before) options, but I rarely do this.\n\njj duplicate is like jj rebase except the changes are not moved but copied to the destination. It’s somewhat like git cherry-pick.\n\njj abandon discards a change and rebases all its descendants onto the discarded change’s parent. I use it to get rid of failed experiments or prototypes.\n\njj absorb is supposed to automatically break the current change and integrate parts of it into ancestor changes at the right places, but I’ve never actually gotten it to work. I need to look more deeply into this.\n\njj log shows the change graph. JJ has a concept of revsets (sets of changes) that has an entire language to specify change IDs. jj log takes an -r argument that uses the revsets language to choose which changes to show. For example:\n\nThe revset language is rich and revsets can be used with many JJ commands. You can also create your own aliases for it, as we’ll see in a later section.\n\njj diff shows differences between two changes, or in general between two revsets:\n\njj show shows the details of the current change. You can also use jj show '<change-id>' to inspect another change without switching to it.\n\nI’ve been mentioning branches, but actually JJ does not have branches like Git does. Instead, it has bookmarks, which are named pointers to changes. You can bookmark any change by giving it a name, and you can manipulate the bookmarks. Then to have branches, all you need to do is to point a bookmark to the required tip of the change graph.\n\njj bookmark create '<name>' creates a new bookmark pointing to the current change with the given name. You can use bookmarks to mark the root or the tip of a feature branch, or to mark a milestone you want to return to later. When you rebase a change that a bookmark points to, the bookmark moves with it automatically.\n\nTo list all existing bookmarks, run jj bookmark list. To delete a bookmark you no longer need, run jj bookmark delete '<name>'. If the deleted bookmark is tracked as a remote Git branch, the deletion is propagated to the remote as well. Alternatively, you can delete a bookmark only locally by running jj bookmark forget '<name>'.\n\nYou can also move, rename, and set bookmarks, as well as associate/disassociate them with Git remote branches. If you push a change with a bookmark to a Git remote, JJ creates a Git branch with the same name on the remote, but locally it remains a JJ bookmark.\n\nJJ tracks each operation in the repository in an immutable log, and provides commands to work with this log.\n\njj op log shows a history of all operations performed on the repository. Each operation is assigned a unique ID, and you can see what changed with each operation.\n\nYou can use the op IDs to restore the whole repo to an earlier state by running jj op restore '<opID>'.\n\njj undo undoes the last operation performed on the repository. Unlike git reset, which modifies history, jj undo works on the Jujutsu operations themselves. This means it doesn’t lose any information; it just moves you back one step in the operation history. You can run this repeatedly to move backward in the operation history one step at a time.\n\njj redo is the opposite of jj undo, that is, it moves you forward in the operation history by one step. It can also be run repeatedly.\n\nThe operation log along with the undo and redo commands provide a safety net that makes it much easier to experiment with JJ without the fear of losing work.\n\nJJ uses Git as its backend, and provides commands to interact with remote Git repos. We already learned about jj git init and jj git clone. We can also push and fetch.\n\njj git push pushes your JJ changes to a Git remote. By default, it pushes all tracked bookmarks that have new changes. If you want to push a specific bookmark, you can specify it with jj git push --bookmark '<name>'. You can also push to all or tracked branches with the --all and --tracked options respectively. When you push, JJ converts the changes into Git commits and creates or updates remote Git branches accordingly.\n\nOne thing to note is that JJ refuses to push changes that have conflicts or are missing commit messages.\n\njj git fetch fetches changes from a Git remote and updates your local repository. It’s equivalent to git fetch. After fetching, you can see the remote changes in your change graph, and you can rebase your local changes on top of them if needed.\n\nYou can fetch from a specific remote by running jj git fetch --remote '<name>', and fetch a particular branch by running jj git fetch --branch '<name>'.\n\njj git remote manages your Git remotes. You can add a new remote with jj git remote add <name> <url>, or list existing remotes with jj git remote list. This is similar to git remote but integrated with JJ; it does not update the remotes of your underlying Git repo.\n\njj revert '<change-id>' creates a new change that undoes the effects of the specified change, pretty much like git revert. The reverted change remains in the history of the repo.\n\njj resolve marks conflicts as resolved during a merge. When JJ can’t automatically merge changes (for example, when two changes modified the same lines), it creates a conflicted state in your working directory. After you manually fix the conflicts in your files, you run jj resolve to tell JJ that the conflicts are resolved and the merge can proceed. JJ then automatically rebases any descendant changes.\n\nJJ is highly customizable through its configuration files. You can define custom aliases for commonly used commands and revsets, which can significantly ease up your workflow. These are stored in your JJ config file at the user and/or repo level. Here’s my configuration:\n\nYou can compose revsets to create new revsets. These are the ones I use:\n\nI use the above defined revsets to create some custom commands:\n\nI have the default command set to log-recent so running only jj shows me the recent log.\n\nMy usual workflow is to create a new commit, work on it, describe it, split/squash/rebase as needed, then run jj tug && jj git push.\n\nThree months in, JJ has become my primary version control tool. The learning curve was demanding, but it was worth it. The ability to freely rearrange changes and experiment without fear has fundamentally changed how I work. I spend less time wrestling with Git and more time actually coding.\n\nJJ has plenty of other useful features such as workspaces and the ability to manipulate multiple changes at once that I haven’t explored deeply. There’s a lot more to discover as I continue using it. If you use Git for personal projects and find yourself frustrated with rebasing or commit management, JJ might be worth a try.\n\nFor further learning, I recommend the Jujutsu for Everyone tutorial, Steve klabnik’s tutorial and Justin Pombrio’s cheat sheet, and of course, the official documentation.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please leave a comment below.

    "fullText": "US President Donald Trump announced Thursday that American forces would begin ground operations in Mexico targeting drug cartels, following months of naval strikes in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean.\n\n\"We are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,\" Trump said in an interview with broadcaster Sean Hannity on Fox News.\n\nTrump provided no additional information on the timing or scope of the planned land attacks.\n\nAny military strikes on Mexican territory without Mexico City's consent would violate international law and mark an unprecedented attack on a US ally and major trading partner.\n\nThe statement follows Saturday's Delta Forces-led capture of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro at a Caracas compound where he was sheltering, the culmination of an extended US military and economic campaign against his government. Maduro now faces drug trafficking charges in New York.\n\nUS strikes on narcoboats have resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people since September, according to US officials. Trump has also recently revealed that US forces struck a docking facility for such boats in Venezuela.\n\nThe naval campaign has targeted vessels suspected of smuggling cocaine and fentanyl in international waters and near Venezuela's coast. Trump has described the operations as enforcing a blockade on drug trafficking.\n\nGround strikes on cartels in Mexico would represent a substantial expansion of US military involvement in the region.\n\nMexico's two most powerful criminal organisations, the Sinaloa Cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel, control vast territories and have been locked in violent competition that killed more than 30,000 people last year.\n\nTrump designated six Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organisations in February 2025, a move Mexico condemned as threatening its sovereignty and potentially justifying military intervention.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has proposed constitutional reforms to strengthen protections against unauthorised foreign operations and has consistently rejected any US military presence on Mexican soil.\n\nSheinbaum said Monday that the Americas \"do not belong\" to any single nation, responding to Trump's assertion of Washington's \"dominance\" over the hemisphere after Maduro's capture.\n\nTrump said Sunday he has pressed Sheinbaum to allow deployment of US troops against Mexican cartels, an offer he said she previously rejected.\n\nOverdoses from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have caused more than 100,000 deaths in the US per year since 2021. Mexican cartels produce most of the fentanyl entering the US using chemical precursors sourced primarily from China.\n\nTrump designated the drug as a weapon of mass destruction in December 2025.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Trump would seek Congressional authorisation for strikes in Mexico. The US constitution grants Congress authority to declare war, although presidents have historically launched military operations without formal declarations.",

    "title": "Why Is Greenland Part of the Kingdom of Denmark? A Short History",
    "description": "From the Vikings to Trump: Greenland’s historic development negates recent White House territorial demands.",
    "fullText": "The first Nordic presence in Greenland dates back to Erik the Red, a Norse Viking banished from Iceland for manslaughter, who sought a new future in Greenland around the end of the 10th century. The name “Greenland” referred to the vegetation around Southern Greenland’s fjords, but the name was likely also given in an attempt to lure more Norse settlers to Erik’s settlement in Southeast Greenland. The Norse settlements in Greenland became part of a North Atlantic empire ruled from Norway.\n\nThe Norse stayed in Greenland for centuries. At the start of the 15th century, they disappeared with little trace. There are numerous possible reasons, including: a colder climate that made the island less habitable and conflict with the Inuit, who began to arrive in the areas that were populated by the Norse.\n\nIn 1721, Hans Egede, a Norwegian priest and missionary with support from the united Dano-Norwegian crown, reestablished contact with Greenland. A concern at the time was that the Norse settlers had missed the Reformation and were still Catholics. When Hans Egede arrived, however, he found only the Inuit, by then firmly established in most of Greenland, and he decided to focus his efforts on converting them to Christianity.\n\nThat marked the beginning of the colonial period. It was a slow start, and Norwegian-Danish influence in Greenland had to compete with other foreign powers, notably the Dutch. In a process that spanned generations, the Inuit were converted to Christianity, and Greenland was both politically and economically tied to Denmark-Norway in a colonial relationship.\n\nWhen the monarchy of Denmark and Norway broke apart in 1814, Denmark kept Greenland. Danish-Greenlandic colonial relations in the 19th and early 20th centuries were characterized by a Danish paternalistic policy for cautious development, ensuring that Greenland would be a profitable colony. In 1916, Denmark’s rights to Greenland were confirmed by the United States, as part of a deal that facilitated the American purchase of the Danish West Indies. A controversy concerning a Norwegian claim to parts of Greenland ended in 1933, when the Permanent Court of International Justice, founded by the League of Nations, ruled against Norway.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the United Nations pushed for decolonization in Greenland. In 1953, the former colony was incorporated into Denmark and granted two seats in the Danish Parliament. In 1979, Greenland achieved Home Rule, which included the formation of the Greenlandic Parliament, and it gained self-rule in 2009 through the passage of a law that included a ‘blueprint’ for seeking independence. The 2009 law firmly established that the decision to go for independence from Denmark would now rest with the Greenlandic people.\n\nThere is no doubt that the majority of Greenlanders want to use this option eventually. Polls show this. Independence has been accepted in Denmark as well. However, polls also consistently show that Greenlanders do not want independence if the price is the collapse of the Greenlandic welfare state. Herein lies the challenge. Greenland is vast, stretching over more than 800,000 square miles, but its population is tiny, consisting of only 56,000 people. Furthermore, the climate remains harsh for most of the year, especially in the North. For these reasons, among others, the Greenlandic government remains dependent on a yearly block grant from Denmark of roughly $600 million, as well as on the Danish state supporting services in areas such as defense, coast guard, and law enforcement. Greenlandic independence, therefore, depends on substantial continued Danish assistance after independence, something the Greenlandic government has yet to convince Denmark to accept.\n\nIt is in this context that President Donald Trump saw an opening to acquire Greenland. American strategic interests in Greenland are not new, but stretch back into the 19th century. Extensive U.S. involvement in Greenland, however, did not materialize until the Second World War, triggered by the German invasion of Denmark on April 9, 1940. As such, the German occupation of Denmark put Greenland in a peculiar position and caused worry in the United States that Greenland’s geography could eventually be used against it. For that reason, Washington reacted favorably when the Danish ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, took the rather unusual step of proposing himself as the true representative of free Denmark, cutting bonds with the occupied country. Kauffmann offered the United States base rights in Greenland for the duration of the war.\n\nThis was the start of the U.S. presence in Greenland. After the Second World War, a liberated Denmark honored Kauffmann’s commitments, and from 1949, the United States and Denmark became allies through NATO. During the Cold War and the decades after, the U.S. safeguarded its security interests in Greenland: tracking Russian missiles, bomber planes, and nuclear-armed submarines from that location. This became the basis for the “Greenland card” in U.S.-Danish relations: the idea that base rights in Greenland constituted an important contribution from Denmark and Greenland to the U.S. and NATO.\n\nThis state of affairs changed with Donald Trump. In the broader context of U.S.-European relations in the age of “America First,” the U.S. had to push its ‘free-riding’ European allies to do more on every front. No longer would Washington be satisfied with having a free hand in Greenland. Instead, Denmark was now a bad ally for not taking responsibility for U.S. security concerning Greenland. In Trump’s narrative, this perceived Danish lapse justified an American takeover of Greenland in its entirety. Trump even went so far as to refuse to rule out the use of military force. Other reasons, voiced by Trump, included securing mineral wealth, especially rare earth minerals, as well as a more general ambition to make the U.S. greater through territorial expansion.\n\nThe Greenlandic right to self-determination should form the bedrock for any future developments. For that reason, as well as for many other reasons, the U.S. military conquest of Greenland is beyond unacceptable. The American public agrees: in a February 2025 poll, only 11% expressed support for using military force to take control of Greenland, while 69% opposed it. This may be why the Trump administration has not mentioned the military ‘option’ recently. Instead, the Trump administration now seems focused on winning over the ‘hearts and minds’ of the Greenlanders. At the same time, stories about US influence agents compiling lists of pro-American and anti-American individuals caused understandable worry in Nuuk and Copenhagen – a behavior that few countries would expect from their allies.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has not been particularly successful. A poll from January shows that only 6% of Greenlanders are in favor of joining the U.S., with 85% against it. Greenlandic politicians have rejected the idea on numerous occasions, and in March, the party leaders of all Greenlandic parties issued a joint rejection of American attempts to annex Greenland. Most telling, the Trump team had to give up on finding Greenlandic hosts willing to meet the Second Lady Usha Vance during her planned trip to Nuuk that month.\n\nWhere do we go from here? The United States should cease its ill-fated adventurism and work with Greenland and Denmark to secure its legitimate security interests. This would be nothing new, but a return to policies that served the United States well for the last 75 years.",

    "fullText": "Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs has recalled nearly 13,000 passports after a software update caused a printing defect.\n\nThe printing error makes the documents non-compliant with international travel standards and potentially unreadable at automated border gates.\n\nThe government said the affected passports, issued between December 23 and January 6, may fail at eGates and border control systems worldwide, prompting a global alert through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and a mass re-issuance program.\n\n\"The Passport Office has confirmed that 12,904 Irish passports issued between 23 December 2025 and 6 January 2026 [inclusive] may not fully meet international travel standards,\" announced the government.\n\n\"The issue was caused by a software update, which could affect use at border control or eGates.\"\n\nHolders are being asked to return their passport books (and cards, where applicable) for free replacement, with new documents to be issued within approximately 10 working days.\n\n\"This will ensure that you do not face any issues with future travel. You do not need to reapply for a new passport,\" the official notice states.\n\nWhile the Department of Foreign Affairs has not explicitly specified where the missing \"IRL\" appears, the reference to ICAO compliance and potential failures at eGates strongly suggests the error affects the machine-readable zone (MRZ), where the three-letter issuing-state code is mandatory under ICAO Doc 9303.\n\nThe MRZ is the two-line block of text at the bottom of the passport's bio page that is scanned by airline systems, border control kiosks, and eGates. It encodes critical data such as the document type, issuing country, passport number, nationality, date of birth, and checksums used to verify the document's integrity.\n\nIf the issuing-state code \"IRL\" is missing or malformed in this zone, automated systems may reject the passport outright, even if the visual biographical page and embedded chip appear normal.\n\nThose travelling imminently or overseas residents can get in touch wih the Passport Office customer service via email at passportreturn@dfa.ie or call +353 (0) 1 613 1780.\n\nAs MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.\n\nThis free cheat sheet outlines 7 best practices you can start using today.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — For House Republicans, the political year started with a pep rally of sorts as President Donald Trump gathered them at Washington's Kennedy Center for a stemwinder of a speech. But by the time lawmakers had completed their first week of work this midterm election year, fractures in the party were already showing.\n\nFrom pushback to Trump's self-described “Donroe doctrine” of aggression in the Western Hemisphere to breaks in party unity over health care, Republican lawmakers are displaying signs of independence from Trump after spending much of the last year acquiescing to his practically every demand. It showed a new dynamic in the GOP as Republicans embark on difficult campaign to keep control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, speaking at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday with a group of Republican Senate candidates, said that Republicans were “going to be focused like a laser” on issues of affordability and pointed to legislation in the works on housing and health care.\n\nThune's border trip and talk of affordability were a nod back to some of the core themes of Trump's presidential campaign. But the focus in Washington of late has instead been dominated by Trump's military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, his threats to use military force to take control of Greenland, the release of case files on Jeffrey Epstein and a debate over extending subsidies for insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act — an issue where Republicans have long struggled to find unity.\n\nRecent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in several U.S. cities, including one that killed a woman in Minneapolis, have also raised new questions about Republicans' hard-line immigration agenda and shifted attention away from Trump's handling of the border, which they see as a political success.\n\nEven so, Trump still has plenty of command over most of the party. That was demonstrated this week by a pair of unsuccessful House veto override votes in which most GOP members stuck with the president despite previously voting for the low-profile bills.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently defy Trump, said that “there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on” from the president that caused the veto overrides to fail.\n\nStill, Democrats are making the case that Trump is becoming distracted from the needs of Americans, especially after the attack on Venezuela.\n\n“He's lurching towards another endless, expensive war, all the while American families here are struggling with skyrocketing costs,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nVenezuela war powers vote draws GOP support\n\nTo prove their point, Democrats are forcing votes on war powers resolutions that would stop Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional approval. Such measures are rarely successful, but a procedural vote on the legislation drew support from five Republicans Thursday, setting up a final vote next week. House Democrats are also pushing forward a similar resolution.\n\nThe GOP senators who voted for the legislation tried to defuse the conflict with Trump by arguing their positions were in line with his own campaign promises to scale back U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump’s goal of ending foreign entanglements,” Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who voted for the war powers resolution, said in a lengthy statement explaining his vote.\n\nTrump reacted with fury. The president promptly called for the five Republicans, which included Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection this year, to “never be elected to office again.”\n\nRepublicans are already dealing with retirements from several lawmakers who had uneasy relationships with Trump, and there was worry that such clashes could complicate their campaign picture even more.\n\n“If Susan isn’t the senator from Maine, we’re going to end up with a Democrat,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican. “That would be 10 times worse. But I do appreciate that President Trump is absolutely pissed off.”\n\nGOP pushes back on Trump's Greenland plans\n\nTrump's desire to possess Greenland and his administration's decision not to rule out military force also met significant resistance from GOP lawmakers this week.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is retiring after crossing Trump last summer, took to the Senate floor to proclaim that he was “sick of stupid.” He specifically criticized White House deputy chief of policy Stephen Miller, who made comments that Greenland should be part of the U.S.\n\n“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy,” Tillis added. “And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOther Republicans, including Thune and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Roger Wicker, also gently pushed back on military threats against Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nAfter meeting with the Danish ambassador, Wicker said it was Denmark's right not to sell Greenland.\n\n“I’m troubled by Greenland. I'm troubled by some of the things he does. I don’t get it,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, another retiring Republican. “I do feel like Congress should be more independent and should provide checks and balances here.”\n\nBacon added that Trump still had the ability to “bully” his Republican colleagues, but that Trump's threats had “stiffened my spine.”\n\nHealth care votes expose divisions\n\nDuring Trump's speech at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday, he urged Republicans to own the issue of health care. Yet when the House voted Thursday on a Democratic proposal to extend expired health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, 17 Republicans broke with party leadership to help pass the bill.\n\n“People recognize the challenge here, which is to address health care affordability,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who voted for the proposal.\n\nHe still criticized the Affordable Care Act, a hallmark piece of legislation for Democrats, yet the health care debate unfolding in Congress is one that Democrats feel confident making a central campaign issue.\n\n“In this first, full week of the new year, House Democrats — every single one of us joined by 17 Republicans — have partnered in a bipartisan way to protect the health care of the American people,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries following the vote.\n\nJan. 6 plaque coming out of storage\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, Trump told House Republicans that he had told his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. The White House also unveiled a website that portrayed the Jan. 6 attack as a “witch hunt” against him by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut the Senate, which Republicans control, this week agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol — a cause that has become a point of contention with Trump as president. The plaque had been kept in storage rather than being displayed because House Speaker Mike Johnson had said the memorial did not comply with the law.\n\nIt was Tillis again who pushed the issue on the Republican side. He said it was important to honor the police and staff who risked their own lives and safety that day.\n\nDemocrats who joined in the effort said they were alarmed by the White House's attempt to recast the narrative.\n\n“It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nThis story has corrected the party affiliation of Rep. Mike Lawler. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",

    "fullText": "(Corrects paragraph 4 to say Democratic Progressive Party, not Democratic People's Party)\n\nHONG KONG/TAIPEI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Some Chinese online users are calling for a lightning Venezuela-style snatch of Taiwan's leaders in a prelude to taking over the island, but analysts, scholars and security officials say China's modernising military is still ​far from ready.\n\nIn Taiwan, they say, China's military has an adversary which has prepared for years against a \"decapitation operation\" on its leaders, besides extensive air defences and radar capabilities, ‌as well as likely support from the United States and its allies.\n\nAlthough China has spent years acquiring advanced weapons, questions remain about the capabilities of its People's Liberation Army in using them effectively, as well as a command structure that must knit ‌them together in combat.\n\n\"Once such an operation runs into trouble, it would quickly escalate into a full-scale conflict, with extremely high political and military risk,\" said Chen Kuan-ting, a lawmaker of Taiwan's ruling Democratic People's Party.\n\nTaiwan's layered air defence and early warning systems meant any air assault or special operations infiltration effort would risk detection as it crossed the Taiwan Strait, foreshadowing escalation, he added.\n\nThe United States showcased its forces' battle-tested air dominance with last weekend's operation to extract Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.\n\nIts military controlled the skies with stealth fighters, jets that jammed enemy defences and covert reconnaissance drones and satellites feeding ⁠commanders real-time intelligence.\n\nChina's defence ministry offered no immediate response to faxed questions from Reuters.\n\nCHINA HAS NOT RULED OUT FORCE TO TAKE TAIWAN\n\nChina, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has not ruled out using force to bring the island under ‍its control. Taiwan rejects China's claims.\n\n\"Operationally, while the PLA is in recent times trying to get up to speed with force integration, it is still baby steps compared to what the Americans have for decades been accumulating,\" said Singapore-based security scholar Collin Koh.\n\nTaiwan is determined to defend its sovereignty and boost its defence, President Lai Ching-te said last month, after Beijing fired rockets towards Taiwan as part of its latest military drills.\n\nThe drills surrounding Taiwan - ​the most extensive to date - were accompanied by strong messaging from Chinese officials and the military.\n\n\"Any external forces that attempt to intervene in the Taiwan issue or interfere in China's internal ‌affairs will surely smash their heads bloody against the iron walls of the Chinese People's Liberation Army,\" China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement.\n\nIn October, Lai unveiled a multi-layered air defence system called \"T-Dome\".\n\nIt is intended to be similar to Israel's \"Iron Dome\", with a more efficient and \"sensor-to-shooter\" mechanism for a higher kill rate that integrates weaponry from Taiwan-developed Sky Bow missiles to U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems.\n\nIn July, Taiwan's military staged a drill to protect the Taipei's main airport from a hostile landing, deploying portable stinger rockets and tanks.\n\nMADURO EXTRACTION INSPIRES SOME\n\nWhile military attaches say China has war-gamed extraction operations in Taipei in a broad range of military options to take control of Taiwan, some Chinese online users tom-tommed the U.S. action in Venezuela as inspiration.\n\n\"The Venezuelan situation has provided us a solution for unifying ⁠Taiwan,\" said one user on the X-like microblogging site Weibo.\n\n\"First use special operations to arrest Lai Ching-te, then immediately ​announce the takeover of Taiwan, issue new identity cards ... and achieve a swift and decisive victory.\"\n\nChen, who sits on ​the foreign affairs and defence committee of Taiwan's parliament, dismissed such remarks as \"fantasy\" and other analysts said any such attempt would quickly face hard military realities.\n\nChina had added aircraft to replicate platforms such as Boeing's EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jet and Northrop Grumman's E-2D Advanced Hawkeye command and early warning aircraft, but their precise ‍capabilities had yet to be delineated, Koh said.\n\nWith the ⁠ruling Communist Party still playing a role in the PLA's command structure, doubts remain about its effectiveness, added Koh, who is with the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\"A decentralised command-and-control hierarchy is essential; that allows field commanders to exercise necessary initiative to cope with the fluid, evolving and uncertain nature of military operations as events unfold,\" Koh said.\n\nDespite any ⁠perceived PLA shortcomings, Taiwan's leaders are taking no chances, however.\n\n\"We have have no capital to take them lightly,\" said a senior Taiwan security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the military issues are sensitive.\n\n\"After all, in the wake ‌of this painful and shocking experience, China will also look for all kinds of ways to overcome these problems.\"",

It's a tall task, considering there are thousands of stocks to choose from. That's why I like to narrow down the search by looking at sectors that were under pressure in 2025.\n\nInvestors often are wary of an entire sector of the stock market. When this happens, virtually every stock in the sector gets punished. This can result in a good company getting thrown out with the bathwater. And that's why I'm looking at financial technology (fintech) today.\n\nFintech underperformed by a wide margin in 2025. To illustrate, consider the Global X FinTech ETF -- an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a focus on fintech stocks -- compared with the S&P 500. As the chart below shows, this ETF posted a loss for the year, in contrast to the market's red-hot gains.\n\nThe fintech sector had a challenging year, making it likely that there's a good opportunity in this beaten-down industry. And I believe that Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) is one such stock.\n\nShift4 offers payment-processing hardware and software to hospitality venues, stadiums, restaurants, and more. This isn't exactly unique -- many players in the industry do this. But Shift4 has grown substantially by focusing on high-volume customers, such as the aforementioned stadiums.\n\nFew fintechs have grown as fast as Shift4 in recent years. During just the past five years, revenue has increased by nearly 400%. Granted, its high-volume customer base tends to have lower margins, but this focus helped the business scale up. Moreover, management relentlessly focuses on profitability -- specifically, free cash flow -- despite the margin headwind.\n\nChief Executive Officer Taylor Lauber said in his third-quarter letter to shareholders that Shift4 always prioritizes \"where the next dollar is spent, and with urgency, as the free cash flow of the business improves each quarter.\"\n\nAs the chart above shows, Shift4 has made consistent progress with its free cash flow, now generating more than $350 million annually. But its stock price has stagnated, meaning it now trades at a cheap price-to-free-cash-flow valuation of 16.",

Inspired by Ridley Scott’s Alien, it is tense, complex and often scary – things we rarely expect from a Nintendo title.\n\nWhy we love it: “Sometimes, you play a game from a decades ago and think, this might actually hit better now. Metroid Prime Remastered is one of those games.” Read more here.\n\nA complete reinvention of the classic Pokémon adventure, with a more challenging capture system and a truly explorable open-world environment.

It is delightful to be back.” Read the full review.\n\nA beautiful homage to the Harvest Moon series, in which you farm, explore and socialise to your heart’s content.

A staple competitive game that has been at the centre of countless housemate rivalries.\n\nWhy we love it: “A palpable love of video games infuses everything, and references to their colourful history are omnipresent, from iconic and world-famous series to esoteric games that you thought nobody else even remembered.” Read the full review.\n\nThe legendary falling-block puzzler somehow returns as a battle royale multiplayer face-off – and once you get over how weird that is, you find you can’t stop playing.\n\nWhy we love it: “I’m pathetically unable to stop playing it – twice, while writing these words, I had to stop and play another round. Like all battle royale games, your every sweet taste of almost-success makes you hungry for more.” Read more here.",

    "description": "\"Today the USA is a disaster\"",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNeil Young has called out US President Donald Trump for making America a \"disaster\", and called on US citizens to \"rise up\" in peaceful protests against his regime.\n\nYoung delivered his acerbic condemnation of Trump in an strongly-worded editorial piece on the Times Contrarian section of his website. \n\n\"Wake up, people!\" he writes. \"Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America bit by bit with his staff of wannabes, people with no experience or talent, closet alcoholic wife beaters, inexperienced leaders who only know how to lie to keep favor with Trump’s falseness so they can hold their unearned positions in his inept government, a Congress full of Republicans acting like idiots with no conscience…He has divided us. How did we elect these creeps who have no spin, no values, no conscience, no way to save the USA.\n\n\"We need to take Trump at his word,\" he continues. \"Make America Great Again. It won't be easy while he is trying to turn our cities into battlegrounds so he can cancel our elections with marshal law and escape all accountability…Something has to change this. We know what to do. Rise up. Peacefully in millions. Too many innocence [sic] people are dying.\n\n\"It’s ICE cold here in America. There was no ICE before Trump. No soldiers in the streets before Trump. Every move he makes is to build instability so he can stay in power.\n\n\"He knows nothing about love,\" Young concludes. \"He does not know you are. Use your love of life, your love of one another, your love of children and theirs and ours. Peacefully. Now.\"\n\nWake up, people! Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America\n\nYoung's editiorial follows on from another piece where he expressed his outrage at the killing of Renee Nicole Good by a US immigration agent in Minneapolis on January 7. \n\n\"This morning an ICE officer shot a woman in the face three times for no reason in Minneapolis,\" he wrote. \"These ICE people do not operate like police. They are thugs. poor ID. Covered faces. Is ICE the new American Thug police?\"\n\nYoung also hit out at the administration's controversial comments on taking over Greenland, and at the removal of women and people of colour from military leadership.\n\nThis is not the first time Young has condemned Donald Trump's presidency. Last August, the singer-songwriter released a track called Big Crime in which he offered a searing indictment of Trump's second term in the White House.\n\nThe lyrics for one section of the song run:\n\n\"Got to get the fascists out\nGot to clean the White House out\nDon’t want soldiers on our streets\nThere’s big crime in DC at the White House\"",

    "title": "This doctor and TV personality is stronger than ever at 56 — and has the bikini pics to prove it",
    "description": "Dr. Jen Ashton is on a mission to change the way aging feels for women over 50. As an OB-GYN, obesity medicine physician and nutritionist, she knows a thing or two about how to do that.",
    "fullText": "What do posting bikini pics at age 56 and being a doctor have in common? They can both be “an inspiration,” says Dr. Jen Ashton, a former GMA3 chief medical correspondent, OB-GYN, obesity medicine specialist and nutritionist. When Ashton started posting her progress photos on Instagram, that’s what many women told her she was. “That word is just gold, because that’s why I became a doctor,” she explains.\n\nHer photos don’t hide what it’s like to get older as a woman, but they also show the power of what spending six months focusing on getting stronger and healthier can do. Getting in arguably the best shape of her life didn’t mean Ashton lost weight — she actually gained six pounds. But Ashton now likes what she sees in the mirror and feels she’s stronger than ever. “And that’s just contrary to our mindset generally,” she says.\n\nWhen Ashton left her job as chief medical correspondent and co-host of GMA3 in June 2024, she set off on what she calls an “experiment” to age better and become healthier and stronger. She then created a roadmap for other women to conduct their own fitness and nutrition anti-challenges. “Challenges can be failed,” she says. “You can’t fail an experiment because the goal is learning; you will always learn something.” She’s educating women about their health, as she’s always done, through her newsletter and wellness brand Ajenda (which you can now read on Yahoo) and offering her Wellness Experiment program to help put her advice into practice.\n\nIt might look like a major career pivot for Ashton, but this is a natural next step for her. She’s spent her entire professional life helping people, especially women, live healthier lives. And now she’s doing it live and direct, sharing expertise from her work in medicine and science communication, along with her own experience of getting fitter in her 50s.\n\n“My career in television was nothing short of miraculous,” says Ashton. “I never planned or tried to have a career like that — it literally just happened and evolved, but I am very proud to say that I reached the top of what I could achieve in my role.”\n\nAshton wanted to become a doctor to empower people to improve their health, which she did as an OB-GYN for six years. The opportunity to work in television came unexpectedly, after friends in the industry suggested she’d be great on camera, Ashton told Columbia College Today. What started as a weekend guest appearance on Fox evolved into a three-year post as the network’s first on-air female medical contributor. She then moved to CBS News and eventually landed at ABC, where she was chief medical correspondent and co-hosted Pandemic: What You Need to Know. “In those early days, I really put a stake in the sand and said to our producer and the network, ‘We have to have the honesty to say what we know,’” says Ashton. “Science is not black and white; it's so much more nuanced than that, and I love providing that nuance for people.”\n\nAshton used her skill to explain everything from the pandemic to foodborne illness and wildfire smoke to millions of American viewers as a network TV correspondent. She found she had a talent for communication and learned a lot by covering so many disparate health issues. But after 18 years doing the broadest possible coverage, Ashton craved focus. “All I want to talk about is what I’m credentialed in,” she says. “When I stepped down from that role, it was almost entirely because I felt that I had more work to do.”\n\nShe decided to devote her full attention to Ajenda, publishing articles that cut through the noise around issues related to women’s health, obesity and nutrition. “And it just so happens that those are literally the biggest topics in the country right now,” Ashton says.\n\nWhile scaling up Ajenda, Ashton was embarking on her own personal wellness journey. “Even though I was going to the gym five days a week, I wasn’t fit,” she explains. “I knew because I would be at a party and be dancing, and I would get out of breath. Or I would look in the mirror and see an image of someone that, as I call it, was ‘skinny fat.’”\n\nAshton called in an expert to help her figure out a fitness routine to see if, in combination with her own nutrition expertise, her tone and stamina could be restored. With the help of personal trainer Korey Rowe, her experiment has been working in spades. And, in response to her social media posts documenting the process, “tens of thousands of women literally asked me to share what I was doing with them,” says Ashton. So, she did, co-creating with Rowe a wellness “experiment” that includes a fitness regimen, meal plans, Q&As with Ashton herself, video content and a community forum. It’s helped its members get moving, and it’s helped Ashton do something she couldn’t do on network television: interact directly with the women in her audience.\n\nOut: One-size-fits-all health advice\n\nOne of the reasons Ashton is eager to reach people is that she’s tired of social media — and even mainstream media — painting health with too broad a brush. She’s frustrated by “influencers who are really capitalizing on people’s interest, need or desperation to improve their health and, in my opinion, are being dishonest from a scientific communication standpoint by implying that there’s only one way to do something,” Ashton says. That’s why she frames her approach as an experiment. She’s shared what has worked (really, really well) for her, but emphasizes that each person needs to test it themselves and make changes accordingly. “See how you feel. Make those observations. What have you learned? What do you want to jettison? That, to me, is the sweet spot,” says Ashton.\n\nAs Ashton notes, it’s common for women to hit a weight and fitness plateau in their 40s or 50s, due in large part to the hormonal changes of menopause. It’s easy to get stuck, especially without guidance about what to do differently — something Ashton experienced herself. “If you don’t have curiosity and an open mind” to try new things, “you’re not going to move the needle for your own health,” she says.\n\nOut: The all-or-nothing theory of wellness\n\nThe carnivore diet. Heavy lifting. Plant-based only. Cardio only. If you consume health and wellness content, you’ve probably heard one, if not all, of these single-item practices touted for solving everything from weight gain and menopause to back pain and more, with studies backing the benefits of each one. “It’s literally cherry-picking your data points to serve your message, and I am fundamentally against that” all-or-nothing mentality, she says. She’s particularly annoyed by advice that claims women only need to do heavy lifting and should never do certain kinds of cardio. “First women got the message that all they needed to do was zone two cardio, and now there are other, bigger voices saying, ‘No, you need to do HIIT cardio,’” Ashton explains. “And guess what? You need both of them. But the moderate gray zone doesn’t get clicks and follows, and I just think that that way of living has to go.”\n\nAshton doesn’t care for the term “longevity, because it’s not just about how long we’re on the planet,” she says. Instead, she hopes to see and promote a greater focus on vitality and an end to ageism. “I think we’ve already started to see that 60 is the new 40, 70 is the new 50, and I think that’s great,” she says. It’s not just about people looking younger than they are, but living like they are and extending their health span. To accomplish that, she says, there’s more work to be done in preventing diseases that affect women as they age, noting that heart disease doesn’t just affect men. She also suspects that using GLP-1 medications for maintenance and prevention — not just weight loss — might become an important piece of the women’s health equation.\n\nOut: Being glued to a smartphone\n\n“This isn’t anything earth-shattering, but I think the entire planet — and certainly our country — is seeing now that the screen life, the tech life, is not only suboptimal, but damaging in a lot of ways,” says Ashton. Amid teen anxiety, tech neck, and shrunken attention spans, she is over living life on a smartphone. The good news is that Ashton believes change is on the way. “I think we’re already at the beginning of that pendulum swing back to in-real-life experiences and analoging,” she says.",

She said that ARK Protection Group removed him from the family's security detail immediately upon learning of the matter.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaints, 261 parcels containing counterfeit OxyContin and other pills were delivered to the couple's western Ohio home between August 2024 and last month. Rankin has been removed from her employment as a schoolteacher in nearby Urbana, according to a statement posted by the district.\n\nSalsburey is being held in the Franklin County jail in Columbus, according to the facility's website. Rankin was held and later released.\n\n“Vivek’s family contracts with a private security firm for protective services and was alarmed to hear this disturbing news,\" Luck said in a text.\n\nShe said that Salsburey had cleared multiple background checks run by the security company, the FBI and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation prior to his employment. The most recent one was conducted by Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center in September, she said.\n\nSalsburey also passed a pre-employment drug test and never failed a random drug screening, Luck said. A message left with an attorney who represented Salsburey in the past was not immediately returned.\n\n“Vivek and his family take matters of safety seriously and support efforts to hold these individuals accountable for these allegations if they are proven,” Luck said.",

    "description": "\"We've now given decision-makers what they need to prepare.\"",
    "fullText": "The United Kingdom has not done enough to prepare for the impact of rising temperatures, and a study has shed light on the worst-case scenarios the government should plan for.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the findings show exactly how the U.K. could be vulnerable to these risks.\n\nIt's hard to predict the probability of the worst-case scenarios because you can't calculate uncertainty. University of Reading professor and study lead Nigel Armell compared the analysis his team did to what the Bank of England does for the financial system.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Earth's Future, found multiple worst-case scenarios. One of them is where temperatures rise 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) and the sea level rises 2 meters.\n\nRising temperatures are also weakening the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or the  AMOC. If this starts to collapse in 2030, the U.K. would actually see a 6-degree Celsius (10.8-degree Fahrenheit) temperature drop. It would disrupt agriculture and water supply, while also putting a strain on energy demand in winter.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the scientists said, \"A collapse of even one part of AMOC, the sub-polar gyre, would reduce U.K. temperatures by 2.5 degrees Celsius.\"\n\nIf the Amazon sees a mass die-off, releasing polluting gases into the atmosphere, this could send global temperatures 4 degrees Celsius higher by 2100.\n\nThe Guardian noted, \"This would result in extreme and prolonged heatwaves and droughts hitting the U.K. in summer.\"\n\nCutting industry pollutants too quickly can also have an effect, including a rise in temperature of 0.75 degrees Celsius (1.35 degrees Fahrenheit), because these pollutants block the sun.\n\nAnother worst-case scenario is extreme weather events. Temperatures could rise 6 degrees Celsius above the average, and rainfall could be triple the average.\n\nHow worried are you about rising ocean levels?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhile extreme weather events such as these were always going to happen, rising temperatures intensify them, as this worst-case scenario is showing.\n\nWhile sea levels are already higher, if Greenland and Antarctica's glaciers melt even more quickly by 2100, this would flood cities in the U.K. Rising sea levels are already on planners' minds, unlike the other scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, the global temperature rise of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34) has already seen many deaths during heatwaves.\n\nA 2021 House of Lords report indicated that the U.K. government was not giving sufficient attention to high-impact, low-likelihood worst-case scenarios.\n\nIn addition, the Climate Change Committee, an independent advisory group, said that the U.K. needs to adapt to a 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) rise, while assessing risks in case a 4 degrees Celsius rise happens. The 2023 adaptation plans were described as being weak.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, \"The research was commissioned by the Met Office as part of the government's climate resilience programme.\"\n\nIt's vital that this kind of research on climate issues continues to better understand how to prepare for these potentially dangerous scenarios.\n\n\"The U.K. has been planning without the tools to test against worst-case scenarios,\" said Armell. \"We've now given decision-makers what they need to prepare for climate outcomes they hope never happen, but can't afford to ignore.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "White House says it’s ‘reviewing protocols’ after Trump seemingly violated federal policy by disclosing jobs data early",
    "description": "The White House claims \"there was an inadvertent public disclosure\" but it says the media shouldn't be \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy.\"",
    "fullText": "The White House said Friday that it is “reviewing protocols” around economic data releases after President Donald Trump appeared to disclose sensitive jobs information ahead of its official publication, a move that economists described as “unprecedented” and potentially in violation of long-standing federal policy.\n\nIn a statement provided on background, a White House official said the episode stemmed from “an inadvertent public disclosure” following routine presidential briefings on economic data.\n\nThis occurred “following the regular procedure of presidents being prebriefed on economic data releases,” the official said. “The White House is accordingly reviewing protocols regarding economic data releases.”\n\nThe official bristled at the criticism of the disclosure, arguing that media coverage had overplayed its significance.\n\n“Instead of grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy, however, the media would be better off covering what today’s job report actually shows,” the official said, adding that President Trump’s policies are “laying the groundwork for an economic resurgence as GDP and real wage growth continue to accelerate.”\n\nThe comments come after Trump posted an image to Truth Social late Thursday evening that included figures from Friday morning’s nonfarm payrolls report, hours before the data was released publicly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nOffice of Management and Budget policy bars executive branch officials from commenting on or releasing market-moving economic statistics prior to their official publication, and also prohibits public statements until at least 30 minutes after release. While presidents are briefed on jobs data in advance, those briefings are treated as confidential.\n\nBharat Kumar, an economist at the financial firm Futures First, spotted that the figures in Trump’s post matched the final numbers released Friday morning. Economist and professor at University of Michigan Justin Wolfers said on X the disclosure “unprecedented,” saying no prior White House had ever released market-moving jobs data ahead of schedule.\n\n“No serious country does this,” Wolfers wrote.\n\nThe figures would have been difficult to interpret, anyway, because the large revisions to earlier months meant that the actually new numbers could not be cleanly isolated to show what happened in December alone, Nick Timaraos, the Wall Street Journal’s chief economics correspondent, noted.\n\nFriday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 50,000 in December, with nearly all of the gains coming from healthcare and social assistance. Stocks edged higher following the release, easing fears of a sharper employment slowdown.\n\nThe leak had drawn limited attention before Kumar’s post, likely because the disclosure occurred on Truth Social, a platform with a very small audience. According to Pew Research Center, just 3% of U.S. adults say they have ever used Truth Social, compared with 84% who use YouTube, 71% Facebook, 50% Instagram, and 21% X.\n\nSome media outlets, instead of decrying a scandal, had fun with that element of the mishap, with the Financial Times’ voicey Alphaville paraphrasing the old hypothetical about a tree falling in the forest: “If a jobs report leaks on a social media platform no one uses, does it move the market?” (This reporter was delayed in filing this story because Truth Social appeared to malfunction, preventing access to both the post and the President’s page.)\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Meta's Manus deal faces a probe from China's regulator. Analysts say it's about sending a message that China's AI talent isn't easy pickings.",
    "fullText": "China has a message for US tech firms: Hands off our AI talent and tech.\n\nThat's what Beijing is signalling by announcing a probe into Meta's acquisition of Manus, analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe probe, confirmed by China's Ministry of Commerce in a Thursday press conference, will investigate whether the acquisition complies with the country's laws and regulations concerning export controls, according to a statement translated by Google.\n\nManus was launched in China last March by the AI product studio Butterfly Effect and drew global attention after saying it had designed a \"general-purpose\" AI agent that can conduct tasks with limited human supervision. In mid-2025, the startup relocated to Singapore.\n\nIn December, Meta announced that it would acquire Manus and sever its ties with China completely. The deal reportedly exceeds $2 billion. Meta did not respond to a request for comment for this story from Business Insider.\n\nWhile China and the US have long engaged in tit-for-tat regulatory exchanges involving their tech companies, analysts told Business Insider this probe is notable because it appears to be aimed at discouraging so-called \"Singapore washing\" — the process of moving a company from China to Singapore to reduce regulatory scrutiny.\n\nTikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and fast-fashion giant Shein are among those that have shifted their headquarters from China to Singapore.\n\nThe probe is also a means to discourage Chinese AI startups from choosing the US, analysts said.\n\n\"I see Beijing's probe as an effort to prevent the loss of AI technology and talent to foreign acquisition, especially to the US,\" Wendy Chang, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta said it plans to bring over Manus' top leadership and will continue to run its AI agent platform separately, alongside integrating the technology into Meta's own products.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, has been the subject of US export controls for years, which limit the sale of its advanced chips to China. The Manus probe shows how the battleground has moved from beyond chips to \"models, agents, talent, and enterprise deployment,\" Murthy Grandhi, a company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, told Business Insider.\n\nHanna Dohmen, senior research analyst at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told Business Insider that while the probe \"isn't entirely surprising,\" the approach regulators are taking is \"more novel\" because it \"appears to focus on the movement of talent and IP.\"\n\nTalent has become a focal point of the AI race, with companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google offering huge pay packages to entice the best and brightest. Last year, Meta invested $14 billion in AI training startup Scale AI, bringing its CEO, Alexandr Wang, over to run the tech giant's AI efforts.\n\nChina's Manus probe could signal that it was policing \"outbound AI technology transfer with greater rigor,\" said Grandhi, adding that it could accelerate the \"bifurcation of AI ecosystems.\"\n\nThe US and China have been taking diverging approaches to AI, with Chinese companies tending to favor AI models that are more open, such as DeepSeek.\n\nIt's not clear how long China's probe will last, should it progress into a full investigation. Other investigations from China's Ministry have taken more than a year.\n\nGrandhi said that in his view, the most likely outcome is that the deal will be approved \"with constraints, rather than an outright block.\"\n\n\"Whatever the outcome may be, this certainly sends a signal to other US or foreign companies that are considering similar acquisitions,\" added Dohmen.",

    "fullText": "Receipts for a “secret menu” item and a separate order of French fries are among the evidence Glendale police shared from their investigation into an alleged counterfeit money scheme that targeted about a dozen In-N-Out Burger locations in Southern California.\n\nAuriona Lewis, 24, and Tatiyanna Foster, 26, both of Long Beach, face felony charges of counterfeiting and grand theft.\n\nThe investigation began Oct. 21, 2025, after an incident at a Glendale In-N-Out, police announced Friday, which detectives later connected to a broader pattern targeting In-N-Out locations throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties.\n\n“Investigators learned that the suspects had successfully victimized approximately a dozen restaurants by using counterfeit bills, resulting in financial losses and operational disruptions to the businesses,” police said.\n\nThe department released photos of counterfeit $100 bills and two receipts from Sept. 29, 2025. One was for a Flying Dutchman, a popular secret menu item consisting of two beef patties and two slices of cheese with no bun, totaling $5.93. It was paid for with a $100 bill, with the customer presumably pocketing the change.\n\nThe other receipt was for a $2.53 order of fries, also paid for with a $100 bill. Police also released In-N-Out security camera photos showing a suspect passing the bills to an employee.\n\nGlendale police financial crimes detectives, K-9 officers and U.S. Marshals arrested Lewis on Oct. 30 in Palmdale, where they said she had counterfeit bills matching those used in the Glendale case, along with numerous gift cards and receipts “believed to be connected to similar fraudulent activity.”\n\nFoster was arrested in December when she appeared at the Glendale Police Department.\n\n“This case underscores the importance of taking financial crimes seriously, regardless of dollar amount,” police said. “Counterfeit currency schemes directly impact local businesses and employees, and swift investigative action helped stop ongoing criminal activity and prevent further victimization.”\n\nThe department encouraged businesses to promptly report suspected counterfeit currency incidents.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge said Friday that she expects to temporarily block efforts by the Trump administration to end a program that offered temporary legal protections for more than 10,000 family members of citizens and green card holders.\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said at a hearing that she planned to issue a temporary restraining order but did not say when it would be issued. This case is part of a broader effort by the administration to end temporary legal protection for numerous groups and comes just over a week since another judge ruled that hundreds of people from South Sudan may live and work in the United States legally.\n\n“The government, having invited people to apply, is now laying traps between those people and getting the green card,” Justin Cox, an attorney who works with Justice Action Center and who argued the case for the plaintiffs, said. “That is incredibly inequitable.”\n\nThis case involved a program called Family Reunification Parole, or FRP, and impacts people from Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras. Most of them are set to lose their legal protections, which were put in place during the Biden administration, by Jan. 14. The Department of Homeland Security terminated protections late last year.\n\nThe case involves five plaintiffs but lawyers are seeking to have any ruling cover everyone that is part of the program.\n\n“Although in a temporary status, these parolees did not come temporarily; they came to get a jump-start on their new lives in the United States, typically bringing immediate family members with them,” plaintiffs wrote in their motion. “Since they arrived, FRP parolees have gotten employment authorization documents, jobs, and enrolled their kids in school.”\n\nThe government, in its brief and in court, argued Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has the authority to terminate any parole program and gave adequate notice by publishing the termination in the federal registry. It also argued that the program's termination was necessary on national security grounds because the people had not been property vetted. It also said resources to maintain this program would be better used in other immigration programs.\n\n“Parole can be terminated at any time,” Katie Rose Talley, a lawyer for the government told the court. \"That is what is being done. There is nothing unlawful about that.\"\n\nTalwani conceded that the government can end the program but she took issue with the way it was done.\n\nThe government argued that just announcing in the federal registry that it was ending the program was sufficient. But Talwani demanded the government show how it has alerted people through a written notice — a letter or email — that the program was ending.\n\n“I understand why plaintiffs feel like they came here and made all these plans and were going to be here for a very long time,” Talwani said. “I have a group of people who are trying to follow the law. I am saying to you that, we as Americans, the United States needs to.”\n\nLower courts have largely supported keeping temporary protections for many groups. But in May, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip temporary legal protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants for now, pushing the total number of people who could be newly exposed to deportation to nearly 1 million.\n\nThe justices lifted a lower-court order that kept humanitarian parole protections in place for more than 500,000 migrants from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The decision came after the court allowed the administration to revoke temporary legal status from about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in another case.\n\nThe court did not explain its reasoning in the brief order, as is typical on its emergency docket. Two justices publicly dissented.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Linda Kemp, 84, who mails letters at her son's law firm in Florida. Kemp said the work helps her stay current on her bills, and she is grateful to her son for the opportunity to hold a job. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMost of my life I've been a caregiver to my children. I've had seven children, and they're now all over the planet. I have one in Australia, three in California, one in Hawaii, one in Ohio, and one here in Florida. My first marriage, I had four children, and the second marriage — which was only a common law marriage — I had three.\n\nWith my second husband, we built a house. When we split up, I freaked out a little.\n\nMy husband paid all the bills and gave me money to do the grocery shopping. I wasn't the main breadwinner, and I wasn't bringing in any money aside from selling some art that I made, which doesn't add up to enough to raise my children. We didn't live in luxury, but we were able to live comfortably. When he left, he gave the house to me.\n\nI managed to buy a house with the money I got from the house we built, but it was too big. I invested and reinvested in property, and each time I did that, I made more money. It helped me keep going once the kids had grown up. Today, they call it flipping. I managed to live comfortably, and I don't care about gold or fancy clothes.\n\nI designed a small, one-story house just for me. When I got older, I had four solar panels installed.\n\nPeople always have arguments over money. It's the downfall of man. Forget the darn money and be happy.\n\nI went back to school and got a degree in graphic design, which was the closest thing to art where I can make a living. I have always been an artist. I became computer literate and then got a job as a graphic designer. I worked at that company for a few years, designing software. I was in my 50s when that job ended.\n\nI made my lifestyle very economical. I'm an environmentalist, so I like to leave a very small footprint on the planet. It got to the point that it was just too much to handle taking care of five acres of farm with fruit trees, so I decided to sell the house.\n\nIn my retirement years, I was a chair of the Sierra Club where I lived and got involved in a lot of community affairs and historic preservation projects. I had friends who would go kayaking every week, and it was a very lovely and economical way to live.\n\nI moved to a home near Jacksonville just a few weeks ago. It's a little over 100 miles from where I was. It's not by the ocean, and it's in an area that blew up with developments everywhere. It's in a development where my son had lived in a golf club. He bought a bigger house in the same golf club about a mile up the road from where I am. It's a bit of a transition, and I'm not yet comfortable with everything here yet.\n\nMy son is an attorney, and so is his wife. They have three kids, and maybe five years ago, he asked me if I wanted to work for him by doing the mail. I was retired at the time. I figured it was a job I could do at home on a computer.\n\nWhen my son's dad left, he was 15 years old, and it was just us two left at home. At that point, it was us against the world. My job as a graphic designer helped him through college. since we introduced the job above He stood on his own after that and stayed in school to get a law degree.\n\nI was doing okay on my own after that and lived a conscious life of simplicity. At my age 84, it felt good that my son wanted to keep a close eye on how I was doing in my old age and for me to move closer to him. The decision was based on my 5-year-old granddaughter running up to hug me whenever I saw her. Who could want any more than that?\n\nI go online in the morning, and I have a line from the sheriff's office sending out a list of all the bookings from the night before. So they send out the names and addresses of all the people who have been booked. He does mainly DUI cases. I send them all a letter my son made asking them if they need an attorney. I address the envelopes, stamp them, and get them in the mail before the post office closes.\n\nI would probably do it for nothing if he asked me to because I enjoy it. It keeps me active, keeps my hands moving on the typewriter every day, and makes me get up and do something. I live by myself and have no male friends. I've had a few women friends, but lately they've all drifted away. I was pretty active in my past community because I'm an artist and involved with art gallery events, and I'm hoping I can become active in my new community.\n\nMondays are very busy because it's three days worth of bookings from the weekend. I probably work from around 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Mondays. On Tuesdays, I may work for six hours, Wednesday for three or four hours, and Thursday and Friday for two or three hours. I do basically 20 hours a week.\n\nI'm not paying any rent at this house, as it belongs to my son. I pay the utilities, and I'll need to pay for someone to cut the grass and shrubs because you can't have any weeds in the neighborhood. My whole income comes from what my son pays me and Social Security.\n\nMy son's my landlord, so he's not going to kick me out. He wants me here, and he doesn't ask for anything except that I work. He had only one request for me, which was to watch my grandchildren once a month so he and his wife could go out on a date. I said, \"Once a month? Why don't you go out once a week?\"\n\nI recently injured myself unexpectedly. I had a vein in my right wrist blow out, which has affected my hand. Still, I'm in pretty good health, although I take seven pills every day. Whatever the doctors tell me, I do it. You can't fight Mother Nature. I'm not wasting my life in the gym either.\n\nI look pretty good for my age. When I tell them how old I am, they think I was 60. My mother lived to be 93, and I'm going for 100.\n\nI haven't quite landed on what I'm going to focus on in the future. I just need to assess the situation around me. I think working 20 hours a week is very comfortable for me because that gives me half the time to be a creative person. I've done all kinds of painting, printmaking, and jewelry making. Whatever I do next, it probably will be some kind of entrepreneur job where I'm my own boss, if I still have the energy to do that.\n\nIt's just like starting all over again. It feels like I just graduated from college.",

    "fullText": "Meghan Lescinskas and her husband were nearing the end of their honeymoon in Saint Lucia when the US launched its raid on Venezuela.\n\nTheir JetBlue flight home to New York was among the nearly 1,000 flights to and from the Caribbean that were canceled last Saturday. The region's airspace was closed for around 24 hours due to the military activity.\n\n\"I understand that this was a rare circumstance, so I called JetBlue and was on hold for hours,\" Lescinskas told Business Insider.\n\nAfter reaching JetBlue via its app's live chat, Lescinskas was offered a flight on January 16, nearly two weeks after her original return date, according to screenshots of her conversation that were shared with Business Insider. Struggling to find affordable alternative routes home, she and her husband used a travel agent to find them a flight on Saturday, January 10.\n\n\"Our six-day honeymoon has now turned into a 14-day trip,\" she said. \"I am a teacher and have missed school due to this delay, and we also had to pay for extra nights at our hotel that we had not planned for.\"\n\nWhile airlines have added extra flights to help stranded passengers, some, like Lescinskas, say they are still having to wait another week to get home, spending thousands of dollars on accommodation and alternative flights.\n\nThe Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about how, or whether, people may be compensated or refunded.\n\nOn Saturday, January 3, Warren Doyle, a retired airline pilot, was in St Thomas in the Virgin Islands with his family, a party of six. After checking their flight status all morning, he said it wasn't until around 4:30 p.m. that he received a notification their American Airlines flight home had been canceled.\n\n\"We started hunting for accommodation Saturday afternoon, and there was nothing. There was nothing, nothing, nothing,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nEventually, they were able to find two rooms for a night at a three-star hotel. \"It's a very rough part of town,\" he said, with music from nearby venues playing until 3 a.m.\n\nDoyle said he booked a Spirit Airlines flight home to Charlotte, North Carolina, via Florida, arriving early on the morning of Saturday, January 10 — a full week after he was first supposed to fly home.\n\n\"I can't speak to other islands, but St. Thomas is a mess,\" he told Business Insider. \"American's apathy is unbelievable.\"\n\n\"It's costing us, for six people, almost $1,000 a day,\" he added.\n\nAmerican Airlines did not respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nSince Sunday, American has added more than 50 extra flights to and from the Caribbean, but listed just one out of St Thomas, which departed Sunday.\n\n\"Every time I hear an airplane go over here, I look outside and see what it is. I see a lot of private traffic — loads and loads of corporate jets in and out,\" Doyle said. Flightradar24 data showed 17 business jets departed St Thomas on Monday.\n\nLescinskas said that she was struggling to get a refund for her canceled flight as she was \"going back and forth\" between JetBlue and Sandals, the resort through which her trip was booked.\n\nA JetBlue spokesperson told Business Insider that, after scheduling additional flights, it offered Lescinskas a flight on Friday, but she chose to stay with her new booking on a different airline. \"After confirming their decision, JetBlue submitted the authorization for the travel agent to refund the fare of their JetBlue flight,\" they added.\n\n\"We remain focused on supporting those affected by Saturday's forced closure of Caribbean airspace,\" the spokesperson said. JetBlue has added more than 30 extra flights so far, they said.\n\nIn a statement, Sandals Resorts said its priority is to support guests and said it has offered reduced rates, waived penalties, and let guests extend their stays due to the airspace closure.\n\nDoyle and his family found another place to stay until their flight out on Friday. \"We're fortunately comfortable where we are,\" he said. \"We're just taking it a day at a time.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine being stuck in a position where you have limited funds, or you're running up your credit card account. It runs into thousands of dollars in no time at all.\"\n\nMany of the extra flights have been operating from Puerto Rico, but travelers on other islands have limited options to get there due to high demand and the fact that inter-island flights use small airplanes.\n\n\"How there can be a 10-day kickback of disruption just blows my mind,\" said the former airline pilot. \"It's not like we're in Outer Mongolia, we're in the Caribbean. We're a stone's throw from the mainland of the United States.\"",

    "description": "SkillCat CEO Ruchir Shah shares his struggle with work-life balance, burnout, and how a silent meditation retreat helped him reset.",
    "fullText": "Ruchir Shah, 34, is the New York-based CEO of the startup SkillCat, which offers online training for skilled trades such as electricians and HVAC specialists. As a founder, he would often advise those working for him to take PTO, but said he sometimes secretly resented it when they did. Attending a 10-day silent retreat changed his perspective. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nMy dad was an entrepreneur, but he would never take vacation. It was this mindset of always being on. So, in the back of my mind, there was always this guilt about vacation. That's persisted for most of my life, and I've been a founder a couple of times.\n\nI would tell people to take time off, but my tone was like, \"Take only a week,\" or \"take just enough.\"\n\nOne of our top-performing employees takes long vacations, but then they're unbelievably productive. I would always be like, \"Should you be taking that time off?\" I was feeling resentful and annoyed, even though, logically, I shouldn't feel that way. They're so good.\n\nI got married a few years ago, and my wife is much more balanced with these things. We went on a couple of vacations, where I was working. Last year, we took a vacation, and I didn't work, but I wasn't mentally there. I had anxiety about work, about getting things done.\n\nI see a lot of people my age focused on achieve, achieve, achieve — get into a great school, get a prestigious job. And then you're in your mid-30s, and you're like, \"What am I working toward?\" That type of anxiety makes you always look for endorphins and achievement, and that's what I was tortured by a lot on vacation last year.\n\nI think I probably reached a level of terminal burnout, where you're so overwhelmed and stuck in the weeds that you just can't actually disconnect.\n\nI was struggling to enjoy experiences that are supposed to be fun. When you're working, it's great, but when you're hanging out with your wife or friends, you're unable to disconnect. You keep thinking about work; you keep feeling anxious about things that you shouldn't feel anxious about.\n\nI've gone through therapy. I tried meditation, but sometimes you just need time off. I don't think there's a replacement for just stopping, because otherwise you're still in that race.\n\nTheoretically, I always thought, \"It's important to take vacation.\" I understand the concept, but burnout got really bad for me last year. I was also dealing with some family stuff, and, on their own, those things would have been fine, but coupled with work, they just built up. I was really miserable and down.\n\nWhen I tried to take a day off or meditate, it wasn't working. I would get pulled into distractions — like social media, watching TV, or unhealthy eating. So, I wanted something a bit extreme. I did a 10-day silent meditation retreat, which changed my mindset.\n\nYou have no screens. You can't talk to anyone, and you don't make eye contact. You can't read, write, or listen to music. You can walk around, but you're not supposed to exercise. It was brutal. You're forced into just being present with yourself, because there's literally nothing else you can do.\n\nIt was transformative in terms of making me think, \"I need to take time off. I can't just keep looking for the next win.\" You always look for more. You hit a revenue target, and you start comparing yourself to people. It's like, where does it end?\n\nI came out of that, and I wrote three pages of notes, and it was like, \"Take a vacation,\" and \"Appreciate your wife and other parts of your life.\"\n\nThis retreat really opened up my mind to, \"Hey, there are other things to do in life.\"\n\nAs far as my anxiety, it's been incredible. Before that, my wife and I had a trip scheduled to Japan. I was fighting with my wife, and was incredibly stressed about it. I was like, \"It's going to be horrible. I'm going to feel guilty, and I'm not going to be able to enjoy it, and I'm going to feel bad that I'm not present for you.\" Then, coming out of this, I was like, \"This is going to be awesome.\"\n\nThe trip was about three weeks. We were in Japan, India, and then Dubai. Now that I'm back, I'm just happier, lighter. I'm in a better relationship with my wife and not depressed — and a lot less anxious.\n\nProfessionally, in the few days after I returned from vacation, the number of insights I've had has been amazing.\n\nOur business had been stuck in a couple of ways. After that, the problems just unlocked — a key hire, how to work with certain people and groups, and our strategy. Things have come together in a way that would not have happened without such a fresh mind.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that frequent warnings about AI are dissuading people from making investments in AI's improvement.",
    "fullText": "Jensen Huang is over AI doomerism.\n\nThe Nvidia CEO said one of his biggest takeaways from 2025 was \"the battle of narratives\" over the future of AI development between those who see doom on the horizon and the optimists. Huang said while \"it's too simplistic\" to dismiss either side entirely, some of the dismal outlooks are having real consequences.\n\n\"I think we've done a lot of damage with very well-respected people who have painted a doomer narrative, end of the world narrative, science fiction narrative,\" Huang said during a recent episode of the \"No Priors\" podcast. \"And I appreciate that many of us grew up and enjoyed science fiction, but it's not helpful. It's not helpful to people. It's not helpful to the industry. It's not helpful to society. It's not helpful to the governments.\"\n\nHuang didn't name the people in question, nor did he give a specific motivation for why people may be sharing their more dour outlook. Instead, he cited concerns about \"regulatory capture,\" arguing that no company should approach governments to request more regulation.\n\n\"Their intentions are clearly deeply conflicted, and their intentions are clearly not completely in the best interest of society,\" he said. \"I mean, they're obviously CEOs, they're obviously companies, and obviously they're advocating for themselves.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to elaborate on Huang's remarks. Previously, the Nvidia CEO took issue with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's prediction that AI could replace up to half of all white-collar entry-level jobs within five years. (Amodei later said that Huang distorted his views.)\n\nOverall, Huang said the sheer amount of negativity is distorting the conversation around AI.\n\n\"When 90% of the messaging is all around the end of the world and the pessimism, and I think we're scaring people from making the investments in AI that makes it safer, more functional, more productive, and more useful to society,\" he said.\n\nHuang isn't the only CEO who is hoping for a different AI narrative in 2026. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in his year-end note that he wanted that society needs to move beyond labeling content AI \"slop.\"\n\n\"We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication,\" Nadella wrote on his blog late last year, \"and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our 'theory of the mind' that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.\"",

    "fullText": "Americans love to eat chicken, and there are plenty of fast-food options for those looking for their fix.\n\nPopeyes, Chick-fil-A, KFC, Raising Cane’s, Church’s … again, it’s not hard to find chicken. But one restaurant you just don’t hear mentioned in that discussion much anymore is Boston Market.\n\nThat might have something to do with the old, “Out of sight, out of mind,” saying because it is not easy to find a Boston Market these days. The restaurant, which began as Boston Chicken in 1985, and is headquartered in Newtown Township, Pennsylvania, had more than 1,200 restaurants at one point in the 1990s, according to The Street.\n\nBut the bottom fell out over the next couple of decades.\n\nBoston Market was down to 300 stores heading into 2023, and The Street said that it shrank to fewer than 30 locations by the start of 2024. The Boston Market Wikipedia page says it currently has 22 stores left, but The Street said the actual number could be less than 20.\n\nThe outlet cited a report from Nation’s Restaurant News in 2023 that claimed that Boston Market owner Jay Pandya faced “hundreds of lawsuits from vendors, franchisors, and employees regarding unpaid bills” when he filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 8, 2023.\n\nAt the time, per the report, he cited $10-$50 million in liabilities.\n\nBut, The Street reported, that filing by Pandya and another attempt were each rejected by the courts.\n\nSo, what happened to Boston Market and its delicious rotisserie chickens to call such a fall off?\n\nRestaurant analyst Aaron Allen told FCNews that the chain hurt itself “by holding its costs down — a move that ultimately led to a reduction in quality, which only undercut it further.”\n\nAlso, a big issue for Boston Market, per The Street’s report, was the fact that grocery stores began offering rotisserie chickens.\n\n“The chain eventually saw the likes of Costco serve up the same things far cheaper,” retail and restaurant expert Steve Feldman reportedly said.\n\nAnd, because of that, it might be hard for Boston Market to pull itself back off life support.",

    "title": "Trump's message to defense contractors: There might be a lot more money coming, but only if you deliver",
    "description": "The White House is calling for much more defense spending while pressuring contractors to prioritize production over profits.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump sent jolts through the defense industry this week by mixing talk of a $1.5 trillion defense budget with a blunt warning to contractors: Prioritize production and readiness, not Wall Street.\n\nThe apparent messaging behind a string of Truth Social posts, a new executive order, and the president's call for boosting the defense budget by 50% is that there's going to be a lot of cash on the table, but only for companies that produce and deliver weapons on time.\n\nA venture capital investor focused on aerospace and defense told Business Insider that Trump is effectively saying: \"I've got a really big pool of money here, but I'm only going to be giving it to people that are going to play ball.\"\n\nThe new executive order empowers the Pentagon to pressure contractors that it feels aren't moving fast enough and are perceived to instead be prioritizing profits for top executives and shareholder returns over production demands.\n\nThe Pentagon is now authorized to crack down on underperforming defense contractors by limiting stock buybacks and dividends, linking executive pay to production and delivery, and using contract and emergency authorities to force faster output and investment.\n\nThere are questions about the degree to which the Department of Defense can influence company decisions, but it sends a clear signal that the government intends to at least try to tell weapons makers how to run their businesses.\n\n\"MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH,\" Trump wrote on social media this week before singling out the major defense firm Raytheon (now RTX Corp) in a follow-up post.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up,\" Trump wrote, urging the company to build more facilities and equipment, \"or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government. RTX is one of the world's leading producers of missiles like the Tomahawk cruise missile; it also makes radars and sensors, among other technologies.\n\nIt's extremely unusual to see this level of federal government involvement in contractor financial decisions.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" Jerry McGinn, the director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told Business Insider.\n\nDefense stocks tumbled hard with the string of announcements but jumped as the Trump administration floated the possibility of a massive increase in defense spending, which would need Congress's approval.\n\nThis new push reflects growing concern that America’s defense sector has slipped, with capacity, capability, and experience today well below Cold War levels, leaving the US potentially ill-prepared for the possibility of a major war, such as a conflict with China.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be trying to force a reset while also offering more money and more predictable demand, acknowledging the government itself has not always been a reliable customer. The hollowing out of the defense industry since the Cold War's end has left the federal government highly dependent on a few companies with the necessary industrial facilities to design and produce complex weapons on a large scale.\n\nThe administration has signaled from the get-go that the big established arms makers are in its crosshairs, with a dramatic shift in support toward agile start-ups over the primes, even if it's still making substantial business deals with them.\n\n\"We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long,\" Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll said last year.\n\nThe Army's top civilian official previously said that he would like to see one of the big defense power players in the contracting world go out of business. And now there's increased pressure.\n\n\"The EO is more of a hammer,\" McGinn said of Trump's newest executive order targeting the US defense industrial base.\n\n\"It still raises a lot of questions about what's enforceable,\" he added, especially with some of the Truth Social mandates that weren't included in the executive order. But \"the strategy is all about focusing on how do you change, how do you make it more attractive for companies to invest, to build factories ahead of need.\"\n\nWith the president's new executive order on defense contracting, the companies that \"stand to lose the most\" are \"the existing primes,\" Justus Parmar, CEO of Fortuna Investments, an America-first venture capital firm, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Legacy defense companies,\" Parmar said, \"they're kind of like taxicabs. They need a bit of disruption.\" He sees the rising defense firms like the ride-share companies that changed the game.\n\nThe primes, the biggest defense contractors, are far from powerless. Their scale, capital, and decades of experience give them room to resist pressure, and in certain defense technologies, they remain the only game in town.\n\nLockheed Martin, for instance, is still producing F-35 stealth fighters, Huntington Ingalls Industries is still building aircraft carriers, and Boeing has a major contract for the new sixth-generation F-47 fighter jet.\n\nWhile some big companies didn't respond, others signaled a willingness to engage. Lockheed Martin, for instance, said it \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nThe newcomers, the start-ups and rising firms making big plays \"have the most to gain\" from what's unfolding right now, Parmar said, calling the latest Trump moves a \"tide shift.\"\n\nPalmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, said this week that he \"broadly\" supports the president's agenda, saying that \"it's good to scare people sometimes.\" Anduril has been pitting itself up against major defense contractors in areas of emerging tech, like collaborative combat aircraft, advanced drones designed to operate alongside piloted fighters.\n\nMcGinn said \"there's a strong recognition that we need to get more out of our defense industrial base and we need new entrants.\" New technology spaces like drones, counter-drone systems, and command and control architecture improvements are opening the doors for new players, particularly those that move fast.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth laid out the administration's approach last November, briefing industry CEOs and releasing a new acquisition strategy aimed at overhauling what it calls an outdated system and a weakened defense industrial base.\n\nHegseth has said his focus is on building the \"arsenal of freedom\" to better prepare the US military for modern warfare.\n\nThe plan is aimed at accelerating modernization, rapidly expanding production, surging capacity, and putting military acquisition and industry on a \"wartime footing\" that favors speed and execution over process.\n\nThis process takes time though, Parmar said. \"The existing primes, they're entrenched. They're not going anywhere quickly.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a slow bleed,\" he said,\" a slow transition until some of these other companies start to get market share.\"",

    "description": "Everything to know about tax season in 2026: What forms you need, when to file, federal and state deadlines, and how to avoid penalties.",
    "fullText": "Tax season is about to begin, and most Americans need to complete their 2025 filings by Wednesday, April 15. To avoid missing a deadline or paying a penalty, plan to check your local tax dates and income paperwork as soon as possible.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about taxes in the new year.\n\nYou can submit your 2025 federal tax return starting in late January 2026. Though the majority of Americans file their taxes annually, self-employed people, contract workers, and some gig workers may also be subject to quarterly estimated payment deadlines. Important dates include:\n\nTaxes for Partnerships and S Corporations (like small businesses or startups) are due on March 15, and taxes for C Corporations (larger companies like Apple or Walmart) are due on April 15.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service makes deadline exceptions for people impacted by federally-recognized disasters. You can check the details here.\n\nAll state deadlines are on or after the April 15 federal due date, but they do vary. States like Alabama, Florida, Tennessee, and North Carolina typically give residents a longer time to file their state-level taxes — though federal filings may still be due in April. Check your state government website for updates and deadline extensions.\n\nIf you're a salaried employee, you will need a W-2 form from your employer to file taxes. Contractors and gig workers will need a 1099 form from the company they contracted with, and self-employed workers may also receive a 1099 from their clients.\n\nThis paperwork is typically mailed to Americans in February or posted online through their payroll company. Banks are also required to send 1099s to people who received interest or dividends, and those who sold stock, bonds, or mutual funds in 2025. Some inherited assets, like real estate, may also need to be reported.\n\nTax returns will likely ask for your adjusted gross income (AGI) — meaning your total earnings minus certain deductions like student loan interest, alimony payments, retirement contributions, and health savings. AGI helps determine your eligibility for tax credits and can be found on your most recent tax return or through your IRS account.\n\nIf you made charitable contributions in 2025, that should also be reported in your filing.\n\nOnline filing is the most efficient and secure way to organize taxes.\n\nAmericans with an adjusted gross income at or below $84,000 may qualify for free tax preparation through an IRS partner. Those with a higher income can work with a tax advisor or pay for online tax software. Pricing varies depending on the complexity of individual financial situations.\n\nDirectFile, the free government-run tax preparation service, was discontinued by the Trump administration and will not be available in 2026.\n\nAfter fully filing your state and federal taxes, you'll see if you owe more money or if you overpaid and are owed a refund.\n\nFederal and state refunds are typically sent via direct deposit within a few weeks of filing. To check when your refund is coming, use the tracking tool on the IRS website. You will need to provide your Social Security number or taxpayer ID, filing status, and exact refund amount.\n\nRefund deposits could take longer than a month if your return is flagged for errors, manual processing, or potential fraud. Contact the IRS if you suspect an issue.\n\nYou may be charged a penalty if your tax filing is missing a required form. Having an incomplete return by the April 15 federal deadline, for example, will result in a 5% penalty per month on any unpaid tax. That penalty may increase after 60 days and refunds cannot be processed until all forms are submitted.\n\nTo prevent a penalty, be sure you have all necessary forms from your employer before the deadline. If your employer is unable to provide this paperwork in time, contact the IRS.\n\nYou can get an automatic extension by paying all or some of the tax you owe by the April deadline. Your new deadline will be October 15.\n\nIf the IRS or your state tax authority sends a notice that you underpaid on your 2025 taxes, try to pay as much as possible to minimize penalties and interest. You'll be charged an underpayment penalty if you paid less than 90% of the tax on your current-year return — something that can happen if your employers' paycheck withholdings don't cover your full tax liability. Self-employed people and independent contractors can be charged for underpayment if they miss or underpay one or more of their quarterly tax estimates.\n\nThis penalty only applies to those who owe $1,000 or \n\nAn underpayment bill can be stressful, but it is better to submit your tax returns by the deadline — even if you can't afford your full balance. The IRS' failure-to-file penalty is higher than the underpayment penalty.\n\nThe IRS doesn't report this to major credit bureaus, so a tax underpayment will not directly impact your credit score. Steep tax debt over time, however, could be sent to a collections agency.",

    "description": "The AI industry is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into super PACs ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence is poised to play a big role in politics this year — and not just when it comes to AI-generated content.\n\nSeveral super PACs backed by figures in the tech industry have formed ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nSome of the groups plan to support candidates who are friendly towards the AI industry and will take a lighter regulatory approach to the technology.\n\nAt least one group has been formed explicitly to combat the influence of those pro-AI groups.\n\nHere are the super PACs to keep an eye on as the year progresses.\n\nThe biggest player so far is Leading the Future, a pro-AI network of super PACs that says it has already raised $100 million.\n\nIn an August press release, the group listed a variety of supporters, including:\n\nIt's unclear how much money each entity has contributed to the group, as it has not been required to disclose donors yet.\n\nThe group says it plans to serve as the \"political and policy center of gravity for the AI industry\" and will \"support candidates aligned with the pro-AI agenda\" and \"oppose those that do not.\"\n\nThe group has already begun spending.\n\nThink Big, a PAC affiliated with the group, has spent over $118,000 against Assemblyman Alex Bores in the Democratic primary for New York's 12th congressional district.\n\nAnd American Mission, a separate affiliated PAC, has spent over $243,000 backing GOP candidate Chris Gober in Texas's 10th congressional district.\n\nIn response to Leading the Future, two former congressmen — Republican Chris Stewart of Utah and Democrat Brad Carson of Oklahoma — have formed their own competing political network to back candidates who support AI regulation, called Public First.\n\nThe group is aiming to raise $50 million for its effort, well short of what the pro-AI groups have raised. But Carson told Business Insider he feels good about Public First's odds, given that the American public is broadly supportive of AI regulation.\n\n\"We have $50 million and 85% of public sentiment. They have 15% of public settlement, and $100 million,\" Carson said. \"I will take our side of that bet any day.\"\n\nThe group has not yet disclosed donors, though Carson said that Public First would have financial support from employees at a variety of AI companies.\n\n\"There's going to be people from across the AI sector, as well as far beyond the AI sector, who contribute to the effort,\" Carson said.\n\nThe group has two affiliated super PACs: one that supports Democrats called Jobs and Democracy PAC, and another that supports Republicans called Defending Our Values PAC. Neither has spent in any election so far.\n\nMeta is also getting into the super PAC game, establishing two different PACs last year to support candidates aligned with their vision for AI regulation.\n\nUnlike the other PACs, Meta's efforts will focus primarily on the state level.\n\nOne PAC, called Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, will focus specifically on the Golden State, where Meta is headquartered.\n\n\"As home to many of the world's leading AI companies, California's innovation economy has an outsized impact on America's economic growth, job creation, and global competitiveness,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"But Sacramento's regulatory environment could stifle innovation, block AI progress, and put California's technology leadership at risk.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that the PAC would back candidates in both parties who \"recognize California's vital role in AI development and embrace policies that will keep the state at the forefront of the global tech ecosystem.\"\n\nA separate PAC, the American Technology Excellence Project, will focus on races in other states.\n\n\"Amid a growing patchwork of inconsistent regulations that threaten homegrown innovation and investments in AI, state lawmakers are uniquely positioned to ensure that America remains a global technology leader,\" Meta VP of Public Policy Brian Rice said in a statement.\n\nNeither PAC has spent significant sums yet.",

    "fullText": "\"The Diary of a CEO\" founder and host Steven Bartlett is one of the world's biggest podcasters — but to hear him tell it, he built his success by focusing on the tiny things, not the huge swings.\n\nBartlett has been a proponent of the 1% mindset, the idea that incremental steps can lead to continual improvement. On Maggie Sellers' \"Hot Smart Rich\" podcast, he spoke about how it had led to large changes at his media company.\n\nBartlett attributed his success to the concept of focusing on \"embarrassingly small steps,\" which he referred to as the \"secret philosophy everyone else ignores.\" He said he was inspired by a Harvard Business Review study that showed the motivational power of tiny wins on employees.\n\nBartlett said he applied that thinking to \"DOAC\" and thought if he kept changing the trajectory in tiny ways, like A/B testing titles and thumbnails, he could get a similar effect.\n\nHe said adding an exclamation mark to the end of a title resulted in a 0.2% increase in click-through rate, while changing the color of thumbnails from green to red increased the click-through rate by 1.4%.\n\nBartlett talked about another small change that impressed a big-name guest. He said an employee changed the air freshener in the \"DOAC\" studio before Spotify CEO Daniel Ek came to be interviewed on the show.\n\n\"Most people would think that was petty. But then Daniel walks in and goes, 'Man, it smells so good in here.' I go, '1%,'\" Bartlett said.\n\nThese improvements also help build psychological momentum, he said, and are immediately executable.\n\n\"All of my competitors are just looking for the next leap forward in innovation in podcasting,\" he added.\n\nBartlett argued that the rule applied to staying ahead in business overall.\n\n\"No matter how much I've said it to people, it still doesn't appear to be obvious to anybody else,\" he said.\n\nBartlett has been known to take big swings, too.\n\nHe has experimented with using AI to clone his voice to make new podcasts, expanded his media company into a network of other shows, and made investments through his company FlightStory.\n\nHe also recently raised an eight-figure investment round to build what he calls \"the Disney of the creator economy.\"",

    "description": "Tesla and legacy automakers are shifting to budget-friendly EVs amid sales declines, subsidy cuts, and mounting US consumer auto debt concerns.",
    "fullText": "On the surface, the electric-vehicle industry looks like it's heading into 2026 with a flat tire.\n\nFederal subsidies are gone, and EV sales have cooled since September. Even Tesla, America's dominant EV maker, is experiencing a sales slowdown.\n\nNow, carmakers are scrapping once-ambitious EV plans.\n\nIn December, Ford discontinued production of the all-electric F-150 and announced a $19.4 billion write-down tied to its battery investments. A week later, Volkswagen halted production of the electric ID. Buzz minivan for 2026, with plans to potentially revive it in 2027.\n\nThat trend snowballed on Thursday. General Motors said it expects to lose $6 billion as it retools its EV strategy. On the same day, Stellantis went even further, discontinuing every plug-in hybrid in its lineup — including the once-bestselling Jeep Wrangler 4xe.\n\nBut beneath the headline-grabbing cancellations, there's a quieter shift underway that could end up reviving the ailing EV market. It has everything to do with the auto industry's biggest problem: price.\n\n\"Electric vehicles are becoming more affordable as more mainstream options enter the market,\" Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told Business Insider. \"We're finally seeing automakers deliver EVs at price points beyond the luxury segment.\"\n\nThis year, legacy automakers — including several that recently pulled back EV projects — are preparing their factory floors to churn out lower-cost electric cars. Startups are jumping into the fray, too.\n\nNissan's Leaf just rebooted as a $29,000 Tesla Model Y look-alike. Subaru and Toyota are launching the Uncharted and C-HR — nearly identical crossover SUVs with $35,000 starting prices. Kia will have a $35,000 competitor with the EV3. Rivian is about to release its $45,000 R2 onto American roads. The Jeff Bezos-backed Slate anticipates its mid-$20,000 pickup will launch in the fall. Chevy's Bolt is returning with $29,000 on the sticker.\n\nThe push toward cheaper EVs is expected to roll into 2027, too, with Ford launching its $30,000 electric pickup.\n\nIt all comes as Americans struggle to keep up with every-expanding vehicle debt.\n\nThe average price of a new vehicle sold in the US hit $50,077 this week, Automotive News reported, citing Cloud Theory's average marketed price metric. That sticker shock has pushed the median buyer to put $6,579 down and take on monthly payments of $748 stretched across nearly six years, NerdWallet data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans carried a record $1.66 trillion in auto loan debt in 2024, the most recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That's more than credit cards and federal student loans, and second only to mortgages. Delinquencies also crept higher that year, a sign that many consumers ran out of room to absorb ever-larger car payments.\n\n\"The reality was that new vehicle sales were being driven by well-heeled consumers,\" Keating said — a dynamic that was especially pronounced in the EV market.\n\nSince 2020, when legacy automakers started launching their first EVs to compete with Tesla, they focused heavily on top-end cars with luxury prices.\n\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning, for example, started around $50,000. Higher-end trims climbed into the high-$90,000 range. Rivian's R1S SUV started at $77,000. Lucid's Air sedan cost between $70,000 and $250,000.\n\nIn September, the federal $7,500 tax credit that helped modestly bring down those high prices largely expired.\n\nNow, as those same carmakers roll out lower-priced models, the industry appears to be course correcting, Keating said. Much of the early EV premium reflected the cost of building an entirely new ecosystem, she added.\n\nEarly buyers weren't just paying for a car. They were helping automakers finance new battery plants, retool factories, retrain workers, and pour billions into supply chains that didn't yet exist.\n\nSix years later, much of that infrastructure is already in place. As a result, new EV consumers are beginning to see those sunk costs roll off the sticker price.\n\nNow, automakers are going to see how much consumers actually want competitive EV products.\n\n\"We're entering a period where we'll see what organic demand for EVs actually looks like, without the policy thumb on the scale,\" Keating said. \"They're not going to abandon EV platforms. They've already made the investments.\"",

    "title": "I lost $30,000 on my first business. Two years later, I built a business worth over $9 million — these are the lessons I learned.",
    "description": "Michelle Hu, owner of Étoile, shares how learning from her failed beauty tech app led to Étoile's over $9 milion revenue last year.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michelle Hu, a 30-year-old business owner based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first business died as quickly as it started.\n\nIn 2017, I was working as an investment banking analyst at Citi when I launched Mei, a beauty app where users could filter through and book appointments with makeup artists, hair stylists, and more. It was a one-year process of trying to scale and pouring in about $30,000 in the process, but we ultimately never launched.\n\nIn the meantime, I was selling handmade acrylic makeup holders online under the brand name Étoile. Mei failed, but I saw Étoile gaining traction on its own. I realized it could take off — and it did.\n\nTwo years later, I quit my job and went all in on Étoile. I transformed it into a world for beauty enthusiasts, crafting accessories that elevate daily rituals. We made over $9 million in revenue last year and recently launched our products in nearly 30 Anthropologie stores across the US.\n\nHere's what I learned from my failed business that helped me the second time around.\n\nI was so in love with the beauty industry that I jumped right in with Mei, but I had no tech background and no idea what really went into building an app. I remember thinking the idea of creating this techy business app sounded cool, but it just wasn't a fit for my skill set or interests. I had no business creating an app.\n\nWhen time's got hard, and the app required more time, energy, and money than I bargained for, I didn't have the passion for my product to drive me. Starting Étoile, a consumer product business, felt a lot more aligned with me.\n\nI learned it's important to start a business in an industry you love, because when things get difficult, you need the passion to fuel you. I'm not passionate about tech, but I am passionate about designing products. That passion fuels me to work through the hurdles.\n\nI now realize that I never had product-market fit with Mei. Most people text or DM to book makeup artists or hairstylists, and I learned the hard way that it's difficult to change consumer behavior.\n\nMy initial vision for Étoile was for it to be an \"everything store\" for beauty, featuring items such as ring lights and vanity tables. However, our customer base was fragmented.\n\nThat's when I took what I learned from Mei and scaled back on items that weren't driving a significant amount of revenue, focusing on what worked: our travel range of products. Since then, we've developed a strong customer base that's excited about our product. I can feel the difference between having headwinds in the business versus having tailwinds.\n\nWhen we hit that product-market fit magic, everything seemed to move a lot more efficiently in the business.\n\nI think the biggest financial mistake I made was not vetting the people we chose to build the app. It sounds silly because it seems so obvious, but I think I was just so new to the world of business and thought, \"If they've made one app before, then they can make any app.\"\n\nWe hired college students from around the world and basically threw money at them without meeting them or vetting them. We couldn't afford people with a strong portfolio, so we just filtered through others who were just as scrappy as us. I didn't realize there was such a big scope of different app developers.\n\nI've always lived by the saying, \"move fast and break things,\" but when you're spending so much money to hire people, do more research.\n\nI think hiring is still a tricky one. The thing that helps is that we have a much bigger budget than we did with Mei. The people we choose to work with have a strong portfolio of brands that they've previously worked with. I think bigger budgets have allowed for better opportunities.\n\nWhen I shut down Mei, I had to admit that things weren't working and even learn to be OK with failure.\n\nAt the start of Étoile, I held onto our product strategy so tightly, even when it wasn't working. My thought process was that we had our products ready to go, stored in a warehouse, and marketed to our audience, so I thought it would be a bad look to pull back on them, even when they weren't working.\n\nWhen I finally made the shift and pulled back on items like mirrors and tables, the business made a complete 180. It reaffirmed that it's important to admit when things aren't working and not to have so much pride when it comes to my business.\n\nDo you have a story to share about lessons learned from a failed business?

Around half the city's apartment blocks are affected following a severe Russian air attack on the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThe overnight attack on Kiev had been the most serious of the war for the city's infrastructure, with the situation exacerbated by cold winter weather, Klitschko said. Those able to find suitable accommodation elsewhere should leave the city temporarily, he posted.\n\nThe recommendation was not an official call to evacuate, but advice to the effect that residents should travel to their dachas equipped with heating stoves or seek accommodation with friends and relatives in less affected areas.\n\nSome of the apartment blocks should have heating again from Friday evening, Klitschko said, adding that the situation in Kiev was difficult but under control.\n\nThe Energy Ministry said on Friday morning that around 500,000 consumers were without electric power in Kiev and surroundings.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said the city had come under overnight attack from more than 200 drones and dozens of missiles and cruise missiles. At least four people died in the attacks, and President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 20 apartment blocks had been damaged.\n\nUkraine has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022.",

    "description": "Is the US labor market in the calm before the storm? Economists say the Beveridge curve is the signal to watch.",
    "fullText": "Is the US labor market in the calm before the storm?\n\nOne model that's closely followed by academics but which tends to fly under the radar for most investors suggests that could be the case — and it's spooking some economists.\n\nWhile the December nonfarm payrolls report, released on Friday, showed that the US added 50,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4% from 4.5%, the so-called Beveridge curve indicates that the labor market could be on the verge of a quick deterioration.\n\nThe Beveridge curve considers the relationship between the unemployment rate and the number of job openings relative to the amount of overall jobs (the job vacancy rate) over the course of a multi-year labor market cycle. As the job vacancy rate continues to fall, signaling it's more difficult to find work, the unemployment rate eventually reaches a tipping point and begins to rise sharply.\n\nUsing 2022 or 2023 as the top of the most recent labor cycle — when the job vacancy rate was around its peak — we can see that conditions are ripe for unemployment to trend upward, and the job vacancy rate has dropped to 4.6%.\n\nThe current cycle is shown in teal dots in the chart below, shared in December by Neil Dutta, the chief US economist at Renaissance Macro Research, who is warning that downside risks to the labor market are higher than upside risks for inflation.\n\nSo far, both hiring and layoff rates have been low, allowing unemployment to stay range-bound. But if layoffs were to increase, the scarce number of jobs on the market could put the economy into trouble.\n\nMatt Bush, US economist at Guggenheim Investments, which oversees more than $357 billion in assets, told Business Insider on Friday that while he thinks the labor market will remain intact in the months ahead, the prospect of rising unemployment is still a threat that investors should be paying attention to.\n\n\"I would say that recession risk is still probably well above normal, given this fragility in the labor market,\" Bush said. \"Because hiring is so low right now, it wouldn't take a big increase in layoffs to see unemployment rise pretty meaningfully.\"\n\nHe continued: \"So because of that, any even somewhat small shock to business confidence could see a pick up in layoffs and a pretty quick and sharp rise in the unemployment rate. It's not our base case, but it is a key risk that we're watching.\"\n\nPeter Berezin, the chief global strategist at BCA Research, recently expressed his concern around another indicator closely tied with the Beveridge curve: the ratio of jobs to workers. It is now negative, meaning there are more workers than there are total jobs (filled or not).\n\n\"The US labor market has reached a critical threshold: The jobs-workers gap has turned negative, signalling that the economy has reached the flat side of the Beveridge curve,\" Berezin wrote in a LinkedIn post. \"A further decline in job openings could push it into recession.\"\n\nThere are other signs that labor market conditions are set to worsen. The unemployment rate recently ticked above its three-month moving average, which has only occurred before or during recessions dating back to the 1940s.\n\nThe Conference Board's \"labor differential\" measure, which compares the number of survey respondents who say jobs are \"plentiful\" versus \"hard to get,\" is also trending higher. The metric tends to move alongside the unemploymnet rate.\n\nBut for now, at least, investors can take solace in Friday's steady unemployment number despite a relatively low print of 50,000 jobs added, Bush said.\n\n\"It's reassuring that we're not seeing this spiral where lower job growth leads to lower spending and that leads to further layoffs and that sort of recessionary snowball effect,\" Bush said. \"And I think it's because labor supply is also cooling alonside labor demand.\"",

    "title": "AI isn't making us smarter — it's training us to think backward, an innovation theorist says",
    "description": "Innovation theorist John Nosta said AI's polished responses can erode human reasoning at work by creating confidence without understanding.",
    "fullText": "AI is often described as a thinking machine — a digital mind edging closer to human intelligence.\n\nHowever, John Nosta, an innovation theorist and founder of NostaLab, an innovation and tech think tank, said that large language models don't think like humans at all.\n\nIn fact, he calls AI \"anti-intelligence\" because it operates in a way that runs counter to how humans reason, learn, and build understanding.\n\n\"My conclusion is that artificial intelligence is antithetical to human cognition,\" Nosta told Business Insider. \"I even call it anti-intelligence.\"\n\nAt the heart of Nosta's argument is a simple but unsettling claim: AI doesn't understand anything in the human sense.\n\nWhen people think about an object — say, an apple — they place it in space, time, memory, culture, and lived experience, he said.\n\nA large language model, Nosta said, does none of that. Instead, it represents the word as a mathematical object inside an enormous, hyperdimensional space and searches for patterns that statistically align, he said.\n\n\"An apple doesn't exist as an apple,\" he said. \"It exists as a vector in a hyperdimensional space.\"\n\nThat distinction matters, he said, because it means AI outputs are optimized for coherence rather than comprehension.\n\nThe system isn't reasoning its way to an answer — it's producing the response that best fits a pattern of language, he said.\n\nNosta believes AI is quietly reshaping how people think, especially at work.\n\nHuman cognition, he said, usually follows a familiar path: confusion, exploration, tentative structure, and finally confidence. AI flips that sequence.\n\n\"With AI, we start with structure,\" he said. \"We start with coherence, fluency, a sense of completeness, and afterwards we find confidence.\"\n\nThat inversion creates a powerful illusion. Because AI-generated answers sound polished and authoritative, people often accept them immediately — without doing the harder work of questioning, exploring, or fully understanding them, he said.\n\n\"Coming to the answer first is an inversion of human cognitive process,\" Nosta said. \"That's antithetical to human thought.\"\n\nThe danger isn't that AI will outperform humans in raw computation. Nosta said that's inevitable. What worries him is how easily people can outsource the most valuable parts of thinking.\n\n\"It's the stumbles, it's the roughness, it's the friction that allows us to get to observations and hypotheses that really develop who we are,\" he said.\n\nAs some companies push employees to go \"all in\" on AI for writing, analysis, and decision-making, Nosta said that speed and fluency are being mistaken for understanding.\n\nUsed as a partner, AI can enhance human thinking. Used as a shortcut, it can quietly weaken it, he said.\n\n\"The magic isn't necessarily AI,\" he said. \"It's the iterative dynamic between humans and machines.\"\n\nIn Nosta's view, the real risk of the AI era isn't smarter machines — it's humans learning to think backward.\n\nConcerns about how AI may be reshaping human thinking are increasingly shared beyond theorists.\n\nResearchers at Oxford University Press found in a recent report that AI is making students faster and more fluent while quietly stripping away the depth that comes from pausing, questioning, and thinking independently.\n\nA report from the Work AI Institute, released last month, echoed the same pattern, saying that generative AI often creates an illusion of expertise — making users feel smarter and more productive, even as their underlying skills erode.\n\nMehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, which advises companies and governments on building the data centers that power AI, said that excessive and poorly designed AI use is driving a \"quiet cognitive erosion.\"\n\n\"If you come to believe that AI writes better than you and thinks smarter than you, you will lose your own confidence in yourself,\" he told Business Insider.",

    "title": "Warren Buffett is famous while Greg Abel is virtually unknown. Here's what Berkshire's new CEO has shared about himself.",
    "description": "Warren Buffett's successor as Berkshire CEO, Greg Abel, has said all the right things but has shared little about himself.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett is a world-renowned investor and business icon, famous for everything from his folksy wisdom and vast fortune to his frugal habits and love of junk food.\n\nGreg Abel, who took over as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO on January 1, has virtually zero public profile by contrast. Whereas Buffett has partied with Jay-Z, stumped for Hillary Clinton, and appeared on \"The Office,\" few people outside the financial world have even heard of Abel.\n\nBuffett's successor has reserved his commentary in recent years for Berkshire's annual shareholder meetings. Business Insider reviewed those Q&A sessions to gain a better sense of who Abel is and how he plans to lead — and found a private person who fully embraces Buffett's teachings and seems unlikely to rock the boat.\n\nAbel joined Berkshire in 2000 when Buffett acquired MidAmerican Energy, and rose from the subsidiary's CEO to become vice-chairman of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses in 2018. He began appearing on stage with Buffett starting in 2020.\n\nPrior to last year's meeting, Abel largely limited his input to discussing subsidiaries such as Berkshire Hathaway Energy and the BNSF Railway, and weighing in on hot topics such as the clean-energy transition.\n\nAbel has frequently echoed Buffett, emulated the investor by praising his employees and lieutenants, championed Berkshire's culture, and talked up its businesses.\n\nHe's described Berkshire as a \"very special company\" because it treats its shareholders as partners and its business managers act as owners, saying \"that's never going to change.\"\n\nAbel has said he'll invest like Buffett by staying within his \"circle of competence,\" treating every stock purchase as if he's buying a piece of a business for the long term, valuing companies based on what they're likely to be worth in 10 or 20 years and relative to the risks they face, and having patience and discipline at all times.\n\n\"It's important to know that the capital allocation principles that Berkshire lives by today will continue to survive, Warren,\" he said during the 2024 meeting.\n\nAbel has underscored that, like Buffett, he'll be ready to pounce during periods of turmoil. He said last year that onlookers should \"never underestimate the amount of reading and work that's being done to be prepared to act quickly,\" adding that a \"large part of being patient\" is \"using the time to be prepared.\"\n\nLike Buffett, who's described himself as Berkshire's \"chief risk officer,\" Abel has underscored his priorities will be protecting Berkshire's reputation, prudently stewarding his shareholders' money, and maintaining a \"fortress balance sheet\" so Berkshire can weather any storm.\n\nSimilar to Buffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, Abel has openly admitted and learned from mistakes. For example, he said BNSF had broken a deal by running too many trains across tribal lands, and that PacifiCorp would switch off at-risk power lines during wildfires instead of working to keep them on, given the risk of feeding the flames.\n\nAbel has said that relative to Buffett, who famously delegates \"almost to the point of abdication,\" his management style is \"more active but hopefully in a very positive way.\"\n\nAbel has shared little about his personal life so far. He offered a rare nugget last year when he said that he'd like to be remembered as a \"great father, but equally a coach.\"\n\n\"And that goes to family, friends, and just being involved with the kids I coach in hockey or baseball or whatever it may be,\" he added.\n\nAbel has shed light on his daily routine, saying he spends a lot of time reading about Berkshire's businesses, their industries, their competitors, what risks they face, and how they'll be disrupted.\n\nHe's also preached the power of hustling, saying that \"if you start with a great work ethic and have that attitude that you want to contribute, you're going to go a long way in life.\"\n\nAbel clearly grasps the immense responsibility of leading a $1 trillion company.\n\nHe said last year that he \"couldn't be more humbled and honored\" to succeed Buffett as CEO, and to have worked alongside him and the other Berkshire brass for 25 years.\n\nEchoing Buffett's quip that he \"tap dances to work\" because he loves his job so much, Abel said last year that \"when you find something like Berkshire that's so special, you fall in love with it and it becomes what you want to do every day.\"\n\nAbel has said all the right things to present himself as the perfect person to carry the torch forward for Buffett and Munger and safeguard Berkshire's future.\n\nHe's been happy to let Buffett have the spotlight to date, but now he's in charge and all eyes are on him. It may be time to give shareholders a look behind the curtain and let them get to know their new leader.",

    "title": "I'm a hypnotherapist who helps day traders who are losing money. Here's why I think hypnosis works.",
    "description": "Hypnosis can help day traders because it's about accessing a person's unconscious mind, which can change automatic behaviors, one hypnotherapist said.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dan Ross, a hypnotherapist who works with day traders at Silicon Valley Hypnotherapy Center. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI originally discovered Tony Robbins back in the 1990s, and one of the tools he uses is hypnosis. I got fascinated by watching how rapidly he could work to help people make changes. I got curious — how does he do it? I studied with him, and then studied some of his teachers. It wasn't so much that I was fascinated with hypnosis itself. I just wanted to be a healer just to help people lead better lives.\n\nAround the same time, I got into day trading. I was working in tech at the time, and I learned a bunch about technical analysis and was trying to trade.\n\nI always have at least a few traders in my practice at any given time. I offer it as one of my specialties because I think traders want to work with somebody who speaks their language.\n\nIn the past year, the number of traders I work with has probably doubled. I think word is getting out that hypnotherapy can take care of issues that coaching or psychotherapy might not, because we're working directly with the unconscious mind, which is where automatic behaviors reside.\n\nThe conscious mind works on logic. Logically, I could say, \"Hey, just follow your strategy.\" But that's just advice. People who have tried to change some kind of habit consciously, they know willpower just doesn't last very long. It's kind of like holding your breath underwater.\n\nWell, hypnotherapy is working with the unconscious mind. The unconscious mind works with the level of symbol and emotion. That's why our dreams, which come from our unconscious mind, don't make conscious sense.\n\nA hypnotherapist has specialized training to talk to your unconscious mind, so your automatic behaviors change. You more naturally follow your strategy, for example. When you otherwise would've felt a sense of greed and stayed in a trade, you just get out. It has a reputation for operating more rapidly than other types of modalities.\n\nThere are a lot of problems traders struggle with. I can list a few of them.\n\nThat's one of the reasons people seek out a hypnotherapist like me. They haven't done that deeper work to clear out the things that limit them.\n\nI tend to work in two different ways. One is, let's clear out the things that stop you from behaving the way you want. Then, let's install and enhance the types of thoughts that you want to experience instead.\n\nLet's say somebody wants to feel a greater sense of calm and peace when the market is moving quickly. I might say something like: \"Imagine you're sitting there at your trading station and the market is starting to move quickly, but you know that you trust your strategy, so you find yourself automatically feeling a sense of calm and confidence.\"\n\nThere are also many misconceptions about hypnosis. Here are a few common ones.\n\nA common misconception about hypnosis is that it's something you've never experienced before. But the reality is, we all go in and out of trance states all the time. Have you ever watched a really good movie, and you got so drawn into it that everything else kind of faded away? That's a naturally occurring trance state.\n\nTrance states are just states where you've kind of gone inside of yourself and are focusing on one thing. If you're driving along and you missed your exit, well, who is driving the car and who's paying attention? Your unconscious mind was.\n\nOne of the things I like to explain to people before I hypnotize them is, you've already been hypnotized. We're just going to be very deliberate about it, and we're going to use it for a specific purpose.\n\nI like to remind people it's not sleep. There's this idea that someone will put you under and you won't remember anything.\n\nYou might have some amnesia for some things that happened during the session, but that's not the centerpiece. It is a state of focus and relaxed attention where your unconscious mind is more open to suggestions.\n\nI also think there's a misconception that someone can force them to change. I can't force anybody to change, so they have to come up on their own accord.\n\nThe beauty of working with traders is that there's not a lot of resistance to change. If I'm working with somebody for something like weight loss, there's often resistance, because food is comfort for some people. Part of them wants to lose the weight, part of them doesn't. But most people are not particularly resistant to not losing money.\n\nSomehow, sometimes people believe in one session, that's it.\n\nI'm personally looking for some kind of change within a few sessions, so it can be pretty quick. Sometimes people are done in a few sessions, and sometimes it takes a few more.\n\nIt just depends — how deep do the challenges go? Is it a couple of limitations, or are there some really significant limiting beliefs? Like, if somebody at their core feels like they're worthless and they don't deserve to have good things in their life. That might take a little bit longer.\n\nThere's a range of hypnotizability. Most people are hypnotizable. The general criteria for hypnotizability are: one, the person wants to be hypnotized, and two, their IQ is over 70.\n\nI think the more somebody wants to be hypnotized, the easier it's going to be, but that's not the only criteria. If they're a little more embodied and a little less intellectualizing, then it's a little easier just to let go of thinking about things.\n\nIt might take a little more work to hypnotize somebody who's highly analytical, but a highly analytical person can still go into the hypnotic state themselves.\n\nWhen somebody comes to me for a consultation, I just invite them to put their fears and their biases out on the table because I don't take it personally. Sometimes hypnosis is not portrayed well in the media, and so we just have to overcome that.\n\nWhat people don't realize is that there are thousands of studies that have done around hypnosis for all sorts of things, from medical issues, pain control, headaches, weight loss, smoking. There's scientific evidence that shows that hypnosis works, and I just need to remind people of that. I'm here to help you. Let me make sure that this is the right tool for you.",

    "description": "Finance's biggest firms are considering how AI might impact jobs, how it could cut costs, and reduce \"grunt work.\"",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Wall Street's AI era.\n\nBanks, private equity firms, hedge funds, and asset managers have been eager to use generative AI to boost productivity and reduce grunt work for workers.\n\nBusiness Insider has been reporting on how some of finance's biggest players are approaching artificial intelligence, from its potential impact on jobs and the creation of new ones, to the various ways firms are cutting costs and ramping up efficiencies.\n\nBut first — if you work at a Wall Street firm and are using AI, we want to hear from you. How is AI really showing up in your day-to-day? Is it living up to the hype?\n\nAI is set to reshape roughly 44% of banking work by 2030, according to consulting firm ThoughtLinks — and Wall Street's biggest firms are racing to get there first.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, is spending $18 billion a year on technology, with AI a central focus. CEO Jamie Dimon is a \"tremendous\" user of the bank's generative AI tools, which have now been rolled out to more than 200,000 employees.\n\nThe bank is also replacing long-standing human processes with AI. Its asset-management arm announced plans to stop using external proxy advisers for US shareholder voting, instead launching an in-house AI platform, Proxy IQ, which will analyze data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings. Executives have said the bank is training employees to use AI in ways that deliver measurable productivity gains.\n\nGoldman Sachs is spending $6 billion on technology this year — a figure CEO David Solomon has said he wishes were higher. In an October memo outlining the latest phase of its OneGS initiative, the bank said AI would drive efficiency, slow hiring, and lead to a \"limited reduction\" in roles. Goldman has since rolled out internal AI tools, including an assistant now available to employees across the firm.\n\nMorgan Stanley, an early OpenAI partner, has focused on turning employee ideas into working AI products. One internally built tool, called DevGen.AI has already saved engineers more than 280,000 hours this year. Among interns, AI adoption is especially strong: 72% say they use ChatGPT daily or several times a week.\n\nCitigroup has also accelerated its push. Nearly 180,000 employees across 83 countries now have access to Citi's proprietary AI tools, which have been used almost 7 million times this year. CEO Jane Fraser said the bank's generative AI tools are saving about 100,000 developer hours a week through automated code reviews. Citi also began piloting agentic AI with 5,000 employees in September.\n\nIn the ultracompetitive world of hedge funds, being ahead on the latest technology is always a priority.\n\nIn December, Citadel said its stockpickers are using an internal chatbot to speed up their processes and find new info at his $71 billion hedge fund.\n\nAt the 2025 Global Milken conference, Andreas Kreuz, WorldQuant's deputy CIO, said the firm was using AI to expand the data it can bring into its models since it can restructure data from images and audio.\n\nPoint72's CTO Ilya Gaysinskiy told BI about his big plans to ramp up Point72's tech organization and how AI will play into that expansion.\n\nBridgewater launched a fund driven by AI in 2024. The fund's AIA Labs worked to replicate every stage of the investment process with machine learning. The firm's co-chief investment officer and chief scientist outlined the plans of the world's largest hedge fund.\n\n$29 billion hedge fund Balyasny has built an AI bot that it believes will be able to do the grunt work that typically falls to senior analysts — a potential huge timesaver for investment teams. The manager told Business Insider in 2024 that roughly 80% of the firm's staff use its AI tools, which include the internal chatbot BAMChatGPT, and recently hired Matthew Henderey, one of the CIA's AI developers, as a data science executive. Man Group and Viking Global have also developed their own internal offerings.\n\nLucia Soares — Carlyle's chief information officer and head of technology transformation — talked to BI about taking on a new challenge: Bringing AI to the investment giant's 2,300 global employees.\n\nPrivate equity firms are no strangers to managing and analyzing copious amounts of data — but data is only helpful if you can find it. Blackstone has invested in improving its enterprise search and is also betting AI will give it a leg up in its pursuit to capture more of the insurance market.\n\nSwedish PE giant EQT built an AI engine called Motherbrain that has changed how its investors source deals. ChatGPT enables the investing giant to take the next step with its AI ambitions.\n\nAs private equity firms turn to AI for a competitive edge, Thomas H. Lee says its engineers are up to 30% more productive with help from AI coding assistants.\n\nAI tools are changing how stock-pickers do their job. AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, and JPMorgan opened up on how their tools are speeding up portfolio manager workflows.\n\nBlackRock has introduced Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. Business Insider talked to Kirsty Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, who helped develop the tool.\n\nThe multi-billion-dollar investment manager VanEck invested in a Toronto-based startup and is onboarding its technology to boost its ETF business. An executive and the fintech's CEO walked us through how AI will change the jobs of analysts and salespeople.\n\nKraken's $1.5 billion acquisition of a retail trading startup made headlines last March. Less noticed was how the crypto exchange used generative AI to run due diligence on the target — a process its head of M&A now considers core to his team's work.\n\nAt Block, Jack Dorsey's fintech behind Square, Afterpay, and Cash App, engineers built an AI agent that can write code faster — and in some cases better — than senior developers. The company ultimately decided to open-source the tool, even as it gives competitors a look under the hood.\n\nChime has taken a similar in-house approach. In 2023, the neobank built a private, ChatGPT-style assistant to help engineers ship products more quickly and at lower cost. The company's CTO shared how the tool has become a key part of Chime's product-development playbook.",

    "description": "Trump's Education Department concluded another round of negotiations focused on gainful employment, aimed at protecting student-loan borrowers.",
    "fullText": "How do you make sure you can afford the student debt you're taking on?\n\nIt's a complicated question that President Donald Trump's Education Department spent a week hashing out. On Friday, the department concluded negotiations and reached consensus on its proposal to strengthen accountability in student-loan borrowing, including revising the gainful employment rule.\n\n\"This is a game changer,\" Nicholas Kent, the department's undersecretary, said in his closing remarks. \"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results.\"\n\nSome of these changes are part of Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The Department of Education has already completed negotiations on some of the student-loan provisions in the bill, including the creation of new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, which will begin taking effect in July.\n\nThe revisions debated this week include eliminating the debt-to-earnings ratio test, which ensured a borrower's student-loan payments are no more than 8% of their annual earnings. It said this would reduce complexity. Some education policy experts worry it would weaken protections for students.\n\nCarolyn Fast, the director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that it \"makes a lot of sense\" for the Department of Education to streamline the metrics, but the proposal risks leaving students with debt they're unable to repay with the elimination of the debt-to-earnings test.\n\nGainful employment, first established by former President Barack Obama in 2014, cut off federal student aid for schools that offered programs that left students with unaffordable debt compared to their likely postgrad income. Trump repealed the rule during his first term in 2019, and former President Joe Biden reinstated it. The existing version went into effect in July 2024.\n\nBiden's version of the rule used two separate metrics to determine whether a program met gainful employment requirements: a debt-to-earnings test and an earnings premium test, which measured whether a typical graduate from the program is earning at least as much as they typical high school graduate in their state.\n\nIn addition to eliminating the debt-to-earnings test, the Department of Education's proposal would allow programs to continue receiving Pell Grant funding even if they fail the earnings premium test. However, if at least half of Title IV funds, which include Pell Grant funds, are going toward programs that fail the earnings premium test, the department would strip all funding from the failing program.\n\nWhile removing Pell eligibility for some failing programs is better than nothing, the two changes could weaken protections for students, Fast said.\n\n\"We're worried that low-income students will exhaust their limited Pell Grant eligibility on programs that don't provide a return on their investment,\" Fast said.\n\nResearch that Fast coauthored, for example, found that in 2022, about 169,000 students received Title IV aid to enroll in programs that would pass the earnings premium test but fail the debt-to-earnings test.\n\nThe department's negotiator said that the gainful employment changes will not be ready by the start of the 2026 academic year, so the new requirements are set to go into effect in the fall of 2027.\n\nLawmakers have previously pushed for a strengthened gainful employment rule. A group of Democratic lawmakers in 2023 called on the Biden administration to put forth a rule that protects students who enroll in \"postsecondary programs that saddle students with unaffordable debt and provide low financial returns.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump put big investors who own single-family rental homes in the spotlight this week by announcing he wants to ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying more of this type of housing.\n\nOverall, major investors own only about 2 to 3% of the country's single-family rental housing stock, researchers have found. But they control a much larger share of the single-family rental industry in certain markets, particularly in the Sun Belt. Cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, Charlotte, and Tampa have especially high concentrations of mega landlords.\n\nA 2023 report by The Hamilton Project, which is part of the Brookings Institution, found that mega investors — defined as those who own more than 1,000 homes — owned nearly 10% of total rental units in the Atlanta metro area and 27% of all single-family home rentals. They owned 22% of the single-family rental stock in Jacksonville, and nearly 20% in Charlotte.\n\nThe map below shows the cities with the highest concentration of institutional investors in the SFR market:\n\nThe report found that 354,000 of the total 446,000 single-family homes owned by mega-investors were located in 20 markets, primarily in the Southeast and Southwest.\n\nWhile Trump says he wants to make homeownership more affordable for individual buyers by blocking mega landlords, industry watchers say the move wouldn't address the root cause of high home prices: a shortage of homes.\n\nJenny Schuetz, vice president of housing at Arnold Ventures, said the lack of homes in markets across the country is \"number one, two, and three on the list of problems.\" She called a potential ban \"a red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nBut she said that having a handful of landlords that own a large part of any rental market could create problems, including higher rents.\n\n\"You don't really want to have highly concentrated ownership of the rental market with a couple of landlords who have market power,\" she said. \"And if you get to a small enough area of geography, it's certainly possible that a big institutional investor could wind up kind of having a quasi monopoly.\"\n\nShe said that the appropriate response to that concentration would be, first, keeping an inventory of who owns a lot of real estate in any city or county, and, second, tracking complaints from tenants regarding their landlords.\n\n\"Figure out whether this is a problem first, and where it's a problem, before you decide what the solutions are,\" Schuetz said.",

    "description": "My two daughters are growing up across the country from their grandmother. We've figured out ways to shrink the distance.",
    "fullText": "Living near your kids' grandparents is great. The pop-ins for bedtime stories. Help with the school pick-ups and drop-offs. And your go-to phone call when your babysitter is sick one hour before your anniversary reservation.\n\nIt's the best, isn't it? I wouldn't know.\n\nMy mom lives in Haslett, Michigan — 1,891 miles away from our home in Portland, Oregon. She's the only living grandmother to my two daughters, 6 and 8, and their only grandfather is close, but at 85, his mobility is limited. There are no pop-ins, drop-offs, or backups, and they lose out on that daily, in-person bonding with her.\n\nMany other families are in the same situation. A study by Cornell researchers found that about one in seven children lives 500 miles or more from their grandparents. Despite the distance, we've found ways to bridge the gap, making it feel like Grandma is always near.\n\nThe distance means Grandma misses all the fun firsts. She's missed first steps, first words, and first days of school. And it's not just big moments. When she's back in town, they suddenly know how to do things like brush their own hair, tie shoelaces, and buckle seatbelts. She missed those little wins, too.\n\nIt's also harder to pass down family traditions and history, though we've still found a way to give our kids a sense of belonging. Grandma's great-aunt's German 'city chicken' recipe, which is breaded veal or pork on a stick (it's good, I swear!), tells my kids where they come from. The bedtime lullaby she learned from her own grandmother shows nurturing runs in the family. The black-and-white picture on Grandma's shelf, filled with \"people who look like me,\" as my daughters say, lets them know they're not alone in this world.\n\nWe have a couple of rituals that help us stay connected in between visits. When our daughters were babies and toddlers, Grandma would chat from a screen while they splashed around during baths. She'd talk about her day, ask about theirs, and tell stories. My girls would get so excited to hang out with Grandma. As soon as I'd tell them, \"Grandma's calling,\" they'd run for the tub.\n\nEvery Sunday, for several years now, she reads to my girls for an hour through an app called Readeo. It features hundreds of books that they can navigate together, and they can see each other on the video screen. And once they started learning to read, she got to fill me in on some of their firsts.\n\nThere are several non-stop flights from Detroit to Portland, which allow Grandma to attend ballet recitals, spend Christmas mornings with us, and go with us to the Oregon coast. She comes our way twice a year, and we head her way once a year.\n\nWhen we visit her, it's special. My girls love to stay at her home. They snuggle under blankets that smell like her, ask about where her art comes from, and fall into her routine. Waking up is an intimate pocket of time they share before my wife and I are awake.\n\nThat's the silver lining of living so far away. When we come together, we make the most of the moments we do have — whether it's big holiday gatherings, small family dinners, or just having breakfast in our PJs.\n\nWe may not have the pop-ins, drop-offs, or backups, but my daughters' relationship with their grandma is still remarkably close, even from almost 2,000 miles away.",

    "description": "My grandmother is 97, and I've learned about leading a happy and healthy life from her. She finds small ways to stay fit and enjoy herself.",
    "fullText": "I live in California. My grandmother lives 5,000 miles away in Scotland, but the distance between us never felt that far. I'm lucky that as I grew up, I got to spend so much time with her. We vacationed in the UK often, and she loved visiting the US, especially San Francisco, where her favorite things are spending time with her family, enjoying clam chowder in a bread bowl, and soaking up the California sunshine.\n\nOver the years, I've picked up a few things from my grandmother, who is now 97. I make a decent Scotch Broth, appreciate the superior quality of Marks & Spencer's products, and never forget to pack a sandwich for the road when I'm traveling long distances. And she's also taught me some lifestyle habits over the years to be healthier and happier in my everyday life.\n\nIn a world where many buy in bulk, my grandmother prefers just one freshly baked roll. At the bakery in Kilmacolm, the small Scottish village where she lived for many years, the baker knew that if she bought more than one, she was having company.\n\nIt's easy to stock up on rolls at Costco — they're affordable and tasty — but there's something to be said for popping into your local bakery, buying a still-warm single round, and taking it home to enjoy with a slab of butter and a cup of tea. It's hard to beat.\n\nAnd the quality-over-quantity mindset applies to more than just food. My grandmother will always prefer one nice wool cardigan over a few poorly made ones, one beautiful scarf over a couple of fashion-forward options, and a beautiful winter coat that can actually handle a Scottish winter instead of several cheaper alternatives. But she rarely pays full price — her secret superpower is finding a good sale.\n\nIn San Francisco, it's sometimes easier to walk than drive. When I have the choice, I lace up my sneakers and hit the pavement — not as a workout, but as a fun way to stay active while running errands.\n\nMy grandmother never stepped foot on a treadmill or used a fitness tracker. She didn't own a car and always relied on buses and her own two feet. Over the years, walking has been part of her daily routine, and she's stronger for it. Unlike my grandmother, I do track my steps, and I'm sometimes surprised by how small choices add up and help me close my movement rings.\n\nThere are so many tasty things to enjoy in life, but sometimes the guilt of indulging strips the fun out of it. My grandmother loves a sweet after dinner, a biscuit with her tea, and a delicious fish and chip supper — truly enjoying what she eats makes her happy, as it should.\n\nAs for me, I love scones, cheese pizza, and a second glass of wine. Sometimes, I do feel guilty when my sugar intake outweighs my vegetables, but I try not to beat myself up about it. We've all heard that moderation is key — and it is — but it's also important to enjoy life without guilt.\n\nMy grandmother has always been sharp, well into her 90s. One reason might be that until recently, she read the newspaper every day. She stayed engaged with the world around her, keeping up to date on current events — especially the football scores.\n\nThese days, I read more articles online than I do in print, although it is nice to take a break from screens once in a while. My grandmother likes to know what's going on around her. I plan to follow her lead and stay curious and mentally fit by reading every day, in print and online.\n\nMy grandmother says everyone has a vice, and she admits hers is shopping. But shopping makes her happy, and she doesn't deprive herself of it. She's always been one of the best-dressed women in the room, especially on special occasions when she dons her cool sparkly tops.\n\nI'm not quite sure what that thing is for me. I'm trying to narrow it down. But when I do, I plan to lean in and enjoy what makes me happy.\n\nI think about my grandmother all the time, especially when I pop over to the bakery for a single roll. The habits I'm stealing from her are simple, but I truly believe these small choices will come with big rewards, at least for me.",

    "title": "We run our bakery out of shipping containers. It was an unexpectedly cost-effective solution to scaling our business.",
    "description": "Chrissy Traore and her husband Ben started a bakery in New York. When they needed more space, they turned to shipping containers as the solution.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chrissy Traore, 41, who opened See & Be Kitchen with her husband Ben Salif Traore in Cairo, New York, about 40 miles from Albany, New York. When their business expanded quickly, they began running parts of it out of shipping containers on their property. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBen and I met while I was a chef and he was a baker. We worked at the same restaurant — they had a bakery and a restaurant right next door, and I was their pizza chef and he was their head baker. I had to mix my pizza dough in his mixer and that's kind of how we met.\n\nBefore, I worked on Madison Avenue in marketing and brand strategy, and in 2008, the economy crashed and my job crashed too. When that happened, I moved into food. I took a job on an ice cream truck and just fell in love with food work.\n\nI was in the food industry in various ways in New York City from about 2008 until 2017.\n\nWhile working in the industry, I was unhappy with the way that they treated employees. I was in management at the time, so I could see the full round numbers.\n\nI thought, \"There has to be a better way, but it's not my job to change this business owner or this business.\"\n\nBen and I talked a lot about it, and we were going upstate frequently — I was working at a place upstate as their first chef.\n\nI said, \"We should really move upstate.\" It's more our speed. We like the outdoors. We like having space. The quality of life is better. We love farming and being close to what's happening on the ground, literally. In 2017 we said, let's get out of the city.\n\nWe didn't have a ton of money, and we had to be scrappy and thoughtful about how we deployed the resources that we had saved. We wanted a place where we could live and work, so we wanted property and land — that was important to us.\n\nWe found a property in Cairo, New York, and it had been a bar and a hotel, so it was already grandfathered in on DOH, and had some structures there. We have 11 acres, and the house was practically falling apart, so we could afford it. We paid $189,900, and that was it. We went all in.\n\nWe knew we wanted to open our own place and we were trying to discover what that was. We knew it would involve Ben's bread and my cooking.\n\nWe started renovating the property and doing farmers markets, and that's how we got to know the community that we were in.\n\nWe came in quietly, like, \"Let's see what's already here and get to know people before we just bash them over the head with what we do.\" Let's see what they want, because ultimately we're entering a community that's not necessarily ours yet.\n\nWe were moving from Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, and part of the reason we moved out was we saw that happening. People were moving in and they would say, \"We need to fix this. This is broken.\" And I'm like, \"What is broken? This is a wonderful community. Please stop.\"\n\nSometime in 2018, we turned into See & Be. Then, from there, we really got some traction at farmers markets.\n\nWe were doing porch pickups — people could pick up their orders at a local massage therapist's house — so we had started operating, but we didn't have a physical space yet.\n\nWe were still building out the cafe in the very small already existing structure on our property. We had one oven, with one proofer, a little cooktop that I would do the sandwiches on, and a coffee station with this beautiful wooden bar that people could sit at. And we opened that in February of 2019. Ben baked everything; I ran the front of house.\n\nWe had a five-year plan and it went into overdrive. Soon, we needed more space, and I could not get a building up fast enough. With traditional buildings, we looked at it and we thought it was going to take a year and a half to two years. We couldn't do that. We needed space like tomorrow.\n\nI had worked for a company while in Brooklyn that was actually my first shipping container job. That was at the DeKalb Market, and it was all built out of shipping containers.\n\nI realized there was no way to get a building through the planning board and everything quickly enough — but I could get a shipping container.\n\nI looked at Ben and I said, \"The fastest way we can do this is to get a shipping container.\" And he said, \"Are you kidding?\" I said, \"No.\"\n\nWe really bootstrapped our business from day one. We had a $10,000 investment in building out the space over time. We costed it out, and we could afford it with what we had already made in the business.\n\nWe got our approval and I was so excited. I posted it on our Facebook page and we got over 4,000 interactions. We couldn't not open.\n\nOur first shipping container was a regular shipping container — a 40' by 20' high cube. We placed it on wooden rail ties, which was not great — those degraded over the years, especially with heavy usage.\n\nWe thought of ourselves as scrappy: \"Well, we did the cafe, we can do this ourselves. So why would I pay to have a spray foam? We'll do that ourselves.\" That was terrible idea.\n\nI think we bought every spray foam insulation canister in a 200-mile radius of here from Home Depot and Lowe's. We didn't know what we were doing. We were just trying to figure it out. The walls were uneven and it worked, but it wasn't a great solution.\n\nThen we pushed out of that shipping container and needed even more space. At that point, we needed more cold storage. I started doing more research into shipping containers and came across decommissioned reefers.\n\nThey're pre-insulated and have steel walls. And unlike a regular shipping container that has a wood floor, this has a steel flat floor. So it's already food-ready.\n\nWe bought the first container for $6,000 painted and delivered. And then we spent another couple thousand dollars in spray foam. God only knows how much the labor was, because we did it ourselves and that took forever.\n\nWe have running water and electric in the containers, but most of the mixing happens in our original building.\n\nThat following year, as our business grew and began to quickly scale, we kept outgrowing our space and needing more and more room. Once we saw how quickly we could get a shipping container in place — about a month — it was easy to go, \"OK, well, gee, trucks can double my space in a month.\"\n\nThe second container was much faster and easier to set up. I bought that directly through a broker at the port. We paid $8,500 for that one.\n\nWhen we installed the second container, we leveled the ground, put in concrete pillars, and the cranes came in and moved the original container and did that whole process. Then, with the third container, it was very easy to attach it because the ground was already graded and leveled.\n\nIt cost about $7,500 to $15,000 per container at the end of the day, because we had to get the crane to get them moved, and we had to get them welded together.\n\nIt's always funny when someone comes up to the building for the first time, and they're just like, \"What is this? Where is the bakery?\" And then they knock on a shipping container door.\n\nPeople are always shook to see that it's a real production. They think we're winging this or pretending because there's these shipping containers. But when you walk in, you forget you're in a shipping container.",

    "description": "From a lollipop that lets you taste sound to a Tamagotchi style AI pet that physically grows, here are the coolest tech you could get your hands on.",
    "fullText": "This lollipop lets you taste your favorite music — literally.\n\nUsing bone induction technology, Lollipop Star made a candy that can transmit sound through vibrations in the jaw and skull while it's in the mouth. For those without synesthesia, this may be the closest you can come to experiencing it.\n\nAccording to Lollipop Star's website, the candy is designed with a standard lollipop on top of a thicker handle at the bottom, which houses the electronics. Users could bite down lightly on the candy to activate the vibrations. Earplugs are included to help isolate the sound in noisy environments.\n\nBased on photos from Lollipop Star's booth at the CES, each candy is tied to a specific artist and flavor. For example, Ice Spice's version comes in peach, Akon's is blueberry, and Armani White's is lime.\n\nOn its website, the company says that the novelty candy will come at an affordable price of $9 each.\n\nThe Tamagotchi of the AI era is here.\n\nA new AI pet from Chinese startup Takway AI, called Sweekar, debuted in the US at CES. Unlike most AI companions that exist entirely virtually, this creature has a physical form that appears to grow.\n\nBased on demo videos, the Sweekar starts out as a palm-sized, egg-shaped device with glowing ears. After an incubation period that can last up to two days, the shell appears to crack open, revealing a newborn digital creature.\n\nFrom there, Sweekar moves through a series of life stages. The baby phase lasts roughly five to seven days, followed by a teenage stage that can stretch from about three to six weeks. Eventually, the pet reaches adulthood, developing greater intelligence and a more defined personality, as well as more independence.\n\nEarly in its life, the pet requires frequent attention, including regular care and help learning basic language. Just like a Tamagotchi, Sweekar can die from neglect.\n\nTakway AI said in a press release that it plans to launch Sweekar on Kickstarter later this year. The company expects the device to be priced at around $150.\n\nVacuum cleaning robots are taking a major step up.\n\nRoborock's Saros Rover prototype became the first robot vacuum to climb stairs at CES. Based on demo videos, the prototype robot vacuum uses a pair of articulated wheel-legs that lift and lever its body up, before folding away and redeploying for the next step.\n\nThe process isn't fast, according to demo videos, but the Rover cleans the stairs as it goes. Roborock said in a press release that the system works on traditional, curved, and carpeted staircases, as well as ramps, thresholds, and other household obstacles.\n\nThe Saros Rover remains an early prototype, and Roborock hasn't shared pricing or a launch timeline. The company has said in a press release, however, that it plans to bring the stair-climbing robot vacuum to market.\n\nLenovo showcased numerous concept devices at CES 2026, but one of its boldest ideas was a gaming laptop featuring a screen that physically expands wider.\n\nThe Legion Pro Rollable, as Lenovo described in a press release, is built around a 16-inch flexible OLED display that can expand sideways to two larger sizes. From photos, the device appears to have a screen screen stretches from a standard 16:10 aspect ratio to 21:9 or an ultra-wide 24:9, effectively turning a compact gaming laptop into a widescreen display better suited for immersive games.\n\nAccording to Lenovo, the Legion Pro has the same lower chassis, ports, and supports high-end graphics, just like some of Lenovo's other products. The rollable device was named Best Gaming Product in the Official Best of CES 2026 Awards, though Lenovo has not announced plans to turn it into a retail device.\n\nAI-Tails is betting that AI can spot health issues in cats long before their owners do.\n\nAt CES, the Swiss startup has unveiled a smart feeding and drinking station that uses AI, cameras, and pattern-recognition software to analyze a cat's behavior and facial expressions, signals that are often too subtle for humans to notice without veterinary expertise. The company's website said that the goal is to monitor a pet's well-being continuously and flag potential problems in real time.\n\nVideos of a live demo at CES show that the system features separate bowls for food and water. with built-in sensors and cameras, analyze consumption patterns, body temperature, and facial cues.\n\nThe feeding station is currently available for preorder and is expected to ship worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2026, according to the company's website. The models are expected to be priced between $199 and $299.",

    "description": "Rory McIlroy relaxes his shoulder. Scottie Scheffler rolls his forearms.",
    "fullText": "Rory McIlroy relaxes his shoulder. Scottie Scheffler rolls his forearms. Jordan Spieth shortens his swing. Same shot shape. Three different answers to three different problems.\n\nThe draw — that coveted right-to-left curve — has haunted amateurs for decades. Most golfers freeze at the thought of it, trapped in an over-the-top motion that sends the ball slicing into oblivion. Yet three Major champions have cracked the code, each engineering the same outcome through radically different methods. The secret? There is no single “correct” draw. Only the one that solves your specific flaw.\n\nFor pure distance with shape, McIlroy’s method stands alone. The five-time Major winner — widely regarded as one of the best drivers the game has ever produced — builds his towering draw on a deceptively simple foundation: aim right, move the ball slightly back, and let gravity do the work.\n\nThe key move happens at the top of the backswing. McIlroy relaxes his trail shoulder, allowing the club to drop below the plane naturally. This “Sleepy Shoulder” move creates an inside-out path without conscious hand manipulation. The ball launches right, then curves back toward the target with penetrating flight and maximum roll.\n\nA recent instructional breakdown reinforces this principle: a solid draw emerges from rotational swing mechanics rather than lateral sway. McIlroy’s shoulder drop exemplifies that philosophy — the body rotates, the path shapes itself, and the hands stay quiet.\n\nIf your draw struggles stem from an out-to-in path, McIlroy’s shoulder relaxation offers the simplest correction. Speed converts to shape with minimal conscious effort.\n\nWhere McIlroy chases distance, Spieth chases precision. The three-time Major champion approaches the draw as a scoring weapon, not a power play. His method centers on restraint. Instead of a full swing, Spieth uses a deliberate three-quarter motion — reducing speed to tighten dispersion.\n\n“I’ve got to take a little bit off, so I’m going to do that by using a three-quarter motion,” Spieth explained in a Titleist instruction session. “Then I’m going to try to be just as aggressive with the ball as I would be on a full one.”\n\nThe second element: late delofting. Spieth keeps the clubface lean through impact, allowing loft to release at the last moment. Face stability remains intact because the adjustment happens early in the swing, not at contact. His target philosophy seals the approach. Rather than firing at pins, Spieth aims at the fat parts of greens, letting draw spin work the ball back toward the hole.\n\n“If you start training that way, it’s so much easier to play the game, because you’re missing on the fat parts of the greens,” he noted.\n\nIf your draw over-curves or your contact lacks consistency, Spieth’s shortened motion and face control offer a path to repeatability. Prioritize strike over speed.\n\nScheffler’s draw solves a different problem entirely — the need to shape on command. The four-time Major winner, who captured five wins in his first eight starts of 2024, including the Masters and the Players Championship, has built his dominance on adaptability. When a dogleg demands a curve or a tree blocks the direct line, Scheffler’s hands take over.\n\nThe setup is straightforward: close the stance slightly, move the ball back. From there, the intention shifts to the trail forearm.\n\n“With the ball position here, the ball is going to start way out to the right,” Scheffler explained in a Golf.com instruction feature. “And all I’m trying to do is get that ball to turn over as much as I can.”\n\nThe key difference from McIlroy’s body-driven method: Scheffler’s “Forearm Turnover” relies on active rotation of the trail forearm over the lead arm through impact. It’s a hand-driven feel, not a sequencing play — simpler to execute under pressure, easier to repeat when the margin for error shrinks.\n\nIf your face control wavers at impact, Scheffler’s forearm turnover provides a direct, feel-based solution. The hands create the shape; the body follows.\n\nThree methods. Three contexts. Path problem? Relax the shoulder like McIlroy. Face control problem? Roll the forearms like Scheffler. Contact and dispersion problem? Shorten the swing like Spieth.\n\nThree Major champions. Three different moves. One shot shape. The “correct” draw has always been the one that fixes your flaw — nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe post How to Hit a Perfect Draw Like Major Champions Ft.

    "description": "Los Angeles allowed a free-falling Winnipeg squad to find its first victory since mid-December.",
    "fullText": "With a prime opportunity to get back in the win column against a last-place Jets team, the Los Angeles Kings were downed 5-1 on Friday evening at Canada Life Centre. Marking the second straight Kings loss, the squad dropped to 18-15-10, sitting fifth in the Pacific Division.\n\nWinnipeg headed into the contest riding an 11-game losing streak, with their last win coming in a 5-1 victory over the Washington Capitals on Dec. 13. The skid was the longest for the club since moving to Winnipeg from Atlanta in 2011.\n\nVladislav Namestnikov and Cole Koepke got the Jets out in front in the first, with each contributing a score to create a 2-0 cushion. Namestnikov snapped a sizeable scoring drought in the process, finding the net for the first time in 29 games.\n\nQuinton Byfield, the lone Kings' scorer of the evening, saw the puck deflect off him and into the net after the initial shot attempt from Warren Foegele. Earning his seventh goal of the season, Byfield now has four points in his last four games.\n\nQ-Tips-It! pic.twitter.com/ShJqK8lxg8\n\n— LA Kings (@LAKings) January 10, 2026\n\nThe score also represented his second consecutive game with a point against the Jets. He had previously earned his 100th career assist in a 3-0 Los Angeles victory against Winnipeg on Nov. 4, 2025.\n\nForward Taylor Ward recorded his first career assist on the play in the third game of his young NHL career. It was the 27-year-old's first action on the road.\n\nHowever, the Jets poured in three goals of their own during the period to pull away and establish a sizeable advantage. Jonathan Toews had the third goal for the Jets, snapping a 26-game scoring skid of his own.\n\nMark Scheifele closed the frame with back-to-back goals, making it 5-1. Through two periods, starting Kings' netminder Darcy Kuemper saved 11 of 16 shots before being replaced by Anton Forsberg in the third.\n\nKuemper dropped to 12-8-7 on the year, conceding a season-high five scores in the loss. He has failed to find the win column in two consecutive starts after the Kings came up short in Thursday's overtime loss to the Sharks.\n\nFollowing a frustrating loss, Los Angeles will look to rebound on the second end of a back-to-back in Edmonton on Saturday evening. It will be the first battle between the Kings and Oilers this season. Currently holding second place in the Pacific Division at 22-16-6, Edmonton is riding a two-game win streak.\n\nPuck drop is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. PT.",

    "fullText": "Moments after the Oregon Ducks' 56-22 loss to the Indiana Hoosiers amid a disastrous three-turnover performance from quarterback Dante Moore, it appears that the potential 2026 draft prospect is still uncertain on his future.\n\n\"I don't know my decision yet,\" he revealed after being asked whether he'll declare for the 2026 NFL draft or return to Eugene for one more season.\n\nIt's the answer that Moore has given ever since his name began to appear in 2026 mock drafts and big boards.\n\nNotably, he's the No. 1 prospect on esteemed ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr.'s Big Board. With the draft order set, he's widely projected to be selected by the Las Vegas Raiders or New York Jets, the teams that own the No. 1 and No. 2 picks, respectively.\n\nOregon QB Dante Moore on his future: “I don’t know my decision yet.”\n\n— Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) January 10, 2026\n\nBut if there was ever a performance that changed Moore's perspective on if he's ready to go pro or not, this may have been it.\n\nOn the surface, Moore wasn't bad. By game's end, he'd completed 24 of 39 passes for 285 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\n\nBut there was also a badly thrown pass on the first play of the game that resulted in a Hoosiers pick-six. There was a mishap in the backfield in which Moore's throwing arm bumped into running back Dierre Hill Jr., causing a fumble and an Indiana recovery deep inside Duck territory. A strip sack followed in which he held the ball for far too long, allowing the Hoosiers pass rush to reach him and cause another fumble.\n\nIn all, Moore committed three first-half turnovers, plummeting the Ducks' chances of a win and showing that he may not be as ready for the NFL as previous opinions have suggested.\n\nRegardless of what he says now, in the wake of one of the most disappointing losses in program history for Oregon and easily the worst game that Moore has pieced together as a Duck, a decision will come soon.\n\nUntil then, the Oregon program, plus the Raiders and Jets, will be waiting for his answer.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Oregon Ducks QB Dante Moore still unsure of future after CFP Semis",

    "fullText": "Broncos' Nik Bonitto says Myles Garrett not best pass rusher in NFL originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller isn’t ready to slow down. Earlier Friday, he said he wants to keep playing so he can continue climbing the NFL’s all-time sacks list.\n\nMiller was at one point widely regarded as one of the league’s premier pass rushers. This season, however, much of the attention has gone to Cleveland Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett, who set the NFL single-season sack record.\n\nMORE: Broncos predicted to cut ties with $12 million quarterback in 2026 offseason\n\nStill, one current NFL player believes others deserve credit for setting the standard before him.\n\nBroncos linebacker Nik Bonitto responded to a post on X supporting the view that Miller is better than Garrett.\n\nAt age 36, Miller tied DeMarcus Ware this season with 138.5 career sacks, ranking ninth all-time in NFL history and standing as the most by any active player. Miller recorded double-digit sacks in seven of his first eight seasons, though he hasn’t reached that mark since 2018. Over his career, he has earned three All-Pro selections and won two Super Bowl titles. He now plays for the Washington Commanders.\n\nMORE: Von Miller using former Broncos teammate as motivation to continue playing career\n\nGarrett, meanwhile, has totaled 125.5 career sacks at age 30, tying him for 20th all-time. He has posted double-digit sack totals in every season except his rookie year, has been named All-Pro four times, and won Defensive Player of the Year in 2023.\n\nBonitto and the Broncos have secured the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC and will await the outcome of this weekend’s wild-card games to determine their opponent, facing the lowest remaining seed.\n\nBroncos get completely buried in another NFL playoff prediction\n\nBroncos could get huge playoff boost with return of three starters\n\nGiants request HC interview with Broncos coach connected to GM Joe Schoen\n\nBroncos' Vance Joseph in high demand for head coaching openings",

    "fullText": "The WNBA and its players’ union weren’t able to agree to a new collective bargaining agreement by the Friday night deadline, and now the league enters a “status-quo” period with no new extension reached.\n\nNegotiations will continue with the current CBA still in effect.\n\nThe league and the players had two previous extensions, with the most recent expiring Friday night. The sides have met several times this week, but are still far apart on many key issues, including salary structure and revenue-sharing.\n\n“Despite demonstrating our willingness to compromise in order to get a deal done, the WNBA and its teams have failed to meet us at the table with the same spirit and seriousness,’ the union said in a statement. “Instead, they have remained committed to undervaluing player contributions, dismissing player concerns, and running out the clock.”\n\nIf a new CBA isn’t agreed upon soon, it could delay the start of the 2026 season.\n\n“The WNBA continues to negotiate in good faith with the goal of reaching a deal as quickly as possible,” the league told The Associated Press in a statement Thursday. “Our focus remains on reaching an agreement that significantly increases player compensation while ensuring the long-term growth of the business.”\n\nThe last CBA was announced in the middle of January 2020, a month after it had been agreed to. It could easily take two months from when a new CBA is reached to get to the start of free agency, which was supposed to begin later this month.\n\nThe WNBA, under U.S. labor law, has a status-quo obligation to allow teams to send out qualifying offers under the expired CBA agreement. Both sides could agree to a moratorium that would result in a pause of all free agency activities until a new CBA is ratified. The league offered one, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on Friday night on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations.\n\nWith no moratorium in place, the league has told its teams that they can send out qualifying offers to free agents beginning on Sunday, according to the person. Those offers would go to players who were restricted free agents or ones that the teams wanted to give the franchise tag to.\n\nBecause neither the players nor the teams have any idea what the new salary structure and salary cap would be in the new CBA, no teams are expected to make those offers.\n\nThe league’s most recent offer last month would guarantee a maximum base salary of $1 million in 2026 that could reach $1.3 million through revenue sharing. That’s up from the current $249,000 and could grow to nearly $2 million over the life of the agreement, the person told the AP.\n\nUnder the league’s proposal, players would receive in excess of 70% of net revenue — though that would be their take of the profits after expenses are paid. Those expenses would include upgraded facilities, charter flights, five-star hotels, medical services, security and arenas.\n\nThe average salary in 2026 would be more than $530,000, up from its current $120,000, and grow to more than $770,000 over the life of the agreement. The minimum salary would grow from its current $67,000 to approximately $250,000 in the first year, the person told the AP.\n\nThe proposal would also financially pay star young players like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers, who are all still on their rookie contracts, nearly double the league minimum.\n\nRevenue sharing is one of the major sticking points in the negotiations.\n\nThe union’s counter proposal to the league would give players around 30% of the gross revenue. The player’s percentage would be from money generated before expenses for the first year and teams would have a $10.5 million salary cap to sign players. Under the union’s proposal, the revenue sharing percent would go up slightly each year.\n\n“Make no mistake. Pay equity is not optional and progress is long overdue,” the union statement said. “We urge the league and its teams to meet this moment. The players already have and will continue to do so.”",

    "description": "Here's what Grizzlies' players said about trade speculation regarding Ja Morant.",
    "fullText": "When Jaren Jackson Jr. hit a 3-pointer early in the Grizzlies' game against the Thunder on Jan. 9, there was only one way for him to celebrate.\n\nJackson immediately hit Ja Morant's \"block out the noise\" celebration, paying homage to his fellow star on what might go down as a monumental day for the franchise. News broke earlier in the day that the Grizzlies would consider trade offers for Morant, potentially signaling a path toward the end of an era of Grizzlies basketball.\n\nJackson, who like Morant has played his entire career with the Grizzlies, reflected postgame on what the partnership has meant to him.\n\n\"The business of basketball, it takes a toll,\" Jackson said. \"And I told him too, I think we've seen it all. I think we've seen so many different things. But, you know, that's my brother. I'm always feeling for him. Yeah, man. It's just a tough thing, man. But he showed up to the game, he's still around. You can understand the mood, something like that. And just, especially with someone like him, who's just viral for freaking anything, it's just intense, man.\n\n\"We're all growing up in the public eye, but it's just intense. I feel for him. That's my brother. That side of the game plays out like it plays out. No matter what, he changed my life coming here. You know who he is.\"\n\nMorant missed the game with a calf contusion. It was his fourth straight missed game, and it isn't clear how long he could be out. The Grizzlies led by as many as 21 points against the Thunder but collapsed down the stretch in an eventual 117-116 loss.\n\nThe loss capped a long day for the Grizzlies, who had to deal with the Morant news and then quickly turn around to face the defending NBA champion (albeit against a Thunder team that was missing multiple key players, including reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander).\n\n\"I'm not going to say I didn't expect it, and I'm going to say I was expecting it,\" Grizzlies forward GG Jackson said about the Morant news. \"I kind of thought things would just mellow over and get back to him being on the floor with us. Right now, I really don't have no reaction. He still comes in the facility smiling with us, doesn't let any of the outside noise affect him.\"\n\nMorant still sat on the bench during the game.\n\n\"Obviously we love Ja over here,\" guard Jaylen Wells said.\n\nReach sports writer Jonah Dylan at jonah.dylan@commercialappeal.com or on X @thejonahdylan.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Memphis Commercial Appeal: What Grizzlies players said about Ja Morant trade speculation",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have a break from Premier League action tomorrow when they take on Charlton in the FA Cup third round.\n\nThe Addicks’ manager Nathan Jones has fired up his men ahead of the game, claiming their intent is to give Chelsea a tough game, not look for autographs from their Premier League opposition.\n\n“You start at the third round and you’ve got that opportunity of getting a big one, which is always nice because it’s a test, it’s not because we want to high-five Liam Delap or anyone,” the ex-Southampton coach said.\n\n“What we have to make sure is that it doesn’t become just an autograph session. It becomes a proper game where we can test ourselves, test our structure, test what we do.”\n\nCole Palmer and a fairly generic group of Chelsea players look disappointed. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\n\nWe can certainly expect Charlton to come out all guns blazing. They may be a couple of divisions below, but this is their biggest game of the season so far in terms of audience, and they will want to show what they can do.\n\nMeanwhile Chelsea are in bad form, are playing an intense run of games, will use a mainly rotated team and have a new coach in place. This could be a very tricky tie.\n\nChelsea’s rotten project under BlueCo has been slammed by a player who was at the club in a very different era, and who can’t believe that “money, money, money” is all that remains.\n\nWe won’t get a full preview of Chelsea’s tactics today because it’s going to be a heavily rotated team and he’s only had one day of training. But long term there are questions about how he will solve the big problem from Enzo Maresca’s reign.",

It was expected that both might be working in tandem like before, but that does not seem to be the plan anymore.\n\nINEOS have already spoken with the ex-England midfielder, and now, as per The Daily Mail, face-to-face talks with the Norwegian will be held on Saturday.\n\n“Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will hold face-to-face talks with Manchester United on Saturday as he bids to become interim head coach until the end of the season.\n\n“Solskjaer is battling with Michael Carrick for the role after United sacked Ruben Amorim this week, although caretaker boss Darren Fletcher cannot be ruled out.\n\n“It’s understood that both Solskjaer and Carrick held preliminary discussions with the United hierarchy earlier in the week.\n\n“Carrick, 44, met with chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox in person on Thursday, and Solskjaer will have his interview at Carrington on Saturday.\n\n“It will be his first face-to-face meeting with the club’s hierarchy since Amorim was sacked.”\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has the backing of plenty of United’s superstars, and The Peoples Person has already relayed that he would want the permanent job should he succeed in taking the 20-time English league champions back to the Champions League.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

Ponds palmed Dante Moore's first pass attempt just seconds into the game. The Hoosiers cornerback finished the play by sprinting 25 yards up the right flank for an early edge.\n\nDucks quarterback Dante Moore helped even the score with a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jamari Johnson to end the next possession, but the Hoosiers responded with a surge of 35-consecutive points.\n\nMendoza found wide receiver Omar Cooper Jr. for an 8-yard score at the end of the first quarter to give the lead back to the Hoosiers. Moore fumbled early in the second quarter, giving the Hoosiers a short field. Running back Kaelon Black scored on a 1-yard run less than a minute later.\n\nMendoza threw his second score about five minutes later, finding Charlie Becker for a 36-yard touchdown. Moore lost his second fumble -- and committed his third turnover of the half -- on the next Ducks drive. Mendoza threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Elijah Sarratt at the end of the quarter to give the Hoosiers a 28-point lead of the break.\n\nMendoza threw his fourth touchdown pass to a fourth different teammate on the first possession of the second half.

(WFXR)— Liberty Christian Academy (LCA) Thursday announced that longtime Head Football Coach Frank Rocco will retire at the conclusion of the 2025–2026 school year, bringing to a close one of the most successful coaching tenures in the state’s history.\n\nCoach Rocco retires as the winningest football coach in Liberty Christian Academy history, compiling an extraordinary 199–35 record over 20 seasons at LCA. Across his distinguished career, he amassed 294 total wins, including 14 seasons coaching in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools.\n\nUnder Coach Rocco’s leadership, LCA football became a perennial powerhouse. His teams advanced to the postseason in 19 of his 20 seasons, capturing an impressive eight VISSA/VHSL state championships. Beyond wins and championships, Rocco’s impact extended to player development, with 85 of his athletes going on to play college football.\n\nPrior to joining Liberty Christian Academy, Rocco served as Offensive Coordinator at Liberty University from 2000 to 2004, establishing his influence on football in the region.\n\nIn 2024, Coach Rocco was diagnosed with cancer. While he has continued to lead with strength and determination, he has shared that his decision to retire is centered on prioritizing his health and spending meaningful time with his family, including his seven grandchildren.\n\nDr. Jeff Capps, LCA Head of Schools, expressed his gratitude for Coach Rocco, “We are thankful for Coach Rocco’s leadership in our football program and the investment that he made in the lives of our student athletes on and off the field to help them become better players and young men, and stronger in their faith.”",

    "fullText": "After beating Oregon 56–22 in the Peach Bowl semifinal, Curt Cignetti’s Indiana is set to face Miami in the National Title Game. But at this moment, instead of talking about preparation, Cignetti gives off a different vibe. It’s an interesting contrast, especially as Miami’s head coach has already signaled the team’s best version of preparation.\n\n“I’m not really thinking about the next game, I’m thinking about cracking open a beer,” said Cignetti after the win in the CFP semifinal.\n\nWhile Barstool Sports shared that clip of Cignetti saying this during an interview with an ESPN reporter, the head coach’s words suggest he may want a moment of refresh before the ultimate game. Otherwise, it could be a strategy to throw off the opponent’s preparation.\n\nWhatever the case, Miami’s Mario Cristobal is ready to give a tough fight, and after the Fiesta Bowl win, he made that clear publicly.\n\n“My f****** head is spinning. I’m ready to go watch the film. We should have scored 10 more points,” said Cristobal.\n\nIt clearly appears the Hurricanes’ coach wants to beat Indiana at any cost, so preparing early by studying film is the best way to identify flaws and ensure they aren’t repeated against the Hoosiers in the final game.\n\nWhile mindsets may differ with timing, both teams are desperately ready to make history by capturing the national title. That’s clearly visible in their dominance in recent bowl games. Still, only one team will bring it home, and that will be interesting to watch.\n\nThe post Curt Cignetti Goes Completely Opposite to Mario Cristobal After Peach Bowl Victory appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "The redshirt sophomore was projected to go second overall to the Jets in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Peach Bowl didn't help his stock.",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl was a clash between No. 5 Oregon and No. 1 Indiana. It was also a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 picks of Yahoo Sports' latest NFL mock draft.\n\nIn both cases, it's pretty safe to say who came out on top.\n\nIndiana reached the national title game with a 56-22 demolishing of the Ducks, taking a four-touchdown lead into halftime and coasting from there. Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the favorite to be the Las Vegas Raiders' first overall pick in a few months, was 17-for-20 for 177 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and 0 interceptions.\n\nAnd Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, the projected second pick? He was 24-for-39 with 285 passing yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 backbreaking turnovers. It's safe to say the performance didn't help the redshirt sophomore's draft stock.\n\nWhen asked about his draft decision after the game, Moore said he hadn't made a decision yet.\n\n“At the end of the day, I don’t know my decision yet.”\n\nDante Moore on his future ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/W1r22EaepO\n\n— FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) January 10, 2026\n\n\"I'm going to soak this moment up and, most importantly, give my hugs and thank yous to my teammates. But at the end of the day, I don't know my decision yet. I'm going to talk to coach Lanning and talk to my family and everybody, but at the end of the day I don't want to think about that right now.\"\n\nAs of now, Moore still looms as a candidate to go second overall to the New York Jets, but his performance on Friday laid bare some concerns around his game.\n\nAfter a rough freshman year at UCLA and a redshirt year under Dillon Gabriel last season, Moore had impressed all season with his arm strength, accuracy, athleticism and command of the Oregon offense. However, he was never pressured in the pocket like he was against Indiana, and the results were ugly.\n\n— Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) January 10, 2026\n\nOregon would surely welcome Moore back for a junior season and at only 20 years old, he still has plenty of time to get to the NFL. The decision is shaping up to be one of the biggest among all underclassmen in this year's draft cycle.\n\nAs for Mendoza, you can probably guess where he's going after a dream season in which he's led Indiana to a 15-0 record while winning the Heisman Trophy.",

    "fullText": "Trae Young reveals why he wanted to be traded to Wizards originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStar guard Trae Young raised some eyebrows when it was reported that his preferred trade destination was the Washington Wizards. Players don’t typically want to get traded to Washington. If anything, the opposite is usually the case.\n\nBut, Young wanted the Wizards, and he ultimately got his wish, as the Atlanta Hawks relocated him to Washington earlier this week.\n\nDuring his introductory press conference with the Wizards, Young explained what it was about Washington that was attractive to him.\n\n“I’m just super excited. For me, D.C. is overlooked as far as a big market. In the NBA, I feel like this is a big market,” Young said. “I just feel like I’m coming into an opportunity to be myself. I’m around people that obviously have known me for a long time and know the type of person I am and the type of winner I want to be.\n\n“And I know it's a day-by-day process. I know what it takes. It's not going to be easy. But I know this is a place that I'm excited about and I was excited about whenever I heard it could be a possibility.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen when Young when make his debut for the Wizards. He's dealing with a sprained knee and a quad bruise and hasn't appeared in a game since Dec. 27.\n\nWhen he does return, he’ll be sporting a different number. Young wore No. 11 during his time in Atlanta, but that number is retired in Washington, so he was forced to switch to No. 3.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how long Trae’s tenure in Washington will last. The four-time All-Star has a player option in his contract for next season, which he could turn down in favor of unrestricted free agency. Though, one would assume that the Wizards traded for Young with the intension of inking him to an extension.\n\nThe expectation around the league is that Young will indeed sign an extension with Washington, per ESPN, but it remains to be seen when that might happen.\n\nNBA legend blasts Hawks over Trae Young trade, labels them a 'mid' franchise\n\nLuka Doncic reacts to Trae Young trade to Washington Wizards\n\nCJ McCollum reacts to being traded to Atlanta Hawks for Trae Young",

    "description": "Lincoln boys basketball coach Neil Alexander is on the path to 1,000 victories, and he got one step closer Friday at Lanphier.",
    "fullText": "The first half of Lanphier’s boys basketball season may be filled with exasperation, but the Lions gave Lincoln everything the Railsplitters wanted.\n\nLincoln (14-3 overall, 5-1 in the Central State Eight Conference) pulled out a 35-31 win over Lanphier on Friday at Lober-Nika Gymnasium.\n\nLincoln coach Neil Alexander, who is approaching win No. 1,000 in his career, said there is no mystery why Lanphier gave Lincoln a tough, down-to-the-wire game.\n\n“It always is when Lanphier and Lincoln play,” Alexander said after picking up his 992nd career win. “It’s been a rivalry long before I was at Lincoln, and I’ve been there 35 years, so long before me and it always will be.\n\n“It’s fun. Both teams are very competitive, both teams play very good defense, and when you’ve got that, you’ve got the scoreboard reading what it does.”\n\nMore: ISU was right choice for Lincoln's Poole before run through FCS playoffs\n\nLanphier coach Blake Turner, himself a veteran of the game in his 14th season as the Lions’ head coach, doesn’t do moral victories. Lanphier, he says, should expect to win these types of games.\n\n“We’re not a disciplined team, we don’t play with that sense of urgency that Lanphier basketball fans are accustomed to, and it’s just frustrating at this point,” Turner said. “You want to try to grind them out.\n\n“We’re not into moral victories or (just) playing hard or playing teams close isn’t good enough and it’s not the standard for our program,” Turner said.\n\nKarson Komnick led Lincoln with 16 points while teammate Tate Aue had nine points, including one clutch 3-pointer from the volleyball line that gave Lincoln a 29-26 lead with 6 minutes, 22 seconds left. It was the first lead change since Lanphier’s Kaimen Smith put the Lions ahead 24-22 late in the third when he connected on a 3-pointer. After Aue made the shot, he let his Lanphier defender know.\n\nAlmost a minute later, Smith hit his third 3 and gave the nearest Lincoln player a verbal retort to the earlier exchange of words.\n\nThis time, the officials called a technical foul, and Lincoln took advantage of that to snap the 29-29 tie with four quick points from Komnick — two technical free throws and a layup off a backdoor cut — with 5 minutes, 15 seconds remaining.\n\n“We got more aggressive to the basket, we made things, and then we had the offensive rebound to tie it by (Komnick, tied it 24-24 15 seconds into the final period),” Alexander said. “Luckily we came out on top.”\n\nDemond Porter hit a transition layup with 45 seconds to get the Lions (5-11, 3-3 CS8) within 33-31. Brody Tungate split a pair of free throws and Camarie Richmond’s attempt at a game-tying 3 missed, went out of bounds with 6.0 seconds left. Komnick split his pair of free throws for the final tally and prevented a 3 from forcing overtime.\n\nMore: After nearly a quarter century away, Kevin Gordon happy back at Greenview\n\nKomnick said the Railers drew some motivation from the technical foul.\n\n“The two free throws helped us and after that, we just rolled and got the lead,” Komnick said, “(before Lanphier) came back a little bit.”\n\nLanphier held Lincoln to just two points in the third quarter as the Lions were able to regain the lead they lost early in the game. Richmond drained a floater to get Lanphier within 22-19, then had a pull-up jumper in transition on his next time down the floor.\n\nWith 2:37 left, Soriano Hayes was called for a charge about two minutes after Lanphier’s Anthony Peck tried to take a charge, but the officials sent Komnick to the free-throw line where he made the Railers’ lone points of the period. Turner was not happy with the Peck foul, but was especially perturbed with the one which went against Hayes.\n\n“I just we did a good job defensively, (but) I still wasn’t happy with the way we were running our offense; just undisciplined on offense, not getting the shots that we should get, not attacking the zone the way we wanted to attack.

    "description": "High school boys basketball: Top-ranked Timpview doubles-up Orem in dominant region win",
    "fullText": "Over the past four years, every time Orem and Timpview have tangled on the court — including two playoff games — it has been must-see action, with the past 10 meetings decided by an average of 6.5 points.\n\nFriday night’s first meeting of the season in a packed Orem gym had a similar pregame buzz, but at the end of the day, nationally-ranked Timpview was the only must-see team on the floor.\n\nTimpview shot over 72% from the field and pushed the game to a running clock late in the third quarter in a dominant 72-36 road win over the Tigers.\n\nTimpview, ranked No. 16 nationally by MaxPreps, improved to 13-1 on the season with the resounding victory. Its only loss has come against No. 14 Redondo Union, California, in a pre-Christmas tournament in Las Vegas.\n\nDefense was the catalyst for Timpview’s big win over Orem.\n\n“I thought defensively we were as good as we’ve been all year, just guarding team defense,” said Timpview coach Brad Kitchen.\n\n“I don’t know if Orem played their best game tonight. I have a lot of respect for what (Tigers coach) Jace (Tavita) does. His teams are always well-coached. If a couple baskets go their way, it’s a different game, and so I don’t take anything for granted.”\n\nWill Openshaw led the way for Timpview with 21 points on 9 of 11 shooting, with Dean Rueckert adding 18 points and Mason Ford chipping in 13.\n\nOpenshaw recorded back-to-back dunks late in the second quarter that helped Timpview race out to a 40-16 halftime lead.\n\nAs good as Timpview was in November and December, an argument could be made that its past two games have been the most impressive of the season.\n\nWith a veteran group led by eight seniors, Timpview had very high expectations about winning the championship in the top group at the Tarkanian Classic in Las Vegas before Christmas, but fatigue caught up with the T-Birds in the title game on Dec. 23 as it shot just 6 of 35 from 3-point range.\n\nA win would’ve surely pushed Timpview into the top 10 nationally. With the loss though, Kitchen was curious what type of focus his players return with after getting a week off during the Christmas break.\n\nEven more specifically, he wondered how his group would respond after he scheduled them for a Jan. 2 game against Juan Diego with just one practice since that Redondo Union loss.\n\n“I told our guys, ‘This is my fault. I did a bad job scheduling this game because that’s a trap game, right?,” said Kitchen, “and our guys responded with laser focus. We’re not going to let this be the slip-up, and I was really proud that there wasn’t that letdown.”\n\nTimpview won 80-43, with Rueckert leading the way with 27 points.\n\n“Our guys were really great at being diligent in their craft. They were all doing their conditioning over the break, staying in shape. This is a really mature group of dudes. I have eight seniors and they lead and they’re a great example for my young guys in this program,” said Kitchen.\n\nWith a full week off since that Juan Diego win, Timpview was chomping at the bit to get back after it — especially against an Orem team it lost to twice last season.\n\nAlready leading comfortably midway through the second quarter 21-12, Timpview blew the game wide open to close the first half as it scored on eight straight possessions over a four-minute stretch to push the lead to 40-14 with a 19-2 run.\n\nRueckert accounted for 11 of those 19 points, with Openshaw slamming down two emphatic dunks. Many of the buckets came in transition after great defensive stops at the other end.\n\n“We had a couple very individual stellar efforts, Lincoln Holcombe and Will Openshaw, really doing a great job and even (Rueckert),” said Kitchen.\n\n“Deano always gets all the accolades for how he scores the ball. Deano did an excellent job guarding Simeon (Suguturaga) who’s their leading scorer.\n\n“He’s a problem, and Deano did a great job, so I was just really proud of the way we guarded and that translated to being able to play in transition and how we want to play.”\n\nTimpview shot 71% in the first half in building the 40-16 lead.\n\nOrem, meanwhile, struggled against Timpview’s length defensively, shooting just 23%. A bunch of those misses came on contested shots at the rim.\n\nKitchen acknowledged that on a different day — perhaps in the rematch next month — those shots at the rim could easily go in and it could be an entirely different game.\n\nAt the end of the day though, Timpview’s first-year coach said Friday’s game exemplified everything the team has been building toward this season — even while acknowledging it’s one win and there are bigger goals.\n\n“We’re trying to play this team brand of basketball where we don’t care who gets the shot, we just care that we get a shot that is good, high quality, that we like, so that’s kind of our goal in all we’re doing, we’re just trying to get a little bit better every day,” said Kitchen.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to snap the school’s 15-year state title drought.",

    "fullText": "Indiana left no doubt Friday night, rolling No. 5 Oregon 56–22 in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl to move within one win of a national title.\n\nThe Hoosiers struck immediately when D’Angelo Ponds returned an interception for a touchdown on Oregon’s first offensive snap. Indiana scored touchdowns on five straight possessions, four before halftime, to build a 35–7 lead.\n\nHeisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza threw five touchdown passes, while Oregon quarterback Dante Moore struggled under pressure, committing three first-half turnovers despite passing for 285 yards and two scores. Indiana repeatedly turned short fields into points.\n\nThe 56 points were the most Oregon has allowed in 41 postseason games and the most since Washington scored 70 in 2016. As soon as the final whistle blew on the Hoosiers’ 56–22 College Football Playoff semifinal win, fans turned their attention to the next target: Miami.\n\nWith Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, one of the Hurricanes’ most iconic legends, looming as symbolic motivation, Indiana fans made it clear they believe the belt is coming north.\n\nIrvin has used the phrase “belt to a*s” and the accompanying motion as a declaration of dominance, particularly when speaking about Miami’s swagger and physicality. But after watching Indiana dismantle Oregon on a national stage, Hoosier fans warned Miami that the belt is changing hands.\n\n“Indiana gonna whoop Miami. They gonna take the belt from Michael Irvin,” one fan commented. “The Philly Special,” one said while referring to a video of a Hoosier fan absolutely demolishing a toy duck. “MIAMI IS NEXT,” another warned.\n\nIndiana didn’t just beat Oregon in the Peach Bowl; they humiliated a program that entered the College Football Playoff riding momentum and confidence. By the time the fourth quarter arrived, the outcome was long decided, and the Ducks were simply trying to survive the night.\n\nIndiana (15–0) advances to the College Football Playoff Championship Game, where it will face Miami (13–2) on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nOregon (13–2), meanwhile, heads into the offseason following another lopsided postseason loss. A year after a 41–21 Rose Bowl defeat to Ohio State, the Ducks saw their title hopes end again in emphatic fashion. Both of Oregon’s losses this season came against Indiana, each by double-digit margins, despite the Ducks recording the third 13-win season in program history.\n\nThe post “They Gonna Take the Belt From Michael Irvin”: Indiana Fans Warn Miami After Crushing Oregon in Semis appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Fernando Mendoza and the Hoosiers have once again laid waste to one of the best teams in college football. And only one remains.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA — The air horn at Mercedes-Benz Stadium blasted for the first time Friday night after just 11 seconds. It’s a distinct, piercing sound with a unique local story, ringing through the sky here after every touchdown.\n\nThis city began to sprout up from the ground nearly two centuries ago because it is where the Western & Atlantic railroad made its last stop. With a stake hammered into the ground, they originally called it Terminus — the end of the line.\n\nSince erecting this modern football palace nine years ago and adding the train horn to commemorate how it all began, nearly every great college football team has come through Atlanta on its way to a national title.\n\nBut none have embodied that sound quite like Indiana.\n\nSleek and efficient, powerful and unrelenting, the Indiana Hoosiers — yes, the Indiana Hoosiers — are barreling down the tracks like a locomotive running late for a date with destiny, blowing that horn as a warning to any creature in its path.\n\nHey, after 139 years of mostly bad Indiana football, what’s another 10 days to become the most mesmerizing national champion we’ve ever seen?\n\nPerhaps the Jan. 19 national championship game against Miami will become something other than a Hoosier coronation. But after Indiana’s tour de force through the College Football Playoff, including a savage 56-22 beatdown of Oregon here in the Peach Bowl, rarely have we encountered a college football team that looks and feels more inevitable than this one.\n\n“They’re complete,” Oregon coach Dan Lanning said. “They do a lot, and they do it really, really well. There’s not a weakness in their game. They run the ball well, they stop the run well, they throw the ball well, they defend the pass well, they've been good on special teams. They obviously have a ton of belief, and deservedly so. They’re really good.”\n\nOregon, it turned out, never really had a chance.\n\nWhen these two teams played in mid-October, with Indiana winning 30-20 on the road in Autzen Stadium, the game was competitive enough to make a dramatic rematch seem plausible.\n\nBut it took 11 seconds to realize Indiana football has subsequently evolved into something different. It is now a weapon sharpened for dissection, a machine built for humiliation, deployed with confidence and precision as its coach stalks the sideline with an eternal expression of annoyance.\n\nOn the first play from scrimmage, Indiana cornerback D’Angelo Ponds — one of the many players who followed coach Curt Cignetti from James Madison to Indiana two years ago — read the eyes of Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, jumped the route and snagged a pick-6 to trip that air horn for the first time.\n\nThen Indiana did it four more times before the first half concluded, each one chipping away at Oregon’s belief until it became a myth. By the time both teams went to the locker room with the Hoosiers leading 35-7, the only point of comparison for a CFP semifinal in this building was LSU’s 63-28 win over Oklahoma six years ago.\n\nSince that season, 2019 LSU has remained the gold standard for modern-era college football dominance, a team so ruthless in the way it attacked opponents that most realized after awhile they never had a chance in the first place.\n\nIndiana is one more performance like this from taking their crown.\n\n“A lot of people [who doubted us] really don't know our team,” Cignetti said. “They don't know what we're made of, what we got, and I get it. There was a lot of skepticism after last year that we were a fluke. That team did a lot of great things and got it all started. We’ve just built off our successes, and we've won some big games on the road, and it helps when you have a quarterback play his best football when the game's online in the fourth quarter. And so, you know, here we are.”\n\nPlayer for player, the Hurricanes will believe they’re the better team based on recruiting rankings, physical size and NFL Draft stock. But so did Oregon and Alabama, which lost to the Hoosiers by a combined 69 points in this playoff.\n\nWith Indiana, it’s not about the measurables. All season long, the Hoosiers have been a nuclear missile of execution and attitude, mocking anyone who dared not believe a program with a litany of laments and losing seasons could turn into this juggernaut practically overnight.\n\nIt was the seventh time against an FBS opponent this year Indiana has won by 30 or more points, and at every turn, they’ve thirsted for more. Beating Ohio State to become Big Ten champs for the first time since 1967? Not enough. A Rose Bowl romp over Alabama? They expected it long before we realized it was possible.\n\nEven when this game against Oregon was well in hand in the fourth quarter, Indiana kept delivering indignities. Only after one final 24-yard touchdown run by Kaelon Black, which drew the slightest smile from Cignetti’s lips with 5:14 to go, had Indiana’s appetite been satisfied. For a little while, anyway.\n\n“Our philosophy is to attack,” Cignetti said. “The reason we are where we are is because we prepared the right way, and that's why we've been able to meet the challenge and put it on the field.”\n\nAnd when the game finally ended, it looked like the most perfunctory of Indiana’s three big celebrations this postseason. This wasn’t like the relief of conquering the Big Ten or the sheer joy of reducing college football’s most iconic brand to a bystander in Pasadena. This was the moment before the moment, the one that seems poised to stamp Indiana as the greatest turnaround story maybe in the history of American sports.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any time to celebrate because this is what everybody dreams of,” Mendoza said.\n\nNow just one game remains as the Indiana train rolls through Atlanta, headed to Miami at maximum speed. To Terminus and beyond.",

Now that might be a clue as to what age/generation I am, because I’m not sure it’s the same now.\n\nWhether it’s the lack of giant killing, or the Champions League gaining traction (i.e. prize money) or the fact that half the Premier League could qualify for one of the European competitions, or we could simply blame Manchester United for just not bothering a quarter of a century ago – but the fact is, it’s just lost a bit of that magic.\n\nBut, after midweek it feels like the distraction of the FA Cup couldn’t have better timing for both clubs.\n\nOur midweek trip to Brentford was strange. The performance wasn’t that different from what we’ve seen in a few away fixtures recently, such as Brighton and Spurs. We stayed in the game and waited for our chance – something we’ve been good at taking advantage of, but on this occasion, we didn’t take the chance and collapsed in on ourselves afterwards.\n\nEverton probably thought they’d have a comfortable evening entertaining Premier League whipping boys Wolves, but the visitors claimed their seventh point of the season, and it could/should have been more after Everton went down to nine men in the later stages.\n\nIt was only four years ago when we were getting knocked out in the first round before the festive season by Mansfield Town and we haven’t had much luck in the FA Cup in recent years, having just got past the third round once in the last ten years, but this weekend a fifth of Premier League clubs will exit the competition and with the league table shaping up the way it is we’d all enjoy a good cup run.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 23/10 to win the game, while Everton are priced at 23/20, and the draw is 2/1.\n\n[Calvert-Lewin 39’, 52’, Niasse 83’]\n\nSunderland: Steele, Love, Jones, Kone, Matthews, Honeyman (Williams), Gibson, Ndong, Rodwell (McManaman), Gooch, Vaughan (Robson) Substitutes not used: Ruiter, Oviedo, Cattermole, Asoro\n\nEverton: Stekelenburg, Kenny, Holgate, Klaassen, Keane, Williams, Besic, Davies, Ramirez (Lookman), Calvert-Lewin (Niasse), Vlasic (Lennon) Substitutes not used: Robles, Martina, Gueye, Sigurdsson\n\nIf this was a few years ago I reckon it would have gone to a replay.",

    "description": "For the second year in a row, Oregon was blown out in the College Football Playoff when it fell to Indiana. Where do the Ducks go from here.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA — Oregon will chew on this one for 239 days, reliving a 56-22 blowout loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl again and again until its 2026 season kicks off against Boise State on Sept 5.\n\nIf only these new Hoosiers were still the same-old Hoosiers. If only. The Indiana program’s evolution into a Power Four devourer of worlds was the one hurdle in the Ducks’ path during a season that can split into two camps: on one side, two losses in two games against Hoosiers; on the other, 13 wins in as many tries against everyone else.\n\nOregon bulldozed No. 12 seed James Madison in the opening round of the College Football Playoff and then did the same to No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl. But Indiana presented a challenge Oregon couldn’t overcome. That no one else has conquered the Hoosiers doesn’t make this one any easier to swallow.\n\nPATH TO PLAYOFF: \n“I think it's probably too premature for me to speak on what happened tonight until I go back and really evaluate it,” said Oregon coach Dan Lanning. “I also think you can't discredit that we played well. We've played well at times even here in the postseason. Yeah, there will be an opportunity for reflection and evaluation, but I couldn't speak on that right now.”\n\nOn the heels of a second one-sided playoff loss to a Big Ten foe in as many years — the 2024 Ducks went unbeaten in the regular season and won the conference but suffered a 41-24 loss to Ohio State in the Rose Bowl that was over in the first half — Oregon can only wonder:\n\nHow did this happen? And what do we have to change to finally capture an elusive national title?\n\n“Man, you hurt for those guys because the world is going to judge everybody in that room based on the result tonight,” said Lanning. “They're not failures. These guys won a lot of damn ball games. They've had a lot of success. They've changed some peoples' lives, but right now, that moment is going to hurt.”\n\nThe first question is easy to answer. Indiana is unquestionably the better team, defying recruiting rankings that heavily favor Oregon. In every way and on nearly every play, the Hoosiers dictated the terms to the Ducks, just as they did earlier this month in a similar rout of No. 9 seed Alabama in the Rose Bowl.\n\nBut in addition to being more physical and more explosive on both sides of the ball, Indiana was unmoved by the high-pressure stakes that have come with each new achievement this team has unlocked during a breathtaking 2025 season.\n\nThe same can’t be said of Oregon. To suffer another meltdown on this stage raises significant concerns about the Ducks’ preparedness and mindset in neutral-site games against the best of the best.\n\n“Man, I feel like the gameplan we had was awesome,” said Oregon guard Dave Iuli. “I just feel like, you know, we went out there and didn’t execute our jobs. Usually, when it comes to critical moments like this with three teams left or four teams left, the biggest thing is executing. Once people stopped executing, we stopped winning.”\n\nQuarterback Dante Moore tossed a pick-six on the first play from scrimmage. He fumbled with 9:29 left in the second quarter to goose an Indiana touchdown drive that put the Hoosiers up 21-7. He fumbled again about seven minutes later to set up another touchdown, making it 35-7 at the half.\n\nWith lead running backs Noah Whittington and Jordon Davison unable to play due to injury, backups Dierre Hill Jr. and Jay Harris combined for 121 yards on 21 carries. But the Ducks ran for 93 yards on 3.6 yards per carry as a team, counting sacks, with 71 yards coming on a Hill run in the third quarter when they were down 35 points.\n\nOffensively, Oregon was wobbled early and remained off-balance the rest of the way, unable to regain its footing as Indiana pinned its ears back and threw the kitchen sink at Moore.\n\n“They have a great defense, great disguise and different looks, but you can't win football games if you're causing turnovers,” Moore said. “But overall, I mean, Indiana’s defense is great, defensive coordinator, but at the end of the day, we beat ourselves.”\n\nDefensively, a group that engulfed the Duke and the Red Raiders was helpless against Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza and a brilliant, steady-handed receiver corps headed by Elijah Sarrat (75 yards and two touchdowns), Omar Cooper Jr. (one score) and Charlie Becker (48 yards and two scores).\n\nWhile the Hoosiers had three sacks and 10 tackles for loss, Oregon’s defensive front barely sniffed Mendoza, who continued his Joe Burrow-like postseason run by hitting on 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards and five touchdowns. Through two playoff games, he has more touchdowns, eight, than incompletions, five.\n\nAnd while the Ducks committed three game-changing giveaways in the first half, Indiana continued to play nearly perfect football. The Hoosiers turned the ball over with a fumble on their 18th play from scrimmage in the season opener against Old Dominion but have not lost a fumble since.\n\nAdding insult to injury, an Oregon punt near its own goal line in the fourth quarter was blocked by Indiaan, which then scored on a short Mendoza pass to Sarratt for a third touchdown drive lasting fewer than 22 yards.\n\n“Yeah, it sucks right now,” said linebacker Bryce Boettcher. “I'm not going to lie. Not how I envisioned it whatsoever. Obviously prepared to win, and Indiana was a better team tonight. Doesn't take away from our season. We had one heck of a season.”\n\nIt's possible to look at this loss with a slightly optimistic slant: Oregon was minus-three in turnover margin and doomed its own chances against the No. 1-ranked team in the country. The loss hurts, sure, but the Ducks have still gone 26-3 since joining the Big Ten last season. There is no question this is an elite program.\n\nYet regular-season success is just not translating to the postseason. As the Ducks head into a crucial offseason defined by their ability to rebuild a roster set to be picked apart by graduation and early NFL draft entries, Lanning’s biggest charge will be assessing and fixing the flaws that have led to two humbling playoff losses in as many years.\n\nOne common thread has been a flat and sluggish start. The Buckeyes buried the Ducks by taking a 34-0 lead in the second quarter of last January’s Rose Bowl. Indiana led by 28 at the break. While the Ducks flopped out of the gate and never recovered, the Hoosiers resembled an unstoppable, merciless, Terminator-like machine that craves to not just beat their opponent but bury them.\n\nTo say the Ducks were simply outmanned by one eventual champion in Ohio State and a potentially historic squad in Indiana is way too tidy an explanation. That excuse works for the have-nots in the Big Ten and elsewhere, teams that expect to be body-slammed by the best of the best in the Power Four.\n\nThat’s not Oregon. The Ducks have higher aspirations; in fact, the program rightfully believes it can beat anyone, anywhere, under any conditions, after spending most of this century knocking on the door of the national title.\n\nBut it was one thing to reach the title game against Auburn in the Bowl Championship Series era and against Ohio State in the first year of the four-team playoff format. Winning the 12-team reboot requires much more: Teams need to be almost perfectly constructed and mentally unflappable to thrive against this gauntlet.\n\nAgain, that’s not Oregon, which is built to reach this point but not to advance. For a program that believes a title is part of its destiny, this loss should trigger a long offseason of soul-searching, with plenty of questions but no obvious answers.\n\n“I think every man can learn from adversity. I just told that whole locker room, right, this is going to be about how you respond in life,” said Lanning.\n\n“This is going to be a life lesson that a lot of people never get. We just got our butt kicked. Right? That's going to happen in life, right, and not just Dante. Every single person in the locker room, every coach, every person can learn, ‘Hey, how do you respond to that?’”\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Oregon after CFP blowout loss in Peach Bowl faces soul-searching",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSteph Curry and the Golden State Warriors took care of business on Friday night against the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe matchup was a cakewalk for Curry’s Warriors, as they issued the Kings their 30th loss of the year. It was done in blowout fashion, as Golden State won 137-103.\n\nAfter the game, Curry was asked about the Warriors-Kings “rivalry.” Clearly, the former MVP doesn’t see the battle as anything more than two California teams facing off.\n\n“Geographically, yes,” Curry said when asked if the Kings and the Warriors are rivals. “That's about it.”\n\nThe Warriors and the Kings have faced each 418 times in the history of their existence. The all-time record for the battle isn’t as lopsided as it would seem. The Warriors have 220 wins, while the Kings have 198.

Back in 2021-2022, the Warriors swept the Kings, and only allowed for one win out of four games in the following year.\n\nSince then, it’s been a split series throughout the regular season. The Warriors’ win on Friday night was their first over the Kings this year, as they lost to Sacramento on November 5.\n\nCurry checked in for 32 minutes. He shot 10-21 from the field, and knocked down six of his 12 shots from beyond the arc.

    "fullText": "When I decided to write about Enzo Le Fee earlier in the week, the intention was to laud him for his exceptional form and how he has bounced back after being left out for the Premier League opener against West Ham.\n\nHowever, this is football, and in a matter of days, our once-record signing has been receiving pelters (understandably) for his ridiculous Panenka attempt against Brentford.\n\nFootball is all about timing, and while there is arguably never a great time to take such a penalty, doing so while your team is 1-0 down away from home is ill-advised.\n\nNevertheless, I think it would be fair to forgive Le Fee and move on from his costly mistake, as he has plenty of credit in the bank for his displays this campaign.\n\nJust don’t do it again, Enzo, please.\n\nThere have been many moments in the last year that I have found hard to believe, and one of those was signing the former AS Roma man on a permanent deal.\n\nIt is almost a year to the day that we signed our midfield maestro on an initial loan with an obligation to buy, hinging on promotion.\n\nWhile I had not seen him play, there was sizeable hype about his ability, with those around me assuring me that Chelsea had been linked with his services, so therefore he must be elite.\n\nSure enough, they were spot on.\n\nIn terms of ability, it would be hard to find a more naturally gifted player to have graced the Championship. His close control and touch were up there with Adel Taraabt, Jack Grealish and Emi Buendia.\n\nGiven how ridiculous Enzo was in the second tier, the injury that thwarted his impact, and our woeful end-of-season form, I didn’t have much hope of promotion or, therefore, signing him permanently.\n\nHowever, 2025 was all about miracles for Sunderland, and after a couple of godly moments in the play-offs, Le Fee became our record signing at £19.3million before Habib Diarra took that mantle.\n\nWhen the deal went through, the 25-year-old and the bulk of Black Cats supporters would have assumed that his place in Regis Le Bris’ side was a formality, but then the transfer window and Noah Sadiki happened.\n\nIndeed, there were murmurings in pre-season that Sadiki looked like a generational talent and that the gaffer would bench Le Fee in favour of the DR Congo international.\n\nSure enough, those murmurings came to fruition, with Regis opting for Granit Xhaka, Diarra and Sadiki in a midfield three, with Chemsdine Talbi and Simon Adingra out wide.\n\nThat decision must have hurt Enzo, and while he could have sulked, instead, he has put his head down, adapted and reemerged stronger than ever.\n\nIronically, it was against the Bees in August when the former Lorient man made his mark in the Premier League, with his penalty and overall performance showcasing exactly what he is capable of.\n\nSince then, Le Fee’s overall statistics have been encouraging, too, as the midfielder has six goal contributions and ranks in the top 15 players in the division for chances created per 90, which is more than Bruno Guimaraes, Antoine Semenyo and Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nOf course, he has had the odd quiet game, but who hasn’t?\n\nOn his day, the 26-year-old has been majestic, whether it is picking out a key pass, making a run in behind or linking up with Brian Brobbey, he looks a natural in the top flight.\n\nNow, the little magician has endured his latest setback, and this one will require an even bigger reaction, but I’m confident that Enzo will come back fighting.",

    "description": "Everton Away, FA Cup Round 3 — how do our writers see this one going?",
    "fullText": "Score prediction: Everton 2 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mundle\n\nWho knows what sort of team we’re going to be putting out today, but it’s likely to have a few changes in there and quite rightly so. If the FA really want teams to take the competition seriously again there shouldn’t be any other fixtures the week before or after each round.\n\nSo, we are likely to see a few changes, and I suspect a narrow defeat. On the positive side of things, a few players will get some minutes in their legs, including Mundle, who I think will get our goal.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 1 Sunderland 1 (AET, SAFC win on pens)\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mayenda\n\nBrentford was a low day for all, but this team is highly likely to be a very different XI plus subs.\n\nI am hoping that as a wider squad we rotate and get a win on the board somehow, while allowing rest for those who need it. Any win against Moyes has to be a good one.\n\nMayenda has done well coming on wide on the right of late, but we know how much he loves a lung-busting and very physical run as the centre forward from his Championship performances.\n\nI am backing Eli to get us a goal in a tight game, which I think will go into extra time (not that either side needs that) and I hope we will nick it on pens, putting to bed the whole chapter about Le Fee and his attempt at a bit of flai,r which backfired as we all saw.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 0 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Traore\n\nEveryone has gone a bit crazy after the defeat mid-week. Yes, it was a poor penalty, but these things happen. It’s not so long ago Wilson Isidor missed two in one match. We’re tired after playing three games in six days, and this is likely going to be a rotated eleven.\n\nIt’s tough to predict games like this, as you have no idea who will play and how we will approach it. Similarly, you have to ask the same question of Everton, so who knows how it will ultimately unfold.\n\nI’ll go for us to win, as everyone generally expects us to throw the game, but we’ll go classic Sunderland and throw a spanner in the works by actually winning.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 0 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mayenda\n\nNew stadium, same Everton, who will be there for the taking. We’ll make changes, because half the squad has played enough minutes to last a lifetime, but there’s still enough spark in the side to nick something.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 0 Sunderland 1 (AET)\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mayenda\n\nThere will be some within the fanbase who will be hoping we go near full strength today, to try our luck at a nice little cup run. I think those fans will be disappointed. I see us rotating heavily today and resting those who have played so many games in so little time.\n\nWill Everton do the same? I suspect they will, for the same reasons as we. Two of those were enforced by red cards handed out against Wolves.\n\nI have absolutely no idea how this goes. I don’t think it will be a thriller by any means, though. Through hope more than belief, I’ll back us to win it after extra time and throw our name in the pot for the next round.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 2 Sunderland 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: N/A\n\nI’m so downhearted after Brentford that I cannot see us beating a depleted Everton squad with our very own depleted squad. Everton have been on such a bad run that they’ll view this as a way to turn their season around.\n\nWe’ll give it a good go, but I reckon Xhaka will be rested and we’ll be left without a real vibesman pulling the strings as good as the Granit. Sorry.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 0 Sunderland 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Mayenda\n\nAfter an awful trip to Brentford, hopefully we can put that aside and give nearly 8,000 travelling supporters a lot to cheer about.\n\nScore predictions in the cup feel like a complete lottery. I have no idea what type of team RLB intends to field. If ever there was a time to go full-strength in the cup, though, it’s now, as there’s no reason to focus on the league and survival as a priority over a good cup run at this point.\n\nUnfortunately, if we are looking at starting our best XI, the timing of this game is far from ideal, given how fatigued we’ve started to look after a gruelling festive schedule, coinciding with AFCON, which has forced us into deploying the same personnel for most of that period.\n\nRLB will have to strike the right balance of freshening things up and selecting the best team to progress. Hopefully Everton, with the suspensions of Keane and Grealish, find themselves in a similar boat to even things out.\n\nScore prediction: Everton 1 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Dan Neil\n\nWho the hell plays in this one? Do we think we’ve done enough in the league to go for a cup run?\n\nDo any of the lads who are coming back from AFCON get in the team? Can RLB squeeze anymore out of those tired limbs we saw on Wednesday night?\n\nAre Everton going to look to rest players, or are they up for the cup? Does Le Fee take the first penalty if it gets that far?..\n\nOne thing I do know, the lads will be backed by over 7000 passionate away fans, daring to dream of another trip to Wembley in May.\n\nWorth remembering also that after every defeat this season, we’ve won the next game (against Premier League opposition). So I look forward to seeing us in the big plastic bowl for the 4th round draw.\n\nThe less we say about the loss away to Brentford, the better.\n\nThe squad have done really well across the AFCON challenge period, but this was one game too many, with a tired squad and against a very in-form team.\n\nAdd in the penalty we didn’t convert, which Brobbey won at a time when momentum was really swinging in our favour, and it was all just too much across too short a period with too little resource to cope. That penna miss was a step too far for even us to come back from.\n\nWe draw a line, thank the lads for the 30 points we already have, and have a go at this cup game, getting the less-used lads some time on the grass, and welcome rest for those who need it.\n\nNot a lot of predictions lads shouted for a loss at the Gtech, so not many points for the lads from that miserable day in West London.\n\n“Happy Gary” did go for a loss, but not 3-0, so gets a point for that. Quite a few missed out on one point for FGS with the penalty not being converted by Enzo.\n\nThe man is a legend in the making. We all move on and take it on the chin for me.\n\nGary extends his lead to 2 points by being Mr Happy.\n\nRest of the table stays as is, so we move on to Cup action, and the chances of a first SAFC goal scorer point get even more challenging!\n\nJust a quick reminder of how we allocate points to our match-by-match predictions:\n\nCorrect outcome (but not correct score) = One point\n\nCorrect first Sunderland goalscorer = One point (no goalscorer is a valid call)\n\nPossible deductions for being lazy and not submitting on time = a two-point deduction.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter years of Chiefs dominance in the AFC, there’s a new heavyweight making waves.\n\nThe Broncos enjoyed a splendid 2025 campaign, besting all but three foes en route to an AFC West crown and the top seed in the AFC playoff bracket. Denver’s success largely stems from its harrowing defense, which surrendered fewer points than all but two teams. The Broncos boast a host of gifted talents across their rearguard, from reigning Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II to linebacking standouts Alex Singleton and Nik Bonitto.\n\nSean Payton’s side fancies itself a Super Bowl contender. Its record would seem to support that assessment, as the roster looks to improve on last year’s defeat in the wild-card round.\n\nWith that, here’s what you need to know about the Broncos’ playoff schedule, including who they face next in postseason play.\n\nSN's expert predictions for NFL playoffs, Super Bowl 60\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nIt's currently unclear who the Broncos will play when they begin their pilgrimage through postseason play in the divisional round. They'll be matched up against the lowest-seeded team still remaining after wild-card play. Who will that be? It's anyone's guess at the moment.\n\nAfter finishing with a 14-3 record and outgunning the Patriots via tiebreakers, Denver landed the top seed in the AFC. That gives Sean Payton's side home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, as well as a bye week during the wild-card round. While it's unknown exactly what day and time they'll play when the divisional round starts on Jan. 25, the Broncos' game will be available to watch on Fubo.\n\nFor a limited time, you can get your first month of Fubo for as low as $59.99, a $25 savings.

    "description": "We’re predicting four changes to the starting line up this afternoon…",
    "fullText": "Today’s game offers us a big chance to progress in the FA Cup, and I do think we should take the competition seriously this season. A decent draw or two could see us get to the latter stages, and who doesn’t love a cup run? Regis has players coming back from the AFCON plus some in need of a rest after a busy schedule, so who will we see in the starting XI today?\n\nRoefs should be in goal today. He’s our number one and if we’re taking things seriously he’ll be in the team. Although he’s played every league game he’s not going to be fatigued like outfield players, so there’s no reason to make a change here.\n\nDan Ballard still looked to be carrying an injury at Brentford, while Omar Alderete looked tired and completely off his game – he’s played a lot of football in recent weeks so could maybe be on the bench for this one. We won’t want to make wholesale changes, so I think Mukiele could be partnered by Geertruida in the centre of defence, with Trai Hume at right back and the returning Reinilido slotting back in at left back.\n\nIn midfield we hae the opportunity to give Chris Rigg a run out in his more favoured position, and I think we will see him partner Granit Xhaka in the middle of the part today – potentially Noah Sadiki will come on to replace Xhaka after an hour or so. Enzo will want to shake off the Brentford disappointment too, so will play in his usual role as well.\n\nBrian Brobbey has been excellent over recent weeks, but has been carrying a slight hamstring injury by all accounts, so we may take the opportunity to let him have a breather today. Mayenda’s been impressive over the past month and I think we’ll see him start up front. Traore’s back from AFCON and will likely resume his role on the right of the attack, while on the left Mundle could get the chance to get more minutes in his legs and stake his claim before Talbi and Diarra are back in contention. I really like Mundle but he’s looked off the pace since returning from injury – so this will be a good opportunity to really assess where he’s at.",

    "description": "A toothless Sunderland side failed to fire against Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool at the Stadium of Light",
    "fullText": "Simon Mignolet, Jordan Henderson and Fabio Borini all returned to Wearside to play at a windy Stadium of Light on this day in 2015. In particular, the presence of Borini in the Liverpool team was quite the surprise, given that he had barely had a look in despite opting against a much mooted return to Gus Poyet’s team after a successful loan spell the previous season.\n\nBorini’s decision against returning to Sunderland was a bitter pill to swallow for the fans as the team looked glaringly toothless up until this point in the season. Connor Wickham had been given the reins as the team’s main centre forward, but his inability to score consistently has resulted in the team having to grind out draws due to the limited attacking play that they can muster up.\n\nAfter Liverpool’s new signing Lazar Markovic gave them an eighth-minute lead, it became extremely difficult for the home side to threaten in any way in a first half that saw the team barely create any opportunity on the Liverpool goal.\n\nIn fact, the game could have been over at halftime had Phillipe Coutinho and Steven Gerrard not been slightly wayward with their shooting. Henderson was ruling the midfield on his return to his boyhood club, and his control and leadership were beginning to frustrate our midfield, who were struggling to get near him.\n\nLiam Bridcutt – one of Poyet’s purchases – was sent off for two yellow cards early into the second half after two bad tackles ensured he was going for an early shower. Inexplicably, we began to improve in his absence and actually created some (half) decent opportunities.\n\nMoreover, it was the increase in energy that actually saw the fans get behind the team \n\nWith minutes to go, the opportunity arrived when a shot from outside the box bounced off the inside corner of Mignolet’s post and went out. Despite their first-half dominance, Liverpool were almost punished for not getting a second, and after the game, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers did lament his side’s inability to close the game out despite having ‘real good control of the game’\n\nAs for Poyet, with the transfer window open, a striker had to be certainly top of his wishlist given the team’s lack of prolificacy during the season thus far. The manager admitted there’s nothing much he could say when boos began to ring around the Stadium of Light after another poor attacking performance.\n\nIn addition, the Uruguayan admitted his dismay at how the team looked better when playing with ten men in comparison to when the numbers were even on the bench.\n\nIncredible. When you are 11 v 11 and have a better chance, sometimes you are a little bit too relaxed because you think it is even. Then, when you find yourself down to 10 the players bring something extra. It is a shame that we didn’t do that in the first half.\n\n“We did practically nothing in the first half apart from wait for Liverpool to score. Then we had a go.\n\nThis was a bad year to be a Sunderland season ticket holder, given the number of insipid performances that the team were showing on the pitch. As it transpired, the signing of Jermain Defoe – a proven goalscorer – was a masterstroke as the veteran English striker came and scored vital goals that kept the team above relegation places as the season came to its climax.",

    "description": "Depth returns at the right moment as competition reshapes matches and raises standards",
    "fullText": "There was a period earlier this season where looking at the FC Barcelona bench felt like staring into an empty cupboard. With Raphinha, Dani Olmo, Pedri, and Fermín López all sidelined, Hansi Flick was essentially coaching with one hand tied behind his back. When the starting XI hit a wall, there was no Plan B. It was just a hope that the tired legs on the pitch could somehow find a second wind.\n\nThe contrast now is startling. Since that humbling night at Stamford Bridge, where Barcelona lost to Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League, the vibe around the squad has shifted. They have rediscovered that suffocating, high-intensity press we saw last season, but with a crucial difference: they can actually maintain it for 90 minutes. It isn’t just about a tactical masterclass from Flick. It is about having the personnel to keep the foot on the gas when the starters start to fade.\n\nNothing encapsulated this new reality better than the Supercopa semifinal against Athletic Club. It is a rare luxury to look at your substitutes and see Robert Lewandowski, Dani Olmo, Lamine Yamal, and Marcus Rashford all sitting in tracksuits. The standout, however, was Roony Bardghji. A goal and two assists in a 5-0 rout is one way to remind the manager you are here. It is no wonder Fichajes is already reporting that Liverpool are sniffing around.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting subplot in this rotation is Marcus Rashford. While his scoring touch has cooled since that hot streak in early November, his buy-in to the “Flick way” has been total. According to reports, the club is already preparing to make his stay in Catalonia permanent this summer. Flick can’t seem to stop praising the Englishman’s attitude, often calling him an “absolute professional.” The manager recently shared a snippet of a private conversation that tells you everything you need to know about the current locker room culture. When told he’d be starting on the bench, Rashford reportedly told Flick that it was only about the team and that winning was the only thing that mattered.\n\nWe saw it again in the league against Espanyol. Flick brought on Lewandowski, Pedri, and Olmo to actually change the rhythm of the game. And who scored when the match was 0-0? Well, Olmo and Lewandowski, who made it a 2-0 win.\n\nIt leaves Barcelona in an enviable, if difficult, position. Between Ferran Torres, Raphinha, and the heavyweights mentioned before, there’s always a “next man up.” For the first time in a long time, the competition for places at the Ciutat Esportiva is as fierce as the matches themselves.",

He was 4-of-6 from 3-point range, meaning he went a bizarre 4-of-19 on 2-pointers. 10 of those misses came inside the paint. He described it as a \"terrible day for me\" to reporters after the game.\n\nThe loss lowers the Lakers' record to 23-13, good for fifth in the Western Conference. They are now 8-8 since Dec. 1.

    "fullText": "Jordan Ott says Jalen Green will immediately join the starting lineup when fully healthy originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter returning from a hamstring injury earlier in the season, Jalen Green suddenly suffered another hamstring injury that has sidelined him since early November 2025. The injuries have limited his contributions in his first season with the Phoenix Suns, which is a shame because they are having a fantastic campaign.\n\nDuring his two games with the Suns so far, he was quite decent. Even when he was ramping up from the hamstring injury, he was showing promising flashes. He and Devin Booker seem like a fantastic backcourt, while Green and Dillon Brooks are now longtime teammates, dating back to their Houston Rockets days.\n\nGreen is a positive acquisition for the Suns. He was the central piece of the trade with Houston for Kevin Durant, but Brooks' breakout is also a welcome sight for the Suns. Now, they are firmly in the race for a postseason spot.\n\nGreen's return is a welcome sight for Phoenix, as he will provide a huge offensive boost to Ott's system. At the same time, the rotation will be deeper, something that Phoenix has been dealing with. Apart from Booker, they have needed a player to put pressure on defenders as a three-level scorer. Green is the right fit for that role.\n\nMore: NBA insider makes bold claim about Suns coach Jordan Ott\n\nCoach Ott is pleased to see Green progressing well in his recovery. He has been sidelined for a while, but he has been present for the Suns. The chemistry is good for the Suns, which could translate well when Green does return to the starting lineup soon.\n\n\"Jalen Green’s a really good player. He’s going to play as minutes, whatever minutes that is. He'll definitely be in the starting lineup as soon as he gets back and is ready to go. We gotta see exactly how that will turn out,\" Ott said ahead of Green's return.\n\nIt has been a frustrating season for Green because he was meant to showcase why he was the central piece in the trade for Durant. He has not gotten to show his ability outside of two limited games.\n\nNow that he is progressing well and Ott has shown his belief in Green, the future is bright for the Suns. The Milwaukee Bucks have shown some interest in scooping him up, but it is unlikely because the Suns would want to see what they have before deciding on that kind of move.\n\nDevin Booker ties Larry Bird with big accomplishment in Suns-Knicks\n\nSuns reportedly looking to trade veteran center\n\nTrade rumors: Bucks reach out to Suns for Jalen Green\n\nTrae Young reveals why he wanted to be traded to Wizards\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is the cornerstone of Jordi Fernandez's offense with the Nets",

(AP) — Toumani Camara scored 25 points and the Portland Trail Blazers extended their winning streak to a season-best five games with a 111-105 victory over the Houston Rockets on Friday night.\n\nShaedon Sharpe and Deni Avdija each added 20 points for Portland.\n\nKevin Durant had 30 points and 12 rebounds for the Rockets. He passed Wilt Chamberlain for seventh place on the NBA's career scoring list when he made a 3-pointer in the third quarter.\n\nDurant needed 15 points going into the game to eclipse Chamberlain, who scored 31,419 points. Durant’s jumper with 7:57 left in the third gave him 31,422.\n\nAvdija hit a 3 to pull the Blazers to 99-98 with 3:54 left, then made four straight free throws to give Portland a 102-99 lead with 2:43 remaining.\n\nAmen Thompson, who had 24 points and nine rebounds, dunked to make it 102-101.\n\nPortland stretched the lead to 107-103 on Sidy Cissoko's dunk and held off Houston the rest of the way.\n\nThe teams also met on Wednesday with Portland winning 103-102. Tari Eason's tip-in as time ran out for Houston did not beat the buzzer upon replay review.\n\nPortland has been resilient despite a number of key injuries. The team hasn't had starting forward Jerami Grant since Dec. 18 because of Achilles tendinitis. Jrue Holiday, out with a calf strain since mid-November, was upgraded to doubtful but did not play.\n\nAfter a tight first half in which neither team led by double figures, the Rockets took an 86-74 lead on Durant's 3-pointer in the third quarter.\n\nPortland rallied in the final period, closing to 94-91 on Duop Reath's 3-pointer. Camara dunked to get the Blazers closer, but Durant answered with a 3 to keep the Rockets in front 97-93 with 5:32 left.\n\nThe Rockets visit Sacramento on Sunday night.\n\nThe Trail Blazers host the New York Knicks on Sunday.\n\nAP NBA: https://www.apnews.com/NBA",

This is not an exhaustive list; see the official release notes for that.\n\nI provide links to the documentation (𝗗), proposals (𝗣), commits (𝗖𝗟), and authors (𝗔) for the features described. Check them out for motivation, usage, and implementation details. I also have dedicated guides (𝗚) for some of the features.\n\nError handling is often skipped to keep things simple. Don't do this in production ツ\n\nPreviously, you could only use the new built-in with types:\n\nNow you can also use it with expressions:\n\nIf the argument expr is an expression of type T, then new(expr) allocates a variable of type T, initializes it to the value of expr, and returns its address, a value of type *T.\n\nThis feature is especially helpful if you use pointer fields in a struct to represent optional values that you marshal to JSON or Protobuf:\n\nYou can use new with composite values:\n\nPassing nil is still not allowed:\n\n𝗗 spec •\n𝗣 45624 •\n𝗖𝗟 704935, 704737, 704955, 705157 •\n𝗔 Alan Donovan\n\nGeneric functions and types take types as parameters:\n\nWe can further restrict these type parameters by using type constraints:\n\nPreviously, type constraints could't directly or indirectly refer to type parameters:\n\nA typical use case is a generic type that supports operations with arguments or results of the same type as itself:\n\nNow we can create a generic container with Ordered values and use it with any type that implements Less:\n\nThis makes Go's generics a bit more expressive.\n\n𝗣 68162, 75883 •\n𝗖𝗟 711420, 711422 •\n𝗔 Robert Griesemer\n\nThe new errors.AsType function is a generic version of errors.As:\n\nIt's type-safe and easier to use:\n\nAsType is especially handy when checking for multiple types of errors. It makes the code shorter and keeps error variables scoped to their if blocks:\n\nAnother issue with As is that it uses reflection and can cause runtime panics if used incorrectly (like if you pass a non-pointer or a type that doesn't implement error):\n\nAsType doesn't cause a runtime panic; it gives a clear compile-time error instead:\n\nAsType doesn't use reflect, executes faster, and allocates less than As:\n\nSince AsType can handle everything that As does, it's a recommended drop-in replacement for new code.\n\n𝗗 errors.AsType •\n𝗣 51945 •\n𝗖𝗟 707235 •\n𝗔 Julien Cretel\n\nThe new garbage collector (first introduced as experimental in 1.25) is designed to make memory management more efficient on modern computers with many CPU cores.\n\nGo's traditional garbage collector algorithm operates on graph, treating objects as nodes and pointers as edges, without considering their physical location in memory. The scanner jumps between distant memory locations, causing frequent cache misses.\n\nAs a result, the CPU spends too much time waiting for data to arrive from memory. More than 35% of the time spent scanning memory is wasted just stalling while waiting for memory accesses. As computers get more CPU cores, this problem gets even worse.\n\nGreen Tea shifts the focus from being processor-centered to being memory-aware. Instead of scanning individual objects, it scans memory in contiguous 8 KiB blocks called spans. The algorithm focuses on small objects (up to 512 bytes) because they are the most common and hardest to scan efficiently.\n\nEach span is divided into equal slots based on its assigned size class, and it only contains objects of that size class. For example, if a span is assigned to the 32-byte size class, the whole block is split into 32-byte slots, and objects are placed directly into these slots, each starting at the beginning of its slot. Because of this fixed layout, the garbage collector can easily find an object's metadata using simple address arithmetic, without checking the size of each object it finds.\n\nWhen the algorithm finds an object that needs to be scanned, it marks the object's location in its span but doesn't scan it immediately. Instead, it waits until there are several objects in the same span that need scanning. Then, when the garbage collector processes that span, it scans multiple objects at once. This is much faster than going over the same area of memory multiple times.\n\nTo make better use of CPU cores, GC workers share the workload by stealing tasks from each other. Each worker has its own local queue of spans to scan, and if a worker is idle, it can grab tasks from the queues of other busy workers. This decentralized approach removes the need for a central global list, prevents delays, and reduces contention between CPU cores.\n\nGreen Tea uses vectorized CPU instructions (only on amd64 architectures) to process memory spans in bulk when there are enough objects.\n\nBenchmark results vary, but the Go team expects a 10–40% reduction in garbage collection overhead in real-world programs that rely heavily on the garbage collector. Plus, with vectorized implementation, an extra 10% reduction in GC overhead when running on CPUs like Intel Ice Lake or AMD Zen 4 and newer.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find any public benchmark results from the Go team for the latest version of Green Tea, and I wasn't able to create a good synthetic benchmark myself. So, no details this time :(\n\nThe new garbage collector is enabled by default. To use the old garbage collector, set GOEXPERIMENT=nogreenteagc at build time (this option is expected to be removed in Go 1.27).\n\nIn the Go runtime, a processor (often referred to as a P) is a resource required to run the code. For a thread (a machine or M) to execute a goroutine (G), it must first acquire a processor.\n\nProcessors move through different states. They can be _Prunning (executing code), _Pidle (waiting for work), or _Pgcstop (paused because of the garbage collection).\n\nPreviously, processors had a state called _Psyscall used when a goroutine is making a system or cgo call. Now, this state has been removed. Instead of using a separate processor state, the system now checks the status of the goroutine assigned to the processor to see if it's involved in a system call.\n\nThis reduces internal runtime overhead and simplifies code paths for cgo and syscalls. The Go release notes say -30% in cgo runtime overhead, and the commit mentions an 18% sec/op improvement:\n\nI decided to run the CgoCall benchmarks locally as well:\n\nEither way, both a 20% and a 30% improvement are pretty impressive.\n\nAnd here are the results from a local syscall benchmark:\n\n𝗖𝗟 646198 •\n𝗔 Michael Knyszek\n\nThe Go runtime now has specialized versions of its memory allocation function for small objects (from 1 to 512 bytes). It uses jump tables to quickly choose the right function for each size, instead of relying on a single general-purpose implementation.\n\nThe Go release notes say \"the compiler will now generate calls to size-specialized memory allocation routines\". But based on the code, that's not completely accurate: the compiler still emits calls to the general-purpose mallocgc function. Then, at runtime, mallocgc dispatches those calls to the new specialized allocation functions.\n\nThis change reduces the cost of small object memory allocations by up to 30%. The Go team expects the overall improvement to be ~1% in real allocation-heavy programs.\n\nI couldn't find any existing benchmarks, so I came up with my own. And indeed, running it on Go 1.25 compared to 1.26 shows a significant improvement:\n\nThe new implementation is enabled by default. You can disable it by setting GOEXPERIMENT=nosizespecializedmalloc at build time (this option is expected to be removed in Go 1.27).\n\n𝗖𝗟 665835 •\n𝗔 Michael Matloob\n\nThe new simd/archsimd package provides access to architecture-specific vectorized operations (SIMD — single instruction, multiple data). This is a low-level package that exposes hardware-specific functionality. It currently only supports amd64 platforms.\n\nBecause different CPU architectures have very different SIMD operations, it's hard to create a single portable API that works for all of them. So the Go team decided to start with a low-level, architecture-specific API first, giving \"power users\" immediate access to SIMD features on the most common server platform — amd64.\n\nThe package defines vector types as structs, like Int8x16 (a 128-bit SIMD vector with sixteen 8-bit integers) and Float64x8 (a 512-bit SIMD vector with eight 64-bit floats). These match the hardware's vector registers. The package supports vectors that are 128, 256, or 512 bits wide.\n\nMost operations are defined as methods on vector types. They usually map directly to hardware instructions with zero overhead.\n\nTo give you a taste, here's a custom function that uses SIMD instructions to add 32-bit float vectors:\n\nCommon operations in the archsimd package include:\n\nThe package uses only AVX instructions, not SSE.\n\nHere's a simple benchmark for adding two vectors (both the \"plain\" and SIMD versions use pre-allocated slices):\n\nThe package is experimental and can be enabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=simd at build time.\n\n𝗗 simd/archsimd •\n𝗣 73787 •\n𝗖𝗟 701915, 712880, 729900, 732020 •\n𝗔 Junyang Shao, Sean Liao, Tom Thorogood\n\nCryptographic protocols like WireGuard or TLS have a property called \"forward secrecy\". This means that even if an attacker gains access to long-term secrets (like a private key in TLS), they shouldn't be able to decrypt past communication sessions. To make this work, ephemeral keys (temporary keys used to negotiate the session) need to be erased from memory immediately after the handshake. If there's no reliable way to clear this memory, these keys could stay there indefinitely. An attacker who finds them later could re-derive the session key and decrypt past traffic, breaking forward secrecy.\n\nIn Go, the runtime manages memory, and it doesn't guarantee when or how memory is cleared. Sensitive data might remain in heap allocations or stack frames, potentially exposed in core dumps or through memory attacks. Developers often have to use unreliable \"hacks\" with reflection to try to zero out internal buffers in cryptographic libraries. Even so, some data might still stay in memory where the developer can't reach or control it.\n\nThe Go team's solution to this problem is the new runtime/secret package. It lets you run a function in secret mode. After the function finishes, it immediately erases (zeroes out) the registers and stack it used. Heap allocations made by the function are erased as soon as the garbage collector decides they are no longer reachable.\n\nThis helps make sure sensitive information doesn't stay in memory longer than needed, lowering the risk of attackers getting to it.\n\nHere's an example that shows how secret.Do might be used in a more or less realistic setting. Let's say you want to generate a session key while keeping the ephemeral private key and shared secret safe:\n\nHere, the ephemeral private key and the raw shared secret are effectively \"toxic waste\" — they are necessary to create the final session key, but dangerous to keep around.\n\nIf these values stay in the heap and an attacker later gets access to the application's memory (for example, via a core dump or a vulnerability like Heartbleed), they could use these intermediates to re-derive the session key and decrypt past conversations.\n\nThe current secret.Do implementation only supports Linux (amd64 and arm64). On unsupported platforms, Do invokes the function directly. Also, trying to start a goroutine within the function causes a panic (this will be fixed in Go 1.27).\n\nThe runtime/secret package is mainly for developers who work on cryptographic libraries. Most apps should use higher-level libraries that use secret.Do behind the scenes.\n\nThe package is experimental and can be enabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=runtimesecret at build time.\n\n𝗗 runtime/secret •\n𝗣 21865 •\n𝗖𝗟 704615 •\n𝗔 Daniel Morsing\n\nCurrent cryptographic APIs, like ecdsa.GenerateKey or rand.Prime, often accept an io.Reader as the source of random data:\n\nThese APIs don't commit to a specific way of using random bytes from the reader. Any change to underlying cryptographic algorithms can change the sequence or amount of bytes read. Because of this, if the application code (mistakenly) relies on a specific implementation in Go version X, it might fail or behave differently in version X+1.\n\nThe Go team chose a pretty bold solution to this problem. Now, most crypto APIs will just ignore the random io.Reader parameter and always use the system random source (crypto/internal/sysrand.Read).\n\nThe change applies to the following crypo subpackages:\n\ned25519.GenerateKey(rand) still uses the random reader if provided. But if rand is nil, it uses an internal secure source of random bytes instead of crypto/rand.Reader (which could be overridden).\n\nTo support deterministic testing, there's a new testing/cryptotest package with a single SetGlobalRandom function. It sets a global, deterministic cryptographic randomness source for the duration of the given test:\n\nSetGlobalRandom affects crypto/rand and all implicit sources of cryptographic randomness in the crypto/* packages:\n\nTo temporarily restore the old reader-respecting behavior, set GODEBUG=cryptocustomrand=1 (this option will be removed in a future release).\n\n𝗗 testing/cryptotest •\n𝗣 70942 •\n𝗖𝗟 724480 •\n𝗔 Filippo Valsorda, qiulaidongfeng\n\nThe new crypto/hpke package implements Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) as specified in RFC 9180.\n\nHPKE is a relatively new IETF standard for hybrid encryption. Traditional public-key encryption methods, like RSA, are slow and can only handle small amounts of data. HPKE improves on this by combining two types of encryption: it uses asymmetric cryptography (public/private keys) to safely create a shared secret, then uses fast symmetric encryption to protect the actual data. This lets you securely and quickly encrypt large files or messages, while still using the security benefits of public-key systems.\n\nThe \"asymmetric\" part of HPKE (called Key Encapsulation Mechanism or KEM) can use both traditional algorithms, such as those using elliptic curves, and new post-quantum algorithms, like ML-KEM. ML-KEM is designed to remain secure even against future quantum computers that could break traditional cryptography.\n\nI'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in cryptography, so here's an example I took straight from the Go standard library documentation. It uses ML-KEM-X25519 for asymmetric cryptography (traditional X25519 combined with ML-KEM), AES-256 for symmetric encryption, and SHA-256 as a key hash function:\n\nAs Filippo Valsorda (the cryptography engineer who maintains Go's crypto packages) says, HPKE is now the right way to do public key encryption.\n\n𝗗 crypto/hpke •\n𝗣 75300 •\n𝗔 Filippo Valsorda\n\nA leak occurs when one or more goroutines are indefinitely blocked on synchronization primitives like channels, while other goroutines continue running and the program as a whole keeps functioning. Here's a simple example:\n\nIf we call leak and don't read from the output channel, the inner leak goroutine will stay blocked trying to send to the channel for the rest of the program:\n\nUnlike deadlocks, leaks do not cause panics, so they are much harder to spot. Also, unlike data races, Go's tooling did not address them for a long time.\n\nThings started to change in Go 1.24 with the introduction of the synctest package. Not many people talk about it, but synctest is a great tool for catching leaks during testing.\n\nGo 1.26 adds a new experimental goroutineleak profile designed to report leaked goroutines in production. Here's how we can use it in the example above:\n\nAs you can see, we have a nice goroutine stack trace that shows exactly where the leak happens.\n\nThe goroutineleak profile finds leaks by using the garbage collector's marking phase to check which blocked goroutines are still connected to active code. It starts with runnable goroutines, marks all sync objects they can reach, and keeps adding any blocked goroutines waiting on those objects. When it can't add any more, any blocked goroutines left are waiting on resources that can't be reached — so they're considered leaked.\n\nFor even more details, see the paper by Saioc et al.\n\nIf you want to see how goroutineleak (and synctest) can catch typical leaks that often happen in production — check out my article on goroutine leaks.\n\nThe goroutineleak profile is experimental and can be enabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=goroutineleakprofile at build time. Enabling the experiment also makes the profile available as a net/http/pprof endpoint, /debug/pprof/goroutineleak.\n\nAccording to the authors, the implementation is already production-ready. It's only marked as experimental so they can get feedback on the API, especially about making it a new profile.\n\n𝗗 runtime/pprof •\n𝗚 Detecting leaks •\n𝗣 74609, 75280 •\n𝗖𝗟 688335 •\n𝗔 Vlad Saioc\n\nNew metrics in the runtime/metrics package give better insight into goroutine scheduling:\n\nPer-state goroutine metrics can be linked to common production issues. For example, an increasing waiting count can show a lock contention problem. A high not-in-go count means goroutines are stuck in syscalls or cgo. A growing runnable backlog suggests the CPUs can't keep up with demand.\n\nYou can read the new metric values using the regular metrics.Read function:\n\nThe per-state numbers (not-in-go + runnable + running + waiting) are not guaranteed to add up to the live goroutine count (/sched/goroutines:goroutines, available since Go 1.16).\n\nAll new metrics use uint64 counters.\n\n𝗗 runtime/metrics •\n𝗣 15490 •\n𝗖𝗟 690397, 690398, 690399 •\n𝗔 Michael Knyszek\n\nThe new Type.Fields and Type.Methods methods in the reflect package return iterators for a type's fields and methods:\n\nThe new methods Type.Ins and Type.Outs return iterators for the input and output parameters of a function type:\n\nThe new methods Value.Fields and Value.Methods return iterators for a value's fields and methods. Each iteration yields both the type information (StructField or Method) and the value:\n\nPreviously, you could get all this information by using a for-range loop with NumX methods (which is what iterators do internally):\n\nUsing an iterator is more concise.

So, if you change the slice right away, it will affect future reads:\n\nThe slice returned by Peek is only valid until the next call to a read or write method.\n\n𝗗 Buffer.Peek •\n𝗣 73794 •\n𝗖𝗟 674415 •\n𝗔 Ilia Choly\n\nAfter you start a process in Go, you can access its ID:\n\nInternally, the os.Process type uses a process handle instead of the PID (which is just an integer), if the operating system supports it. Specifically, in Linux it uses pidfd, which is a file descriptor that refers to a process. Using the handle instead of the PID makes sure that Process methods always work with the same OS process, and not a different process that just happens to have the same ID.\n\nPreviously, you couldn't access the process handle. Now you can, thanks to the new Process.WithHandle method:\n\nWithHandle calls a specified function and passes a process handle as an argument:\n\nThe handle is guaranteed to refer to the process until the callback function returns, even if the process has already terminated. That's why it's implemented as a callback instead of a Process.Handle field or method.\n\nWithHandle is only supported on Linux 5.4+ and Windows.

These prefixes are usually written in CIDR notation:\n\nIn Go, an IP prefix is represented by the netip.Prefix type.\n\nThe new Prefix.Compare method lets you compare two IP prefixes, making it easy to sort them without having to write your own comparison code:\n\nCompare orders two prefixes as follows:\n\nThis follows the same order as Python's netaddr.IPNetwork and the standard IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) convention.\n\n𝗗 Prefix.Compare •\n𝗣 61642 •\n𝗖𝗟 700355 •\n𝗔 database64128\n\nThe net package has top-level functions for connecting to an address using different networks (protocols) — DialTCP, DialUDP, DialIP, and DialUnix. They were made before context.Context was introduced, so they don't support cancellation:\n\nThere's also a net.Dialer type with a general-purpose DialContext method. It supports cancellation and can be used to connect to any of the known networks:\n\nHowever, DialContext a bit less efficient than network-specific functions like net.DialTCP — because of the extra overhead from address resolution and network type dispatching.\n\nSo, network-specific functions in the net package are more efficient, but they don't support cancellation. The Dialer type supports cancellation, but it's less efficient. The Go team decided to resolve this contradiction.\n\nThe new context-aware Dialer methods (DialTCP, DialUDP, DialIP, and DialUnix) combine the efficiency of the existing network-specific net functions with the cancellation capabilities of Dialer.DialContext:\n\nI wouldn't say that having three different ways to dial is very convenient, but that's the price of backward compatibility.\n\n𝗗 net.Dialer •\n𝗣 49097 •\n𝗖𝗟 490975 •\n𝗔 Michael Fraenkel\n\nThe default httptest.Server certificate already lists example.com in its DNSNames (a list of hostnames or domain names that the certificate is authorized to secure).

Because of this, some suggest switching code from fmt.Errorf to errors.New when formatting isn't needed.\n\nThe Go team disagrees. Here's a quote from Russ Cox:\n\nUsing fmt.Errorf(\"foo\") is completely fine, especially in a program where all the errors are constructed with fmt.Errorf. Having to mentally switch between two functions based on the argument is unnecessary noise.\n\nWith the new Go release, this debate should finally be settled. For unformatted strings, fmt.Errorf now allocates less and generally matches the allocations for errors.New.\n\nSpecifically, fmt.Errorf goes from 2 allocations to 0 allocations for a non-escaping error, and from 2 allocations to 1 allocation for an escaping error:\n\nThis matches the allocations for errors.New in both cases.\n\nThe difference in CPU cost is also much smaller now. Previously, it was ~64ns vs. ~21ns for fmt.Errorf vs. errors.New for escaping errors, now it's ~25ns vs. ~21ns.\n\nHere are the \"before and after\" benchmarks for the fmt.Errorf change. The non-escaping case is called local, and the escaping case is called sink. If there's just a plain error string, it's no-args. If the error includes formatting, it's int-arg.\n\nIf you're interested in the details, I highly recommend reading the CL — it's perfectly written.\n\n𝗗 fmt.Errorf •\n𝗖𝗟 708836 •\n𝗔 thepudds\n\nPreviously, io.ReadAll allocated a lot of intermediate memory as it grew its result slice to the size of the input data. Now, it uses intermediate slices of exponentially growing size, and then copies them into a final perfectly-sized slice at the end.\n\nThe new implementation is about twice as fast and uses roughly half the memory for a 65KiB input; it's even more efficient with larger inputs. Here are the geomean results comparing the old and new versions for different input sizes:\n\nSee the full benchmark results in the commit. Unfortunately, the author didn't provide the benchmark source code.\n\nEnsuring the final slice is minimally sized is also quite helpful. The slice might persist for a long time, and the unused capacity in a backing array (as in the old version) would just waste memory.\n\nAs with the fmt.Errorf optimization, I recommend reading the CL — it's very good.

Since its release, many projects have switched from third-party logging packages to use it. However, it was missing one key feature: the ability to send log records to multiple handlers, such as stdout or a log file.\n\nThe new MultiHandler type solves this problem. It implements the standard Handler interface and calls all the handlers you set up.\n\nFor example, we can create a log handler that writes to stdout:\n\nAnd another handler that writes to a file:\n\nFinally, combine them using a MultiHandler:\n\nI'm also printing the file contents here to show the results.\n\nWhen the MultiHandler receives a log record, it sends it to each enabled handler one by one.

They are important for debugging failures in remote environments (like CI), where developers can't step through the code manually.\n\nPreviously, the Go test framework and tools didn't support test artifacts. Now they do.\n\nThe new methods T.ArtifactDir, B.ArtifactDir, and F.ArtifactDir return a directory where you can write test output files:\n\nIf you use go test with -artifacts, this directory will be inside the output directory (specified by -outputdir, or the current directory by default):\n\nAs you can see, the first time ArtifactDir is called, it writes the directory location to the test log, which is quite handy.\n\nIf you don't use -artifacts, artifacts are stored in a temporary directory which is deleted after the test completes.\n\nEach test or subtest within each package has its own unique artifact directory. Subtest outputs are not stored inside the parent test's output directory — all artifact directories for a given package are created at the same level:\n\nThe artifact directory path normally looks like this:\n\nBut if this path can't be safely converted into a local file path (which, for some reason, always happens on my machine), the path will simply be:\n\n(which is what happens in the examples above)\n\nRepeated calls to ArtifactDir in the same test or subtest return the same directory.\n\n𝗗 T.ArtifactDir •\n𝗣 71287 •\n𝗖𝗟 696399 •\n𝗔 Damien Neil\n\nOver the years, the go fix command became a sad, neglected bag of rewrites for very ancient Go features. But now, it's making a comeback.\n\nThe new go fix is re-implemented using the Go analysis framework — the same one go vet uses.\n\nWhile go fix and go vet now use the same infrastructure, they have different purposes and use different sets of analyzers:\n\nFor example, here we only enable the forvar analyzer:\n\nAnd here, we enable all analyzers except omitzero:\n\nCurrently, there's no way to suppress specific analyzers for certain files or sections of code.\n\nTo give you a taste of go fix analyzers, here's one of them in action. It replaces loops with slices.Contains or slices.ContainsFunc:\n\nIf you're interested, check out the dedicated blog post for the full list of analyzers with examples.\n\n𝗗 cmd/fix •\n𝗚 go fix •\n𝗣 71859 •\n𝗔 Alan Donovan\n\nGo 1.26 is incredibly big — it's the largest release I've ever seen, and for good reason:\n\nYou might be wondering about the json/v2 package that was introduced as experimental in 1.25. It's still experimental and available with the GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 flag.\n\nP.S.

    "fullText": "Today we celebrate 15 years since Elixir’s first commit! To mark the occasion, we are glad to announce the first release candidate for Elixir v1.20, which performs type inference of all language constructs, with increasing precision.\n\nIn this blog post, we will break down exactly what this means, and what to expect in the short and medium term of the language evolution (roughly the next 15 months).\n\nIn 2022, we announced the effort to add set-theoretic types to Elixir. In June 2023, we published an award winning paper on Elixir’s type system design and said our work was transitioning from research to development.\n\nOur goal is to introduce a type system which is:\n\nsound - the types inferred and assigned by the type system align with the behaviour of the program\n\ngradual - Elixir’s type system includes the dynamic() type, which can be used when the type of a variable or expression is checked at runtime. In the absence of dynamic(), Elixir’s type system behaves as a static one\n\ndeveloper friendly - the types are described, implemented, and composed using basic set operations: unions, intersections, and negations (hence it is a set-theoretic type system)\n\nHowever, I want to emphasize what the gradual typing means in Elixir. Many gradual type systems have the any() type, which, from the point of view of the type system, often means “anything goes” and no type violations are reported.\n\nOn the other hand, Elixir’s gradual type is called dynamic() and it works as a range. For example, you can say dynamic(integer() or float()), which means the type is either integer() or float() at runtime. Then if you proceed to pass it to a function that expects a binary(), you will get a typing violation. This allows the type system to emit warnings even in the presence of dynamism. Even if you declare a type as dynamic() and then proceed to use as integer() and then binary(), a type violation is still reported. We have also developed new techniques that ensure our gradual typing is sound, without a need for additional runtime checks.\n\nThe type system was made possible thanks to a partnership between CNRS and Remote. The development work is currently sponsored by Fresha, and Tidewave.\n\nLet’s see how this is turning out in practice.\n\nElixir v1.17 was the first release to introduce set-theoretic types into the compiler. Elixir v1.18 added inference of patterns and return types. Therefore, if you wrote this code:\n\nElixir’s type system will infer the drive function expects a User struct as input and returns either {:ok, dynamic()} or {:error, :no_choice} or {:error, :not_allowed}. Therefore, the following code\n\nwill emit a warning stating that we are passing an invalid argument, both in your IDE and the shell:\n\nNow consider the expression below. We are expecting the User.drive/2 call to return :error, which cannot possibly be true:\n\nTherefore the code above would emit the following warning:\n\nHowever, Elixir v1.18 could only infer types from patterns. If you wrote this code:\n\nElixir would not infer anything about the function arguments. As of Elixir v1.20-rc, Elixir correctly infers the function to be %{..., age: integer()} -> binary(), which means it expects a map with at least the age field (the leading ... indicates other keys may be present) and it returns a binary().\n\nWhile a + b works with both integers and floats, because the rem (remainder) function works exclusively with integers, Elixir correctly infers that a and b must also both be integers. If you try calling the function above with a float, you will also get a type violation.\n\nIn a nutshell, we have been steadily increasing the amount of inference in Elixir programs. Our goal is to find typing violations in Elixir programs for free, without a need for developers to change existing code. And, in the last few days, we finally wrapped up the last missing piece.\n\nElixir v1.20-rc also performs inference of guards! Let’s see some examples:\n\nThe code above correctly infers x is a list and y is an integer.\n\nThe one above infers x is a binary or an integer, and y is a two element tuple with :ok as first element and a binary or integer as second.\n\nThe code above infers x is a map which has the :foo key, represented as %{..., foo: dynamic()}. Remember the leading ... indicates the map may have other keys.\n\nAnd the code above infers x does not have the :foo key (hence x.foo will raise a typing violation), which has the type: %{..., foo: not_set()}.\n\nYou can also have expressions that assert on the size of data structures:\n\nElixir will correctly track that the tuple has at most two elements, and therefore accessing elem(x, 3) will emit a typing violation. In other words, Elixir can look at complex guards, infer types, and use this information to find bugs in our code!\n\nAs we work on the type system, we have been carefully monitoring the compiler performance. And while we have been able to develop new techniques to keep everything running smoothly, the next weeks will dramatically ramp up the amount of type information flowing through the compiler, and therefore we need your feedback.\n\nThe next Elixir release is scheduled for May. We are shipping this release candidate earlier than usual for validation. We also plan to launch at least two additional release candidates with increased type checking.\n\nThe first release candidate is out right now, with type inference of all Elixir constructs. Please give it a try. However, at this stage, we expect some false positives: the type system will report warnings which are not actual violations. We will explain exactly why in the next paragraphs. So don’t change your programs yet. The most valuable feedback we want from you is performance! If everything compiles at roughly the same speed as before, then hooray!\n\nThe second release candidate will add type inference across clauses. Let’s see some examples. Take this code:\n\nToday, we know user in the first clause has the name field (and potentially other fields). We know that user in the second clause has first_name and last_name. The code above also implies that user in the second clause does not have the name field (after all, if it had the name field, the first clause would have matched). In other words, pattern matching order becomes a source of negative type information. In the first release candidate, the type system cannot infer this information yet, but it will be implemented in the following release candidate.\n\nBesides giving us more precise types, the above will also allow us to perform exhaustiveness checks as well as find redundant clauses (note we already warn for clauses that won’t ever match since Elixir v1.18).\n\nHowever, it is worth keeping in mind the work is a bit more complex than one might think. For example, take this code:\n\nCan we say the user in the second clause does not have the age field? No, we can’t, because the first clause only matches if age is greater than or equal to 21. So the second clause will still match users with a lower age. This means we must distinguish between “surely accepted clauses” and “potentially accepted clauses”.\n\nFinally, we will ship a third release candidate, which enables type inference for function calls across your dependencies. In the current release candidate, Elixir can infer types from function calls, but such inference only applies to modules from Elixir’s standard library. Take the following code:\n\nIn the code above, we will infer x is an integer(), but if instead you call MyInteger.to_string(x) from a dependency, we only perform type checking, we won’t infer the integer_to_string function expects an integer. Once implemented, this step will drastically increase the amount of types flowing through the compiler, hence we are dedicating a release candidate for it.\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering: when can we officially claim Elixir is statically typed?\n\nWhen we first announced the type system effort, we broke it into three distinct milestones:\n\nType inference of patterns and guards: this is our current milestone which has, since then, been extended to type inference of all language constructs\n\nIntroduction of typed structs, allowing struct types to propagate throughout the system, as we pattern match on structs throughout the codebase\n\nIntroduction of type signatures, including for parametric and protocol polymorphism\n\nAssuming all release candidates above go according to plan, we will officially conclude the first milestone as part of Elixir v1.20 and start working on the subsequent ones. However, there are still challenges ahead that may prove the type system to be impractical:\n\nErgonomics: all of our improvements so far have happened behind the scenes, without changes to the language. While this has been very valuable to validate the feasibility and performance of the type system, we still need to assess its impact on the developer experience\n\nPerformance: our current implementation does not yet support recursive and parametric types and those may also directly impact performance and make the type system unfeasible\n\nOur goal is to explore these problems and their solutions in the future Elixir v1.21 (Nov/2026) and v1.22 (May/2027) releases, by implementing these operations in the compiler and using it to internally type complex Elixir modules, such as the Enum module. So while we don’t have a precise date for when we will conclude these upcoming milestones, we will likely continue to see gradual improvements on every release for the next 15 months.\n\nThe first release candidate for Elixir v1.20 is out and includes type inference of all constructs. We will have multiple release candidates before the final release in May/2026, and your feedback is very important:\n\nEvery release will have a thread in the Elixir Forum for discussion.\n\nCheck our documentation to learn more about our overall work on set-theoretic types. This release also includes our official types cheatsheet.\n\nThe complete CHANGELOG for this release is on GitHub.",

    "description": "I was unhappy with the LLM-as-a-judge instruction fine-tuning results I got when comparing my various base models.  Could I make them any better?",
    "fullText": "I'm still working on my \"extra credit\" projects after finishing the main body of\nSebastian Raschka's book\n\"Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)\".\nLast time around, I trained four base models, using the GPT-2 architecture from\nthe book, on Lambda Labs machines. I was using two ways to compare them with each\nother, with three models that I'd trained locally, and with the original GPT-2 weights\nfrom OpenAI:\n\nHere were the results I got, sorted by the loss:\n\nNow, you'd expect there to be at least a loose correlation;\nthe lower the loss, the higher the IFT score. But, while we can see a difference\nbetween the OpenAI weights and our own, within our own there doesn't seem to be a\nlogical pattern.\n\nI think that the problem is that the results from the GPT-5.1\nLLM-as-a-judge are not consistent between models. That's not a complaint about\nthe code or its original design, of course -- it was originally written as part\nof the LLM book as a way of doing a quick test on an instruction fine-tuned model that\nwe'd spent the previous 238 pages writing -- just something that was a bit more efficient than\nreading hundreds of input/output pairs ourselves. It was never meant to be a tool\nto compare models in the way I'm using it now.\n\nIn this post I'll dig into why it doesn't work for this kind of thing, and see if that's something\nwe can change.\n\nLet's spec out the problem first. The instruction fine-tuning test trains our model\non the Alpaca dataset in order to\nlet it know how to follow instructions; that comprises a series of sequences like\nthis:\n\nIn the version I've settled on,\nI fine-tune on a training set of 85% of the samples, epoch by epoch, bailing out when the\nloss on a separate validation set of 5% of the samples starts rising. I then use the\nweights from the previous epoch -- that is, before validation loss started rising --\nto generate responses to the remaining 10% of the samples.\n\nOnce that's done, the script hits the OpenAI API, using GPT-5.1, default parameters for all\nof the options (eg. no explicit temperature) with queries like this:\n\nWe do that for every model-generated response in the test set, then take the\naverage of the scores and use that as our result.\n\nTo see why that's problematic, imagine this simple instruction with no separate input:\n\nOne response I've seen from my models was this:\n\nThat's obvious garbage, and should get a zero -- and GPT-5.1 consistently does that.\n\nAnother response, from OpenAI's original weights for their \"medium\" model (larger than\nthe ones I've been training), is this:\n\nThat's correct, so it deserves 100, or perhaps 95 due to being unnecessarily\nwordy (the answer \"Jane Austen\" is the suggested response in the dataset).\n\nOne of my models came up with that gem during an earlier eval. It's completely wrong,\nso it deserves a 0, right? And normally the GPT-5.1 model does that -- but sometimes\nit's a little more generous, and gives it a low, but non-zero score. When asked for\nits reason for that, it makes the logical point that while it's the wrong answer, at\nleast Sarah Palin is a real person. It's better than the \"the book wrote itself\"\ncomplete nonsense of the first response.\n\nThe problem is that the different runs against the different models are not consistent, as\nthey're all talking to GPT-5.1 separately. One model might find it in a harsh \"mood\",\nand get a lower rating than another model that found it at a more generous moment.\n\nI came to the conclusion that the best way to fix this is to do a \"batch\" -- that is, fine-tune\neach model on the Alpaca dataset that Raschka provides, and generate responses for\nthe test set and store them in a file. Then, once we've done that for all models,\nwe can score them all at once, prompting GPT-5.1 with something like this:\n\nThe theory is that doing it that way will mean that each individual query/response pair is graded consistently\nbetween models, even if there might still be inconsistencies between query/response pairs.\nThat hopefully means we'll get more consistent results and can compare the models\nbetter.\n\nRunning the first against each of our models, and then the second against all of the\noutput files, gives us this updated table (with links to the annotated JSON files\nin case anyone else wants to take a look):\n\n(Still sorted by loss so that you can compare it more easily with the one above.)\n\nThat's really interesting! The IFT score is still not correlated with the loss.\nBut there does appear to be a pattern.\n\nIt looks like we have three groups of models:\n\nI tried running the LLM-as-a-judge scoring script a few times, just to make sure\nthis wasn't some kind of random weirdness, but the pattern was always the same:\nthe OpenAI weights, the cloud FineWeb 8x A100 40 GiB, and the two local Local FineWeb-Edu\nmodels always got the best IFT scores, though sometimes they swapped positions (apart from the\nOpenAI medium model, which was of course always at the top). The other cloud\nFineWeb models and the local FineWeb one were consistently scored much lower.\n\nA hypothesis: there are two things that contribute to how good a model is at these\nIFT tests:\n\nOr to put it another way -- some of these models are smart but not knowledgeable, while\nothers are knowledgeable but not smart, and some are neither.\nI think that could explain what we're seeing here. While OpenAI never published\ntheir \"WebText\" dataset for GPT-2, the paper\ndescribes it as\n\na new web scrape which emphasizes\n document quality. To do this we only scraped web pages\n which have been curated/filtered by humans. Manually\n filtering a full web scrape would be exceptionally expensive\n so as a starting point, we scraped all outbound links from\n Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3\n karma.\n\nNow, the FineWeb dataset is quite similar, though I think it's a tad more curated than that.\nBut OpenAI trained\ntheir models for quite some time and did lots of tricks to get the loss as low as\npossible.\n\nonly the most \"educational\" data. Models trained on it, you might think, would\nknow more facts for a given amount of training.\n\nSo we can imagine the OpenAI models are smart but not knowledgeable, as we can our\ncloud FineWeb 8x A100 40 GiB model, which (I believe due to an accidentally-near-optimal batch\nsize) worked out well in terms of loss. They were trained on relatively sloppy datasets\nbut turned out reasonably well. Their intelligence makes up for some of their lack of\nknowledge.\n\nOur other cloud trains and the local FineWeb one are dumb and not\nknowledgeable; they were trained on the low-information FineWeb dataset, but they didn't\nwind up with a particularly amazing loss. So they get low scores.\n\nAnd finally, our local FineWeb-Edu models are still dumb, but they make up for it\n\nWell, it sounds plausible ;-) And I'd like to spend some time digging in to see if there's any indication\nif it's actually true. But after an afternoon of poking around the results, I can't really get\na handle on whether it is, or indeed how you'd test that hypothesis in any real\ndepth.\n\nTBH, I think this has zoomed so far past my \"no side quests\" limit that it's not even\nvisible in the rear view mirror, so it's probably best to shelve it as a\n\"cool idea, bro\" for now. Learning about how to run sensible evals, and how to work out\nwhat they're saying, will have to be a task for another day. I will keep on doing these\nIFT tests for future models, though, just out of interest.\n\nSo: let's get back to our regular scheduled LLM training. Next up, how do we\nupload our models to Hugging Face quickly and easily so that other people can\nplay with them.",

In a fireside chat hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) with President and CEO Dr. John J. Hamre, Huang continued outlining his layered view of AI, emphasizing the systems, capital, and breadth of applications that underpin the technology’s long-term impact.\n\nJeff Bezos Launched a Secretive AI Startup in 2025 That Should Give Wall Street Chills\n\nThe Top-Rated Dividend King to Buy for 2026\n\nEvercore Analysts Love UnitedHealth Stock for 2026. Should You Buy UNH Here?\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. \n\nBuilding on earlier discussion of energy, chips, and systems, Huang described the current infrastructure buildout of AI as being multi-layered. The first layer is simple: energy. Huang frames electricity buildout as the most fundamental part of the entire AI revolution.\n\nThe next is Nvidia itself: Chips. Without chips, there’s nothing to use electricity and process the AI compute needed to run the AI models.\n\nHuang then highlights the third layer, which “includes financial services, because it takes an enormous amount of capital to do what we do.” His remarks highlight that AI development at scale is not only a technical challenge, but also a financial one, requiring sustained investment in data centers, networking, and long-lived computing assets.\n\nHuang then turned to the fourth layer that receives the most public attention: the models themselves. He acknowledged the prominence of well-known systems, describing how “this is where people largely focus on when they talk about AI,” citing examples such as ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok. However, he placed those systems in a much wider context, pointing out that “those are four of the one and a half million AI models in the world.” The statement reframes popular generative models as an incredibly small subset of a far larger and more diverse ecosystem. This statement diversifies the risk away from the larger, more broadly known AI models, and instead frames Nvidia as an infrastructure play amongst a technological revolution being implemented across every industry in the world.",

    "fullText": "A 20-year-old Canadian lit up social media after she won the lottery in the summer of 2025 and (gasp!) chose to accept her winnings in an annuity rather than a lump sum.\n\nInstead of taking a tax-free lump sum of $1 million (Canadian lottery wins aren't taxed like U.S. jackpots), Brenda Aubin-Vega, of Quebec, chose to receive $1,000 a week for life. Her decision contrasts with what the vast majority of lottery winners choose and drew criticism. Everyone seemed to have an opinion, even Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.\n\nThe fierce debate highlights, once again, the age-old question of whether lottery winners should take the lump sum or an annuity and how even to make that decision.\n\n“The reason most take the lump sum is because if you take the annuity and get hit by a bus, they feel like it’s over,” said Dan White, founder and CEO of Daniel A. White & Associates in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore deciding how to receive your prize, winners should understand what the two options are.\n\nLump sum is a one-time cash payment, usually the cash value of the jackpot. The cash value is the amount of money required to be in the jackpot prize pool, on the day of the drawing, to fund the estimated jackpot annuity prize.\n\nAnnuity is a regular stream of payments over time, either for a certain number of years or for life. Mega Millions and Powerball, the two largest U.S. lotteries, pay the annuity with an annual payment over 30 years that increases each year by 5%.\n\nIf the winner gets hit by a bus, it’s true the winner may have only enjoyed a fraction of the winnings. However, the winner can leave the missed annuity payments to heirs.\n\nAt any time, the winner or the heirs can sell remaining annuity payments if they want to receive a lump sum instead of the annuity.\n\nA 2011 study of the Powerball lottery from 2003 to 2009 showed more than 93% of jackpot winners took the lump sum.\n\nMany people on social media believe the lump sum is always better because they can invest the money and grow it more quickly than the annuity would grow. After all, the broad S&P 500's average annual return is about 10%, including dividends.\n\n“She will be better off to accept $1m today,” wrote Binance's Zhao in a social media post. But instead of stocks, he suggested she should invest the money in bitcoin and end up spending “$1k each week for the rest of her life, with millions left over.”\n\nBut that strategy can be riskier than taking the automatic annual increase in lottery annuity payments, some advisers noted. The stock market can post losses for multiple years at a time.",

    "fullText": "Mark Epstein continues to make claims that his brother, Jeffrey Epstein, was murdered\n\nMark said on Friday, Jan. 9, that \"more autopsy facts\" will be released in the coming weeks and \"prove\" his allegations\n\nJeffrey died of “suicide by hanging” in a cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in August 2019\n\nMark Epstein continues to claim that there's evidence that will prove his brother Jeffrey Epstein was murdered.\n\nJeffrey, a convicted sex trafficker, died of suicide by hanging on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, as he awaited trial on numerous sex trafficking charges. Mark was the one to identify the body.\n\nAs speculation about the circumstances of Jeffrey's death began, Mark hired former NYC chief medical examiner, Dr. Michael Baden, who said the “evidence points to homicide rather than suicide.”\n\nYears later, in June 2023, the FBI and the Department of Justice said there was no credible evidence of foul play in his death, according to a DOJ report.\n\nDespite the findings, Mark has continued to voice his skepticism of the official findings, telling NBC News in July 2025, “More and more, I believe he was murdered.\" \"And everyone who looks at all the information that’s out there on facts comes to the same conclusion,\" Mark added.\n\nMark reiterated his beliefs in an appearance on News Nation Now on Friday, Jan. 9, alleging again that Jeffrey was murdered, and that \"more autopsy facts will be coming out in February that prove it.”\n\nHe told the outlet that when he saw Jeffrey’s body, the injuries “didn’t correspond to the way his body was found hanging.”\n\nMark continued, “There are only three ways to die in prison,” before adding, “Suicide, natural causes or murder.”\n\n“And Jeff was murdered. I want to know who killed him and on whose behalf?”\n\nMark also said that he believes the previous investigations and the subsequent findings are a “cover-up.” “Why the charade?\" he asked. \"Who are they trying to protect?”\n\nMeanwhile, Mark rejects Jeffrey’s longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell's August 2025 comments that she didn't “see” the murder of Jeffrey happening, although she acknowledged that it is \"of course\" possible.\n\n\"But I don't know of any reason why, and I don't believe in the blackmail or in any of this, I don't think Epstein had a hit on like that,\" she continued. \"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation.\"\n\nIn Friday's interview with News Nation Now, Mark said that he \"wouldn't trust anything\" Maxwell says, adding that she \"never saw the body or talked to Jeff before he died.\"\n\nBefore Mark spoke with NewsNation on Jan. 9, he claimed in a Nov. 18 phone interview with the outlet that an unnamed source told him that names of conservative politicians were being axed from the Epstein files to prevent Republicans from getting incriminated.\n\nDays later, on Nov. 20, he claimed on CNN’s Erin Burnett OutFront that President Donald Trump purposefully delayed the release of the Epstein files.\n\nMark also alleged that his brother had information on Trump when he was running for his first term in office in 2016, claiming that it was incriminating enough to “cancel the election.”\n\n\"He didn't tell me what he knew,\" Mark told the outlet, \"but Jeffrey definitely had dirt on Trump.\"\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nIf you or someone you know has been a victim of sexual abuse, text \"STRENGTH\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected to a certified crisis counselor.",

    "fullText": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pakistan is in the final phases of striking a $1.5-billion deal to supply weapons and jets to Sudan, a former top air force official and three sources said, promising a major boost for Sudan's army, battling the paramilitary Rapid ​Support Forces.\n\nTheir conflict has stoked the world's worst humanitarian crisis for more than 2-1/2 years, drawing in myriad foreign interests, and threatening to fragment the ‌strategic Red Sea country, a major gold producer.\n\nThe deal with Pakistan encompasses 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones for scouting and kamikaze attacks, and advanced air defence systems, said two of ‌the three sources with knowledge of the matter, who all sought anonymity.\n\nIt was a \"done deal\", said Aamir Masood, a retired Pakistani air marshal who continues to be briefed on air force matters.\n\nBesides the Karakoram-8 jets, it includes Super Mushshak training aircraft, and perhaps some coveted JF-17 fighters developed jointly with China and produced in Pakistan, he added, without giving figures or a delivery schedule.\n\nPakistan's military and its defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA spokesman for Sudan’s army did not immediately respond to a ⁠message requesting comment.\n\nAssistance from Pakistan, especially drones and jets, could ‌help Sudan's army regain the air supremacy it had towards the start of its war with the RSF, which has increasingly used drones to gain territory, eroding the army's position.\n\nSudan's army accuses the RSF of being supplied by the United Arab Emirates, which ‍has denied supplying weapons.\n\nThe sources did not say how the deal was being funded but Masood said it was possible the finances would come from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia may favour and support all the favourable regimes in Gulf for procurement of Pakistani military equipment and training,\" he said.\n\nOne of the sources said the Saudis brokered the deal but added there ​was no indication they were paying for the weapons. Another source said Saudi was not providing funds.\n\nMasood said the weapons for Sudan could be included in such an agreement, without confirming discussions with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEgypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are part of the U.S.-led quad grouping of nations that has tried to push Sudan's army and the RSF towards peace talks.\n\nOn recent visits, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan requested Saudi assistance in the war, according to Sudanese and Egyptian sources.\n\nRiyadh and Abu Dhabi are embroiled in a major feud sparked by recent events in Yemen.\n\nThe two most powerful countries in the Gulf ⁠have sharp differences on a range of volatile Middle East issues, from geopolitics to oil ​output.\n\nTheir difference burst into the open with an advance of UAE-backed southern Yemeni separatists in early December ​that brought them into conflict with Saudi-backed forces.\n\nThe deal is another feather in the cap for Pakistan's growing defence sector, which has drawn growing interest and investment, particularly since its jets were deployed in a conflict with India last year.\n\nLast month, Islamabad struck ‍a weapons deal worth more than $4 billion ⁠with the Libyan National Army, officials said, for one of the South Asian nation's largest arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.\n\nPakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on a defence deal that could includes the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, as ties improve ties with Dhaka.\n\nThe ⁠government sees Pakistan's burgeoning industry as a catalyst to secure long-term economic stability.\n\nPakistan is now in a $7-billion IMF programme, following a short-term deal to avert a sovereign default in 2023. It won IMF ‌support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.",

    "description": "The AI investment realm is full of great opportunities in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Nebius and Applied Digital are both data center plays.\n\nSoundHound AI could see monster adoption over the next few years.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Nebius Group ›\n\nWith artificial intelligence (AI) usage skyrocketing, this sector of the market is a great place to look for stocks that could double in under a year. Many AI companies are generating explosive growth, and these are the ones to take a look at.\n\nThree, in particular, have a chance to double in value in 2026: Nebius (NASDAQ: NBIS), Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD), and SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). All three are growing at a rapid pace and could provide investors with a potential doubling of returns in 2026.\n\nNebius and Applied Digital operate in similar industries. Nebius was spun out of Russian-based Yandex after sanctions from the Ukraine war devastated the business, including the non-Russian parts. Nebius is focused on providing computing power to its various clients by renting out space in a data center and placing cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) in them. It also owns some of the locations it operates in.\n\nDemand for computing power has been unprecedented, and Nebius told investors that it has \"sold out\" all of its available capacity. As it expands capacity, it expects to have a $7 billion to $9 billion annual run rate (ARR) by the end of 2026. For comparison, its ARR at the end of Q3 was $551 million. That's explosive growth for a relatively small business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock double in 2026 as a result.\n\nApplied Digital builds and operates data centers and has two facilities in North Dakota that it operates. It is working on increasing computing capacity at these two facilities, and is a key CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) partner. It has signed 15-year leases for many of its data centers, which gives investors a long-term look into what Applied Digital's future looks like.\n\nIn the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, ended Aug. 31, its revenue rose about 84% year over year. As more computing capacity comes online, its revenue will jump, which could lead to outsize stock performance.\n\nLast is SoundHound AI. SoundHound AI blends generative AI and audio recognition to create a software platform that can be deployed in many applications. This is a key company to watch in 2026, as there could be a huge growth explosion if widespread adoption occurs. Several industries can be streamlined by deploying generative AI agents, such as customer service reps.\n\nIn its latest quarter, SoundHound AI's revenue jumped 68% year over year, and it raised the full-year outlook. We'll see if SoundHound AI's product gains momentum in 2026. But it could be a great year for the company and the stock.",

    "fullText": "Russia said Friday it used its latest missile against Ukraine for a second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, a forceful signal to Kyiv and its Western allies as U.S.-led peace talks have entered a new and crucial stage.\n\nThe hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile hit Ukraine's western Lviv region late Thursday night, although officials there did not mention any casualties. The area is near a military base in neighboring Poland, a NATO member, that serves as a key hub for ferrying Western military supplies to Kyiv.\n\nSome Moscow commentators said the attack was a warning to European leaders against proposals to deploy their troops to Ukraine as part of a prospective peace deal. Russia has said it won't accept such a deployment and would view those forces as legitimate targets.\n\nA look at the weapon and why Russia used it now:\n\nWhat’s known about the Oreshnik\n\nRussia first used the multiple-warhead Oreshnik on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the Oreshnik, which means “hazelnut tree” in Russian, streaks at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and was immune to any missile defense system.\n\nHe said the weapon is so powerful that several such missiles -- even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. He said it’s capable of destroying underground bunkers “three, four or more floors down.”\n\nThe Russian military said the Oreshnik can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and can reach any European target.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Ukraine’s military said the missile had six independently targetable warheads, each carrying six submunitions.\n\nRussian military bloggers said the submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives.\n\nSince the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has used swarms of cheap slow-flying drones and an assortment of other missiles, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said last month the Oreshnik had been deployed to Belarus and entered active service. It didn't specify how many missiles were sent to the key ally of Moscow and whether they were fitted with nuclear warheads, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that up to 10 Oreshnik systems will be stationed there.\n\nRussia previously has stationed tactical nuclear weapons inside Belarus, whose territory it used to launch the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, Putin released a revised nuclear doctrine that placed Belarus under Russia's atomic umbrella. The document significantly lowered the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons, declaring that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on the country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons.\n\nUnlike Russia's other shorter-range conventional weapons, the Oreshnik is able to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether the missile is carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.\n\nRussia's message by using the Oreshnik\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Putin described it as a response to Ukraine's Western allies allowing it to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nIts latest strike comes as the U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage and appears to underline Putin’s intention to negotiate from a position of strength as his troops make slow but steady territorial gains.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers noted that the strike in Lviv, not far from the Polish border, was a message intended for Kyiv’s allies. Those members of the “coalition of the willing” have proposed sending their troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees once a peace deal is reached.\n\nRussia has said it won't accept any European forces in Ukraine, seeing them as legitimate targets.\n\n“For the first time, NATO command has been shown a strategic weapons strike virtually on its border,” said military expert Valery Shiryayev. “This action is intended to demonstrate the determination of Russia’s military and political leadership to use such weapons with nuclear warheads if necessary.”\n\nThe attack comes less than a week after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. action as an act of aggression and sharply criticized Wednesday’s U.S. seizure of a Russia-flagged tanker.",

    "description": "In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that he would impose a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has taken another shot at big business, targeting banks this time.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said on Truth Social that he would call for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" he added. \"Coincidentally, the January 20th date will coincide with the one year anniversary of the historic and very successful Trump Administration.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The president cannot unilaterally impose such a cap; it would require an act of Congress. Similar efforts that have been advanced in Congress have yet to become law.\n\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, representatives for Chase and Citi pointed to a joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America. The statement said that the trade organizations \"share the President's goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit.\"\n\n\"At the same time, evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help,\" the joint statement read. \"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.\"\n\nTrump's announcement came hours after Sen. Bernie Sanders posted a jab against the president on X for not yet having introduced a proposal to cap credit card interest — a pledge Trump made during his 2024 reelection campaign.\n\n\"Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and stop Wall Street from getting away with murder. Instead, he deregulated big banks charging up to 30% interest on credit cards,\" Sanders wrote. \"The result? Last year, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon made $770 million. Unacceptable.\"\n\nIn the first few months of his second term, the Trump administration slashed funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency responsible for protecting consumers by ensuring that financial markets are fair and competitive.\n\nTrump's announcement, made on Truth Social, is the latest in a series of swipes at big business the president has made this week.\n\nEarlier this week, he said that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, aiming to lower interest rates and monthly payments. He also said he was barring \"large institutional investors\" from buying up single-family homes and signed an executive order that would limit defense contractors' corporate spending.",

He’s 6-foot-3, 200 pounds and has a 6-foot-11 wingspan. So yeah, this is a big, athletic kid that if he gets the right coaching and development, could be a really good player at corner or one of the safety spots. For now though, he’ll likely be a special teamer who is a depth piece as the Nittany Lions build out some depth in the back end of the defense.",

    "fullText": "Former Oklahoma State quarterback Zane Flores has committed to Iowa State, via the NCAA Transfer Portal, per On3’s Pete Nakos. Flores spent three seasons with the Cowboys.\n\nFlores began the 2025 campaign as Oklahoma State’s backup QB, but took over starting responsibilities in Week 2 after Hauss Hejny suffered an injury in the season-opener. Flores made nine appearances this past season.\n\nHe completed 59.8% of his pass attempts for 1,490 yards and three touchdowns, while throwing seven interceptions. Additionally, Flores recorded 117 yards and two scores in the ground game.\n\nZane Flores played high school football at Gretna (NE), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 467 overall player and No. 29 QB in the 2023 recruiting cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Rankings.\n\nFlores is the 33rd player who has committed to Iowa State this offseason via the NCAA Transfer Portal. At the time of his commitment to the Cyclones, Flores was the No. 97 QB in On3’s 2026 Transfer Portal Player Rankings.\n\nIowa State is entering a new after longtime head coach Matt Campbell left the program to take over at Penn State. Campbell had been the head coach at Iowa State since 2016. In his 10 seasons at the helm of the program, he amassed a 72-55 overall record and a 50-40 mark in conference play.\n\nIn response to Campbell’s decision, Iowa State hired Jimmy Rogers to be its next head coach. Rogers was Washington State‘s HC in the 2025 campaign. He led the Cougars to a 6-6 overall record.\n\nPrior to his time at the helm of WSU, Rogers was South Dakota State‘s head coach. In just two seasons with the Jackrabbits, he led the program to a 27-3 record and a 15-1 mark in conference play.\n\nMoreover, in 2023, South Dakota State won the FCS National Championship. The team lost in the national semifinals in 2024, but won the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Now, he’ll look to lead Iowa State to similar heights.\n\n“My family and I are excited to be joining the Iowa State University community and the Cyclone football program,” Rogers said. “Iowa State has been one of the nation’s top programs for the last decade and we look forward to building upon its upward trajectory. I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity that Jamie Pollard has given me to lead the Cyclones.”\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "fullText": "Eagles legend LeSean McCoy has strong statement on 49ers matchup originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSean McCoy doesn’t seem to have a single ounce of worry when it comes to his former team’s Wild Card matchup this Sunday.\n\nAs the Eagles are coming off of what became a controversial loss against the Washington Commanders, McCoy cannot be found on the side of those criticizing Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni for his decision to sit the starters for the regular season finale.\n\n“We don't care,” McCoy said. “Other teams you talked about, they are playing for something—first seed, they playing for divisional championships. We got the division. We won that championship. What's next?”\n\nWith a win and a Chicago Bears loss on Sunday, the Eagles could’ve locked up the NFC’s second seed behind the Seattle Seahawks. It would’ve secured home games for the first two rounds at least.\n\nThe Bears lost to the Detroit Lions, setting the Eagles up for an opportunity secure that home-field advantage, but their backups couldn’t seal the deal. If the Eagles advance to the Divisional Round, a matchup against the Bears would take place in Chicago—not Philadelphia.\n\nHome-field is obviously an advantage for most teams, but McCoy doesn’t take too much stock in that. Like Sirianni, he felt the additional rest was the right move.\n\n“We are defending champs,” McCoy continued. “Let's get healthy, right? Been a long season. Let's get our offense back together. Let's get the mental part right. Let's get physically ready to play. Got the playoffs coming up. So I don't mind that. I don't mind how my head coach runs his show, because my thing is, who we playing? That's all that matters. Line them up and we'll beat them.”\n\n\"The championship is going to Philadelphia... We not trippin'\"\n\n– @CutonDime25 is CONFIDENT in his Eagles and commends Sirianni for sitting the starters despite possibly obtaining the number 2 seed had the Eagles won\n\nCOME JOIN THE CHAT WITH US ➡️ https://t.co/f4H3dQB55cpic.twitter.com/2GITdLk56s\n\n— Speakeasy (@speakeasytlkshw) January 5, 2026\n\nThe Eagles enter the playoffs with an 11-6 record. The 49ers were one game better with a 12-5 finish. Yet, Philadelphia will enter the matchup as favorites, with McCoy confident as ever.\n\n“We ain’t worried about the Niners! You see the way they looked last game? We're not worried about the Niners,” the Eagles legend finished. “Niners or Green Bay, whoever it was, we're just gonna beat them anyway. Listen, man, the championship goes to Philadelphia. I know that, and so does Nick Sirianni. We ain't tripping. We don't care.”\n\nThe Eagles and the 49ers will kick off on Sunday at 4:30 PM ET.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints may have a quarterback on their hands. Rookie Tyler Shough impressed in the first nine starts of his young professional career, completing 67.6% of his passes for 2,384 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions.\n\nNew Orleans was even able to win four of their last five games under the guidance of Shough, providing optimism that he can be their quarterback of the future.\n\nIn real life, Shough had to wait to have his name called until the 40th overall pick in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft. But almost a year removed, would he be picked any higher?\n\nIn a re-draft of the 2025 NFL Draft, Bleacher Report's Brent Sobleski projected Shough to go No. 3 overall to the New York Giants, since Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward were both off the board with the first two picks.\n\n\"Tyler Shough performed better than any rookie quarterback this past season. A person can even argue he should have been the No. 1 overall pick when compared to his classmates. He slides to No. 3 based on one factor: upside,\" wrote Sobleski.\n\n\"Aside from age, he originally fell into the second round because of an extensive injury history throughout his collegiate career. He remained healthy in 2025, but that concern hasn't disappeared.\"\n\nDespite Sobleski's concerns, it's impressive that a second-round pick improved his stock enough in nine games to be considered a top-three pick just nine months later.\n\nIt's safe to say the Saints are pleased with last year's selection.\n\nMock draft has Saints landing explosive playmaker to pair with Tyler Shough\n\nSaints HC Kellen Moore responds to concerns about QB Tyler Shough's age\n\nSaints 'expected' to play first international game in new European country for 2026\n\nSaints owner Gayle Benson provides stern update on potential sale of Saints, Pelicans\n\nGayle Benson delivers bad news for Saints fans on general manager Mickey Loomis",

    "fullText": "\"The stories have been written in the stars, it seems. Literally.\"\n\nWhile scathing of the effort of many of his own players, even Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche acknowledged something is stirring at Wrexham as they knocked his Premier League side out of the FA Cup.\n\nIn front of co-owner Ryan Reynolds, the Red Dragons' Class of 2025-26 etched themselves into cup folklore by taking their top-flight scalp at the Stok Cae Ras on penalties.\n\nWith drama befitting their modern-day Hollywood associationwice they were two goals clear against last year's semi-finalists before being dragged, exhausted, into extra time where they produced a dramatic climax.\n\nFor a club with FA Cup upsets stitched into its fabric, this win was up there with the most climactic - and the hero of the iconic win over Arsenal in 1992, Mickey Thomas, watched on.\n\nBefore the match, manager Phil Parkinson admitted he had wished to take on a Premier League team ever since the club's journey up from the fifth tier began five years ago.\n\n\"We highlighted to the lads some of the great moments in this club's history in the FA Cup and could we make our own bit of history tonight. We've certainly done that,\" Parkinson said.\n\nThey did, and then some - beating top-flight opposition for the first time since 1999 to progress into round four.\n\nBut Wrexham are getting used to writing their own scripts.\n\n\"It's not just about the money, the fame and the people involved who have been amazing in the whole story, but to keep that edge and keep pushing as they're doing is tremendous,\" Forest boss Dyche said.\n\nAnd with a nod to Wrexham's position just outside the Championship play-offs, having been a non-league side as recently as 2023, he added: \"They might well add to the story.\"\n\n'Unacceptable to the badge' - Dyche fumes at FA Cup exit\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\n'I still think of him' - the Wrexham friendship FA Cup hero will never forget\n\nFrom \"colossus\" Arthur Okonkwo's spot-kick heroics to Ollie Rathbone's continued rip-roaring return from injury, and first club goals for both Liberato Cacace and Dom Hyam thrown into the mix, Parkinson said there were \"stories everywhere\" on a truly wild night in north Wales.\n\n\"It's a magical night. It's just a classic FA Cup game,\" said goalscorer Cacace, who was making his first start for Wrexham in more than two months.\n\nIt ensured co-owner Reynolds - accompanied by his mother who witnessed the glory of the world's oldest national football competition in full view - was not left disappointed.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll (Reynolds) be delighted to feel the emotion again inside the Stok Cae Ras,\" said Parkinson.\n\nWrexham sit just one point adrift of the Championship's top six, having won four successive matches in the second tier for the first time in their history.\n\nThe likes of Lewis Brunt, Andy Cannon, Danny Ward, Kieffer Moore and Issa Kabore are all edging ever closer to returning from injury to bolster Parkinson's ranks.\n\nThe possibility of adding to the squad in the January transfer window has not been ruled out, either.\n\nAs for Forest, it's back to the drawing board.\n\nWhile Wrexham made the most of their FA Cup opportunity, Dyche lambasted some of his players for \"not making the most of the platform\".\n\n\"We built up to the game, there was a serious edge to it, we told them about Wrexham - and we were miles off,\" Dyche said.\n\n\"Then we had three important players who came on and showed their hand and the whole thing changed and we looked like a Premier League outfit.\n\n\"The only positive - if there is one out of that first half - is it shows why I'm picking the team I am.\"\n\nForest's focus now will be Premier League survival while Wrexham's will be to join them there next season.\n\nAfter another special night at the Stok Cae Ras - the old romance with the FA Cup no distraction - Wrexham fans will wonder if the stars are aligning for their team this season.\n\nNottingham Forest: Shut Up and Show More Football",

    "description": "A transfer portal spiraling out of control prompted the new regulatory body for college sports to issue a memo to athletic directors Friday night saying it has “serious concerns” about some of the multimillion-dollar contracts being offered to players.  The “reminder” from the College Sports Commission came out about an hour before kickoff of the semifinal between Indiana and Oregon in a College Football Playoff that has shared headlines with news of players signing seven-figure deals to move or, in some cases, stay where they are.

Third-party deals, often arranged by businesses created to back the schools, are being used as workarounds this so-called salary cap.\n\nThe CSC, through its NIL Go portal, is supposed to evaluate those deals to make sure they are for a valid business purpose and fall within a fair range of compensation for the services being provided.\n\nThe CSC did not list examples of unapproved contracts, but college football has seen its share of seven-figure deals luring players to new schools since the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2.\n\nOne high-profile case involved Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who initially sought to enter the transfer portal and turn his back on a reported deal worth $4 million with the Huskies. Legal threats ensued and Williams changed course and stayed at Washington.\n\n\"Making promises of third-party NIL money now and figuring out how to honor those promises later leaves student-athletes vulnerable to deals not being cleared, promises not being able to be kept, and eligibility being placed at risk,\" the CSC letter said.\n\nThe commission listed two rules about contracts it evaluates, some of which have been termed “agency agreement” or “services agreement” in what look like attempts to bypass the rules.\n\n—\"The label on the contract does not change the analysis; if an entity is agreeing to pay a student-athlete for their NIL, the agreement must be reported to NIL Go within the reporting deadline.\"\n\n—\"An NIL agreement or payment with an associated entity or individual ... must include direct activation of the student-athlete’s NIL rights.\" This is a reference to the practice of “warehousing” NIL rights by paying first, then deciding how to use them later.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "Indiana vs. Oregon live score, updates, highlights from 2026 College Football Playoff semifinals originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Indiana vs. Oregon\n\nCollege Football Playoff schedule 2026\n\nWhen the No. 7 Indiana Hoosiers defeated the No. 3 Oregon Ducks in Autzen Stadium on October 11, Curt Cignetti and the Hoosiers finally announced their status as the new college football powerhouse. This 30-20 performance in one of the sport's most hostile environments was the season’s inflection point, cementing Indiana’s spectacular rise from historical underdog to national title contender.\n\nNow, less than three months later, the undefeated Hoosiers and the 13-1 Ducks meet again in the 2026 College Football Playoff semifinals. This is a clash of two established heavyweights, the last two Big Ten champions, led by two of the sport’s most successful and dynamic program builders, meeting with everything on the line.\n\nCignetti is the ultimate program architect, having accomplished a turnaround many call the greatest in college football history. Taking over the losingest program in the sport, Cignetti immediately installed a championship culture, leading the Hoosiers to a remarkable 25-2 record in two years in Bloomington. That run peaked just days ago with a 38-3 thrashing of perennial powerhouse Alabama in the Rose Bowl. Now in his second season, Cignetti has led Indiana to an undefeated campaign, the program's first-ever No. 1 ranking, and their first outright Big Ten championship since 1945.\n\nAcross the field is Dan Lanning, the defensive mastermind who has rapidly transformed Oregon into a consistent powerhouse, never missing a beat in a new conference landscape. Since taking over in Eugene, Lanning is a staggering 48-7, a tenure that includes leading Oregon to an undefeated season and Big Ten championship in their first year in the conference. While the Ducks experienced playoff heartbreak last season, they have since rattled off two dominating wins in the 2025 postseason to set up a rematch with the only team that has beat them this season.\n\nThe electric tension of this high-stakes rematch is amplified by the star power under center — two phenomenal quarterbacks whose seasons have carried their teams to the precipice of a national championship appearance. Fernando Mendoza became the first Indiana player ever to win the Heisman Trophy, leading the nation in total touchdowns. For Oregon, the offense flows through the arm of Dante Moore, who has orchestrated one of the most explosive and balanced attacks in the nation, thriving in Lanning’s system with pinpoint accuracy and commanding control.\n\nThe No. 1 Hoosiers and No. 5 Ducks have been, without question, two of the best teams in college football in 2025: both rank top-10 in scoring offense and scoring defense, boast explosive stars on both sides of the ball, and are guided by two of the sharpest coaches in the game. That's why they own a combined record of 27-1 and now face off for a national championship berth, with one team a win away from bringing home its first title in school history.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Indiana vs. Oregon in the College Football Playoff semifinals.

    "description": "Experts are urging guideline changes on what health professionals should wear to protect against flu-like illnesses including Covid",
    "fullText": "Experts are urging guideline changes on what health professionals should wear to protect against flu-like illnesses including Covid\n\nSurgical face masks provide inadequate protection against flu-like illnesses including Covid, and should be replaced by respirator-level masks – worn every time doctors and nurses are face to face with a patient, according to a group of experts urging changes to World Health Organization guidelines.\n\nThere is “no rational justification remaining for prioritising or using” the surgical masks that are ubiquitous in hospitals and clinics globally, given their “inadequate protection against airborne pathogens”, they said in a letter to WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\n“There is even less justification for allowing healthcare workers to wear no face covering at all,” they said.\n\nAt the height of the Covid pandemic an estimated 129bn disposable face masks were being used around the world every month, by the public and healthcare workers, with surgical masks the most widely available and recommended by most health authorities.\n\nRespirators designed to filter tiny particles – such as masks meeting FFP2/3 standards in the UK or N95 in the US – should instead be standard practice for medical interactions, they said.\n\nAs additional evidence emerged over the course of the pandemic, officials in many countries switched to recommending those masks as more effective.\n\nThe proposals would result in fewer infections in patients and health professionals, and reduce rates of sickness, absence and burnout in the health workforce, the authors contended.\n\nProf Adam Finkel of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, one of the letter’s organisers, said surgical masks were not designed to stop airborne pathogens but “invented to stop doctors and nurses from sneezing into the guts and the hearts of patients”.\n\nSurgical masks are to respirators what the typewriter was to the modern computer, said Finkel, who was chief regulatory official at the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 1995 and 2000: “Obsolete.”\n\nThe letter came out of discussions at an online conference organised last year called Unpolitics, looking at the implementation of evidence-based policies. It was authored by seven clinicians and scientists, including Finkel, and has been endorsed by almost 50 senior clinicians and researchers, and more than 2,000 members of the public, including clinically vulnerable patients.\n\nThere could be “off-ramps”, where governments or establishments decide respirators are not necessary, based on factors such as community infection rates, and ventilation or air filtration devices in a room, the letter says.\n\nWhile the suggested guidance would apply only in healthcare settings, where the risk of infection is higher, it is likely to provoke controversy. Face masks became a culture war issue during the Covid pandemic.\n\nIn December, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said she had been “slightly traumatised by all the mask wearing that we had to do during Covid” in response to comments by an NHS leader saying people with flu symptoms “must wear” a face mask in public.\n\nThe WHO cannot mandate global policies, but the signatories argue that an update to its infection prevention and control guidelines to recommend respirators could have a profound impact.\n\nThey also suggest that the WHO’s procurement infrastructure could help increase access to respirators even in poorer countries, with production of surgical masks phased down over time.\n\nSurgical masks are still “better than nothing”, Finkel conceded, with studies suggesting they block approximately 40% of Covid-sized particles in the air, compared with approximately 80% (and up to 98%) for respirators.\n\nHe says the comparative reduction in risk can be thought of like falling off a wall of four inches rather than four feet: “You can still trip and break an ankle at four inches, but you’re much better off.”\n\nCritics of the group’s arguments point to a lack of randomised controlled trials showing that physical measures slow the spread of respiratory viruses. Finkel and the other authors say such trials are inherently flawed and misleading, for example because people in a trial will not wear masks 24/7 and could be exposed to pathogens while unmasked.\n\nInstead they say physical tests showing that respirators stop particles, conducted in laboratories, offer sufficient evidence.\n\nThe WHO has been criticised for being slow to describe Covid-19 as spreading via “airborne” particles and the letter also calls for it to revisit earlier statements and “unambiguously inform the public that it spreads via airborne respiratory particles”.\n\nProf Trisha Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford, whose research is cited extensively in the letter and is one of its signatories, said: “A germ that does not get inside someone cannot make them sick. By sealing against the face, respirators force airflow to pass through them, filtering out the airborne germs. Respirators are designed to fit closely around the face and meet high filtration standards. Medical masks, in contrast, fit loosely and leak extensively.”\n\nThe letter’s supporters include members of the World Health Network, prominent US epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, and Guardian columnist George Monbiot.\n\nA WHO spokesperson said the letter required “careful review”. They said the organisation consulted widely with experts from different health and economic contexts when producing guidance on personal protective equipment for health workers, adding: “We are currently reviewing WHO’s Infection Prevention and Control guidelines for epidemic and pandemic-prone acute respiratory infections, based on the latest scientific evidence to ensure protection of health workers.”",

    "description": "Talha Tariq quickly found his company at the center of a fast-moving, high-stakes mitigation effort. The result: a bounty program, a cat-and-mouse patch fight, and a debate about open-source security coordination.",
    "fullText": "Talha Tariq and his colleagues at Vercel, the company that maintains Next.js, endured many sleep-deprived nights and weekends when React2Shell was discovered and disclosed soon after Thanksgiving. The defect, which affects vast stretches of the internet’s underlying infrastructure, posed a significant risk for Next.js, an open-source library that depends on vulnerable React Server Components.\n\nHe quickly realized he had a major problem to confront with CVE-2025-55182, a maximum-severity vulnerability affecting multiple React frameworks and bundlers that allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution in default configurations.\n\n“It’s literally the very first layer that everybody on the internet interacts with, so from a risk perspective and exposure perspective it’s basically as bad as it could be,” Tariq, the company’s CTO, told CyberScoop.\n\nTariq and his team initiated and coordinated a massive response effort with major cloud providers, the open source community and technology vendors hours after a developer reported the defect to Meta, which initially created and maintained React before moving the open-source library to the React Foundation in October.\n\nThe React team publicly disclosed the flaw with a patch four days later, after Vercel and many other impacted providers implemented platform-level mitigations to minimize damages.\n\nVercel’s deep integration with and  understanding of React meant it had an outsized responsibility to investigate and share its findings across the industry. Doing so would help validate the patch’s effectiveness and ensure downstream customers understood the potential risk once the vulnerability was disclosed, Tariq said.\n\n“Nobody slept through the weekend, nobody slept through the night,” he said, adding that it was a 24/7 response for Vercel for a minimum of two weeks — extending beyond the vulnerability disclosure into a cat-and-mouse game with attackers seeking to exploit the defect or bypass the patch.\n\nCybercriminals, ransomware gangs and nation-state threat groups were all taking swift measures to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nPalo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 confirmed more than 60 organizations were directly impacted by attacks involving exploitation of the defect by mid-December. Valid public exploits also hit an all-time high, nearing 200 by that time, according to VulnCheck.\n\nMalicious activity targeting React2Shell remains at a “sustained, elevated pace,” cybersecurity firm GreyNoise said in a Wednesday update. The company’s sensors have observed more than 8.1 million attempted attacks since the defect was disclosed, with daily volumes now ranging between 300,000 and 400,000 after peaking in the final weeks of December.\n\nVercel also responded to React2Shell with a quickly arranged HackerOne bounty program offering $50,000 for each verified technique that bypassed its web application firewall. More than 116 researchers participated, and Vercel ultimately paid out $1 million for 20 unique bypass techniques.\n\nThe company said this work allowed it to block more than 6 million exploit attempts targeting environments running vulnerable versions of Next.js. Tariq said it was the “best million dollars spent,” considering the potential impact and exposure it contained.\n\nTariq doesn’t look back on the initial response toReact2Shell with regret. Instead, he sees it as motivation to address a persistent challenge rooted in coordination.\n\nThe burden to promptly address security issues with the broader community often falls on individuals like Tariq who relied on personal relationships to coordinate an industry-wide response. This involved direct contact and communication with security leaders at Google, Microsoft, Amazon and others, he said.\n\n“We have to do better as an industry and figure out a more sustaining way to do this,” Tariq said.",

The small gadget’s battery can last as long as a week before needing a recharge, according to the company.\n\nEarly AI-powered devices such as the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 have landed with a thud, owing to issues such as bugs, poor battery life and the lack of any standout features that would make them preferable to smartphones.\n\nAmazon has a spotty history with wearables and has shown less dedication to the category compared with its tentpole Fire TV, Kindle and Echo hardware. The company discontinued its Halo health tracker wristband in 2023 and has not released a new pair of wireless earbuds in almost three years. The Halo device offered some features that have carried forward with Bee, like the ability to detect a speaker’s mood.\n\nBee is trying to chart a different path from those gadgets by acting as a comprehensive daily journal that requires no prompting or manual input. Startups like Plaud have released competing gadgets with a similar purpose.\n\nThe notion of Amazon taking ownership of an always-listening accessory has made some people wary, but the startup said it maintains stringent privacy practices.",

NPR summarized his research, which found that the frequency of new cancer cases in the country spiked 162% from 1990 to 2023, and cancer-related deaths increased by 80% over that period.\n\nThough pollution and agricultural chemicals are contributing to the issue, Mokdad told the news outlet that a lot of the cancer can be attributed to a strong smoking culture in the nation.\n\n\"There is no more taboo about smoking,\" Mokdad said. \"Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went with some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco.\"\n\nNPR noted that cancer rates are also increasing worldwide. While smoking may be the main culprit in Lebanon, we are now confronting a number of pollutants and chemicals that are increasing our risks for different types of cancers.\n\nFor instance, air pollution, which Mokdad noted is prevalent in Beirut, has been linked to a number of health problems, including respiratory issues and cancer. In fact, one new study found that women who live in more polluted areas suffer increased risks for breast cancer.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAirborne microplastics — which can be inhaled — also put people at risk for lung cancer, per another recent paper.\n\nIt's tough to prevent exposure to all cancer-causing pollutants, but one positive step is to quit smoking if you currently do. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has resources and tips to help smokers kick the habit.\n\nAnother thing anyone can do to reduce air pollution in our cities is to opt for carbon-free modes of transportation, such as biking, e-biking, or walking. Using public transportation can also help decrease pollution.\n\nReducing the amount of new microplastics entering the environment will help limit our exposure. The best way to do this is to stop using so many single-use plastics. Some easy swaps include reusable water bottles and shopping totes, and bringing your own sturdy container to restaurants for leftovers.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "While a salary of over $100,000 would’ve been enough for one to feel financially well off a decade ago, it doesn’t seem like enough these days.\n\nAccording to the recent Income Paradox Survey conducted by The Harris Poll, 64% of six-figure earners admitted that they felt a six-figure salary was no longer a sign of wealth and that they were in survival mode. The survey also revealed that 44% of six-figure earners felt that they were one unexpected bill away from “financial chaos.”\n\nGOBankingRates consulted with experts to determine the minimum net worth you would need to be considered rich in the U.S. right now and how you could work on getting there.\n\nFor You: Are You Rich or Middle Class? 8 Ways To Tell That Go Beyond Your Paycheck\n\nFind Out: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nHere’s what the research and experts had to say about the net worth that makes you rich in America today.\n\nAccording to Charles Schwab’s recent Modern Wealth Survey, Americans felt that you need a net worth of $2.3 million to be considered wealthy, down from the $2.5 million figure last year. The survey also found that Americans thought you needed $839,000 to be “financially comfortable,” up from the $778,000 figure in 2024. The $2.3 million net worth makes sense because one million dollars may not be enough to retire on, and you have to factor in inflation when thinking about your money.\n\n“Let’s assume that ‘rich enough’ is being able to receive annual dividends of $120,000 from your investments,” said Arie Brish, a professor at St Edwards University, board director, and investor. “At a moderate assumption of 5% per year, this equates to a net worth of $2.4 million.”\n\nBish also noted that being rich depends on your definition of it and the level you want to reach. The numbers make sense, since they’re close to what Americans perceive as rich in 2026.\n\n“You have to have a minimum net worth of one million dollars to be considered wealthy if you’re in your 30s or younger,” said Melanie Musson, a finance expert with Quote.com. “You’re only halfway through your career in your 30s, so you’re expected to still be paying off some debts while preparing for the future.” Since you still have an income and time on your side, you can continue to grow your wealth as you think about retirement.\n\nMusson also noted that the average American should have at least $1 million in retirement accounts before retiring. She warned that as you get older, you need more money to be considered wealthy because you’ll be living off that net worth without contributing to it like you did when you were employed. This is why it’s crucial that you manage your funds on a consistent basis so that you’re keeping up with inflation and your financial goals.",

    "fullText": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina has repaid the funds it drew from a $20 billion credit line with the Trump administration, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Friday, in a crucial step for Argentine President Javier Milei to restore confidence in his chronically distressed economy.\n\nIn addition to making payments to bondholders, Milei’s radical libertarian administration had “quickly and fully repaid its limited draw,” Bessent said, without specifying the amount.\n\nThe Treasury’s latest report on the status of the credit line said that Argentina’s central bank had traded pesos for $2.5 billion through the swap as of the end of October.\n\nThe Argentine Central Bank confirmed Bessent's announcement.\n\nThe contentious and largely unprecedented U.S. rescue provided dollar liquidity to the Trump administration's cash-strapped ideological ally and halted a market rout in Argentina ahead of crucial midterm elections last October.\n\nMilei’s libertarian party won a major victory in the vote, cementing support for his harsh austerity program and quelling investor concerns about the crisis-stricken country's ability to repay debts. In another sign of the revived optimism around Milei's reforms, his government issued a dollar bond for the first time in eight years last month, presaging a return to international bond markets.\n\nThanks to Argentina’s deposit, Bessent said, the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund tapped for the bailout holds no more Argentine pesos.\n\nHe praised the payment as a landmark that justified the Treasury’s bailout of Argentina, which raised doubts about the consistency of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy and drew backlash in the U.S. for putting taxpayer funds at risk. Experts have also criticized the opaque and apparently unconditional nature of the loan.\n\n“Stabilizing a strong American ally – and making tens of millions in profit for Americans – is an America First homerun deal,” Bessent wrote. “Setting the course for Latin America, a strong and stable Argentina that helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in our clear best interest.”\n\nLuis Caputo, Argentina’s economy minister thanked the Trump administration “for the trust in our economic policy.”\n\n“It is an excellent reality for our country to have been able to build this geopolitical alliance and to know that we have the explicit support of the most important country in the world,” he said.\n\nBut Argentina is not out of the woods.\n\nIts foreign exchange reserves still run perilously low. The country is set to come under further strain in the coming months from repayments on previous International Monetary Fund loans and other private debt.",

The family had not paid much attention to it, assuming it was harmless,\" he added.\n\nAs explained in the release, hair cannot be digested, which led to the years of hair pulling and eating (a mental illness called trichophagia) to accumulate and harden into a mass that developed into an intestinal obstruction, blocking H.'s stomach outlet.\n\nPEOPLE reached out to FV Hospital for comment and did not receive an immediate response.\n\nTo remove the hairball, H. underwent a complex three-hour laparoscopic surgery, which allowed surgeons to access the obstructed segment of the intestine. At the same time, gastrointestinal endoscopy helped identify the exact location of the hairball and assisted with its removal from the gastric side.\n\nFollowing surgery, H. experienced immediate pain relief and resumed normal eating. The child was discharged from the facility five days after the procedure. In a recent follow-up, H. showed healthy weight gain and a marked improvement in both her physical condition and overall well-being.\n\nAccording to Dr Tuan, trichophagia is often associated with mild psychological disorders, habits formed in early childhood or conditions linked to stress and anxiety. For this reason, a child’s behaviour of pulling out and putting hair into the mouth should not be dismissed as “normal mischief.”\n\n“If not detected early, this behaviour can lead to very serious consequences, even becoming life-threatening,” he emphasized. \"In many cases, psychological support is also necessary to prevent recurrence.\"\n\nH.'s parents were given guidance and were advised to closely observe the child, spend more time communicating with her and seek psychological consultation if the behaviour continues.",

    "description": "The Ukranian military has relied heavily on Starlink satellites for communications since Russia invaded in 2022, but this response seems implausible.",
    "fullText": "Even if you've never used the service you're likely familiar with Starlink, the global internet service provider that depends on an array of satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO). SpaceX launched the first Starlink satellites in 2019, and since them more than 9,000 more have joined those initial five dozen. Starlink plans an eventual fleet of over 40,000, but before that can happen Russia seems interested in knocking some of them out of commission.\n\nIn late December of 2025 the Associated Press reported that \"Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation.\" The unnamed services apparently said Russia wouldn't target satellites individually or with electromagnetic pulse devices but rather employ a \"zone-effect\" weapon consisting of a cloud of dense pellets. While any unsourced reports should be taken lightly, potential Russian interest in taking out Starlink satellites could be due to Ukraine's dependence on Starlink since Russia invaded in 2022. While anti-satellite weapons aren't new, they present significant risk in the form of widespread debris fields that could threaten other satellites.\n\nA \"zone effect\" weapon like the one mentioned is akin to firing a shotgun blast at the satellites, with one major difference. While shotgun pellets are limited by physics and gravity to a few seconds of flight, debris in space continues zipping around until it hits something or is captured by the earth's gravity field. The AP quoted defense expert Victoria Samson of the Secure World Foundation as saying \"I would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\" Brigadier General Christopher Horner — who commands the Space division of the Canadian military — wasn't so sure. After confirming that his intelligence services hadn't turned up any evidence of such a weapon, he added the caveat \"it's not implausible.\"\n\nStarlink satellites travel at 27,000 km/h (almost 17,000 mph) and orbit at 550 km (341.75 miles) above the earth. Hitting even a small object at that speed can cause catastrophic damage to the delicate structures and instruments on a satellite, and Starlink's aren't the only ones in low-earth orbit.\n\nNASA defines low-earth orbit as below 1,200 miles, noting that the International Space Station occupies this level of space and that it plans to expand access to \"include government agencies, commercial providers, academic organizations, and potentially more.\"\n\nDepoloying a \"zone-effect\" weapon like the one described in Associated Press' reporting would certainly cause indiscriminate damage to these satellites. The potential risks would be obvious to any rogue state on the planet, and Russia surely has scientists who understand them. Even if Russia never plans on developing or using such a device, it's possible this story has been fabricated and leaked to deter Starlink's operational support of Ukraine. Starlink is also providing internet service in Venezuela after U.S. military operations there, although that's only through February 3.\n\nZone-effect weapons are relatively low-tech, and Russia has a dedicated space launch agency with the ability to deploy much more capable anti-satellite weapons. Among the most powerful military air defense systems in the world is Russia's S-500 Prometheus, which can take out satellites in the near reaches of low-earth orbit. The S-500 was engineered as a defensive weapon, but it's not a huge leap in logic to imagine it being used in a \"zone effect\" or other attack on Starlink satellites.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

Hiding beneath the sun-baked earth of the western Nile Delta were an entire Roman Period necropolis and industrial complex that had gone undisturbed for 2,000 years before archaeologists recently dug them up.\n\nWhen archaeologists from the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities and the University of Padua excavated at the Kom el-Ahmar and Kom Wasit sites in Beheira Governorate, what surfaced was beyond anything they could have imagined. They had unearthed the remains of what was once part of a city dating back to the fifth century B.C.E. This was a period during which Egypt was influenced by Greek and Roman culture, and a merging of aesthetics is visible in artifacts such as carvings, pottery, and objects used in funerary rituals.\n\nThe Roman cemetery found in the area contained evidence of several different types of burial practices that reflected various cultural elements. The remains of 23 individuals laid to rest ranged from those buried directly in the ground to some in ceramic coffins. Bodies of children were encased in large, elongated amphorae. While mummification was still alive in this era—fusing Egyptian elements such as linen wrappings and hieroglyphs with Roman plaster funerary portraits painted with the face of the deceased—no mummies were found. At least on the outside, these remains showed that the people who once inhabited the city suffered no violence or epidemic. Ongoing bioarchaeological analysis will reveal how they lived.\n\nWhile the Nile Delta was more fertile thousands of years ago, Roman Egypt was still arid enough for both human remains and an entire trove of artifacts to survive. Archaeologists also excavated an industrial building spacious enough for six rooms. Much of that space was apparently used for processing salted fish, which was an important source of revenue, especially when it came to long-distance trade, at a time when there were few methods of food preservation available. Processing had left behind 9,700 fish bones which were dug up by the archaeological team.\n\nIn some of the other rooms, craftsmen and artisans had produced tools of stone and metal along with faience amulets. These generally inexpensive amulets were available to anyone regardless of how grand a tomb they could afford to build. Often taking on the form of scarabs or other animals, and sometimes deities, they were made of clay and glazed in bluish-green faience. These amulets were either worn by the living for protection or buried with the dead to secure entry into the afterlife. Mummies have often been found with faience amulets between their wrappings, and sometimes a scarab was placed over the heart to convince the goddess Ma’at of the individual’s purity when it came to her final judgment. Someone considered impure was thrown to the jaws of soul eater Ammit.\n\nAlso found in the ancient facility were unfinished limestone figures, some nearly complete and others that had barely been carved, which remained at its workstations when it was abandoned. There were also amphorae imported from Greece and Rome as well as fragments of Greek pottery that further reflect the influences of those cultures. Some of the best preserved artifacts, including a stunning pair of golden earrings thought to have belonged to a woman, have now been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for the living to gaze upon.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says saving for retirement will be \"irrelevant\" if he's right about what the future holds.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO predicted AI would help create an \"abundance\" of resources for all.\n\nPeople would have \"whatever stuff they want\" and access to superb healthcare and education, he said.\n\nSaving for retirement has been a cornerstone of personal finance for well over a century. It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.",

    "description": "Lawyers are asking for a former Manitoba hockey coach who pleaded guilty in 2024 to luring and sexually assaulting a teenage player to be sent to prison for six years.",
    "fullText": "WARNING: This story includes reference to suicide.\n\nLawyers say a former Manitoba hockey coach who pleaded guilty in 2024 to luring and sexually assaulting a teenage player should be sent to prison for six years.\n\n\"This is a case about the profound wrongfulness and harmfulness of sexual offending against a child,\" Crown attorney Larissa Campbell told provincial court Judge Jerilee Ryle during a sentencing hearing for Madison Biluk in a Winnipeg courtroom on Thursday, where the prosecution and defence jointly recommended a six-year sentence.\n\n\"This is also a sentencing about choices — choices made by the accused that have had, and will continue to have, a profound effect on the victim.\"\n\nBiluk, now 31, was charged in November 2023 for abuse court heard happened between October 2019 and February 2021, when she groomed and sexually exploited a player on her team.\n\nBiluk was between 24 and 26 years old at the time, while the player was 15 and 16, an agreed statement of facts read in court said. The player's identity is protected by a court-ordered publication ban.\n\nCourt heard Biluk's relationship with the player started with driving her to practices and taking her skating, but later involved late-night calls and private messages on Snapchat that included explicit photographs, as well as personal discussions about sex and relationships.\n\nBiluk at one point told the player they shouldn't pursue a relationship because she was her coach, but her behaviour quickly escalated and soon involved taking intimate and nude videos and photos with the girl, and kissing and touching the player sexually, the agreed statement of facts said.\n\nIn a victim impact statement Campbell read in court, the player said what happened had a \"severe\" emotional impact on her life, leaving her with low self-worth, persistent mistrust, depression and anxiety that caused her to lose jobs and weakened her relationships with other people.\n\nThe player also said the cost of therapy \"took a huge toll\" on her family’s finances, and added she worries about running into Biluk.\n\n\"I am afraid of large public spaces for fear of seeing her or maybe somebody she knows,\" the statement said.\n\n\"I feel anxious when I see somebody who resembles her.\"\n\nWhen the girl started to move on and pursue relationships with people closer to her own age, court heard Biluk made a fake Snapchat account to send disparaging comments about the teen's new girlfriend to the teen's other friends.\n\nCourt heard Biluk and the player had ceased all contact by February 2021. But the teen, who had confided in Biluk that she was depressed and that she'd been sexually abused by a trusted adult, continued to struggle.\n\nThat resulted in a suicide attempt in early February 2023. Court heard that around that time, the girl called Biluk asking for help \"and suggested that the accused had played a role in her state of mental health,\" Campbell said. About a week later, the girl ended up at the Crisis Response Centre following another suicide attempt.\n\nBiluk’s lawyer said Thursday his client feels great remorse and never meant to hurt the girl, telling the judge the situation \"morphed from initially altruistic wishes into something that unfortunately became criminal.\"\n\nWhen given the chance to speak in court, Biluk apologized to the player for the harm she caused, and to everyone else affected by what she did.\n\n\"I'm just going to keep trying to improve myself every day and make amends however I can,\" said Biluk, who sat in the courtroom gallery with her family during sentencing arguments.\n\nThe abuse came to light after the girl posted a TikTok video in October 2023 detailing her experience with Biluk. That video came to the attention of police.\n\nThe teen later shared with police a number of photos and videos of her and Biluk together, as well as messages where Biluk referred to their relationship as \"one of the most risky things in my life.\"\n\nAfter her arrest, Biluk said she still cared for the player but that she was shocked by the TikTok video the teen posted. Biluk described the girl as a \"pathological liar,\" the agreed facts said.\n\nBiluk, who appeared in court Thursday with her right arm in a sling, is expected to return to court to be sentenced and taken into custody near the end of March, after completing scheduled surgery, court heard. She is no longer coaching and remains out on bail under conditions.\n\nCourt heard Biluk coached hockey from 2019 through 2023, and during that time drew concerns on several occasions from coaching staff who said her behaviour went beyond the professional coach-and-player relationship, Campbell said. Those concerns resulted in several warnings but did not curb her behaviour.\n\nAfter her contact with the player ended, Biluk continued coaching in Alberta and Manitoba, where her behaviour again raised concerns about inappropriate boundaries with players.\n\nWhile there were investigations into her behaviour in both provinces, no further charges were pursued, Campbell said.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling, here’s where to look for help:",

    "description": "Jonathan Gerlach was arrested Jan. 6 at the cemetery with a bag containing human remains of children and skulls, along with additional bones in his vehicle.",
    "fullText": "A Lancaster County man is facing more than 500 charges after investigators say they discovered more than 100 human skeletal remains in his home.\n\nOfficers say a Tuesday night arrest of 34-year-old Jonathan Gerlach culminated a monthslong investigation into break-ins at Mount Moriah Cemetery in Yeadon, where at least 26 mausoleums and vaults had been forced open since early November.\n\nPolice had been looking into the string of burglaries when an investigator checked Gerlach's vehicle plates and found he had been near Yeadon repeatedly during the period when the burglaries occurred. Police say the break-ins centered on sealed vaults and mausoleums containing older burials, which had been smashed open or had stonework damaged to reach the remains inside.\n\nHe was arrested as he walked back toward his car with a crowbar at the 1855 cemetery, police said, and a burlap bag in which officers found the mummified remains of two small children, three skulls and other bones.\n\nGerlach told investigators he took about 30 sets of human remains and showed them the graves he stole from, police said.\n\nInvestigators said the arrest led to a search of Gerlach's home in Ephrata, Lancaster County, where they found well over 100 skeletal remains.\n\n\"Detectives walked into a horror movie come to life the other night. This is an unbelievable scene,\" said Tanner Rouse, the Delaware County District Attorney. \"Understand, some of these are 200 years old. Some obviously much newer, there's one with a pacemaker still attached to the body.\"\n\n\"I grieve for those who are upset by this, who are going through it, who are trying to figure out if it is in fact their loved one or their child, because we found remains that we believe to be months-old infants among those that he had collected,\" added Rouse.\n\nDelaware County DA holds news conference on gravesite thefts on Jan. 8, 2026.\n\nPolice believe the remains were also taken from other cemeteries throughout the region. They are also investigating a Facebook group titled \"Human Bones and Skull Selling Group,\" where Gerlach was tagged and pictured holding a skull.\n\n\"Very simply, detectives have recovered an awful lot of bones at this point, and we are still trying to piece together who they are, where they are from, and how many we are looking at. It's going to be quite some time before we have a final answer,\" stated Rouse.\n\nAuthorities said they do not yet know if any remains were sold or why Gerlach wanted them.\n\n\"The remains were in various states,\" Rouse explained. \"Some were hanging as it were. Some were pieced together, some were skulls on a shelf.\"\n\nNeighbors were shaken after learning about the charges.\n\n\"It's supposed to be a nice, quaint little town, and here you have somebody with bodies in their house,\" said Kim Hackman, of Ephrata.\n\n\"I just wanna know the motive, like why would someone do that?\" asked Conner Barker, of Ephrata.\n\nThe gravesite is considered the country's largest abandoned burial ground, according to Friends of Mount Moriah Cemetery, which helps maintain the 160-acre landmark in Yeadon that's home to an estimated 150,000 grave sites.\n\nYeadon Police Chief Henry Giammarco called the case one of the most disturbing he has ever seen.\n\n\"Rest in peace is rest in peace, and this is definitely something that tears at your heartstrings,\" Giammarco said.\n\nPolice are working to identify the remains and notify families.\n\nThe full list of charges against Gerlach includes the following:\n\nBurglary - Not Adapted for Overnight Accommodation, No Person Present (F1) - 26 counts\n\nCriminal Trespass - Enter Structure (F3) - 26 counts\n\nCriminal Trespass - Enter Structure (F2) - 26 counts\n\nAbuse of Corpse (M2) - 100 counts\n\nTheft By Unlawful Taking (F3) - 100 counts\n\nReceiving Stolen Property (F3) - 100 counts\n\nIntentional Desecration of Public Monument (M2) - 26 counts\n\nIntentional Desecration of Venerated Object (M2) - 26 counts\n\nIntentional Desecration of Historic Lots and Burial Places (M1) - 26 counts\n\nCriminal Mischief - Damage Property (M3) - 26 counts\n\nDefiant Trespasser (S) - 7 counts\n\nHe is being held on $1 million bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for January 20, 2026.\n\nThe investigation remains ongoing\n\nThe Delaware CountyDistrict Attorney's Office urges anyone with additional information to contact Detective Leah Cesanek at 610-623-1500 or Detective Chris Karr at 610-891-4700.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge’s ruling that a Trump administration prosecutor in upstate New York was serving unlawfully has spilled into another case — with the same judge saying he can’t obtain tax return information in a criminal investigation because he lacks authority.\n\nThe ruling Thursday against prosecutor John Sarcone from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield came the same day the judge disqualified Sarcone from overseeing investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Schofield ruled that Sarcone was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York and that any “of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable.”\n\nSarcone is among the prosecutors around the country found by federal judges to lack authority after the Republican administration used unusual maneuvers to place them or keep them in their posts without U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said Schofield's ruling was consistent with previous decisions.\n\n“It does seem like more and more courts are coming around to this view,” he said.\n\nIn a separate ruling Thursday, Schofield denied Sarcone's application for a court order directing the IRS to disclose tax return information for a limited liability company as part of a criminal investigation. The application remains sealed and it's not clear who filed the tax returns sought in the Oct. 2 request.\n\nApplications for that tax information can only be made by officials holding specific positions, such as U.S. attorneys. The Manhattan judge said Sarcone lacked authority to authorize the application because he was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney — mirroring her reasoning in the case involving James.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to the northern district.\n\nCourts in New Jersey, Nevada and California have held that similarly installed acting U.S. attorneys lacked lawful authority. Trump’s former personal attorney, Alina Habba,resigned as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey in December after an appeals court said she had been serving unlawfully.",

    "fullText": "Jan 9 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will give a speech in a few minutes on \"the terrorist actions\" ​in the country, Iranian state TV reported on Friday, ‌as protests over economic hardships continued nationwide.\n\nA countrywide internet blackout was reported in Iran ‌on Thursday and extended into Friday, internet monitoring group NetBlocks said. It coincided with calls for more protests from Reza Pahlavi, the long-exiled son of Iran's last shah who was toppled in the ⁠1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nStarting in ‌Tehran with shopkeepers in the Grand Bazaar angered by a sharp slide in the rial currency, the ‍latest protests now involve others - mainly young men rather than the women and girls who played a key role in 2022-23.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists ​News Agency has reported at least 34 protesters and four ‌security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest, which analysts say highlights deeper disillusionment with the status quo.\n\nAuthorities have tried to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while ⁠responding to some demonstrations with tear gas ​amid violent street confrontations.\n\nNearly five decades ​after the Islamic Revolution, Iran's Shi'ite Muslim clerical rulers are struggling to bridge the gap between its priorities ‍and the expectations ⁠of a young society.\n\nIn the ongoing unrest, many protesters are venting anger over Iran's support for militants around the Middle ⁠East, chanting \"Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran\" in frustration over the authorities' ‌perceived neglect of domestic problems.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump read aloud a private note from Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a Jan. 9 press conference at the White House\n\nTrump, who was meeting with oil and gas executives, read Rubio's instruction to \"go back to Chevron\" in front of the whole room\n\nHowever, the president didn't seem to fully comprehend Rubio's instruction\n\nPresident Donald Trump appeared to embarrass Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a press conference when he read aloud a private note from him on live television.\n\nTrump, 79, was taking part in a meeting with oil and gas executives at the White House on Friday, Jan. 9, when the incident occurred.\n\nThe president was seated between Vice President JD Vance and Rubio, 54, during the press conference. After Trump called on Ryan Lance of ConocoPhillips to speak, Rubio could be seen passing a handwritten note to Trump while Vance, 41, seemed to look on with confusion.\n\n\"Marco just gave me a note,\" Trump told the room of executives. Rubio capped his pen and glanced down, but as the president began reading the note aloud, he immediately looked at him.\n\n\"Go back to Chevron,\" Trump read from Rubio's note. \"They want to discuss something. Go back to Chevron.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Vance was clearly amused, laughing on one side of the president as Rubio smiled in apparent discomfort on the other.\n\n\"Go ahead, I'm going back to Chevron,\" Trump said as he placed the note back down on the table.\n\nHe then patted Rubio on the back as he told him, \"Thank you, Marco.\"\n\n\"Was there a question, Mr. President?\" a voice off camera could be heard asking Trump, who then picked up the paper again as he said, \"Yes, go ahead,\" before asking, \"Marco, what was the, what are you saying here?\"\n\nSecretary of energy Chris Wright then took over, asking Mark Nelson of Chevron to share updates from the company. As Nelson spoke, Rubio took the note back and folded it up before tucking it away.\n\nRubio also made headlines in the fall for another note written to Trump, which he gave the president during an Oct. 8, 2025 meeting with conservative influencers and the press.\n\nThe contents of the note, which were captured by photographers in the room, told Trump he needed to approve a statement on social media about a tentative peace agreement between Israel and Hamas.\n\nRubio signaled for Trump's attention during the meeting before sharing the private update with the president concerning the need for him to \"approve\" a social media post, suggesting Trump hadn't written the post himself.\n\nA photo captured by The Associated Press revealed the message, which read: “You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.” Trump quickly told meeting attendees that he had good news.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we’re very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they’re gonna need me pretty quickly,” he said. “So we’ll take a couple of more questions.”\n\nAP reported at the time that Trump continued the meeting for 10 more minutes before telling the group he had to \"try and solve some problems in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Although I’m very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows,” he continued. “We don’t want to take any chances. So we’re going to go and do that.\"",

    "fullText": "A 550-pound bear that had been living beneath a California man’s home for over a month has finally left after a bizarre strategy ended a long streak of failed removal attempts by state officials.\n\nThe male black bear was reportedly removed from the crawl space Tuesday after bear-removal experts from Tahoe traveled to the Altadena home. One team member crawled inside and fired paintballs filled with vegetable oil, wildlife organization BEAR League told Fox News Digital on Thursday.\n\nAccording to surveillance video, the large bear has been wedging itself in and out of a small crawl space beneath Ken Johnson’s house since late November. Johnson said that the animal caused extensive damage to his home, costing tens of thousands of dollars. It also created a dangerous, unlivable situation involving structural and gas line issues.\n\n\"Right after surviving the Eaton fire, I lost my job, and shortly after that the bear began tearing into the structure of my home,\" Johnson said in a GoFundMe page. \"I have video footage of it twisting gas pipes, which created an extremely dangerous situation and forced me to shut off my utilities just to stay safe.\"\n\nBear Remains Under California Home After Weeks Of Failed Removal Attempts\n\nThe bear eviction finally took place after Johnson contacted BEAR League, an organization that specializes in bear removal emergencies in Lake Tahoe, located seven hours north of Altadena.\n\nBEAR League told Fox News Digital on Thursday that the organization was \"pleased to have helped Ken Johnson with this bear.\"\n\n\"A Southern California homeowner had a large male bear living under his house for more than a month before reaching out to the BEAR League for help,\" the organization added in a post on Facebook on Thursday.\n\nBEAR League told Fox News Digital that the league used paintballs filled with vegetable oil that hit the bear in the backside. The wildlife rescue group reportedly finished the job in less than 20 minutes.\n\nWild Bear Makes 'Very Polite' Surprise Visit To California Zoo Before Returning To Forest\n\n\"After earlier removal attempts by state wildlife officials were unsuccessful, BEAR League first responders Scott and Dave traveled to the Los Angeles area to assist,\" the organization added. \"Scott, one of our most experienced responders, crawled beneath the home—fully aware the bear was still there—to get behind him and encourage him to exit through the crawl space opening.\"\n\nTo prevent the bear from denning in the crawl space again, the organization said it \"loaned electric unwelcome mats to give the homeowner time to make repairs and secure the crawl space to prevent another visit.\"\n\nAccording to social media footage posted by the organization, the mat worked just as designed, and the bear scurried away when it returned.\n\nBEAR League emphasized that residents should be cautious about having open crawl spaces, noting that properly securing them helps people coexist safely with wildlife.\n\n\"We remind those who live in bear country that a poorly-secured crawl space is an open invitation for a winter visitor like this bear,\" the league said to Fox News Digital. \"BEAR League responds multiple times per day at this time of year to evict bears from under homes in the Lake Tahoe region, and we’ve done so for 30 years without cost to the homeowner.  We work hard to educate people who share space with the bears that if humans take some very simple steps, they can live in harmony with the bears.\"\n\nTuesday’s success ended a long streak of failed eviction attempts by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which had been trying to remove the bear for over a month. At one point, a trap even caught the wrong bear. Efforts that included bait, noisemakers and even a trap that caught the wrong bear all failed.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "\"I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress,\" Gates wrote in his annual letter.",
    "fullText": "Last year didn’t go the way Bill Gates hoped. As a philanthropist who has dedicated billions to improving everything from healthcare and education in poor countries to climate change action, Gates could only watch as the Trump administration slashed swathes of foreign aid contracts. \n\nThe Microsoft co-founder has criticised the cost-cutting regime, much of which was enacted under Elon Musk’s Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He warned the action could directly result in the death of children, a claim which Tesla CEO Musk demanded evidence.\n\nWriting in his annual letter this year, the Gates Foundation founder was optimistic but candid, writing: “I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.”\n\nHe added: “The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under five years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.”\n\nLast month the Gates Foundation’s Goalkeepers Report revealed an additional 12.5 million child deaths could occur by 2045 if development assistance for health (including government spending) is reduced by 20% from 2024 levels, according to bespoke modelling based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\n“Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization,” Gates wrote. “My answer is this: I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.”\n\nBut, that optimism comes with a deadline, or as Gates puts it “there are footnotes to my optimism.”\n\n“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates continued. “As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.”\n\n“I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.”\n\nIn 2025, Gates announced his $200 billion moonshot: He was donating “virtually all [his] wealth”—about $100 billion—to his foundation. It was the largest philanthropic commitment in modern history, and came with strings attached. The funds (made up of its current endowment and projected growth) must be spent in the next 20 years.\n\nWhile Gates made the announcement this year, his intentions have been clear for many years. In 2010 Gates, his wife at the time Melinda French Gates, and Berkshire Hathaway co-founder Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge, making a public commitment to philanthropy, which has since been signed by the likes of philanthropist Mackenzie Scott and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky.\n\nIn a bid to bridge a gap in government funding, Gates is calling on fellow wealthy philanthropists. He wrote: “This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.”\n\nA report on billionaires from Oxfam, released most recently in January 2025, revealed that in 2024, the number of billionaires rose to 2,769, up from 2,565 a year prior. It also said it expects at least five people to reach trillionaire status a decade from now.\n\nGates added: “I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1% of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "A Guggenheim heir is raising $50 million to back media and creator startups. Here are 4 areas he's betting on.",
    "description": "Guggenheim Brothers Media and Abu Dhabi's EIH formed a fund for media, entertainment, and creator economy investments.",
    "fullText": "A new $50 million fund is targeting media, entertainment, and creator economy startups, tapping into Hollywood networks and the UAE's growing appetite for cultural investment.\n\nUS investment firm Guggenheim Brothers Media is launching the fund with backing from Abu Dhabi-based Ethmar International Holding.\n\nThe firm is led by Dillon Lawson-Johnston and Criswell Fiordalis, who are looking to write checks of $2 million to $5 million, targeting 10 to 15 companies. They plan to seek other investors as well and hope to grow the fund to as much as $75 million.\n\nThe pair brings extensive entertainment and cultural ties. Lawson-Johnston is the great-great-grandson of Solomon R. Guggenheim, founder of New York City's famed Guggenheim Museum, and has experience from UTA, Sugar23, Untitled Entertainment, and Anonymous Content. Fiordalis has had roles at Lionsgate, MRC, Hello Sunshine, and Webtoon. The two had previously invested in Stapleview, a comedy platform, and The Lighthouse, Whalar Group's campus for creators.\n\nEIH is an investment holding company that's led by a prominent member of a UAE ruling family. The UAE, like other Gulf nations, has been pouring money into US media and entertainment as it tries to diversify away from oil. One UAE government project, Creators HQ, aims to get 10,000 creators to relocate to the country. Lawson-Johnston's family is set to open the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi in 2026.\n\n\"We're investing in creativity and culture, and we're looking to leverage this amazing museum that's being built,\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nHe and Fiordalis want to deploy the fund mainly in the US, where the creator economy is more mature. The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimated that advertisers would spend $37 billion with creators in 2025, a sum that it says is growing four times faster than overall media spending.\n\nHere are four trends the new fund is betting on:\n\nInvestors tend to shy away from backing individual creators because of the risk of overdependence on a single person, also called \"key man risk.\" That's why some big names like Steven Bartlett and Alex Cooper are building networks of complementary creators (and attracting millions of dollars in the process).\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in creators who are looking beyond themselves when building talent-related businesses.\n\nThey'll also look at companies that develop creators through talent management or other services. One example is their earlier investment in Stapleview, which manages social media-born comedians and produces with them.\n\nTraditional media companies have a lot of intellectual property that they want to give new life to in digital media. It's why Disney did a deal that'll open its vault of famous characters to OpenAI.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston, both of whom have spent time at legacy media companies, envision a mutually beneficial way for creators and Hollywood to collaborate in this area and aim to facilitate this process.\n\n\"If you're SpongeBob SquarePants, what do you do other than taking SpongeBob and slapping it on YouTube and saying, 'Oh, we now have a digital presence?'\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nBrands are clamoring to get their message out using creators, leveraging influencers' built-in distribution and popularity among younger consumers. The IAB found in November that brands were most eager to work with mid-tier creators — those with between 50,000 and 500,000 followers — because of their ability to drive sales and awareness.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston see an opportunity to back platforms that connect such influencers with brands using a mix of people and technology. They pointed to the platform Kyra, which raised $15 million in 2022, as one they admire.\n\n\"There's a lot of, not top creators, but downstream creators that have way more engagement and can drive a lot more value to said brand,\" Fiordalis said.\n\nAs more brands shift their budgets to creators, they face increasing pressure to prove that their spending has paid off. Brands have gone from just caring about a creator's follower count to looking at other ways to prove efficacy.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in companies trying to standardize how creators are measured.\n\n\"Who's standardizing the definition of value across these platforms and across pieces of content?\" Fiordalis said. \"I think the industry is getting to a point where it needs that.\"",

    "description": "Canceled flights following airspace closures have left my family stranded in the Caribbean for a week. It's been expensive, but we've made it work.",
    "fullText": "My family expected the usual post-holiday travel blues after spending Christmas and New Year's on an ultra-luxury Caribbean cruise. What we did not expect was to get stranded the moment we stepped off the ship.\n\nOn Saturday morning, we disembarked our ship in Barbados and boarded a prearranged island sightseeing tour that was supposed to drop us back at the airport for our afternoon flights home.\n\nMidway through the tour, our phones began lighting up. News was breaking that military action tied to Venezuela had triggered widespread airspace restrictions across the eastern Caribbean.\n\nOur flight from the island back to the US was far from the only one suddenly canceled.\n\nNow, we were among thousands of others in the Caribbean whose plans were affected during one of the busiest travel seasons of the year.\n\nMy family, including my mom, brother, sister-in-law, and 7-year-old nephew, suddenly needed lodging, food, and a plan on an island alongside hundreds — maybe thousands — of other people in the same boat.\n\nBecause we hadn't booked our airfare through the cruise line, there was little it could do beyond offering general guidance.\n\nAnd despite constant calls to airlines and online searches, I could not secure five seats on any commercial carrier back to any US gateway for at least seven days.\n\nAt one point, I explored chartering a private jet as a theoretical fallback.\n\nOne representative quoted me over $70,000 to fly my brother and his family from Barbados to Dallas — even so, there was no aircraft available until at least Tuesday.\n\nEven if we had pursued chartering a private jet, we would've missed much of the workweek regardless. That mattered.\n\nI'd already been away from the office for an extended holiday break and ultimately had to cancel other planned PTO and another upcoming trip to compensate for the extra time I'd be spending on this one.\n\nMy sister-in-law was able to work remotely, but my brother lost revenue while stranded. My nephew missed school.\n\nAt that point, the jet stopped being a real solution and became a signal. When disruptions hit at scale, availability disappears first, and the consequences ripple well beyond travel itself.\n\nMissed shifts, lost income, burned PTO, and disrupted schedules become part of the cost long before anyone actually gets home.\n\nSince going home that weekend was clearly not an option, we needed to find a place to stay the night.\n\nAvailability mattered more than comfort, but even that was scarce due to the surge in demand. Several hotels I called said they had nothing available until Monday at the earliest, and when options did appear online, they weren't cheap.\n\nAt one point, I saw single rooms at a high-end hotel listed for about $4,500 each. Paying nearly $9,000 a night for two rooms for our group didn't feel realistic or appealing, especially given the uncertainty surrounding when we could get home.\n\nUltimately, I used a consolidator website to find us a small two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath unit at a three-star resort for one night for $600.\n\nMy mom and I shared one room with twin beds, and my nephew slept on a couch. It wasn't ideal and didn't feel sustainable.\n\nOvernight, though, airspace and schedules stabilized, and our airline re-accommodated us on its next available flight home — seven days later than originally planned.\n\nStill, having a confirmed departure, even one a full week out, changed everything.\n\nNow, we could make deliberate decisions about how to spend our wait time instead of reacting day by day in a crowded hub with limited options.\n\nUnable to return to the US for the better part of a week, we decided to leave Barbados on Sunday.\n\nStaying in the larger hub would've meant competing with lots of other stranded travelers for a shrinking inventory at inflated prices. By going to a nearby island, we hoped we could find more available accommodations with more predictable, consistent rates.\n\nThe goal was not necessarily to upgrade our trip — it was to regain control.\n\nWe ended up spending about $600 a person on round-trip flights to Canouan, a small island in St Vincent and the Grenadines, located roughly 120 miles from Barbados. The cost almost felt reasonable given the alternatives.\n\nUnlike Barbados, where inventory had seemingly vanished overnight, it still had availability across several tiers of hotels.\n\nIt made sense given that Canouan is harder to get to and quite small.\n\nThere's no large commercial airport, minimal cruise traffic feeding the island, and far fewer daily flights under normal circumstances. In a mass disruption, that limited visibility worked in its favor.\n\nWe found entire homes and villas available that night for less than what I'd seen one room costing at some hotels in Barbados. Though prices were high, they were at least in line with luxury resorts across the Caribbean, not just inflated because of demand.\n\nCanouan is not inexpensive — most meals alone have cost a few hundred dollars — it is simply predictable.\n\nOver the next few days, the scale, calm, and thoughtfulness of the island made an otherwise stressful situation feel not just manageable, but genuinely restorative.\n\nSo far, we've spent multiple unplanned days in the Caribbean and thousands of dollars navigating cancellations, accommodations, meals, and rebooking costs.\n\nIt was far more than we budgeted for a holiday trip, and none of it was planned.\n\nAlthough travel insurance may offset costs related to flight cancellations, it wasn't able to solve the core problem of getting us home more quickly. No policy can rebook you onto a flight that does not exist.\n\nLuxury travel does not insulate you when systems fail — and sometimes, the smartest move when you are stranded is not to fight the chaos, but to be flexible.\n\nUltimately, we were fortunate to have options we could afford. Many travelers were not.\n\nThough we can't make up for the shifts missed and PTO lost, being willing and able to pivot turned our experience around.\n\nNext time I travel abroad, I'll build in more buffer days, research alternative regional hubs in advance, and think less about where I'm supposed to be and more about where I could realistically go when plans collapse.",

    "description": "Big investors own a small fraction of America's single-family homes. But they're big players in certain Sun Belt markets. Trump wants to ban them.",
    "fullText": "Industry watchers on both sides of the aisle say President Donald Trump's recently announced goal of banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes won't address the root cause of high home prices: a shortage of homes.\n\nMajor investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices.\n\nThese mega landlords own only a tiny fraction of the overall US housing market, although they control a significantly larger share of single-family rental homes in certain markets, particularly in the Sun Belt. Studies have found that they may have contributed to increased home prices and rents in certain areas.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, large investors bought thousands of distressed properties, particularly in Southeastern cities. They correctly predicted that home values and rents in many of the targeted areas would rise over time with population growth.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, and interest rates dropped, investors again snapped up thousands of homes, particularly in cities across the South and Sun Belt. This sparked alarm in communities where individual homebuyers struggled to compete with all-cash offers from major investors.\n\nOverall, large investors own only about 2% of the single-family rental housing stock, according to a 2024 analysis by the GAO. And since 2022, large investors have slowed their purchasing as interest rates have spiked and home prices have remained high. Some major investors have shifted their business model to buying homes in bulk directly from homebuilders, rather than purchasing them one by one.\n\n\"You're seeing this huge increase in debt costs to buy a home, and rents have softened mostly or been flat, and then with prospects of potentially declining home prices, or at least flat home prices, it's just tough,\" said Glenn Hull, CEO of SFR Analytics, which provides software and data tools to real estate investors and others.\n\nInstitutional investors have tended to cluster their purchases, resulting in more concentrated investments in certain neighborhoods in a handful of markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, Charlotte, and Tampa. The 2024 GAO report found that they own 25% of single-family rental homes in Atlanta and 21% of those in Jacksonville. Researchers have found that mega landlords may have contributed to the rise in housing costs, particularly in areas where they're heavily concentrated.\n\n\"The studies reviewed by GAO indicate that institutional investment may increase rents and home prices, particularly in places with high rates of institutional ownership,\" the GAO report said. It added that there are some indications that big investors are more likely to file evictions.\n\nStill, the evidence isn't particularly strong that big investors charge more than smaller landlords, or that they outcompete other buyers.\n\n\"It is unclear whether institutional investors crowd out individual home buyers, and evidence about whether they behave differently than other landlords is thin,\" a 2023 report by the Brookings Institution found.\n\nTo the extent that mega landlords are hurting affordability, it's a local problem in the most affected neighborhoods, industry watchers say.\n\n\"It's not a national story,\" said Jason Lewris, cofounder of Parcl Labs, which tracks institutional investors in housing. \"If you look within those markets, it's a handful of zip codes.\"\n\nMuch remains unknown about what kind of ban Trump intends to pursue. The administration hasn't defined \"large\" institutional investor. Trump said he would ban these investors \"from buying more single-family homes,\" but it's not clear whether they would also be required to sell their current portfolios.\n\nA White House spokesman, Davis Ingle, said in an emailed statement, \"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs.\"\n\nTrump's proposed ban is part of a recent White House effort to address housing affordability concerns. The president announced on Thursday that he's directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds in an attempt to bring down mortgage interest rates.\n\nHousing economists say that banning major investors from buying additional homes would do little to improve affordability.\n\n\"Targeting a small subset of landlords without addressing underlying market conditions and policy gaps will not meaningfully improve the well-being of renters and prospective homebuyers,\" Jenny Schuetz, a former senior fellow focused on housing at the Brookings Institution, told the House Financial Services Committee during a 2022 hearing on corporate investors in residential real estate.\n\nSchuetz, in an interview with Business Insider, called Trump's proposed ban a \"red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nThat's in part because investors don't change the demand for or supply of housing.\n\n\"The housing demand is the same regardless of whether a household rents or buys a home, and housing supply is the same regardless of whether a landlord supplies the unit or a household owns it,\" researchers at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, wrote in a 2024 report in which they called institutional investors a \"scapegoat\" that distracts from the supply shortage driving higher prices.\n\n\"Periods of rapid rent increases correspond to periods of greater household formation coupled with supply shortages, not institutional investor buyers,\" they added. \"It is hard to argue that institutional rental operators drive up home prices over any reasonable period.\"\n\nInstead, economists argue that an undersupply of homes is the major underlying reason for rising prices.\n\n\"If we actually wanted to solve that problem, bringing down the cost of home ownership, what we should be doing is increasing the supply of housing,\" said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin.\n\nMom-and-pop landlords and other smaller investors own the vast majority of single-family rentals in the US. Stopping a large investor from buying a home doesn't necessarily mean a first-time homebuyer or other individual would end up purchasing the house, Fairweather said. Instead, many of these homes would be snapped up by the main competitors of big investors: smaller landlords.\n\nFrom the tenant's perspective, having a mom-and-pop landlord isn't necessarily better than renting a home from a large investor. And when it comes to enforcing laws that protect tenants, including fair housing laws, it can be easier to prove a pattern of behavior by larger landlords, Fairweather said.\n\nIf the federal government succeeds in passing a ban, enforcing it could be tricky. Large investors could break themselves up into smaller shell companies to avoid the prohibition, Lewris said.\n\nThere are other ways to stop investors from buying up more homes that could be more effective. One alternative is to discourage the behavior by raising property taxes on homes owned by institutional investors, thereby making the practice less lucrative, Hull and Fairweather said.\n\n\"In general, bans don't really work, because people find a way around them,\" Fairweather said, \"but if you tax something, at least you get tax revenue out of it that could be used to support things like first-time homebuyer programs or building more affordable housing.\"\n\nInvestors often argue that they actually boost quality housing options for lower-income people by offering rentals in neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes. Tenants tend to have far lower incomes and wealth than homebuyers. And the neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes often have attractive amenities, including good schools and jobs.\n\n\"The narrative today is that what my business does is wrong, that buying homes and renting them is a bad thing because I'm keeping people from buying homes,\" Sean Dobson, CEO of Amherst, a single-family rental company heavily invested in the Sun Belt, said at the real estate conference ResiDay in November 2025. \"It couldn't be any further from the truth, but it's a powerful message.\"\n\nInstead, he argued, his firm helps its tenants live in homes that they couldn't afford a down payment for or wouldn't qualify for a mortgage to buy.\n\nFairweather agreed that banning large landlords from owning single-family homes would mean fewer tenants could live in these wealthier neighborhoods. \"In a way, it boxes out renters and exacerbates some of the inequalities that exist in the country,\" she said.\n\nMadison Hoff contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Trump's plan has already pushed mortgage rates down, but industry experts say they're skeptical of a long-term impact on housing affordability.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump this week has zeroed in on an issue that's at the heart of America's affordability crisis: housing costs.\n\nBut it's not clear if his latest proposal, which involves instructing his \"representatives\" to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, will move the needle for the housing market in the long run, economists and analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe mortgage-bond purchasing plan, which Trump announced on Truth Social Thursday night, is a lot to grapple with for people unfamiliar with the mortgage market. But the logic behind how this could make buying a home easier goes something like this:\n\nThe plan could have a quantitative easing-like impact on the market, Oliver Allen, a senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told Business Insider. QE refers to the Fed's bond-buying program aimed at adding liquidity to the debt market and stimulating economic activity by encouraging more borrowing. However, the Fed has generally undertaken QE in times of economic turmoil, while Trump is piling into mortgage bonds while the economy is doing pretty well.\n\nThe president's plan has already moved mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped from 6.21% to 5.99% on Friday morning, according to Mortgage News Daily. That's the lowest level in about three years, and experts are optimistic that rates could fall further.\n\nZelman & Associates, a boutique housing research firm, estimated that mortgage rates could fall slightly below 6% under the new MBS purchasing plan, down from its most recent mortgage rate forecast of 6.2% for 2026.\n\nJoel Berner, a senior economist at Realtor.com, estimated that the purchasing plan could drive mortgage rates as much as 50 basis points.\n\nBut the move might be a one-time drop, and the plan may not alter the picture for housing affordability in the long run, Berner and Allen said.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump meant when he said he told his \"representatives\" to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. The timing and mechanism behind the bond purchases also remain unclear, Zelman & Associates wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nIt's also murky how much of a difference $200 billion will make in the $9 trillion MBS market, analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on Friday. The Fed, for reference, has around $2 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet, Realtor.com's Berner said.\n\nThe MBS market is the largest and most liquid in the world after US Treasurys, and buyers are plentiful. Purchasing around 2% of the total outstanding value of bonds in the market might amount to a drop in the bucket a far as impact.\n\n\"Without that same level of scale and credibility, any impact on mortgage rates would likely be modest and short-lived,\" Berner wrote.\n\n\"I don't think this policy on its own can really do very much,\" Allen said.\n\nWhile borrowing costs have been a barrier to homebuyers in recent years, the real issue is supply. A lack of available homes has been the key constraint to truly making housing affordable for more Americans, Berner said. By some estimates, the US is short 5 million homes, or 3.7% of the current supply.\n\nShould rates come down without an increase in housing inventory, that could actually worsen affordability by intensifying competition in the housing market and causing home prices to rise.\n\n\"The long-term real impact is on the supply side. So this demand boost might help in the short run, might boost sales activity, potentially might boost prices or stabilize prices at least, but we don't really see this as a long-run solution,\" Berner told Business Insider.\n\n\"I think even if you can nudge down mortgage rates at the margin, you're still going to have very high home prices and very stretched affordability as a result,\" Allen said.\n\nTaken along with Trump's ban on large investors buying single-family homes, the MBS plan shows that the administration is keenly aware that affordability is an issue for many Americans—and a potential political liability as the midterms approach.\n\nHousing has been a crucial focus for Trump all throughout his second term, but the president's zeal for making housing cheaper appears to have picked up as campaign season approaches, Allen noted.\n\n\"They're throwing a lot of darts at the board right now,\" Berner said, referring to the president's other initiatives, like introducing a 50-year mortgage and banning big investors from purchasing homes. \"I think they're just trying to pull out all the stops.\"",

    "description": "Internal emails show Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang urging teams to to address DGX Spark backlash, highlighting its approach to responding to customers.",
    "fullText": "An internal Nvidia email chain revealed how senior executives at the chip giant — including founder and CEO Jensen Huang — mobilized in response to customer criticism of a key product launch late last year.\n\nThe thread offers a glimpse into how the company responds to public backlash as it expands products designed for individual developers and researchers.\n\nThe thread, which Business Insider has seen, centered on the launch of DGX Spark, a desktop AI system designed for developers and researchers to build AI products and work on apps for data science, medicine, and other fields.\n\nWhile much of Nvidia's business targets data center customers, Huang underscored Spark's significance in the thread, calling it the \"ultimate developer's platform — out of the box easy to run all NVIDIA.\"\n\nSpark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAnshel Sag, a Moor Insights & Strategy analyst who has tracked Nvidia launches for 15 years and was an early DGX Spark tester, said the company's long experience releasing graphics cards in the gaming industry — where products are routinely scrutinized — has made it adept at handling public feedback, with Huang typically keeping a close eye on new releases.\n\nIn recent years, the company has become even more reactive, Sag said, due to increased internal resources and \"sensitivity about the stock price and how negative sentiment can draw that down.\"\n\nIn the fall of last year, AstraZeneca executive director Justin Johnson wrote in a LinkedIn post that while the DGX Spark met performance and speed claims, the software experience was buggy and unstable.\n\nAfter an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.\n\n\"Jump on x and say you will fix,\" he wrote.\n\nSubsequently, an Nvidia engineer replied that the company had reached out to Johnson to resolve most of the issues, which were related to a version mismatch of CUDA, Nvidia's software that allows developers to build AI apps powered by its GPUs.\n\nJohnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.\n\nFollowing Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.\n\nStaffers tracked complaints and engaged directly with key critics who raised concerns about DGX Spark's performance, heating issues, and pricing.\n\nAnother incident involved the researcher Christopher Kouzios, who wrote on LinkedIn that he'd purchased DGX Spark to conduct medical research after his daughter died from a rare brain tumor, with the goal of studying cancer risk in his sons.\n\nKouzios said software incompatibility had rendered the system unusable and that he'd only received an automated acknowledgment 38 hours after filing a support ticket.\n\nAfter an Nvidia executive flagged the post, team members said they were fixing the bug, according to the emails. The executive later circulated an updated post in which Kouzios lauded Nvidia's customer support.\n\n\"While the situation initially frustrated me, Nvidia's response time was exceptional,\" Kouzios told Business Insider. \"In more than 33 years working with large technology companies, I have never seen an organization respond that quickly to public technical feedback.\"\n\nIt's often standard for hardware to ship without fully finished software, Sag said, adding that Nvidia tends to be more \"high-touch\" than other tech companies in fielding complaints — an approach that flows down from an exceptionally \"hands-on\" CEO.\n\nNvidia has previously faced some launch hiccups and early criticism for new products, such as its Blackwell rollout, which encountered manufacturing challenges.\n\nWhile a CEO's involvement is notable and Nvidia's backchannel efforts appeared to placate critics, such an approach isn't without risks, another analyst said.\n\n\"C-suite engagement during product controversies has become more common in tech, particularly for founder-led companies,\" said Kate Holterhoff, a senior industry analyst at RedMonk. \"It can signal authenticity and accountability, but it also carries reputational risk if the response is perceived as defensive or dismissive.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen will soon lose another longtime lieutenant.\n\nStuart Brown, the longtime head of trading for Viking Global, is stepping down from the $55 billion asset manager to take a career break, two people familiar with the move told Business Insider. The firm declined to comment, and Brown could not be reached for comment.\n\nBrown was at the long-running Tiger Cub, a nickname for hedge funds that spun out of late billionaire Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, for 18 years, according to his bio on the firm's website. He joined the firm after working on the corporate credit sales desk at Credit Suisse.\n\nOne of the people close to the firm said Brown's official departure date is not yet known. Brown will help the firm during a transition period, this person said.\n\nViking has lost several senior members of its team in recent years, which now numbers 275 employees, according to the firm's site.\n\nFrom the investing side, Ning Jin, the former chief investment officer of Viking, left the firm in August 2024 to start his own fund, Avantyr Capital.\n\nOn the operations side of the business, the firm's former general counsel, Andrew Genser, joined former Viking portfolio manager Divya Nettimi's fund, Avala Global, last summer. Viking's director of recruiting, Kevin Curtis, moved to Bobby Jain's eponymous fund in September 2025, and the firm's former investor relations head, Savina Boyadjieva, just started as a partner at Joshua Kushner's Thrive Capital.\n\nWhile Viking's peers include long-short equity funds such as Tiger Global, Coatue, Lone Pine, D1, Maverick, and others, the firm is not as tech-heavy as some of the other Tiger Cubs. In some years, such as 2022, this can help the manager, but when mega-stocks like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft drive a bulk of the market's returns, it can lead to Viking missing out on some gains.\n\nLast year was an example of this: Viking returned less than 9% on the year in its flagship fund, a person close to the manager said, less than the S&P 500 index.",

    "fullText": "Amazon is beefing up its physical retail game with a new big-box store concept that goes well beyond groceries.\n\nVillage officials in Orland Park, Illinois, voted on Tuesday to approve Amazon's plan to build a 228,000-square-foot mega store near Chicago. That's roughly the size of a newer, larger Walmart Supercenter.\n\nPlanning documents said the facility would offer both groceries and general merchandise, as well as other services and prepared food options. Customers would also be able to place and receive online orders on-site.\n\nKatie Jahnke Dale, an attorney for Amazon, told the planning commission that the plan is \"a more purpose-built and thoughtful\" approach to traditional big-box stores, according to the Orland Park Patch.\n\n\"This is a retail concept, a retail store, albeit with perhaps a larger storeroom in the back, which will allow us to enhance the customer experience,\" she said.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the store was one way the company is experimenting with making customers' lives easier.\n\n\"The site in question is our planned location for a new concept that we think customers will be excited about,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nIf all this sounds familiar, it's probably because hypermarkets like this one have been a staple of American retail since 1988, when Walmart opened its first Supercenter outside St. Louis. Walmart now has about 4,600 US stores.\n\nOf course, Amazon is no stranger to physical retail — at least in comparatively smaller formats.\n\nThe company operates 58 Amazon Fresh grocery stores, 14 Go convenience locations, and more than 500 Whole Foods Markets.\n\nAmazon said that more than 150 million US shoppers get groceries from the company, generating over $100 billion in sales in 2024.\n\nWhere those stores primarily focus on food, the new plan calls for a much broader range of merchandise, such as housewares or apparel, that can complement grocery shoppers' carts.\n\nAs traditional retailers like Walmart and Target ramp up their e-commerce efforts, Amazon is taking a few pages from the brick-and-mortar playbook as well.\n\nThis expansion comes a month after Business Insider reported that Amazon has been developing a \"rush\" pickup service, which would allow shoppers to collect their orders at Amazon-owned stores within an hour.\n\nThe company is also testing a fulfillment-only store concept that it expects to bring 30-minute delivery to customers in Seattle and Philadelphia.",

    "description": "The president uses digital media to get his message across — but he really loves old media like newspapers and cable TV.",
    "fullText": "Last fall, Donald Trump filed a $15 billion defamation suit against The New York Times. That suit is still ongoing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sat down with Times reporters at the White House for a 2-hour interview, where he expounded on his worldview, conducted an off-the-record conversation with the president of Colombia, and showed off new plans to renovate the West Wing.\n\nIf that surprises you, it shouldn't. Trump, and the rest of his administration, love to complain about the Times and other big, mainstream media outfits. They also love talking to them.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, key Trump advisor Stephen Miller appeared on CNN for a much-discussed interview with Jake Tapper, where he laid out a bellicose view of America's role in the world.\n\nA few days before that, Trump talked to The Wall Street Journal — another publication he's currently suing — for a story about his health and fitness.\n\nAnd last month Vanity Fair published a lengthy profile of Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, which involved multiple interviews with Wiles and portraits of her and other Trump officials, including Miller, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump has made mainstream media a target since he started running for president in 2015, calling reports he doesn't like \"fake news,\" and labeling journalists \"enemies of the people.\" He's called for a change in US libel law, so he can more easily punish journalists, and he often insists that TV networks that irk him should have their broadcast licenses revoked.\n\nAnd his rhetoric and actions have ramped up in his second term, where he has banned the Associated Press from events in the Oval Office, stocked the White House briefing room with Trump-friendly outlets, and pushed out all mainstream reporters from the Pentagon.\n\nAll of that should worry anyone who cares about press freedom — or in less lofty terms, the ability of the press to accurately tell you what's happening in the federal government.\n\nThe flip of that is quite simple: Trump is a man who grew up in a world dominated by traditional media — newspapers and television — and he still cares very much about what traditional media says about him, no matter what he says. That's why he delights in constant press appearances in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and anywhere else reporters have cameras, microphones, and notepads.\n\nI often think of an AP photo from last spring, shortly after he'd announced his initial, chaotic tariff plan, that shows him perusing the New York Post's coverage of that plan in the back of his limousine. We focus a lot of attention on Trump's ability to use Twitter, YouTube, podcasts, and other digital media to shape public perception. But he's very much an old media guy — print, broadcast, cable.\n\nAnd as long as those things still exist, Trump will want to be in them and flattered by their coverage. Which explains why he can sue them and invite them into his office at the same time.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance called employees back to the office five days a week. CEO David Ellison said there had already been \"increased productivity.\"",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance's return-to-office push is underway, and CEO David Ellison is taking a moment to thank staffers for showing up.\n\nStarting Monday, Paramount employees assigned to the company's New York and Los Angeles offices were expected to return to the office five days a week, as announced by Ellison in September. (Some workers, including those who aren't assigned to an office, are in \"Phase 2\" of the RTO rollout, with more details coming later this year.)\n\nStaffers who couldn't, or wouldn't, make the change were offered a severance package, which the company said about 600 workers took.\n\n\"I know that returning to the office full-time has been an adjustment for many, and I truly appreciate the flexibility and commitment you've shown,\" Ellison said in a companywide email on Friday afternoon, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nEllison added that \"the positive energy and increased productivity that come from being together in-person are already evident.\"\n\nThe Paramount CEO had said in a September memo announcing the five-day RTO push that \"in-person collaboration is absolutely vital to building and strengthening our culture and driving the success of our business.\"\n\nIn his latest missive, Ellison also thanked the \"RTO Task Force\" that got its offices ready for a surge of workers returning.\n\nParamount isn't alone in calling its employees back to the office. Several major media companies, including Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, have asked their staff to return to in-person work.\n\nNBCUniversal instructed thousands of employees to return to its offices starting on January 5, although it's only requiring four days a week of in-person work. As with Paramount, staffers who didn't want to return to the office were offered severance packages.\n\nRead Ellison's full memo to employees here:\n\nAs we wrap up our first week back together in our LA and NY offices, I want to thank each of you for your dedication, professionalism, and teamwork. I know that returning to the office full-time has been an adjustment for many, and I truly appreciate the flexibility and commitment you've shown. The positive energy and increased productivity that come from being together in-person are already evident, and it's great to see.\n\nA special thank you to our RTO Task Force and all the teams involved for their hard work behind the scenes to prepare for our return and to ensure the transition was smooth and welcoming for everyone.\n\nIt's hard to believe we launched the new Paramount just five months ago, and in that short time we haven't just set a strategy — we've acted on it. In the process, we've made real and meaningful progress against our North Star priorities. From day one, our goal has been clear: to transform Paramount for the future by championing great storytellers, investing in world-class technology, and making bold, thoughtful moves that position us to help define the next era of entertainment. That's exactly what we've been doing — and it's what we'll continue to do together.\n\nWhile the coming year will bring its share of challenges, it will also be exciting. We've set ambitious goals, and we're confident we have the strategy, the momentum, and — most importantly — the team to achieve them. Your expertise, resilience, and commitment give me tremendous confidence in what we can accomplish. I am grateful for your efforts and incredibly proud to work alongside you.\n\nThanks again for a great first week back together. Let's go!",

    "description": "Robotaxi reporter Lloyd Lee breaks down what he saw — and heard — on the ground at the world's largest consumer tech show, CES, in Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The race to dominate the robotaxi space may not be as close as some companies suggest.\n\nLloyd Lee, Business Insider's reporter covering robotaxis and emerging mobility tech, went to CES for the first time to check out the autonomous service from Zoox, Vay, and other providers. Lee, who has taken a few rides with robotaxis recently entering the market, said the experience sharpened his view that one company appears to be significantly ahead — and that the industry still faces major hurdles before the vehicles can truly go mainstream.\n\nIn the Q&A below with BI News Chief Steve Russolillo, Lee breaks down his biggest takeaways from CES, the most impressive tech he saw, and how the experience will shape his coverage in the year ahead.\n\nSteve Russolillo: Lloyd, this is your first time at CES. What are your impressions and biggest takeaways from the event?\n\nLloyd Lee: First, CES is a massive event. It is humanly impossible to stop by every booth no matter how militant you are with your time. Second, I was struck by how much space the convention was dedicated to automobility. I agree with what Paul Costa, a 25-year Apple veteran who worked on the company's self-driving car project and is now at Ford, told me: CES has become a car show as much as it remains a tech show.\n\nRussolillo: What's the craziest and wildest piece of new technology that you saw?\n\nLee: Hyundai Motor Group's booth had a really impressive display of how far it's trying to take autonomy — from EV charging stations and robotaxis to robotic arms and humanoid robots. Boston Dynamics, a Hyundai unit, demoed its Atlas humanoid robot at the booth. Just the way it activates and stands up is terrifying and awe-striking at the same time.\n\nRussolillo: You cover robotaxis for BI and had the opportunity to test drive two different robotaxis this week. What stood out to you the most?\n\nLee: I tried two robotaxi services for the first time, including Amazon's Zoox. There are obviously a lot of smart people working on this technology. But I have to say: Trying those services only made me realize 1.) how far ahead Waymo is or at least appears to be, and 2.) just how difficult it is to make a profitable business case for robotaxis right now.\n\nGetting autonomous driving right is only part of the challenge. There's also the operations side — like fleet scaling and management — that Waymo has had to build up to help make robotaxis feel like a real autonomous ride-hailing service you can use in your day-to-day. (That is if you live in the city Waymo operates.) And even then, we know Waymo is burning money on its service.\n\nRussolillo: What are some of the predictions you've heard from sources about tech, AI and business?\n\nLee: Chris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte with expertise in software-defined vehicles, had a few interesting points.\n\nRussolillo: What startup you never heard before really stole the show and impressed you?\n\nLee: Perhaps less stole the show, but I thought Vay, a German startup developing a driverless car rental service, reminded me that there's still room for some contrarian voices in the driverless space. Remote driving is the big bogeyman for robotaxi companies. You don't want to be caught using it. This startup's entire business model is built around it. Vay is using remote driving — with a potential to pursue autonomy in the future — for a small fraction of the overall driving experience: Getting the car delivered to a renter without a human inside. It was a \"Huh, I never thought about that\" moment.\n\nRussolillo: What did you learn that might change how you go about your tech coverage for BI?\n\nLee: Broadly, emerging technologies like humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and, more generally, AI, contain a lot of unknowns and uncertainties. And company leaders in those spaces can be evasive when you ask for specifics, or they simply don't know the answer. Possibly both. My instinct is to resolve that ambiguity, which in this space, will not always be realistic. Instead, I should write to the uncertainty, not through it. Name the ambiguity, build the story around it.",

    "fullText": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' luxe private jet is off the market after reportedly raking in millions through charters while the disgraced music mogul sits in prison.\n\nSilver Air Private Jets, a private aviation company that previously managed charters for the plane, confirmed to Business Insider in January that Combs sold the Gulfstream G550 in October 2025.\n\nIt's unclear what the plane sold for. Online listings show pre-owned G550s built that year typically sell for between $20 million and $30 million, depending on factors such as total hours and maintenance status.\n\nRegistration data shows the matte-black jet now bears the new tail number T7-OKS. The T7 prefix means the plane is registered in San Marino, a landlocked microstate surrounded by Italy known for its banking sector and tax perks for the wealthy.\n\nFederal records show the jet was previously registered as N1969C and owned by the Combs-owned entity LoveAir LLC. That tail number has been reserved by the same company since November 3, 2025.\n\nCombs' attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nThe ex-Diddy G550 was built in 2015 and features a black exterior and beige interiors. It can hold 14 passengers, is pet-friendly, and features an entertainment system, according to now-deleted charter listings.\n\nIn the months after Combs' September 2024 arrest and indictment on federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, the jet took dozens of flights to places like French Polynesia, New Zealand, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Baja, Mexico, according to JetSpy data.\n\nChartering the jet was likely a temporary money-maker for Combs.\n\nWhile the specific jet is not mentioned by name in any of the suits against Combs, several lawsuits accuse him of flying his alleged sexual abuse victims on private or commercial planes or of procuring illicit drugs via plane. Combs has repeatedly denied committing sexual assault.\n\nSince the slew of lawsuits began in 2023, Combs' business empire — which once included a lucrative deal with Diageo, a catalog of music hits, and a successful clothing line — has crumbled.\n\nCombs' trial ended in July 2025. The jury cleared him of the more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, but convicted him on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He was sentenced to 50 months in prison, plus a $500,000 fine.\n\nHe maintains ownership of a pair of mansions on Miami's Star Island, as well as valuable jewelry and art collections.\n\nCombs also owns a mansion in Los Angeles that was listed for sale for $61.5 million in September 2024, weeks before his arrest. He reportedly delisted the home in December 2025 after it struggled to sell amid its history.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in November 2024 but has been updated with the status of Combs' private jet.",

    "description": "Countries worldwide have eyes on Greenland for its natural resources, but the island only has one fully operational mine. We visited to find out why.",
    "fullText": "Greenland has no shortage of valuable minerals. What it lacks is almost everything else needed to extract them.\n\nGreenland is one of the most logistically hostile environments on the planet — a place with no roads between towns, limited labor, and weather that can shut down operations without warning.\n\nStill, world leaders and investors across the globe have their eyes on the island for its natural resources, including copper, zinc, graphite, gold, and rare earth elements that can be used in everything from construction and manufacturing to electronics and defense systems.\n\nAs the US, Europe, and other countries look to diversify supply chains away from China, Greenland has drawn renewed attention as a potential alternative. President Donald Trump's latest remarks that the US should annex Greenland for national security reasons — triggering an outcry from its citizens — have also drawn attention to the island and its strategic value.\n\nThere is only one fully operational mine in Greenland. Business Insider's Sarah Andersen visited the mine in June to see why it remains open while others have shut down — and why the island's vast mineral wealth hasn't translated into a mining boom.\n\nYou always have to plan several steps ahead when operating in Greenland, said Bent Olsvig Jensen, managing director of Lumina Sustainable Materials.\n\n\"We have to think of everything because we cannot just pick up the phone and expect spare parts to be available the next morning,\" he said in June.\n\nLumina Sustainable Materials — a private science and mining company group with operations in Greenland, the US, Mexico, and the European Union — operates the island's only fully active mine, located deep inside a fjord system with no road access.\n\nThe mine produces an industrial mineral called anorthosite, used in fiberglass, construction materials, and other industrial applications.\n\nAside from what they've built, which includes a camp, a plant, a warehouse, a harbor, and a small gym and clinic, there is no other infrastructure supporting the site. Everything, including the crew, arrives by ship during the ice-free months or by helicopter when the fjord freezes over for months on end, Jensen said. (Andersen arrived via an eight-hour boat trip from the capital, Nuuk.)\n\nWhen something breaks, there is no overnight delivery.\n\n\"Sometimes you can wait for spare parts for a week or two,\" Dennis Jensen (no relation to Bent Jensen) said during Andersen's visit to the mine. Jensen is the mine's site manager who oversees operations through the long, dark winters, where temperatures can dip to -22°F. When that happens, \"we are not working outside,\" he said.\n\nWinter storms can ground helicopters for days, delaying crew changes and keeping workers on-site longer than planned, Dennis Jensen added.\n\nOn average, \"it takes 16 years to develop a mine, right from the first idea to the actual mine,\" Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister responsible for natural resources, including minerals, said in June.\n\nFor most of that time, \"you spend money, you don't make a lot of money,\" she said.\n\nIt took Lumina 11 years, for example, to get from exploration to production. Exploration started in 2008 and reached final production in 2019, Bent said.\n\nGreenland has over 100 mineral licenses, spanning early exploration to advanced stages. Many projects stall long before reaching operation, often because they cannot secure long-term financing, Nathanielsen said.\n\nPeople mistakenly think they can begin to extract the minerals on day one, but they can't, Majken Djurhuus Poulsen, a geologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told Andersen during her visit.\n\nParts of Greenland host some of the oldest bedrock on the planet, billions of years old, Poulsen said. That history has created many different types of mineral deposits, but the conditions make exploration slow.\n\n\"You can only do exploration for three to four months a year,\" when areas are ice-free enough, she added.\n\nOn top of that, Poulsen said sites can be difficult to get to, often requiring helicopters that push costs higher. There's rarely any infrastructure, so you have to build everything from scratch — from the mine to where workers will live. After all that, identifying a promising deposit can take years, sometimes decades, she added.\n\nAs a result, mining requires investors who are willing to wait years without returns and have a high tolerance for risk. Nathanielsen said Greenland lacks the domestic capital to fund that process and depends heavily on foreign investment.\n\n\"It is quite sobering in terms of trying to keep your providers of capital,\" James Kiernan, honorary chairman of Cordiant Capital, a Canadian multinational investment management firm and one of Lumina's major backing investors, told Andersen in July.\n\nKiernan pointed to multiple examples of mines affected as market realities shifted.\n\n\"There was a mine called Ruby that was open, and they were trying to find rubies. They were open and closed and open and closed,\" he said, referring to the Greenland Ruby mine and describing the stop-start pattern that has defined many efforts on the island.\n\nAt the same time, the government has kept strict environmental and social standards.\n\nBefore any project moves forward, Nathanielsen said companies must answer two questions: Will it create jobs for Greenlanders, and how will it protect the environment?\n\n\"If the project owners cannot answer those two questions on a satisfactory level, if they cannot provide the people with a good answer, they will meet opposition,\" she said.\n\nLumina's success in navigating that process is in part due to its long planning horizons, close coordination with the government, and a business model designed around Greenland's constraints.\n\nStill, the mine has yet to turn a profit, Kiernan told Andersen during a follow-up call on Friday.\n\nBut Bent Jensen and Kiernan said that after years of operating in Greenland's challenging conditions, the company is well-positioned to apply that know-how to other mining projects, and Lumina has recently secured an exploration license to search for rare earth minerals.\n\nMore mines could unlock a new future for Greenlanders, helping pave a path toward greater autonomy as the island seeks to develop new revenue streams to eventually become financially independent from Denmark.\n\nHowever, a mining boom isn't likely at any point soon, Bent Jensen said.\n\n\"I see Greenland developing slowly because it needs to develop organically with the population, with the politicians,\" he said. \"It will be one mine at a time.\"",

    "description": "Barry Pollack represented Nicolás Maduro in court on Monday. Another attorney, Bruce Fein, says he's also the Venezuelan politician's lawyer.",
    "fullText": "When Nicolás Maduro showed up in Manhattan federal court Monday morning — having been hauled by the federal government 2,000 miles from Caracas — he was represented by attorney Barry Pollack.\n\nPollack, best known for representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange, with vast experience in both criminal and international law, told the judge in Maduro's initial appearance that he'd be raising motions objecting to the legality of how United States forces captured the now former Venezuelan president.\n\nOn Tuesday, Maduro appeared to add another experienced legal hand to his team: Bruce Fein, a former high-ranking Justice Department official during the Reagan administration, and an expert on civil liberties and international law.\n\nThe addition of Fein quickly caused a ruckus that's been playing out on the court docket.\n\nOn Thursday night — after US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who is overseeing the case, approved Fein's motion to represent Maduro — Pollack wrote that Maduro had never even spoken to Fein. He asked Hellerstein to remove Fein from the case.\n\n\"I confirmed with Mr. Maduro that he does not know Mr. Fein and has not communicated with Mr. Fein, much less retained him, authorized him to enter an appearance, or otherwise hold himself out as representing Mr. Maduro,\" Pollack wrote in a court document.\n\nPollack said he had made several attempts to contact Fein to clear up the issue, but never heard back.\n\nIn a response on the court docket Friday afternoon, Fein said that he believes he's rightfully Maduro's lawyer.\n\nHe asked the judge to personally interview Maduro in his courthouse chambers in lower Manhattan and determine who the jailed Venezuelan leader wants on his legal team.\n\nFein said he hasn't had any \"telephone, video, or other direct contact with President Maduro.\"\n\nBut, Fein said, people who were \"credibly situated within President Maduro's inner circle or family\" had indicated that Maduro wanted Fein to represent him.\n\nThe confusion, Fein wrote, may be because Maduro was apprehended \"under extraordinary, startling, and viperlike circumstances\" and was subject to \"a foreign criminal process in a foreign tongue, fraught with the potential for misunderstandings or miscommunications.\"\n\nFein wrote that he doesn't dispute that Pollack \"believes\" Maduro didn't hire him, and that the circumstances require Hellerstein to step in personally.\n\nFein did not address in his document whether he had spoken to Pollack since Thursday night. Neither Pollack nor Fein responded to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nFederal prosecutors — who have accused Maduro of narco-terrorism, cocaine trafficking conspiracy, and machine gun-related crimes — took no position in the power struggle between Pollack and Fein, Pollack wrote in a court filing.\n\nA third Maduro lawyer, David Wikstrom, made it clear to Hellerstein that he would not be working with Maduro going forward.\n\nWikstrom was automatically appointed to be Maduro's public defender after his arrest and capture. He asked Hellerstein this week to appoint him as Maduro's lawyer — but only so that he could collect legal fees for the several hours of work he performed Monday morning to prepare for Maduro's arraignment before Pollack formally joined the case.",

Part of this, of course, is because of all the games coming out this year. From Resident Evil: Requiem to Grand Theft Auto: 6, we've got a lot to look forward to. However, there's another thing to consider when looking at the year ahead: the staggering number of series with major anniversaries.\n\nIt's hard to believe the first Donkey Kong game was released 45 years ago, and I swear I heard my knees crack as I realized that Pokemon is officially 30 years old. Nintendo in particular has a lot to celebrate this year, with big anniversaries for The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Kid Icarus, and Animal Crossing coming in addition to the games I mentioned previously. That said, both Sony and Xbox have reason to celebrate as well, as Tomb Raider turns 30 and Halo--and Xbox as a brand overall--hit 25.\n\nBut perhaps the most exciting thing to consider in light of all these anniversaries are the announcements that could be lingering just around the corner. Though we've already received confirmation that a remake of the original Tomb Raider is in the works, and other series such as Donkey Kong, Pokemon, and Resident Evil all have new or upcoming entries, there are a few games on this list that have been dormant for some time. Could 2026 be the year we get a new Kid Icarus or Castlevania? No clue, but a girl can hope, right?\n\nSo without further ado, is a round up of all the series with milestone anniversaries in 2026:",

Wonder Onesie has the most customization options of any OG pass skin thus far, as you can decorate her with any of the sprays or emoticons you have in your locker.\n\nNotably missing are the Ice King, who was Season 7's hero, and the Prisoner, who served as the season baddie. Midway through the original Season 7, the Ice King projected a gigantic magical phantom of himself standing over the island, and then unleashed a blizzard that coated the island in snow for several weeks. Presuming Fortnite OG will do that event again the way it has all the other Chapter 1 live events, it would make a lot of sense for a new Ice King skin to be on one of those hidden pages.\n\nEach of the three skins available in the Season 7 OG pass comes with a back bling, a pickaxe, a weapon wrap, a glider, and an emote. The pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and access to the pass is included while players are subscribed to Fortnite Crew, which costs $12 per month.

    "title": "I left a mom group over parenting decisions. I don't regret it.",
    "description": "I joined a mom group hoping for community, but judgment over my parenting, work, and family size pushed me to leave.",
    "fullText": "I should have sensed the judgment the minute I arrived at the first playdate with four kids in tow and another on the way. Instead, I was thrilled to finally find my \"village\" that I'd heard so much about — a group of moms who met a few times a month at nearby play spaces and coffee shops to commiserate and encourage each other.\n\nI even brushed off the first comment I was met with, which, in hindsight, should have been a warning sign. \"Wow, are they all yours?\" It wasn't the first or last time someone had a \"witty\" one-liner about my family size, which was completely on purpose and by choice, if they must know. My kids jumped into the playground with the others, and I settled in to find my new besties.\n\nThe thing about mom groups, though, is that they often aren't obviously terrible. In fact, they check all the boxes — moms at similar ages, stages, and struggles, getting together for camaraderie and community. We all had similar jogger set mom uniforms and extra-strong lattes on hand, hidden in the pockets of diaper bags to make it past \"no food or drink\" signs at indoor parks (no? Just me?).\n\nBut they aren't always necessarily a good fit. All the feelings from this almost-perfect mom group I was once a part of resurfaced when Ashley Tisdale wrote an essay in The Cut, talking openly about how her mom group turned toxic.\n\nMy first feelings that I was \"different\" came when two of the younger kids had a small collision at the bottom of a slide. They tripped, fussed a bit, and in my parenting world, were ready to get back up and carry on. I'm used to being around people with widely differing parenting styles, but not used to being judged for mine.\n\nI felt like my free-range parenting was judged by other moms who were more helicopter parents. The mom of the other kid who collided picked the child up, brushed them up, and performed a full check-up. Meanwhile, my own child popped up, whined a little, and ran off.\n\nBand-Aids and tissues were coming out to counteract tears, and a full-scale breakdown of the situation, complete with apologies and moment-by-moment recaps, had commenced. I enjoyed my coffee and didn't give it much thought. I hadn't noticed yet that my parenting style was a mismatch. To be clear, this is just my perception.\n\nSlowly but surely, questions about my family size began to infiltrate conversations. I was used to one-liners from grannies at the grocery about having my hands full, but it felt like an onslaught.\n\nIt was the same thing with my career. After the group learned I was a working mom, running my own business full-time, I started to feel like an outsider. People spoke a lot about the negative sides of daycare, and the perks of being able to be a full-time mom, Their comments made it seem they weren't interested in a different perspective, nor was there a question about why I work (because I want to) or about the immense benefits my kids have gotten through day care. I felt like there was an assumption that I was stuck in this terrible world of working motherhood against my will, with no way out.\n\nOver time, I felt like the circus spectacle, and felt I had to have all the i's dotted and t's crossed on parenting topics, to show the naysayers that I was doing just fine with many kids, rather than finding a soft landing place to vent and share.\n\nI was lonely and desperate, so I clung to my mom group. The alternative was too scary. Nobody to hang out with on a boring Saturday or text when things get tough. It's not just me — two-thirds of parents find the role isolating and lonely. But one day, I realized the abyss was better than the alternative.\n\nThis was the day they moved all the get-togethers to 10 a.m. on weekdays. They knew exactly where I'd be at 10 a.m. every weekday — working.\n\nAlthough I haven't found a similar style group, I realized that instead of looking for a whole village of besties, my village was already around me. It just didn't look like 10 moms with lattes at play group. Instead, it involves the trainer who asks if my kid is over his third bout of strep, or my mom's friend who texts me with some press-on nails she likes that would look good on me.\n\nMy real friends don't demand we have precisely only 1.5 children, helicopter around our babies, or only wear pink on Wednesdays.",

    "description": "Delete or disable apps you don't need.",
    "fullText": "Any new phone almost certainly comes with a handful of preinstalled apps you'll never use, regardless of which manufacturer you buy from or which operating system you're on. Some devices are more bloated than others: Google Pixels have a relatively \"clean\" build compared to Samsung phones, for example, and don't typically come with third-party apps and games.\n\nBut you may still want to eliminate apps and features that clutter your home screen, take up valuable space, and create a drag on performance, especially if you have alternatives you like more. On Android, that likely means uninstalling what you easily can and disabling everything else.\n\nUnfortunately, many preinstalled first-party apps can't be easily removed. This varies by manufacturer and device—for example, Pixel users can uninstall Google Play Games and Books but are stuck with Chrome, Drive, Maps, and Calculator. As HowToGeek points out, you can delete other pre-selected Google apps added during initial setup, such as the Pixel Watch app and NotebookLM.\n\nOn Samsung Galaxy phones, again, some preinstalled bloatware is locked in, but ZDNET calls out five native apps that most users should delete right away: Global Goals, Samsung Free, Samsung TV Plus, Samsung Shop, and Samsung Kids.\n\nTo uninstall an app on your Pixel, go to the Google Play Store and tap the Profile icon. Tap Manage apps & devices > Manage, select the app you want to remove, and tap Uninstall. On Samsung, go to Settings > Apps, tap the app name, and tap Uninstall > OK. You can also touch and hold the app icon on your home screen and tap or drag to uninstall.\n\nIf you're absolutely set on removing preinstalled apps that can't be deleted using the above steps, you can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), but these methods are more advanced.\n\nBuilt-in apps that aren't in use can be disabled, which hides the icon from your app drawer. They'll still take up space, but at least they'll be out of sight. Most preinstalled apps can be disabled if you don't need them, with the exception of critical system apps.\n\nOn your Pixel, go to Settings > Apps > See all apps to select individual apps, and tap Disable at the top of the screen. You can hide preinstalled Samsung apps from your home screen settings: tap Hide apps and tap the icon of the apps you want to disable, the press Done.",

    "description": "Get the most out of your Kindle.",
    "fullText": "The Kindle has become the default e-reader for many bookworms, and I get it. I've used Kindles for well over a decade, and I've enjoyed using my latest Paperwhite quite a bit. It helped me read more than 30 books last year, so I'm not complaining.\n\nThe basic Kindle setup is okay, but if you learn your way around the device's gestures, hidden features, and additional services, you can really get a lot out of this unassuming reading device.\n\nThere’s only one button on the Kindle. Everything else happens using touch. And like every touchscreen device, there are countless gestures you need to know to use the device. The most obvious ones are for the page turns. You can swipe or tap right to go to the next page and swipe or tap left for the previous one. If you have a Paperwhite Signature Edition, you can also double tap on the back or sides of the device to move to the next page.\n\nTap on the top of the Kindle to bring up the toolbar, where you can go back to the Home screen, change the settings, view the table of contents, and more.\n\nIf you tap the bottom left corner, you can cycle between different stats like reading progress, page number, time left in chapter, and more. Oh, and if you want to quickly change the font size, just pinch in or out to zoom in on the text (like you would zoom into images on your phone).\n\nWant to take a screenshot of what’s on your Kindle screen? Tap any two opposite corners of the screen together (top-right and bottom-left or top-left and bottom-right). The screen will flash for a second, and the image will be saved as a PNG in the root directory. Connect your Kindle to your Mac or PC to retrieve the image file.\n\nThe Kindle isn’t the easiest device to navigate, especially when you’re reading a book where you need to jump between different chapters. Here, again, a hidden gesture can help. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up a new Page Flip mode. You’ll see a slider at the bottom, which you can use to move forward and back. There are buttons to jump to the next chapter as well (I use this all the time).\n\nIf you love reading in bed, you’ll want to enable dark mode. Pull down from the top edge to bring up the quick settings panel. Here, tap the Dark Mode button to quickly invert the colors. You’ll now read white text on a black background. While you’re here, also check out the Warm Light settings (if you have a Kindle Paperwhite, Oasis, or Scribe). Use the slider to increase the warmth of the screen, making it more amber-toned.\n\nThis is especially useful for reading in the evenings or at night, but I like it so much I keep it enabled at all times. You can also set your color temperature to change on a schedule, so that the display slowly warms up in the evening hours. Do this under Settings > Device Options > Display Settings > Schedule.\n\nNot everyone needs to know what’s on your Kindle, right? If you read a lot in school, or public areas, you can lock down your Kindle using an optional setting. Go to Settings > Device Options > Security and Privacy > Device PIN. You can then set a numeric unlock code up to 12 digits long, but it might be easier to stick to a four or six-digit code.\n\nReading on your Kindle doesn’t need to be limited to books you buy from the Kindle store. In fact, you can send any PDF or DRM-free ebook to your Kindle, and wirelessly. I have previously outlined multiple methods for doing this, ranging from using an email address, to using the Kindle app. But the one I keep coming back to is Amazon’s own Send to Kindle website. Open it on any browser, sign in with your account, drag and drop a document in a supported format (.DOC, .DOCX, .HTML, .TXT, .PDF and .EPUB), and send it off. Once you sync your Kindle using Wi-Fi, these documents will be available to read on it, just like that.\n\nEvery time I set up a new Kindle, I’m surprised that this is a feature that I still need to enable manually. By default, Kindles shows a couple of images as screensavers when turned off. That's because of the e-ink display, which lets them show a static image without using power. These default screensavers, though, are boring. You can make this feature much more interesting (and useful) by showing the cover of the book you were last reading as the screensaver instead. Go to Settings > Device Options and enable the Display Cover feature.\n\nKindle’s built-in browser is pretty barebones and laggy, but you can still read long articles on it. For a smoother experience, though, you can wirelessly send articles to your Kindle, where they’ll show up in form of books, devoid of ads, formatting, and images.\n\nThe simplest way to do this is by using Amazon’s Send to Kindle Chrome extension. Visit a page, trigger the extension, and send it off to your e-reader.\n\nIf you don’t use Chrome, you can also use a dedicated service like Push to Kindle to send articles to your Kindle. You can send up to 10 articles a month for free, and a $2.99/month plan unlocks all limits.\n\nIf you’re using your Kindle to research or read non-fiction books for school or work, you’ll end up with a lot of highlights. Those highlights, just sitting in your Kindle, aren’t that useful. Amazon has a dedicated website that lists all the highlights from all the books you’ve purchased via the Kindle Store, but it's not your only option.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Clippings, which also works for content not bought from the Kindle Store. With it, you can import all the highlights and notes from your Kindle books and personal documents using a browser extension. You can view and organize all your notes from your browser, too, but if you want to export them to a document, you’ll need to pay for a $1.99/month Professional plan.\n\nThere are many places where you can rent and borrow books to read legally and for free. The most popular option is using the Libby app from Overdrive, which loans you books via your library card or student ID. In the Libby app, go to Shelf > Loans > Read With... > Kindle. Here, sign in with your Amazon account and verify your Kindle device. Then, tap Get Library Book. Voila, an ebook from your local library will instantly show up on your Kindle device.\n\nLastly, you can take inspiration from my colleague Pranay, who uses his Kindle without any Amazon services. You can set up a Kindle without an Amazon account and use it as a perfectly good e-reader. You can buy DRM-free books online from various sources and transfer them to your Kindle simply by transferring the ebook files to your Kindle storage or using the Send to Kindle feature I talked about above.",

    "description": "You can't permanently disable these short-form clips, however.",
    "fullText": "Internet videos have always been addicting, but short-form content is a whole other beast. Whatever platform you watch them on, these brief clips pull you in and don't let go, and, before you know it, you've mindlessly scrolled through hours of videos, most of which you'll never remember watching.\n\nYouTube Shorts are no exception. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, short-form content is not the main source of videos on the platform. YouTube, of course, hosts long-form videos first and foremost, and is the sole reason why many of us visit the site or app. Shorts are just an afterthought, but an afterthought that YouTube pushes hard. You might hop on to watch a specific video, or check out new content from your subscriptions, but to do so, you'll have to push past rows of \"Shorts\" all vying for your attention. God help your afternoon if you accidentally click on one.\n\nIf you like YouTube Shorts, please disregard. But for the rest of us that just want to find and watch standard videos on YouTube, there's now some respite: As part of a larger update to search filters and content discovery, YouTube is now allowing users to filter out Shorts in searches. The company is pitching this as a way to separate searches between either Shorts or traditional videos, but you'll never catch me searching specifically for Shorts. What YouTube has done here, at least for users like myself, is to create a way to exclude Shorts from any particular search.\n\nTo start, open YouTube and search for something. You should now see a series of options along the top of the display, one of which is \"Videos.\" Choose it, and you'll reload the search with only long-form videos. Huzzah. You can also do the same from the greater search filters settings: On desktop, when the results appear, select \"Filters\" in the top right then look for \"Type\" on the left of the \"Search filters\" pop-up window. On mobile, tap the three dots icon, then choose \"Search filters.\" On both platforms, you'll find the \"Videos\" option here.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't something you can set and forget: You'll need to choose this option every time you search for something, which is definitely a bummer. That said, at least there's some way to filter Shorts out of a search—especially if those Shorts were impacting your ability to find what you were looking for in the first place.\n\nYouTube might not ever let us disable Shorts completely, but there are tools to get around them. You can choose to limit how many Shorts you watch in any given day—though the guardrails aren't necessarily strict. The company also lets you tell them to show you fewer Shorts on the home page, but if that's not enough, you can also install an extension to block Shorts from your feeds.\n\nIn addition to this new Shorts filter, YouTube made some adjustments to filters and sorting options. \"Sort By\" is now known as \"Prioritize,\" and while YouTube doesn't say whether it changed the function, it does say the menu \"aims to maximize utility.\" The company also changed the \"View count\" sort option to \"Popularity.\" The menu still takes view count into consideration, but also watch time, to sort videos in a search by the algorithms' assumed popularity.\n\nFinally, YouTube is removing the \"Upload Date - Last Hour\" and \"Sort by Rating\" options from search. The company says you can still find videos uploaded most recently from the \"Upload Date\" filters.",

    "title": "The Biggest Fitness Trends at CES 2026 (and What I Think About Them)",
    "description": "Exoskeletons, rings, and smart bands were popular, but a lot of big name companies seem to be running out of ideas.",
    "fullText": "I just got back from CES 2026, and you can see my real-time reports on some of the best and weirdest things I saw in our CES 2026 live blog. I tried on six(!) different exoskeletons, perked up my ears whenever I heard about a new smart strap, and looked in vain for new models of familiar fitness tech like watches. Here are the biggest trends I noticed and some notes on what was conspicuously missing. I've included prices where possible; anything without a price is likely too far from market to have one yet.\n\nThis is a continuation of a trend that really got going in 2025. Whoop is no longer the only player in the screenless fitness strap space. Last year we saw straps from Amazfit ($99) and Polar ($199), plus a sleep band from Garmin ($169). At CES I learned about two more.\n\nThe Luna Band is likely to be the next one to market—the company’s reps said to expect it to ship sometime in the next month or two. (I plan to review it once units are available.) It will be $149, won't require a subscription, and it will use the same app as the Luna Ring, which I’m currently reviewing. Its maker, Noise, is new to the U.S. wearables market but is one of the leading smartwatch makers in India.\n\nBesides the new hardware, Noise also announced that the Luna app will soon have a system to take voice notes to give context to your health data. (This is coming to the app in the next few weeks.) For example, if you tell the app that you had a few glasses of wine, it will remember this when it sees your poor sleep the next morning, and it will adjust its recommendations accordingly—say, reminding you to hydrate, rather than telling you to take a nap.\n\nSpeediance also announced the Speediance Strap, although it doesn’t seem to be as close to market. No price has been announced, and the units at the show were clearly prototypes. The Strap will collect sleep and recovery data, without requiring a subscription to view it, although some more advanced metrics will require a premium subscription.\n\nOura has had competitors for years (and has taken up suing them to stop sales), but it seems like the number of smart rings out there is just exploding—though not all of them are fitness or health oriented. Besides Pebble’s Index 01 ($75), which is charmingly simple, there are plenty of rings that pack in more functions—NFC payments, AI voice processing, haptic alerts, and more. There are so many I can’t give a full list, but to name a few: there’s the Muse Ring One ($323), the Dreame Ring, and the Vocci AI ring.\n\nRingConn announced its third-generation ring, with blood pressure insights (I’m skeptical) and haptic alerts, including the ability to buzz for a smart alarm (I’m intrigued). This one isn’t on the market yet, and a rep at the booth asked me what price I thought it should go for. In the meantime, RingConn gave me a gen 2 ring to compare to Oura and others—watch for my review soon.\n\nThe companies that make smartwatches and fitness watches tend to be on their own release cycles, not necessarily tied to CES. Apple certainly wasn’t going to announce a new Apple Watch; Google and Fitbit didn’t show up, either. Amazfit had a new watch, the Active Max ($169) in its lineup, but it was more of a refinement to the product line than a new exciting announcement.\n\nThe only real exception I can think of is Pebble, but you’ve heard from me already on why it bucks the trend. I got to go hands-on with the Time 2 (announced last year) and the Round 2 (announced last week), which was so thin and sleek it made the Coros on my wrist feel like a big ol’ hunk of plastic. As a reminder, the Round 2 doesn’t have a heart rate monitor and Pebble is trying not to be a fitness watch brand. (I’m still looking forward to reviewing its watches anyway.)\n\nI think the main reason for the stagnation here is that watches already have everything they need to have for fitness and health tracking. There's not a lot of room left to innovate; either you give a device slightly better battery life (nice, but yawn) or you stick something else into it just to say you did—like a flashlight or a microphone. That's nothing against flashlights or microphones, which are both great in context, but we're hardly in game-changing territory anymore. Companies like Oura and Whoop are pivoting to services like blood tests that take the focus off their hardware. My colleague Stephen Johnson said it best: tech launches don't feel magical anymore, partly because we don't have many problems left that consumer tech can easily solve, and partly because every new advice adds a hassle to your life.\n\nAnd so Garmin’s main announcement this weekend was a nutrition tracking feature in its Connect+ subscription. I thought at least there was a good chance of a new watch from Garmin—nope. Garmin announced the Instinct 3 at last year’s CES, but no new hardware this year besides a camera system for truckers (I’m happy for them).\n\nA few other companies used the buzz around CES to announce non-hardware developments as well: Oura is finally shipping the charging case it promised last fall, and Ultrahuman announced a limited-time free tier of its blood testing service with 20+ markers. Its other tiers give you 50+ markers for $99, or a 100+ marker test followed by a 60+ marker follow-up test for $365. (Ultrahuman told me that the exact blood tests it's able to offer vary slightly by state, hence the vague numbers.)\n\nThere were, of course, plenty of mentions that “AI” is baked into this or that fitness app. But the companies mostly seemed to understand that while AI might help to create features their users want, users don’t buy devices for the AI. (See also: Dell executives commenting that its customers don’t seem to want AI, and that it has adjusted the marketing for its computers to de-emphasize it.)\n\nI heard at CES that apps are using AI to identify foods from photos (Garmin and Amazfit) or that AI is helping to find patterns in data (basically everybody). Merach did say it would let me try an AI-powered treadmill, but a rep apologetically told me the device wasn’t available in time to ship the prototype to CES.\n\nExoskeletons were the biggest new-to-me trend at CES. These are devices that you strap on to your body, and their motors give an added boost to what your muscles are doing. Several of the companies described them as being like an e-bike for walking.\n\nI gave myself a side quest of trying every exoskeleton that was available to demo. That ended up being a total of six: four that assisted you at the hip, one at the knee, and one at the ankle. One device made by Ascentiz ($1,299-$1,848) can be configured with combined hip and knee action, but the knee module wasn’t available for me to test.\n\nAll six devices really did give me a boost while walking (or climbing stairs—several of the companies wisely included a mini staircase in their booths to try out). But I have to wonder who the exoskeletons are really for. If you’re not a serious hiker, an exoskeleton might help you hike up a mountain and keep up with your friends. But I’d think that only a serious hiker would have $1,000+ to spend on hiking gear like an exoskeleton—and that they would probably prefer to train harder and spend the money on something else.\n\nIf I had to predict where this tech is going, I think the rental market makes the most sense. Imagine if you could borrow the Ascentiz for a scenic hike on vacation without having to train for months ahead of time, or strap on Dephy’s “powered footwear” ($4,500) to get you through a day at Disneyworld.",

    "description": "Evocative sounds from the past, complete with hiss and warp.",
    "fullText": "If you've ever been intrigued by the mystery of a dusty cassette you found in a thrift shop—or if you're just looking for a new time-sink—you have to check out Intertapes, a website that digitizes \"found cassettes\" sent in by users all over the world, then posts them in full for anyone to listen to.\n\nThe catalog is small at the moment—only 14 cassettes—but already really interesting. There's a bootleg cassette of music played at a Spanish nightclub in the late 1990s (lots of squelchy noises and relentless bass) and a 90-minute recording of New York hip hop station WBLS captured in '94 (Warren G.'s \"Regulate\" represent), amid more mysterious choices, like this haunting recording from a \"destroyed cassette tape found on the side of the coast highway near Heraklion\" in Greece; this tape full of ominous noises found in a parking lot in Tbilisi, Georgia; tape of binary code from Barcelona; and a cassette recorded in the USSR featurng 1970s pop hits.\n\nI love how each cassette is treated like an important archeological object, because in a way, they are—discreet time capsules made more poignant by the hiss and warp that speaks to the time that's passed since this audio was captured and the ephemeral nature of analogue recording. From musical snapshots to accidental field recordings, these tapes are fascinating for there mere existence in the modern day, where the question of who recorded them and why adds a layer of mystery to each one.\n\nIntertapes could be viewed as a reflection of the growing cassette tape revival, a movement that celebrates the outdated format. Since they hit the market in 1963, audiophiles have generally considered cassette tapes an inferior format to vinyl—tapes are more rugged than records, but the sound quality is markedly worse. The spread of CDs and streaming music pretty much killed off commercial cassette releases by the early 2000s, and it's easy to see why: Digital music doesn't hiss or degrade. Cassettes have a more narrow dynamic range. You can instantly select tracks on a CD or MP3 player, and it will never play at a slightly wrong speed, unspool, or melt on your car dashboard. Bonus: You never have to rewind them to hear a song again.\n\nMost people didn't see it at the time, but when tapes slipped into obsolescence, we lost something real and tangible. Dropouts, distortion, and warp are evidence of life. Cassette tape compression is a unique sonic aesthetic that conveys warmth and nostalgia. And then there's the way they impart meaning into the act of \"listening to music.\" Starting a Spotify stream is frictionless, optimized, and weightless, while cassettes are physical objects with histories that defy the disconnection of the digital space. You own the music on tapes in a way you never own information being served to you by a tech company. A friend handing you a cassette of their favorite songs is meaningful in a way a link to playlist will never be, and your Spotify playlist will never be found by the side of the road near Heraklion, to be pondered over by future people. \n\nYes, by digitizing them, Intertapes is removing some of the qualities that make these recording special—but it's also preserving them, at least for now (if you've ever tried following a decades-old weblink, you know the internet is ephemeral too).\n\nIf you're of a certain age, you probably have a dusty cassette or two hanging around somewhere. Don't let it molder in a desk drawer. Describe the origin of your recording and a background story, scan a picture of your tape, and email [email protected] to arrange you submission to the site. This collection really deserves to grow.",

    "description": "AI gadgets had to get weird to stand out at CES 2026.",
    "fullText": "AI is still the big thing in the tech world, but it's no longer the big new thing. It's been around long enough that simply integrating it into your product isn't enough to make it stand out anymore, especially at the biggest tech show in the world. While I attended this year's CES, the trend I noticed over and over again on the show floor was that AI is getting weird now. From personal hologram sidekicks to a gaming monitor that basically cheats for you, here are the five weirdest AI inventions I saw at CES 2026.\n\nAt last year's CES, gaming lifestyle company Razer introduced Project AVA, an AI esports coach concept that was just a disembodied voice that lives in your laptop. Yawn. This year, the company's expanding on that by bringing AVA into the real world.\n\nIn Razer's suite this year, I held a conversation with \"Kira,\" an anime girl \"hologram\" that lives in a little USB tube you can plug into your laptop. She noticed my orange sweater thanks to a camera installed in the tube, before asking me about the show and prompting me to start up a round of Battlefield 6, where she gave me some generic loadout advice. I spoke with her using microphones also built into her tube, and she responded using her own speaker rather than the laptop's. Razer said this demo was more directed, hence why she brought up gaming right away, but that the end goal is to let the new AVA work as a convincing all-purpose AI companion, so you don't have to use it for only play.\n\nTo that end, the company says it's \"AI agnostic,\" so you can plug your own model into it. The demo I ran through was clearly using Grok, and generally felt a lot like talking to the AI companions built into that app, right down to the cringeworthy jokes. But Razer said you could theoretically use ChatGPT or Gemini instead.\n\nWhile we were chatting, Kira played animations courtesy of Animation Inc., which powers similar but more app-driven AI companions. In other words, the chatbot and the animations aren't really new here, so what you'd be buying would be the USB tube and the characters.\n\nKira isn't your only option for an AI companion here—she's a typical anime gamer girl, but I also got to briefly look at Zane, a tattooed muscle man in the deepest V-neck I've ever seen. You can kind of see the target audience for both of these characters right away, but if you want something more tame, you can also have your tube display Razer's logo surrounded by an audio waveform, which simply goes by AVA (even though the project as a whole is still called AVA). And the company's also working on celebrity likenesses, with esports star Faker and influencer Sao having already given their approval.\n\nRazer said it's still working on figuring out how it'll distribute these characters, and I was told you'd get a bundle of them with your purchase, but would probably be able to buy more down the line.\n\nAs for pricing and availability, no word on that. This is technically still a concept, so it might go back to the drawing board again. But Razer's website does say it's hoping for a release in the second half of 2026, and that you can put $20 down now to reserve your unit.\n\nIn short, if you strip away the functionality that's already baked into apps you can download now, the new Project Ava is basically a talking hologram toy for your desk. That's still not a bad pitch, but unfortunately, I'm not sure if hologram is the right word for this. Kira looked pretty flat to me, less like that one Princess Leia projection and more like she was displaying on a normal transparent screen that just happened to be stuck inside of a cylinder. I don't think the novelty quite matches the pitch yet.\n\nWhenever I play a competitive game, instead of hopping right into a match, I instead load up into a few practice sessions to warm up. It's helpful, but time consuming. The new Neurable x HyperX concept headset is hoping to change that by helping you lock in within just a few minutes.\n\nEssentially, it looks like a normal gaming headset, but built into the earcups are various sensors that can supposedly read your focus levels. These are similar to the brain-computer interfaces you might have seen in sci-fi shows, the ones with a bunch of wires and discs attached to them, but shrunken down for the consumer market, with no creepy wires in sight.\n\nThat's where the AI comes in. Shrinking down the sensors so much does mean this headset gets fewer readings than the bigger ones in labs, but Neurable claims its models are still able to pick up on trends in those readings and translate them into useful data, while also throwing out junk data.\n\nFor gamers, that means it can run you through a quick focus exercise called \"Prime,\" where you concentrate while noticing a cloud of dots shrink into a solid orb. Once this is done, which took about 90 seconds for me, you're supposedly focused up and ready to play.\n\nUnfortunately, I actually did worse in a practice shooting game after focusing than beforehand, but that doesn't mean the data was useless. I ran through the exercise with a colleague whose score improved by maybe about a third after focusing, and with such a small sample size, there could be any number of reasons I choked after focusing up. The company said that it could even be helpful to practice choking in this way.\n\nAnd at any rate, numbers are fun. That's why I'm most excited about the headset's plug-in for streamers, which allows them to show their focus levels on screen for their chat to see. I could easily imagine a community looking at that data and teasing their favorite streamer to try to distract them.\n\nThat said, it'll be a while until you can actually buy this. It's still a concept for now, with no pricing or promise of release. However, Neurable does already have a similar, non-gaming headset made with Master & Dynamic that will be shipping out soon, just without this software. For more, read my full article here.\n\nThis one is more of a hardware innovation, but it's a clever touch. This CES, Lenovo introduced a laptop with a motorized hinge that can automatically close, open, and even rotate from side-to-side. It'll be coming out later this summer, but while the company was demonstrating the unit to me, it also showed off a prototype chatbot app it's making for it. This uses ChatGPT for now, and is still just a concept and will not ship with the laptop. But it was cute.\n\nEssentially, while I talked with the app, the laptop displayed a big pair of animated eyes on screen, and used its hinge to nod or shake its head no when I asked it questions. It also displayed small animations in response to certain questions, like showing an umbrella when I asked about the rainy weather.\n\nIt's still very early days, but I was impressed that the hardware was able to recognize what an affirmative answer was and trigger the laptop to respond accordingly. A lot of AI feels pretty disconnected from the real world, so anything that can give it a physical presence is probably a good idea if you want people to take it seriously.\n\nAlso shown off at CES this year, Lenovo's AI Frame gaming monitor is probably the most practically useful item on this list, almost to the point where it feels like cheating. Essentially, this fills up most of the 21:9 screen with a regular 16:9 view of whatever's on your computer, and uses AI to show a zoomed-in look at critical game information on the rest.\n\nFor instance, in a demo showing a MOBA game (think League of Legends), the monitor zoomed in on the map. In a demo showing Counter-Strike 2, it zoomed in on the reticle. Personally, I didn't think getting a blown-up look at the map was all that helpful, but being able to constantly see what was essentially a sniper scope around my reticle was a game changer, since it worked with any gun and made targets much easier to see.\n\nI could see Counter-Strike 2 developer Valve go as far as banning this if it ever makes its way to market, since it's taken similar actions before. But this is still just an idea for now. Still, it shows that companies are starting to figure out concrete ways AI can help you in your games, beyond just feeding you advice you probably already know.\n\nFinally, probably my favorite AI invention at CES this year was XREAL's new REAL 3D technology. Built into its newest AR glasses and already added to an existing pair via a firmware update, this uses AI to automatically find depth in any 2D video source and convert it into 3D. And trying it out for myself, it practically looked official.\n\nWhen I used it to play Mario Kart World, I would have believed you if you told me Nintendo had added this mode itself. It also worked great with James Cameron's Avatar, and there was no loading time to set it up or turn it off. There also wasn't any fuzziness, like there might be with glasses-free 3D screens like the 3DS.\n\nIt's a great option for people who like watching 3D games and movies, but might have trouble finding them now that 3D TVs and the Nintendo 3DS are mostly in the past. Now, you can just watch your existing 2D library, but in 3D.\n\nThe only issue you might come across is in content that doesn't have depth. For instance, XREAL's Ralph Jodice told me the software didn't quite know what to do when he tried playing the original 8-bit Super Mario Bros. with it, and would randomly emphasize only certain game assets without any rhyme or reason. An illusion of depth does seem to work, though. Super Mario Bros. is entirely flat, but when I tried watching the pen-and-paper animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with this technology, it correctly separated characters in the foreground from scenery in the background, even though everything on screen was entirely hand-drawn.",

    "description": "Monitor data usage or block apps from the net entirely, all in a couple of clicks.",
    "fullText": "Most people haven't actively managed a firewall in at least a decade, assuming they ever have. But keeping track of which applications are using the internet—and how much data they're using—is still useful at times, as is blocking apps from accessing the net entirely.\n\nWhile you're traveling, for example, internet access might be limited, so it's a good idea to cut off applications that constantly churn through data. But even while at home, it's a good security practice to review which applications are connecting to the internet. And while macOS comes with a firewall, it's not really a useful tool for that.\n\nWhich is why I like FireWally. This totally free application, offered by the Ukraine-based indie Mac developers Nektony, isn't a tool for power users—it's streamlined and user friendly. Click the menu bar icon and you'll see a list of applications using the internet. You can see a summary of all traffic today, in the past hour, or monitor incoming traffic in real time.\n\nBeside every application is its data usage. You can see a breakdown of inbound and outbound traffic for any application by hovering the mouse over it. You can block any application from accessing the internet by toggling the switch.\n\nWhat if you don't recognize an application? I, traditionally, ended up copying the name of the application and pasting it into a search engine. FireWally tries to save you some time by providing AI-generated summaries of each application using Apple Intelligence (assuming your Mac supports that feature). It's a useful way to quickly remind yourself what a particular application is, or to identify one you don't recognize.\n\nIt's a very streamlined application, but perfect for anyone hoping to understand a bit more about how much data their various Mac applications are using. Give it a spin if you're looking for a simple firewall application.",

    "description": "Katrina vanden...",
    "fullText": "Cora Weiss died in December at age 91. She never stopped campaigning to save the world from nuclear destruction.\n\nBetween 1958 and 1970, researchers in St. Louis collected 320,000 baby teeth. Unusual though that image might be on its own, the discovery that came out of it was far more disturbing: Fallout from nuclear weapons tests had made its way into the bodies of the very youngest Americans.\n\nIndeed, the resultant Baby Tooth Survey found that children had absorbed elevated levels of strontium-90—a carcinogenic radioactive isotope. The study attracted widespread attention, including from President John F. Kennedy. The month before his assassination, he signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963—the Cold War’s inaugural arms-control agreement.\n\nAs Kennedy, a young father, said at the time: “The loss of even one human life or the malformation of even one baby—who may be born long after we are gone—should be of concern to us all. Our children and grandchildren are not merely statistics toward which we can be indifferent.” That presidential recognition and action came at the urging of not just scientists but grassroots activists such as Cora Weiss, a New York City mother who sent her own children’s teeth to be tested and made peace her priority.\n\nCora, my friend and frequent collaborator, died in December at age 91. She was a champion of the United Nations and its mission to advance peace and women’s rights—and along with her husband, Peter, a brilliant international lawyer, she never stopped organizing to save the world from nuclear destruction. Unfortunately, in the last months of her life, that organizing became more necessary than ever.\n\nIn the fall of 2025, Kennedy’s acknowledgment of the dangers of nuclear weapons gained a grim new relevance when President Donald Trump announced that the United States might resume nuclear testing. Exactly what form these tests will take is unclear, but if Trump initiates a new era of explosive nuclear testing, it will constitute a catastrophic break from decades of hard-won restraint.\n\nThis move risks restarting a nuclear arms race, and Russia is already vowing to “take reciprocal measures” should the United States resume tests. Trump’s saber-rattling ignores the repercussions of nuclear testing that led the world to this moratorium in the first place.\n\nThis painful legacy is perhaps most acutely felt in the Marshall Islands, where the United States tested 67 nuclear weapons in the years following World War II. In 1954, the United States detonated its most powerful hydrogen bomb, Castle Bravo, on the archipelagic nation’s Bikini Atoll. The blast was more than 1,000 times stronger than those inflicted upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Only after testing, the residents were evacuated and told they could soon return. But they were not allowed home for 15 years—and even then, they were soon re-evacuated from the radioactive island, which remains virtually uninhabited to this day.\n\nIn the years since the detonations, Marshall Islanders who were exposed to nuclear fallout have experienced increased rates of cancer, leukemia, and infants born with congenital defects. On one atoll, 20 out of 29 children under 10 developed thyroid cancer. These catastrophic effects have reverberated across generations: More cancers are on the horizon for a community that has already lost so much.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nTo Trump, this death, disease, and destruction is perhaps a small price to pay for Making America Fearsome Again—and he, after all, will not be paying it.\n\nSenator Ed Markey, a longtime congressional leader in the fight for nuclear disarmament, writes for The Nation in this issue: “Instead of deterring foreign nations, renewed testing would be like throwing gasoline on the arms-race fire.”\n\nHe’s right, but can movements be mobilized to avert Trump’s march toward madness? Cora Weiss taught us the answer to that question.\n\nIt’s vital to recall the history of activists like Cora, who found the tools—and the teeth—to prevent nuclear war. In 1961, she joined a local chapter of Women Strike for Peace, a movement to end nuclear testing. Activism that started with sending her children’s baby teeth to St. Louis evolved into world-shaping leadership as the United Nations’ representative at the International Peace Bureau, and as its president between 2000 and 2006. Cora, who co-chaired the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, was a pillar of much of the anti-war organizing—including trips to return POWs, and efforts to humanize the Vietnamese people in the eyes of Americans and to convey the war’s impact on women and children.\n\nShe would go on to organize one of the largest antinuclear marches in history—1 million people who gathered in New York City’s Central Park on June 12, 1982. She also drafted the unanimously approved UN resolution affirming the importance of women’s roles in the peace and antinuclear movements.\n\n“I wasn’t making a revolution,” Cora told the Columbia Center for Oral History in 2014. “I was just working hard and long.”\n\nIt’s time to work every bit as hard and long as Cora did to create a world of peace safe from nuclear accidents, conflicts, or all-out war. It is the least we can do for the generations of people still facing the radioactive fallout of US recklessness.",

    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. US, The Nation’s justice correspondent makes the case to get rid of ICE, explores George Conway’s congressional campaign—and shares his New Year’s resolution.\n\nEvery authoritarian regime throughout history has employed a roving band of armed thugs who operate outside the law to enforce its strongman’s will. Caesar had his Praetorian Guard, Francios Duvalier had his Tonton Macoutes, Hitler had his Gestapo.\n\nDonald Trump has ICE. ICE is functionally a paramilitary organization, armed and empowered to harass citizens, brutalize opposition, and murder people who get in their way. Like any paramilitary apparatus, its chief aim is to strike fear in the population. It does this not only through feats of violence, false imprisonment, and kidnapping but also by repeatedly showing us it can’t be held accountable for its actions. ICE agents can seemingly do anything they want, and no one is allowed to stop them: They know it, and they want us to know it.\n\nWhen we look at the historical record, the horrifying reality of these thug paramilitaries is that they do not naturally melt away when the strongman is finally deposed. They stay on. They align themselves with the next strongman, or the strongman who wants to overthrow the republican government that deposed the previous strongman. The next guy in office tends to want to keep them around anyway, because having a terrorist apparatus able to operate outside the law is something that leaders of nations consistently find useful.\n\nThese paramilitaries can be dismantled, but only when the people demand it, over and over again, and refuse to support any politicians or regimes who would keep them in place. ICE can be stopped, but we do not elect people to power who actually want to stop ICE; we tend instead to elect people who want to “fund” ICE, control it, and use it for their own purposes. And that is why we fail.\n\nICE must be abolished, root and stem, by the next Democratic administration. As a stopgap, it must be defunded by the current collection of Democrats, should the party take power in the upcoming election. ICE is the one true litmus test for an incoming post-Trump administration. The Democrats will likely not be inclined to do this. Again, paramilitary thugs have their uses to leaders the world over, and Democrats are traditionally afraid of looking “weak” on immigration or actually dismantling the tools of the enemy. Democrats, if they’re going to do this, must be forced to do this, by the people whose support they seek.\n\nI’ve liked to think of myself as a single-issue voter, with that issue being Supreme Court expansion. But no longer. Abolish ICE, or GTFO of my primary.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nI’m not going to bother to tell you, as some no doubt will, that George Conway isn’t a “real” Democrat. Sure, Conway is a lifelong Republican and essentially a founding member of the Federalist Society. Sure, he switched parties and moved from Bethesda, Maryland, to run in the Democratic primary to replace Jerry Nadler in New York’s 12th Congressional District, but… whatever.\n\nWhat even is a “real” Democrat these days? A party that consistently embraces wannabe Republicans like Joe Manchin and Elissa Slotkin, that regularly gets bumfuzzled by straight-up liars like Kyrsten Sinema and John Fettermen, and that operates under the feckless and borderline complicit leadership of Charles Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries can hardly stand on intellectual or political purity. Conway is as much a “Democrat” as most of them these days. He’s a guy who’d rather make strongly worded television appearances than take radical action. He wants to reassemble the institutions Trump has smashed instead of smashing the institutions that make Trump possible. He wants to go backward, to a time before Trump, instead of boldly going forward. Oh, he’s a Democrat all right.\n\nAnd not just any Democrat. Conway represents the very worst of what today’s Democrats have to offer. His signature issue is “not Trump.” His fame is based on being a Republican who was against Trump while married to a Republican working for Trump. His positions would be banal if not for the family melodrama and the fact that so few Republicans had the basic human decency to stand up to the cretin taking over their party. He exists as a television personality because TV executives are desperate for Republicans who can maintain a veneer of respectability—or, at least, they were before they gave up and put Bari Weiss in charge.\n\nDemocrats who offer nothing beyond “Orange Man bad” are the lowest-common-denominator politicians these days. Conway takes the calculation to its irreducible conclusion. Everybody knows he stands against Trump, but do people know what he stands for?\n\nI do. Conway is basically one of the founding members of the Federalist Society. He first joined one of their boards in 1984. He’s not Leonard Leo, but he’s worked closely with the Republican judicial Svengali over the decades. There is not a single Republican on the bench that Conway has objected to: not the sexual predator Clarence Thomas or alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, not the anti-abortion stalwarts John Roberts and Sam Alito, not the stolen-seat installations Neil Gorsuch or Amy Coney Barrett. Conway was there for all of them, and most of the Republican judges appointed to the lower courts too.\n\nConway’s no longer an active member of the Federalist Society (though I don’t know if he still goes to their parties and fundraising dinners; it’s not like I’m invited over to see). His 2018 FedSoc splinter group “Checks and Balances” apparently went nowhere. But despite this apparent break, Conway is one of those “Never Trumpers”—like Nicole Wallace or the entire staff of The Bulwark—who keep their criticisms focused more on Trump than on the Trump-loving Supreme Court they helped create. While he recently said that the Supreme Court has become “intoxicated with its power,” Conway is, for my money, among the people running for office who can be trusted least to take away power from a court he spent a lifetime helping to create.\n\nConway is good on TV. He should stay there. Being wrong about everything for your entire life until yesterday is a good credential for television. It’s a terrible credential for leadership. I have no problem accepting Conway as a Democrat, but I have a huge problem accepting that Conway is the best Democrats can offer.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nOver the holiday break, I rewatched all of the Lord of the Rings movies. I was struck, once again, by one of the most famous scenes in the three films—the one where Frodo says, “I wish none of this had ever happened,” and Gandalf responds, “So do all who live to see such times. But it is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time given to us.”\n\nI usually find this scene empowering. This time I found it to be full of shit. As I ponder what to do with the awful time given to me, my intrusive thoughts tend toward, “How best to die while fighting this regime?” But the reality is that most of us will not have a choice on how or when the Trump regime will martyr us.\n\nRenee Good did not wake up one morning and decide she was ready to die opposing Trump. She just reacted as a decent person would when the bad people came to do bad things in her neighborhood.\n\nOn this most recent Lord of the Rings rewatching, I identified most with Meriadoc Brandybuck (one of the three hobbits who join Frodo on his quest). Merry didn’t set out like Gandalf to organize regime change. He wasn’t charged like Frodo to destroy the evil power. He just… tried to help his friends, and understood that if he didn’t try, his entire community would be destroyed. When Merry is at the Entmoot (the meeting of powerful but long dormant tree-creatures), literally screaming at the trees to do something, I felt like he was me talking to Democrats in Washington.\n\n“I’m a hobbit, and I know I can’t save Middle-Earth. I just want to help my friends” turns out to be my New Year’s resolution.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur's main supporters' group has accused the club of a \"dramatic fall in ambition\" after meeting with senior club figures.\n\nSpurs have won just one of their last six Premier League games and find themselves 14th in the table with 27 points, just three more than at this stage last season.\n\nThe Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) says members of its board met with \"representatives of the Club at a senior level\" on Friday to discuss supporter concerns.\n\nSeveral players were pulled away from angry fans following their 3-2 defeat to Bournemouth on Wednesday.\n\nSections of the travelling support booed under-fire manager Thomas Frank, who also drew criticism for drinking out of a coffee cup emblazoned with the logo of rivals Arsenal before kick-off.\n\nA THST statement cited the club's lack of transfer activity this month as evidence of reduced ambition, as well as recent comments made by Frank.\n\n\"[He reminded] supporters that the club finished 17th in the Premier League last season, that the club is only participating in the Champions League through winning the Europa League, and that Bournemouth (a side without a win in 11 games) are 'always a difficult team' and that he is 'not enjoying the job',\" read the statement.\n\nTHST accused players of \"directly confronting\" fans who were \"exercising their right to express themselves\", and referred to the \"embarrassment\" of club captain Cristian Romero's social media activity.\n\nAfter the Bournemouth loss, Argentine Romero stated on Instagram \"other people\" should be coming out to speak and adding they \"only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies\".\n\nThe post was deleted and reposted with an altered caption.\n\n\"While these incidents may have explanations that we could understand and even sympathise with, they demonstrate a lack of understanding and a lack of care about the perception of the football club,\" said THST.\n\n\"We reiterated to the club that we believe the club leadership should address these issues publicly and through direct communication with fans.\n\n\"We stressed that fans need to hear directly from the club leadership [of] the ambition for the football club for this season, for next season, and for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"That begins, but is certainly not restricted to, the coming transfer window, in which all the stops need to be pulled out in order to demonstrate that Tottenham Hotspur are a serious football club and that we really do want to 'win more, more often'.\"\n\nDuring his media conference on Thursday, Frank said: \"I think it's very important to stress that even though there's noise, the club is very aligned.\n\n\"[Sporting director] Johan [Lange], [chief executive] Vinai [Venkatesham] and I are very aligned. The ownership is very aligned. We know it's a tough spell that we need to get through.\"",

Scrum-half Mikey Austin spotted space in behind and judged his chip over the defence to perfection for Atkinson to touch down.\n\nTrailing by 13 points at the break, Edinburgh needed the next score and they got it when Ashman, a first-half substitute in place of Harri Morris, burrowed over from close range.\n\nBarton responded with another penalty but when McConnell blasted over the line for the home side, we had a two-point game heading into the final quarter.\n\nEdinburgh tails were up and when a rolling maul was halted illegally as it hurtled towards the Gloucester line, a penalty try was awarded, Atkinson was sent to the bin and the home side led for the first time.\n\nBarton kicked flawlessly all night and his fourth penalty from long-range split the posts to bring the visitors back within two, but the hosts stood firm to secure a vital win.\n\nEdinburgh: Goosen, Graham, Currie, Lang, Van der Merwe, Thompson, Vellacott; Whitcombe, Morris, Blyth-Lafferty, Hunter-Hill, Young, McConnell, Douglas, Bradbury (capt).\n\nReplacements: Ashman, Schoeman, Hill, McVie, Dodd, Muncaster, Shiel, O'Conor.\n\nGloucester: Barton, Cotgreave, Butler, S.

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior wants to emulate \"brave\" Sir Alex Ferguson with a young Chelsea squad he believes has the potential to grow like Manchester United's famous Class of '92.\n\nThe 41-year-old replaced Enzo Maresca as head coach of the Blues after the Italian left his role on New Year's Day.\n\nMaresca had complained of pressure to select certain players - senior figures insist he was only asked to limit minutes for those carrying injuries - and highlighted the challenge of sustained success with the Premier League's youngest squad, whose starting XIs have averaged 24 years and 198 days this season.\n\nBut Rosenior will relish the opportunity to shape successful futures for an exciting crop of talent - just like Ferguson did during his trophy-laden reign at Old Trafford.\n\n\"I was a Manchester United fan and I am now massively a Chelsea fan,\" said Rosenior.\n\n\"I remember Sir Alex Ferguson was brave enough to put six or seven players aged between 19 and 21 into a title-winning team because he believed in them.\n\n\"They grew and won trophy after trophy. It was an amazing period in that club's history. Without that bravery, it doesn't happen. There is potential for that here.\"\n\nUnited legends, such as Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil and Gary Neville, famously became known as the Class of '92 as they came through the youth ranks to win multiple major honours with the club under Ferguson.\n\n\"Speak about Moises Caicedo or Enzo Fernandez or Cole Palmer or Reece James - world-class players and still very, very young,\" added Rosenior.\n\n\"That is the ultimate ambition for this club - to create that again.\"\n\nChelsea appointed Rosenior after 18 months at Strasbourg, who are part of the same Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital multi-club ownership group.\n\nThe French side fielded the youngest squad in Europe's big five leagues last season, averaging 21 years and 171 days, and finished seventh - just three points off the Champions League places, but qualified for Europe for the first time in eight years.\n\n\"If you watched the Strasbourg team I coached, everyone enjoyed watching them because they played with intensity,\" said Rosenior. \"Why? Because they were young, fit, less prone to injury. I'm going to work really hard to create that here.\n\n\"I have to train the players right, work with the medical team and look after them because they have outstanding careers ahead. But that doesn't stop you being successful now. If I thought it was impossible to win with this group, I wouldn't have come.\"",

    "fullText": "Sean Dyche has called for some of his Nottingham Forest players to \"have a look in the mirror\" after an \"unacceptable\" first-half performance in their FA Cup loss at Wrexham.\n\nForest were the first Premier League side in third-round action and the first casualty at the hands of lower league opposition.\n\nHaving made eight changes from Tuesday's Premier League win at West Ham, Dyche watched in fury as his side trailed their Championship opponents 2-0 at the break.\n\nThey fought back to make it 3-3 and force extra-time at Stok Cae Ras, but were beaten 4-3 in the penalty shootout after Igor Jesus and Omari Hutchinson had their spot-kicks saved by home keeper Arthur Okonkwo.\n\n\"The first half was completely unacceptable,\" Dyche told TNT Sports.\n\n\"I let the players know and there are certain individuals that certainly know and they have to look in the mirror.\n\n\"But the strangeness of football, some players that came on in the second half were a credit and we went on and looked like a Premier League side.\n\n\"You can't do that in the first half, it's completely unacceptable. It's unacceptable to me, but I said you have to look in the mirror because that's unacceptable to the badge as well.\n\n\"They all knock on the door and say, 'why aren't I playing?'. Well the evidence is quite honestly there for some, not for all.\"\n\nWhile Dyche praised those who came off the bench - including two-goal Callum Hudson-Odoi - for acting as a \"catalyst\" for their second-half comeback, he continued to berate his side's efforts in a poor first 45 minutes.\n\n\"I could have taken all of them off [at half-time],\" he added. \"The tempo, the mentality to take the game on was lacking so badly in the first half.\n\n\"Slow, methodical, we have done a lot of work on that. There was basically no intent, no real desire to make a difference. Second half, the changes were terrific.\n\n\"The facts of the matter are we've got to make changes. They showed their hand and won't be knocking on my door saying, 'why aren't I playing?' again, that's for sure, that first-half group.\"",
