    "fullText": "Any chance the Lakers had at trying to capture a second NBA Cup championship in the third season of the tournament evaporated for good in the fourth quarter against a young, fast and athletic San Antonio Spurs team missing its best player.\n\nThe Lakers won the inaugural NBA Cup title in 2023 and had designs on winning it again in 2025 and the $500,000 cash that goes to each player on the championship team.\n\nBut it was not to be — not with the Lakers unable to slow down the Spurs during a 132-119 quarterfinal loss Wednesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers got down by as much as 24 points in the fourth and made a run to get to within eight points late in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Lakers got no closer and now will face the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday.\n\nThe Spurs will meet the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in Las Vegas in the semifinals.\n\nLuka Doncic had 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists, Marcus Smart came off the bench to score 26 and LeBron James had 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. But that wasn’t enough against a Spurs team that had seven players score in double figures.\n\nStephon Castle led the Spurs with 30 points and De’Aaron Fox had 20.\n\nWhen the Lakers needed someone to lift them when they got down by 18 points in the second, someone to provide them a spark when there wasn’t one for so much of the quarter, they finally got it from the oldest player on the court, 40-year-old LeBron James.\n\nJames drove down the lane and threw down a thunderous dunk over Spurs 7-1 center Luke Kornet, bringing the Lakers to within eight points and charging up the crowd in the process.\n\nJames growled and yelled in the face of the reeling Kornet. The crowd stood and cheered, now happy that there was a Lakers’ awakening.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t hold on to that momentum, falling behind 70-58 at the half.\n\nAnd then when the third quarter started, the Lakers came out flat, giving up back-to-back threes and two more easy baskets for the Spurs to fall into an 80-60 hole early in the third.\n\nThe Lakers didn’t make it easy on themselves either.\n\nDoncic got a technical foul in the first quarter after no foul was called after Kelly Olynyk smacked him in the face and Lakers coach JJ Redick was called for a technical foul in the second quarter.\n\nWhen the Lakers last faced the Spurs a little over a month ago here, San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama played in a game L.A. won, but speedy point guard De’Aaron Fox did not.\n\nIt was the opposite this time, with Fox playing and Wembanyama out with a left calf strain.\n\nThe 7-5 Wembanyama has been out for almost a month and the super-quick Fox has been back during that time, which has changed the dynamic of the Spurs, which meant the Lakers had to shift how they played defense against San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs are more guard-oriented with Fox, Castle and Dylan Harper.\n\nThe Lakers got a taste of how much faster the Spurs are now in the first quarter, when L.A. gave up 39 points and trailed by nine after the first frame.\n\nThe Spurs show 56% from the field in the first, 50% (six-for-12) from three-point range.\n\nKeldon Johnson came off the bench to score 13 points in the first quarter for the Spurs.\n\n\"Yeah, they're running a lot of pick and rolls with Fox, a lot of pick and rolls with Castle and Harper,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said pregame about the Spurs’ new way of playing. “And all those pick and rolls lead to drives, those pick and rolls lead to kick-outs and catch two threes and then more drives. So, we've got to do a good job of containing the basketball and do a good job of contesting.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Lewis Hamilton's first year at Ferrari started with positivity but his and Ferrari's struggles took its toll. Is there reason for optimism in 2026?",
    "fullText": "Lewis Hamilton said after the final race of what has been an annus horribilis for him at Ferrari that he wanted to shut off from the world over the winter.\n\n\"I'm already looking forward just to the break, just to disconnecting, not speaking to anyone,\" the seven-time champion said, after the worst season of his career.\n\n\"No one's going to be able to get hold of me this winter. I won't have my phone with me and I'm looking forward to that. Just completely unplugged from the matrix.\n\n\"I've generally always had it around, but this time it's going in the fricking bin.\"\n\nHis remarks reflect the toll this season, his first in which he has scored not a single podium finish in a grand prix, has had on Hamilton.\n\nIt was a year that started with such positivity, but quickly turned into something Hamilton himself described as a \"nightmare\".\n\nThe 40-year-old Briton joined Ferrari with the ambition of winning that elusive eighth world title, which he - and a good number of others - believes he should already have won in the controversial 2021 title decider.\n\nIt had been a long-time ambition, and the move created a sensation.\n\nThe sport's most famous driver joining its most iconic team, right at a time when Ferrari seemed to be on an upward trajectory after ending 2024 narrowly missing out on the constructors' championship at the final race of the year. It seemed set up perfectly.\n\nBut the script went off course. Ferrari's car was not competitive at the start of the year, while Hamilton struggled to adapt to its characteristics, and had questions about the way the team worked.\n\nAlthough a sprint-race victory for Hamilton at the second race of the season in China was a promising start, reality set in with a bump the following day, when both cars were disqualified from the grand prix.\n\nIn Hamilton's case, the reason for the disqualification was an early indication of a problem that would blight much of Ferrari's season.\n\nHe was disqualified for excessive skid wear. To be vaguely competitive, Ferrari had to run the car so low that it risked wearing out its skid plates. Run it higher, and it was slow.\n\nFerrari fell foul of this issue at least twice \n\nIn Hungary, his team-mate Charles Leclerc qualified on pole and appeared to be competing for the win with the McLarens for the first two-thirds of the race, only to slow significantly in the final stint as he limited his top speed to reduce the load on the car.\n\nIt was in Hungary that the first real signs of the strain on Hamilton showed.\n\nHe could manage only 12th on the grid, and the stark comparison between him and Leclerc resulted in him saying he was \"just useless\", and suggesting the team \"probably need to change driver\".\n\nThe second part of the season was littered with similarly downbeat comments, always uttered in the heat of the moment when the adrenaline was still pumping after a difficult time out on track.\n\nTeam principal Frederic Vasseur has been brushing them aside.\n\n\"I don't pay attention to the reaction in the TV pen,\" he said in Abu Dhabi last weekend. \"Honestly. Or the reaction that sometimes they add on the microphone in the car, on the radio.\n\n\"In the TV pen, they are jumping out of the car five minutes after the session. Sometimes they have bad results for a couple of hundredths (of a second). And you are asking them questions.\n\n\"I can understand that sometimes the guy is a bit emotional and to say, 'OK, yes, no.' All he wants is to go back to the engineering office and to discuss with the engineer to understand why.\"\n\nIn that answer Vasseur touched on another common theme he has used to downplay Hamilton's difficulties.\n\nWhen Hamilton has missed out in qualifying, Vasseur often points out that it's usually by tiny margins. The field is so tight, he says, that any error, whether in driving or tyre preparation or whatever, is punished.\n\nAs Vasseur said after the race in Abu Dhabi: \"We struggled all the season with details, because what we have to keep in mind is that yesterday in Q1, you moved from P6 to P16 for less than 0.1secs.\"\n\nThe margin between sixth and 16th last Saturday was actually 0.216secs, but the fundamental point stands - Hamilton missed out on getting through by 0.009secs.\n\nNevertheless, it overlooks the fact that there are two Ferrari drivers, and Leclerc has not been as badly affected.\n\nHe has out-qualified Hamilton, the sport's all-time pole position record holder, 22 times to seven at an average advantage of 0.15 seconds a lap. Leclerc's average grid position is 5.6, Hamilton's is 9.5.\n\nInevitably, Ferrari's first winless season since 2021, in combination with the added focus on the team created by Hamilton's presence, has stoked tensions.\n\nThat was abundantly clear when Ferrari chairman John Elkann made an intervention after the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.\n\nA day after Hamilton had said his season was \"a nightmare and I've been living it for a while\", Elkann gave a rare interview and said his drivers needed to \"focus on driving and talk less\".\n\nElkann's comments have not had any noticeable effect on Hamilton's desire to express his frustration publicly.\n\nAfter a difficult Las Vegas weekend, he told BBC Sport he was \"not looking forward to\" next season.\n\nAnd in Abu Dhabi, where he ended the season with his third consecutive failure to progress beyond the first qualifying session, he said he was feeling \"an unbearable amount of anger and rage\".\n\nHamilton insists he is still motivated to continue into next season, when the introduction of new rules bolsters his hope that his and Ferrari's form can turn around.\n\n\"It's the love for what you do,\" he says. \"It's the love for racing. I've got amazing support from people around me, my fans. It's that constant keeping an eye on the dream. I still have a dream that I hold hope in my heart and that's what I work towards.\"\n\nThat dream remains to win his eighth world title with Ferrari. Any suggestions he should retire can clearly by ignored.\n\nHow realistic that dream might be remains to be seen. And the exact causes of Hamilton's struggles in 2025 remain a point of conjecture.\n\nNext year, F1 is going through a major upheaval with new rules for cars and engines. Ferrari are not alone in hoping that the inevitable reset of the competitive order that will create will benefit them.\n\nThat partly explains why Ferrari have not shown any significant progress this season. When the car was clearly uncompetitive early on in 2025, the team made a collective decision to focus even more heavily on the 2026 car, even earlier.\n\n\"I was a part of (that), I was one pushing for it,\" Hamilton says. \"You can't fall behind the others in terms of that development for the new car because it's a steep learning curve for all of us.\n\n\"So I supported it 100%. I still do. I think it was the right decision. Particularly where we were already with the car, we weren't fighting for a championship.\n\n\"But it's just meant that it's been harder to maintain the performance, at least some of the performance we had at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nThis season has provided Hamilton with plenty of examples of areas where he thinks the team can improve operationally, and it's clear that Ferrari will be spending some time over the winter looking at where to plug the gaps that Vasseur, too, has repeatedly pointed out.\n\n\"We just need to analyse where we've been, what's been good, areas that we can improve on,\" Hamilton says. \"I know where they all are. It's sitting down with the team at the end of the year.\"\n\nBut even if Ferrari end up competitive next season, there inevitably remain question marks about Hamilton.\n\nWhile he has repeatedly pointed to the need to adapt to Ferrari in a number of different ways, it is an uncomfortable truth that this was the second consecutive season in which he has been out-performed by a younger team-mate. George Russell's record against Hamilton in his 12th and final season at Mercedes in 2024 was remarkably similar to Leclerc's in 2025.\n\nAnd perhaps the most striking aspect of Hamilton's season is that it has been unique in one noteworthy way.\n\nUntil this year, no matter how difficult a season had been, there were always reliably a handful of the sort of moments where Hamilton did something incredible - a qualifying lap that came out of nowhere, a race of consistently searing speed, a stunning overtaking move etc.\n\nAside from his sprint victory from pole in China, it's hard to think of any similar moments in 2025.\n\nHamilton has made no secret of his distaste for the generation of cars that were created by the rules introduced in 2022. \"There's not a single thing I'll miss about these cars,\" he said. \"Simple as that. I've not enjoyed it.\"\n\nThe theory is that they do not mesh with Hamilton's style of late braking and pitching the car into the corner.\n\nYet it remains a mystery how a driver who was long famed for his adaptability, and whose talent and status is unquestioned and unquestionable, has failed to adapt to them.\n\nEqually, while next year's cars return to an aerodynamic philosophy that is much more akin to those in which he had so much success until 2021, teams are already saying that the other changes being brought in for next year will require major levels of adaptation from the drivers - perhaps more than ever before between one year and another.\n\nMany people in F1 wonder whether Hamilton's struggles are more to do with the inevitable creep of age - he will be 41 in January - than anything else. And some have drawn parallels with Michael Schumacher's unconvincing comeback from 2010-12.\n\nHamilton's old rival Fernando Alonso, who is three years older than him, seems to be proving that racing into your fifth decade does not necessarily need to mean a competitive decline.\n\nBut human beings age in different ways and at varying rates.\n\nNone of this is to say that Hamilton can't or won't return to competitiveness. But whether he - and Ferrari - can will be one of the defining narratives of F1 2026.\n\nHamilton's struggles and ranking Verstappen's 2025 - Q&A\n\nNorris keen to 'live a normal few days' and 'forget I drive in F1'",

    "fullText": "Dec. 10 (UPI) -- The University of Michigan on Wednesday fired head football coach Sherrone Moore for \"an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,\" and hours later he was booked into a jail near the college's campus in Ann Arbor.\n\nMoore compiled a 17-8 record for two seasons after serving as offensive coordinator when the Wolverines won the national title in January 2024.\n\nFour hours after the school announced his termination, Moore was taken to the Washtenaw County Jail at 8:30 p.m EST, the Pittsfield Township Police Department told the Detroit Free Press. Police were called to investigate an alleged assault in Pittsfield Township.\n\n\"U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement to the media. \"Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\"\n\nNo details about the relationship have been released, though The Detroit News reported an outside investigation this week was conducted after an internal inquiry didn't reveal evidence of an inappropriate relationship.\n\nMoore, 39, married his wife, Kelli, in 2015, and they have three daughters.\n\nPossible criminal charges are being investigated.\n\nAt 4:10 p.m., the Pittsfield Township Police Department said officers responded to a call for an alleged assault investigation.\n\nThirty-three minutes later, the school announced the firing. The termination has not been posted on the school's website or social media accounts.\n\nPolice in Saline, near the Ann Arbor campus, said in a statement to ESPN that they \"assisted in locating and detaining Moore.\"\n\n\"Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges,\" the authorities said.\n\nMoore, the school's first Black head coach, signed a five-year contract before the 2024 season for at least $5.5 million annually. There is a $13.89 million buyout but his firing could void the amount, CBS Sports reported.\n\nBiff Poggi, 66, was appointed interim head football coach.\n\nMichigan (9-3) is scheduled to play Texas (9-3) in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. Last year, Michigan went 7-5 during the regular season and beat Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa, Fla., on New Year's Eve.\n\nPoggi returned to Michigan as offensive coordinator and also filled in when Moore served a university-imposed suspension for games against Central Michigan and Nebraska in a sign-stealing saga. Moore was to be suspended for the first game of the 2026 season as a continuation of his punishment for the scouting scandal involving former staffer Connor Stalions.\n\nMoore was suspended for one game in the 2023 season as part of a self-imposed penalty for a recruiting violation.\n\nMoore had been on Jim Harbaugh's staff since 2018.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 18 days after Michigan won the national title, Moore replaced Harbaugh, who went to the NFL Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nDuring the championship season, he was the interim coach for the Wolverines for the final three games as Harbaugh served a suspension for his role in the sign-stealing saga.\n\nBefore coming to Michigan, Moore worked on Central Michigan's staff.\n\nUniversity of Michigan Regents in January 2022 fired President Mark Schlissel after an investigation found inappropriate conduct with an employee.\n\nDomenico Grasso became interim president in May after the resignation of Santa Ono, who was announced as the University's Florida president but the state board rejected his candidacy.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea’s players have reportedly held a meeting regarding the recent struggles they have against the lesser sides.\n\nThe latest struggle of course came on Tuesday evening with The Blues failing to beat midtable Serie A side Atalanta in the Champions League. They didn’t only fail to beat the Italian side, they ended up losing the game 2-1 after being ahead in the first half.\n\nAnd that game came almost a week after Chelsea lost 3-1 to Leeds United away from home and at the time of the defeat, Leeds were in the bottom three in the Premier League!\n\nIt’s been clear this season that Chelsea have been able to operate much better against teams they are not expected to win against. They do not like being the underdogs and it appears the pressure of this gets to them when they are.\n\nReece James battles in midfield, (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail this week, Chelsea’s players, led by captain Reece James, have been speaking with each other on their struggles against the lesser sides they should be controlling.\n\nSo, let’s see what effect if any, this has on our next matches going forward.\n\nChelsea’s upcoming fixtures are not looking too favourable. Can you even call Everton a ‘lesser’ team at the moment given the top form they have been in? They have won four of their last five games ahead of facing Chelsea at the weekend.\n\nAfter that, Chelsea face Newcastle United and Aston Villa in the league, two other sides who have found good recent form and will be very tough to beat.\n\nSo this will be a stern test for Enzo Maresca and his players coming up, a test that they really do need to pass now with flying colours.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland aiming to tighten their grip on a top-eight Europa League berth when they face Basel tonight.\n\nVilla arrive in red-hot form, winning 13 of their last 15 matches in all competitions.\n\nUnai Emery’s side claimed a statement win against Arsenal over the weekend, with Emiliano Buendia’s 95th-minute strike sealing a dramatic 2–1 victory.\n\nThe Villans sit third in the Premier League, three points off the top, and with European progress firmly in view.\n\nThey enter matchday six on 12 points (W4, L1), joint-top of the 36-team standings. However, Basel are dangerous, especially at home.\n\nThe Swiss side has alternated between wins and defeats throughout the League Phase (W2, L3).\n\nIt is worth noting that they have won their last seven Europa League home matches, their longest active streak in the competition.\n\nA late defeat to Genk dropped them to 24th, but they still occupy the final play-off spot with three games remaining.\n\nConfidence is rising after back-to-back domestic wins, including a last-gasp 2–1 victory over Winterthur last weekend.\n\nThis will be the clubs’ first meeting in 23 years, since Villa’s 4–1 aggregate victory in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nThe Villans must be wary as Basel have won five of their last 10 matches against English opposition.\n\nBasel have also been flawless at home in this competition, with seven straight wins at St Jakob-Park.\n\nVilla have struggled on the road in Europe recently, winning just one of their last six UEFA Cup/Europa League away games.\n\nHowever, Villa have scored two or more goals in 10 of their last 15 matches, highlighting their firepower heading into this fixture.\n\nDonyell Malen up top will likely carry Villa’s greatest threat with Ollie Watkins rested. Malen has scored three goals in his last two Europa League outings.\n\nTyrone Mings (thigh) and Ross Barkley (knee) remain out, while Evann Guessand is doubtful after missing the Arsenal win.\n\nUnai Emery may rotate. Emiliano Martinez has started the last three European games but could be rested, with Marco Bizot pushing for minutes.\n\nMatty Cash might also drop out, opening the door for Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof or Andres Garcia at right-back.\n\nIf Lindelof does not play wide, he could partner Pau Torres centrally, with Lucas Digne competing with Ian Maatsen on the left.\n\nIn midfield, Boubacar Kamara and Amadou Onana are expected to continue, while Youri Tielemans or Morgan Rogers may be managed due to fixture congestion.\n\nFurther forward, Buendia is pushing for a start after his last-gasp Arsenal heroics. The 28-year-old could get a shot.\n\nHarvey Elliott will likely not play today. Emery confirmed that the youngster, who is a ‘special player’, could return to parent club Liverpool in January.\n\nJadon Sancho and John McGinn are alternative options. Malen is expected to lead the line, with Emery likely to rest Ollie Watkins again.\n\nMarco Bizot; Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof, Pau Torres, Lucas Digne; Boubacar Kamara, Amadou Onana; John McGinn, Emiliano Buendia, Jadon Sancho; Donyell Malen.",

He sat down with Josh Pate on the \"Pate Speaker Series\" to unveil his vision.\n\n“We’re going to have to prove it,\" Campbell said. \"Words are great, but we’re going to have to prove it.\"\n\nPenn State underachieved massively this past season, as it limped its way to a bowl game at 6-6 after beginning the year as the preseason No. 2 team in the nation before James Franklin was fired midseason after a berth in the College Football Playoff was no longer sustainable.\n\nCampbell intends to ensure a repeat doesn't happen next fall.\n\n“Toughness still wins in this sport. … Mentally and physically tough.

That’s what’s going to have to reside at Penn State.\"\n\nCampbell certainly has his work cut out for him, but if anything, if there's someone who has done a similar turnaround before, it's him. It just happens to be alongside the biggest job he's ever had in his coaching career.\n\nFor now, though it remains to be seen whether he's still ends up being the right man for the job. We will find out next fall.",

A victory would improve their record to 10-4 and keep them locked in to the fifth seed. Additionally, if the Packers beat the Broncos, Los Angeles would only be one game back from owning the top spot in the division.\n\nA loss would drop the Bolts' record to 9-5, their playoff odds to 69% and could have them in the \"in the hunt\" category, should the Texans, Colts, and Bills win their respective games.\n\nThe Week 15 game between L.A. and Kansas City is important because it could be one of the things that knocks the Chiefs out of the playoffs.

    "fullText": "In a crowded field, Poyet’s first derby is right up near the top of my personal list – it’s no Richardson free kick, obviously, but I absolutely loved that game.\n\nI’d have just turned 15 not long before the match, so I was in that sweet spot in life where I had near-endless free time to sink into football, but was just about old enough to really understand the emotional weight of what we were seeing.\n\nThe game itself is a bit strange to look back on, because for the vast majority I remember it looking pretty similar to any other game – no leg-breakers, no refereeing drama, not much to tell you the scale of the occasion other than the deafening volume of the crowd. Certainly it wasn’t marked by controversy like certain other derbies…\n\nSteven Fletcher’s opener was unremarkable as well; a stood-up cross to the back stick and a nod down from a couple of yards. Perfect start to the game, but nothing to etch into folklore. Maybe something to brighten up our awful start to the season, though.\n\nMy overriding memory of their equaliser is knowing I’d be able to hear their f***ing away end singing ‘DE-BU-CHY’ like I was sat right there for weeks – as we’re 12 years on and I can hear it like it was yesterday, I think it’s safe to say I underestimated it! It felt so deflating – hardly a stunner, and we weren’t being hammered, but it just felt like more of the same dross we’d been serving up for months.\n\nSat in the East Stand that day, you could have offered me a million quid to pick a potential game-winning hero and I’d have got nowhere near it. Because of everything that followed, it’s hard to remember quite how little any of us rated Fabio Borini before that day. Did Poyet picture what was coming in his mind when he sent the Italian on? I’d suggest not.\n\nThen came the quick free kick (taken with a rolling ball, by the way). Then came Altidore’s – ehem – lay-off. Then came Borini’s stunner.\n\nI’m not even gonna bother describing it – we all remember. But sat in front of the recording of the game on Sky Sports the next morning, videoing the goal on my phone, it started to dawn on me that we’d just beaten them, in front of my eyes, with a howitzer from range and there was nothing they could ever do to take it away from us.\n\nThat’s a feeling I replicated each and every of the 1000+ times I sat and rewatched that grainy, out-of-focus video on my phone. Cheers Gus and Fabs!\n\nPersonally, the one stand out Derby memory is Defoe’s ridiculous volley at home and the celebrations that spilled over into half time.\n\nAlas, I’m not reflecting on that game. Instead, I get to talk about a game that you won’t often see being referred to. One that certainly doesn’t get posted by the club’s social media pages as we near the 11th anniversary. It was Newcastle United 0 – 1 Sunderland in December 2014.\n\nFor me, the last minute winner is synonymous with an ill judged YouTube upload from a Newcastle fan. In incredibly grainy footage captured on a Nokia 3210, the fan in question aims to immortalise himself by recording a winning Newcastle Corner in the dying minutes.\n\nWhat transpired was quite different.\n\nThe grainy footage, for me, is actually a blessing in disguise, as I’m almost unable to see which player finishes the brilliant breakaway chance… What I do remember, though, are the scenes from that away end and the image of Gus Poyet that is immortalised – arms aloft to the away end up in the gods as we realise that it’s the fourth successive win against our horrible neighbours.\n\nWhat can we take away from it now? It was a bit of a hint to the “Til The End” mantra that encompasses this team. That the game isn’t over until the whistle blows and just how much the result matters to the team, management and fans.\n\nFor me, this was the best and most complete Sunderland derby performance in my lifetime.\n\nNot only did we beat them, but we absolutely mullered them, and in their own back yard to boot.\n\nNot once in that ninety minute performance were Newcastle in control of the game. This was Poyet’s gameplan at its finest, led and orchestrated by the debuting Liam Bridcutt at the base of Sunderland’s midfield.\n\nI imagine for mag supporters this was the most embarrassed that they’ve felt after a derby loss, because there could be no arguing with how the game played out. In truth, they were lucky we didn’t score five or six.\n\nIn my chat today with Gus he beamed with pride about that particular showing from his team – it was outstanding, and at the end of the game when he was left in the stadium he looked up at the Sunderland fans, understood what it meant to them to have played in the way we did, and was so unbelievably proud.",

    "description": "It was a memorable day for Sunderland AFC Striker Dave Halliday who scored four goals against Manchester United",
    "fullText": "Any day you win, score six goals, and beat Manchester United has to be seen as a good day out for a Sunderland AFC team, and this is exactly what they did on this day in 1926.\n\nIn the fantastic book The Absolute Record written by Rob Mason, Mike Gibson, and Barry Jackson, the season was labelled as a ‘Goal Feast’ as Sunderland crushed many sides by huge margins during this season as they went on to finish third.\n\nDespite the attacking exploits that Robert Kyle’s team displayed in this game, newspaper articles were not blown away by his Sunderland side. One report lamented that Sunderland ‘did nothing much of note’ during the entire first half whilst also labelling the game ‘vigorous with too much force used’ throughout the game.\n\nIn addition, another journalist said he was ‘not fooled’ by the Sunderland win in a game where they played ‘little good football’ throughout.\n\nKyle’s team appeared to play an industrious style of football which suited our centre-forward Dave Halliday more than it may have suited our more talented footballers such as Bob Kelly, who was said to be ‘completely unsuited to this type of football’.\n\nIndustrious or not, the team brought a huge second-half performance where the role of Billy Clunas was mentioned as an enormous turning point in the game. Clunas’ forceful efforts put Sunderland on the front foot in the second half, and it wasn’t long before the Manchester United rearguard crumbled under the attacking Sunderland play.\n\nThe first goal came from the aforementioned Halliday who headed home after a good cross from Billy Ellis put it on a plate for the striker. Minutes later, Bobby Gurney scored after a goalmouth scramble whilst Clunas made it three goals in ten minutes after a handball in the United box handed Sunderland a penalty.\n\nFrom this point onwards, reports suggested ‘it was all Sunderland penetrations’, and United seemed to fold rapidly; in a game which was deemed as one with ‘too much force’, it appeared United’s injuries caught up with them as the game progressed.\n\nLate on, Halliday added three more that gave him four goals for the afternoon and a huge win for his Sunderland team in front of a crowd of 15,385 at Roker Park.",

    "fullText": "During the last couple of days, most of my time has been spent thinking about Sunday’s derby. I’ve been feeling nervous and anxious, hoping that we get something out of the game, but then my perspective changed as I realised something — it should be Newcastle who are hoping to get a result out of us.\n\nOur team is different. Different from previous Sunderland teams and different from other Premier League teams.\n\nWe’re resilient, hardworking, cohesive and most importantly, full of brilliant footballers. I’m by no means saying the derby will be a walk in the park, as they’re a good team and both the players and fans will be right up for the game.\n\nWe’ve made the Stadium of Light a fortress, one in which no opponent has defeated us so far during this Premier League season. We also have a terrific set of players who understand the importance of both this game and the season as a whole.\n\nAs the newly-promoted team, it would be easy to see us as the underdog against the Champions League-competing side, but I no longer see it that way.\n\nThey have weaknesses which I believe we can exploit and a brilliant atmosphere at the Stadium of Light combined with our aggression, belief and confidence could cause them some serious problems. By starting strongly, getting at them and defending resiliently, we’ll give ourselves a great chance of getting a good result.\n\nAll the abuse we’ve had to put up with from them during the last eight years has been building up. Our double relegation followed by heartbreaking final defeats and their triumph over us in the FA Cup in 2024 has given them enough ammunition to last for a long time, but since that fateful day at Wembley, everything has changed.\n\nThey’re scared. Regardless of how composed or unbothered they appear to be, it’s clear.\n\nOur brilliant start to the season and excellent squad of players has intimidated them, and I can almost guarantee they were hoping to see Noah Sadiki or Granit Xhaka pick up bookings against Manchester City. They’re worried that it’s no longer going to be an “easy six points” and this chance has been eight years in the making, so let’s get after them and take it.\n\nRegardless of the result on Sunday, the club is prospering and the city itself is responding correspondingly.\n\nWe’re in one of the best positions the club has ever been. We’ve had a magnificent season so far and I believe we can build on it this Sunday.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams enter Week 15 as the only NFC team that can clinch a playoff spot. A victory at Sofi Stadium on Sunday over Jared Goff's Detroit Lions will send Los Angeles to the postseason for the third consecutive year.\n\nThe Rams are aware Sunday's game holds serious playoff implications. However, they are approaching everything on a day-to-day basis. Head Coach Sean McVay is simply trying to win a football game.\n\n“We try to do everything in terms of being totally present,\" McVay said. Our focus and concentration are doing everything that we can to try to be able to win this game.”\n\nIf Los Angeles wants to punch their ticket to the postseason this week, it will require execution in all three phrases.\n\nThe Lions are coming off a 44-30 win over the Dallas Cowboys and sit just one game back of the No. 7 seed San Fransisco 49ers with just four weeks remaining. Detroit's No. 1 scoring offense in the NFL has been prolific, scoring 34 or more points in seven of its eight wins this season. Third-year running back Jahmyr Gibbs has backed up his breakout Sophomore season in 2024 with over 1500 total yards and 16 touchdowns in 13 games this season, proving to be one of the most feared playmakers in the NFL.\n\nSean McVay knows the effect Gibbs can have on a game.\n\n“I see as an explosive of a player as there is in this league,” McVay said. “Every single time he touches it, you're like, Oh my gosh, he might score.”\n\nDespite scoring a league-high 30.3 points per game, Detroit's offense hasn't been perfect.\n\nHead Coach Dan Campbell took the play-calling duties away from Offensive Coordinator John Morton after a home loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 9. Since taking over on the headset, Detroit has erupted for 44 points on two separate occasions but also produced its worst offensive output of the season in a 16–9 loss on Sunday Night Football in Philadelphia.\n\nDespite the change of play callers, McVay recognizes the dynamic ability the Detroit offense possesses.\n\n“Still an unbelievable offense, McVay said. \"There's a certain style of play that really comes to life when they're at their best. It's a real credit to their players and coaches.”\n\nMcVay credits his former quarterback Jared Goff on his ability to run the offense and control the game from the pocket.\n\n“You can see they give him a lot of things at the line of scrimmage like Mike point IDs, calling multiple plays and getting in and out of the right looks whether that be in the run game or in the pass game, unbelievable accuracy and anticipation.”\n\nWhile the Rams 3rd-ranked scoring defense will be tasked with limited Goff, Gibbs and company, Detroit will have to try to stop MVP-frontrunner Matthew Stafford.\n\nThe 37-year-old quarterback has been nearly impossible to stop in 2025. Stafford has completed 66.7% of his passes this year to go along with 3,354 yards and a league-high 35 passing touchdowns. Those statistics have him primed to secure his first MVP award in year 17. Stafford is grateful to just be in those discussions.\n\n“Just to be in the conversation is something that's humbling to me, Stafford said.”\n\nHis next step in bringing home the MVP award will be taking down his former team, which he spent the first 12 years of his career with.\n\n\"It's a really good, complete football team, Stafford said. \"It’ll be another challenge for us.”\n\nHis former squad will be without star defensive back Brian Branch, who suffered a season-ending torn Achilles tendon in last week against Dallas. Stafford says his absence will be something Detroit will have to account for.\n\n\"He’s a huge difference maker for them on the back end with his ability to cover receivers, cover tight ends, make plays in the run game and he’s great in zone coverage, Stafford said. \"I know that'll be something they'll have to adjust to and figure out.”\n\nA major contributor to Stafford's success this season has been Devante Adams, who signed a two-year, 46 million contract with Los Angeles in March 2025.\n\nThe two-time First-Team All-Pro wide receiver has been exactly what Stafford and Los Angeles hoped for when they inked him to the multi-year deal. Adams’ 14 receiving touchdowns lead the NFL by a five-touchdown margin, with three receivers behind him tied at nine.\n\nAdams expressed how Los Angeles has been everything he thought it would be.\n\n“It's honestly been exactly what I hoped it'd be, Adams said. \"I was just another piece to the puzzle and it's been fun being a part of a fun operation.”\n\nSunday's matchup will have the feeling of a playoff atmosphere with two teams looking to make a statement as the playoffs inch closer by the week.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James shows off insane athleticism at (almost) 41 years old with poster dunk originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers superstar forward LeBron James will turn 41 before the calendar flips from 2025 to 2026, but his athleticism is still off the charts. That athleticism was on full display during L.A.’s 132-119 loss to the San Antonio Spurs in an NBA Cup quarterfinal contest on Wednesday night.\n\nLate in the second quarter, James brought the ball across half court, beat his primary defender, drove into the paint, rose up and put Luke Kornet on the wrong side of a poster.\n\n\"OHHHH LEBRON JAMES... A FEROCIOUS FLUSH!\"\n\nABSOLUTE POSTER.\n\nAnd the block on the other end... tap to watch on Prime: https://t.co/7Xzi9OenaCpic.twitter.com/irV3nS4lEZ\n\nJames made sure to stare through Kornet's soul after posterizing him.\n\npic.twitter.com/HXWQhJY3vThttps://t.co/U4iUQpNhPn\n\n— Underdog NBA (@UnderdogNBA) December 11, 2025\n\nThat was (obviously) the highlight of the night for James, who finished the game with 19 points, 15 rebounds, 8 assists and 3 blocks in 36 minutes. His production wasn’t enough to lift the Lakers to victory though, so their dreams of becoming the first team ever to win the NBA Cup twice are now dashed.\n\nJames is one of the greatest athletes that the league has ever seen, and it’s nice for him to remind people that he can still get up every once in a while, even though he’s 23 seasons in. Opposing players clearly still have to think twice when it comes to challenging James at the rim.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland on Thursday night looking to extend a magnificent winning run.\n\nThey face FC Basel at St. Jakob-Park in the Europa League. Unai Emery’s side arrive in Basel brimming with confidence after a dramatic 2-1 victory over Premier League leaders Arsenal last weekend. This result extended their winning streak to seven matches across all competitions. The Villans currently sit joint-top of the Europa League standings with 12 points.\n\nThey aim to secure a top-eight finish. However, they face a formidable test against a Basel side that has turned St. Jakob-Park into a fortress. The Swiss outfit have won each of their last seven home Europa League matches. This is the longest current winning home run in the competition.\n\nDate: Thursday, 11 December 2025\n\nHead coach Ludovic Magnin will rely heavily on the experience of captain Xherdan Shaqiri. He has been instrumental this season with 11 goals and 10 assists. The former Liverpool man scored the opener in last weekend’s win over Winterthur and is expected to retain his place in attack. In midfield, Andrej Bacanin is likely to come into the starting XI to replace Marin Soticek. Moritz Broschinski is expected to lead the line. However, there are doubts over the availability of Kaio Eduardo due to injury.\n\nUnai Emery is expected to rotate his squad following the intense victory over Arsenal. Consequently, Matty Cash could be rested after scoring the opener against the Gunners. Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelöf, or the returning Andrés García are contending for the right-back slot. In attack, Donyell Malen is pushing to replace Ollie Watkins. Furthermore, Emiliano Buendía is in contention for a start after scoring the winner against Arsenal. Tyrone Mings and Ross Barkley remain sidelined.\n\nBasel enter this contest knowing their home form is their greatest asset. They are unbeaten in 10 European matches on home soil since 2015. Moreover, they have won five of their last 10 major European games against English opponents. Despite a rocky start to the league phase, they have found domestic rhythm recently. They have won back-to-back games in the Swiss Cup and Super League.\n\nVilla are enjoying a historic year in Europe. They have won eight of their last 10 major European matches. All eight wins came in 2025, which is a club record for a single calendar year. Their style under Emery has been distinct. Indeed, they have played the highest percentage of short passes of any team in the competition. History also favours the visitors as Villa triumphed when these sides met in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nBasel predicted XI: Hitz; Tsunemoto, Adjetey, Daniliuc, Schmid; Metinho, Bacanin; Shaqiri, Leroy, Otele; Broschinski\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Bizot; Bogarde, Lindelof, Torres, Digne; Kamara, Onana; Buendía, Tielemans, Rogers; Malen\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports. Coverage starts at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead- Mainoo preference abroad move over Premier League loan\n\nSee more- Saudi Pro League CEO endorses Mohamed Salah transfer\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Ex-Manchester United star Paul Parker has urged the club to rethink offering Harry Maguire a new contract.\n\nReports in recent months have suggested that the Red Devils are willing to extend Maguire’s tenure beyond seven years, as long as he accepts a reduction on his current £190,000-a-week wages.\n\n(Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nIt’s unconfirmed whether an official proposal has been tabled by United or if things are just at early talking stages, given we’re only a few months into the campaign and he hasn’t had much chance to feature amid persistent injury problems.\n\nYet, it’s that same reason that might already be making INEOS think twice about keeping hold of the centre-half.\n\nSo far this term, Maguire, whose contract expires in June 2026, has already missed five matches through fitness issues and has been utilised only four times from the off in the Premier League, showing that, even when he is available, he still isn’t a first-choice at the back in Ruben Amorim’s setup.\n\nThe 32-year-old has been out of action since before the November international break, when he featured for 72 minutes in United’s 2-2 away draw with Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nWith Matthijs de Ligt also sidelined for the last two outings, the pair’s absences resulted in Amorim calling upon youngster Ayden Heaven to play against West Ham and Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\n(Photo by Alex Pantling/Getty Images)\n\nWhen speaking on the England international’s situation with UtdDistrict, Parker said: “It makes no sense to offer him a deal, because at the end of the day, who’s offering the deal? Is it the manager, or is it because there’s someone who feels a bit sentimental?\n\nExclusive: Harry Maguire handed #mufc contract extension verdict amid injury troubles ⬇️🚨https://t.co/KDYt4cfFH8\n\n— UtdDistrict (@UtdDistrict) December 10, 2025\n\n“Sentiment will cost you, and it’s costing Manchester United now with Luke Shaw and things, but you have to move on.  But you look at it, and common sense says no, the team’s got to go forward.\n\n“When you look at young Heaven, you’d look at you’ve got [Lisandro] Martinez back now as well, then you’ve got De Ligt, then you’ve got [Leny] Yoro, [and] you’ve still got Luke Shaw still under contract and [he] can do a job.\n\n“No, Harry Maguire, they shouldn’t do it. Let him go off and get regular football somewhere else.

On Wednesday night, Moore was arrested and booked in the Washtenaw County Jail, according to online court records. The former Michigan head coach was initially detained by police in Saline, Michigan, for an investigation into potential charges, as reported by ESPN’s Dan Wetzel and Pete Thamel.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel announced that Moore was terminated, with cause, effective immediately. The shocking statement came after a University investigation that found credible evidence showing Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.\n\nFollowing the arrest, Pittsfield Charter Township released a statement on Wednesday night talking about the incident involving the former Michigan head coach. Moore wasn’t explicitly named due to the ongoing probe; however, the type of incident was revealed to be an “Assault Investigation.”\n\nAs of now, there are no pending charges for Moore, but it could change as the investigation progresses.

    "fullText": "As we head into another round of Premier League matches, attention turns to the players who can make the biggest impact.\n\nCaptaincy remains one of the most important decisions each week, and GW16 brings several exciting options to consider.\n\nPlenty of managers stick with the same trusted choices week after week, but this game week offers room for a wider mix. From the premium stars to reliable mid-priced players and a few bold picks, some options could deliver strong returns.\n\nWith so many possibilities, it’s worth taking a closer look at the leading captain options for GW16 and why they could make a real difference for your team.\n\nBukayo Saka is a strong captain option this week as Arsenal, who lead the Premier League with 33 points, take on a struggling Wolves side sitting at the bottom with just 2 points.\n\nHe has been in good form this season, scoring 4 goals and providing 1 assist. He also has a history of performing well against Wolves, having both scored and assisted in their last league meeting.\n\nWith this favorable fixture and his ability to create and finish chances, Saka looks set to deliver the attacking returns that make him a reliable choice for captaincy.\n\nFor managers looking for a player who can make a real impact, he stands out as one of the top options this game week.\n\nCalvin Bassey has been one of Fulham’s most consistent defenders this season. He has demonstrated strong defensive skills, making key interceptions and contributing to his team’s clean sheets on several occasions.\n\nEven though Fulham have struggled for a while now, they face a Burnley side that has had a difficult season, giving Bassey a good chance to keep another clean sheet.\n\nHis reliability at the back makes him a solid budget-friendly option who can still deliver points for managers.\n\nIgor Thiago has been one of Brentford’s most dangerous attacking players this season, scoring 11 goals, most of which have come from penalties.\n\nThis week, he faces Leeds United, who sit 16th in the Premier League, providing him with a favorable chance to add to his tally.\n\nWith his eye for goal and ability to take responsibility in crucial moments, Thiago could be an exciting option for managers considering the captain armband in GW16.\n\nDespite being blank in Manchester City’s 3‑0 win against Sunderland on Matchday 14, Haaland is still one of the most reliable FPL options and continues to be the captain pick for many managers each week.\n\nHis ability to score goals and make an impact on games makes him a top choice.\n\nThis week, Manchester City face Crystal Palace, who sit 4th in the table and are in good form.\n\nWith another favorable fixture, Haaland looks set to be a leading option for the captain’s armband in GW16, as he is always dangerous in attacking areas and can change a game with a single moment.\n\nOllie Watkins is showing signs of a strong comeback after a slow start to the season.\n\nWest Ham face an in-form Aston Villa, who have been unbeaten in most of their recent matches, and Watkins is likely to have plenty of chances to score or assist.\n\nWith his ability to influence the game in attack, he could also be considered as a captain option for GW16\n\nBryan Mbeumo could be an interesting captain pick this week. Bournemouth have struggled to defend set-pieces and have allowed the fourth-most shots from their left side this season, which gives Mbeumo a good chance to get involved in attack.\n\nWith Matheus Cunha back, Amad can return to the right, where he has a strong connection with Mbeumo. This link-up and the favorable fixture make him a solid option to score or assist in GW16.\n\nWho are you giving your captain armband to this week heading into Game Week 16? Will you go with a popular pick or try a differential option? Share your thoughts and let us know who will wear the armband in your team.",

    "fullText": "BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:45 GMT). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds of Detroit Lions v Los Angeles Rams on Sunday (from 21:00).\n\nThere are four weeks left in the NFL's regular season and I feel like every year we're saying this, but I don't think the league's ever been this contested.\n\nThere's been so many games where you cannot blink or take anything for granted. Some play-off spots won't be decided until week 18, so for so many teams, that final game will be incredibly meaningful.\n\nThe AFC East title could go down to the wire, but the Buffalo Bills will need to stop the New England Patriots' 10-game win streak when the divisional rivals meet at Foxborough this Sunday.\n\nThe Bills improved their record to 9-4 with a 39-34 win over the Bengals last Sunday, and it was just Josh Allen doing Josh Allen things again, especially in that fourth quarter. He just puts on his cape and make things happen. That's what makes the Bills so dangerous. He was last season's Most Valuable Player and he's a guy who can change the game and rally the troops around him.\n\nBuffalo had a rough spell but have won their past two. At this time of year, you've been able to have a true self-scout, so things are coming together for them, and last Sunday's win was huge. The Bills were on the edge of the AFC play-off rankings and now they've solidified themselves. If they win at the Patriots, who are 11-2, the Bills will be just one win back with three games left.\n\nNew England's schedule looks easier than Buffalo's though. The Patriots finish with Baltimore, the Jets and the Dolphins. The Bills go against the Browns, the Eagles and the Jets.\n\nThere's a high probability Buffalo won't win the AFC East for the first time in six years, and few expected New England to win the division after back-to-back four-win seasons.\n\nIn the past, there was an expectation with the Patriots because they had greatness. They had Tom Brady and had been winning for so long. Now there's straight excitement about current quarterback Drake Maye and what this team can do. They could clinch the AFC East on Sunday, which is huge for them.\n\nSometimes it's better when you're that team with no expectations, but the Patriots have Mike Vrabel as head coach. He won three Super Bowls with them as a player and he's brought in the right people. Josh McDaniels won six Super Bowls on the Patriots' coaching staff but wasn't successful as head coach of the Raiders. Vrabel pairing him as offensive coordinator with Maye has been so good though. McDaniels understands what it takes to win in the AFC East, to win in the cold and how to attack those teams.\n\nNew England had one of the easiest schedules this season, but you still have to win those games. Vrabel's been using the word 'champions' and I think all the guys are starting to believe in that championship mentality. I love how he also says 'no naps', like, you can't sleep on anybody and you've got to keep doing the right things. I think he's a great leader who's learned how to inspire from being in this situation as a player.\n\nThe Patriots were the ones that broke the Bills' undefeated start in week five and when you do that on the road, your team's going to walk away and think 'alright, we actually might have something here'. Then all these wins they've had is building more and more confidence.\n\nThe Patriots aren't outstanding in any one category, offensively or defensively, but Maye has been brilliant, especially as a second-year quarterback. He can run the ball and be a big threat with his legs, and his decision making has gotten so much better. He gets to the top of his drop and he's already kind of made his decision on where he wants to throw the ball, because he's reading the field so quickly.\n\nMaye's got the NFL's best pass completion percentage, only Matthew Stafford has a higher passer rating, and only Dak Prescott has more pass yards. Maye's thrown 23 touchdown passes versus six interceptions. In every game, he's had 200+ pass yards and that goes to show that, for the most part, he's made the right decisions. He's protecting the football, and he's using different weapons to throw to.\n\nEarly in the season, Stefon Diggs was pretty much the star of the show. That gave Maye confidence and now he's using a slew of different receivers. They were kind of identifying their roles and now they're elevating each other. Maye has also been doing it without Will Campbell on the offensive line the past few weeks.\n\nHe is very much in the MVP conversation, but Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has just been phenomenal. It's his 17th year in the league and this is probably his best season. He leads the league with 35 touchdowns, with just four interceptions.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Maye does this week against Buffalo and then Baltimore. There's the irony of playing the past two MVPs - Allen and Lamar Jackson - and some people might say that could determine whether Maye becomes this season's MVP.\n\nAllen's still breaking records and it's hard to watch that game on Sunday and not think 'wow, this guy is so different'. I mean, which other quarterback has a 40-yard touchdown run in the snow? But I don't know if they'd give him a back-to-back MVP. Last year made sense because of how he took care of the ball but this year he hasn't been as perfect.\n\nBuffalo have a rivalry with the Patriots and, after losing to them in October, I think the Bills understand the importance of Sunday's game and what it can mean to go into Foxborough and get the win. But this is going to be a challenge for their defence, for sure.\n\nWith the different offensive weapons the Patriots have through the air, I think the Bills' defence has to step up and force turnovers. You know it's going to be a Stefon Diggs game when his former team Buffalo is involved, so I think that Maye-Diggs connection is where the outcome lies.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Manchester City came from a goal down to beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Bernabeu last night. The win was crucial to Manchester City’s Champions League campaign as Pep Guardiola’s side consolidated their place in the top-eight of of the UEFA Champions League league phase table. There was a host of players for City who put in strong performances against Real Madrid. Perhaps the most impressive performance came from Nico O’Reilly at left-back. Manchester City’s young England international showed he is right at home on the biggest stage with a strong display in a crucial City win.\n\nLike his teammates, Nico O’Reilly wasn’t at his best in the opening half-hour of last night’s match. City dominated possession but they were too open at times as Real Madrid pressed City with a sense of urgency in the game’s opening half-hour. Nico O’Reilly had a difficult time at left-back against Rodrygo who opened the scoring last for Xabi Alonso’s side after 28 minutes. But from that point onwards, Nico O’Reilly and his team grew into the game. Come the final whistle Nico O’Reilly’s contribution to Manchester City’s win was immense on one of the biggest stages in European football.\n\nFirst of all, Nico O’Reilly scored Manchester City’s equaliser in the 35th minute. He reacted quickest to tap in past Thibaut Courtois after the Real Madrid keeper failed to deal with a Josko Gvardiol header from a Rayan Cherki corner. It was Nico O’Reilly’s run and cross into the penalty area that led to Antonio Rudiger’s foul on Erling Haaland which led to a spot kick for City. Erling Haaland converted the penalty to help his team overturn a 1-nil deficit and take a 2-1 lead into the interval. It would be a lead that City would hold onto come the final whistle. Nico O’Reilly was at the heart of Manchester City’s turnaround as he put in a display that showed that he is thriving on the big stage.\n\nWhat stands out in Nico O’Reilly’s game is his ability to remain undaunted by an opponent, a mistake or an occasion. The young England international wasn’t afraid of the challenge in front of him last night. More experienced players than Nico O’Reilly have crumbled under the pressure of facing Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. Nico O’Reilly isn’t a player who will join that list as he showed last night.\n\nSpeaking after his team’s win, Pep Guardiola had high praise for the ability of Nico O’Reilly to play without fear and put his mistakes in a match behind him. Speaking on Nico O’Reilly’s performance, Pep Guardiola said: “Now he is left back for England, for the national team, he has incredible pace and is so intelligent and makes mistakes, but he tries and that is top. Everyone makes mistakes. Sometimes you make a mistake because you are not courageous enough.”\n\nLike his team, Nico O’Reilly put a difficult opening half-hour behind him to help set Manchester City on their way to victory at the Bernabeu overnight. He played a crucial role in Manchester City’s important win as he played a critical role in both of his team’s goals. Just as important as Nico O’Reilly’s goal contributions was his ability to play undaunted by previous events that had unfolded in last night’s match. In the process Nico O’Reilly showed that he is made for the biggest stage as he continues to go from strength to strength as a player.",

Was the defeat against the Skyblues his last game as Real coach?\n\nAfter the final whistle, several Real stars demonstratively stood behind their coach. \"The team stands 100 percent behind Xabi Alonso,\" said Raul Asencio, among others. The atmosphere in the team is very good every day, \"but it is an unusual situation.\"\n\nIt is now up to the players to change their behavior. \"We support Xabi Alonso 100 percent,\" said Rodrygo, adding: \"It is a difficult time for us and our coach. We stand behind him. So many lies are being spread.\"\n\nHe hugged Alonso after his goal because he knows it is a tough time for him as well. \"I wanted to show that we support our coach,\" said the Brazilian.\n\nAs 'Marca' reported shortly after the final whistle, Xabi Alonso is not to be dismissed.

    "fullText": "For the second straight week, one of the conference players of the week is coming off a fantastic game against the Arizona Cardinals. Last week, it was Tampa Bay Buccaneers punter Riley Dixon who earned NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors for Week 13. For Week 14, it is Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua. He was named the Week 14 NFC Offensive Player of the Week.\n\nNacua had seven receptions for 167 yards and two touchdowns in the Rams' 45-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nHis 167 receiving (and scrimmage) yards in Week 14 led the NFL.\n\nIt was the fifth time in his career he has had at least 160 receiving yards and a touchdown. Sunday's game was his first in the NFL in which he scored two touchdowns.\n\nIt is his second player of the week award this season and third in his career. He earned it earlier this season for his 13 catches for 170 yards and a touchdown in Week 4 in a 27-20 win over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe Cardinals will have to face Nacua again in Week 18.\n\nNacua has a league-leading 93 receptions through 14 weeks with 1,186 receiving yards and six touchdowns.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

An inglorious record, and he will be glad not to have broken it.\n\nThe Brazilian had been waiting for a goal for 31 (!) games – although this season he was repeatedly benched by his shaky coach Xabi Alonso.\n\nHe ended this negative streak yesterday in the Champions League match against Manchester City, when he scored in the 28th minute with a remarkable shot from a sharp angle after a pass from Jude Bellingham. Thus, he narrowly escaped the negative club record – but was still not the hero of the evening who saved Alonso's job.\n\nCity turned the game around before halftime, and in the end, the Royals lost 1-2 in their own stadium.\n\nWhether this comforts him or not is anyone's guess – after all, Rodrygo received personal praise from Pep Guardiola after the final whistle, who said: “I went up to him and told him how good he is.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis is exactly what Golden State Warriors fans have been waiting to hear.\n\nAfter an extended stay on the sideline due to a quad injury, star guard Steph Curry is ready to return to action. Curry is expected to play when the Warriors host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night.\n\n\"It's looking good,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of Curry's return, via ESPN.\n\nCurry has missed Golden State's last five games after suffering the injury in a game against the Houston Rockets on Nov. 26. The Warriors went 3-2 in those games, and they currently sit eighth in the Western Conference standings with a record of 13-12. Credit to the rest of the roster for keeping the team afloat in Curry's absence.\n\nOther NBA news: LeBron James shows off insane athleticism at (almost) 41 years old with poster dunk\n\nCurry's return should help Golden State's hopes of climbing up the standings in the West. The two-time MVP is in the midst of another stellar season for the Warriors. He's averaging 27.9 points, 4.0 assists, 3.7 rebounds and 1.3 steals per performance while shooting 47 percent from the floor and 39 percent from long range.\n\nThe game against the Timberwolves on Friday night will be a rematch of the Western Conference semifinals from last season. Minnesota bested Golden State 4-1 in that series to move on to the conference finals. It will be the first of three meetings between the two teams on the season. They'll meet two more times in late January.  Both of those games will take place in Minnesota.",

    "description": "A bad start, a strong fight-back, and a late slip sees the FC Bayern Frauen drop points in the UWCL.",
    "fullText": "Bayern Munich drew 2-2 on the road against Atlético Madrid on Wednesday in a UEFA Women’s Champions League match that leaves them sixth in the standings after five matchdays, level on points with Juventus and Real Madrid but behind in goal differential.\n\nBarcelona, Lyon, and Chelsea lead the pack; only the first four teams qualify automatically to the quarterfinals.\n\nIn Madrid, Bayern looked the stronger side, but got off to a horrendous start. Glódís Perla Viggósdóttir was called for a penalty for what looked to be fairly incidental contact with her elbow as she jostled with an attacker in the box, and the visitors found themselves in a hole inside of 15 minutes as a result.\n\nThe fight-back was there, though, and though the half ended 1-0 it eventually paid dividends. Klara Bühl connected with Pernille Harder twice, two stars of the game flexing their muscle for FC Bayern. The first saw Harder turn nimbly and fire into the net (off a deflection) with three defenders closing in in front of her. The second was typical Bühl, marauding down the left flank to receive a ball in acres of space somehow, jinking past her marker and fizzing a ball across the face of goal for Harder to latch onto.\n\nThis after Bayern earned their own penalty at the start of the second half, back when the score was still 1-0, and Giulia Gwinn blazed over the bar. The chance to make this more decisive, while Bayern held the upper hand, was there.\n\nGwinn’s penalty miss would prove costly, and so would Bayern’s loosening grip on the game. After Harder’s 78th-minute would-be winner, the Bavarians found themselves pinned back as they tried to secure the win. There were seven players deep in Bayern’s box when Atlético winger Luany cut back to the top of the 18, where Fiamma Benítez arrived, unmarked and un-hassled, to hit a thundering strike that banked in off the inside of the crossbar.\n\nFCBayern.com captured player and coach reactions after the match.\n\nSaid head coach José Barcala: “The early goal against us certainly had an emotional impact, but we reacted well. We were very dominant and pushed the opponent deep into their own half. But Atlético was very compact between the lines and made it very difficult for us. After halftime, we shifted the game more to the flanks and turned the game around. Unfortunately, after taking the lead, we allowed too much space and conceded another goal.”\n\n“Disappointed, but learning from this game,” added midfielder Arianna Caruso.\n\nThe Frauen are back in action on Sunday against Hamburger SV — also their next DFB-Pokal opponents, though this time it is a league match. Then it’s back to the Champions League with a home match against Vålerenga next week, before finishing off the first half of the season at Leverkusen.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

It's a fun, addictive, accessible and easy sport to play,\" she says.\n\n\"When I started playing, I had a back injury, but that didn't even prevent me from playing.\n\n\"It's a great sport for those who aren't entirely mobile. There is all ages; people who've had hip operations; bigger people.\"\n\nShe first learnt the sport in Florida from an 83-year-old teacher.\n\n\"Pickleball has taken off. There's about 55,000 people in the UK playing it; it's the largest-growing sport in the western world,\" she says.\n\n\"In America, they've got hundreds of free courts, so we're still a little bit behind but we're definitely getting there.\"\n\nWhile there are many new clubs around the UK, she says some members turn up alone.\n\n\"The community is so welcoming: new players every single week and they keep coming back.\"\n\nHelen only started pickleball a year ago but now plays up to six days a week.\n\n\"This week alone, I've been to Stratford, Colchester, and now Woodbridge today,\" she says.\n\n\"I'll go anywhere to play pickleball, and I'm completely addicted. It is my life, sadly.\n\n\"It's always so good natured and although there are rivalries, it's always well mannered.\"\n\nTeacher by day, pickleball player by night, Sophie Maitland has taken her game to the next level and won bronze in the women's doubles at the national championship this year.\n\n\"We medalled and we are chuffed,\" she says.\n\nShe has found some of the best players on the court are the older ones who \"really surprise you\".\n\n\"There are many smiling faces, and it is a sport for everyone. You walk on a court with 70-year-olds and you think, 'We've got this' and then get run around!\n\n\"It's the best decision I ever made, to start playing. I got an injury in our medal match and it's been really tough not playing.\n\n\"I'm a teacher; it's a hard job. Playing is a release and it's huge for mental health.\"\n\nBefore taking up pickleball, Sonia Talbot, 52, played table tennis, rounders and badminton.\n\n\"It's great fun,\" she says. \"Pickleball gives me a smile. I don't take it too seriously, because you then will start losing.\n\n\"It's the social side of it, too; it's a great chance for us to get together. It's really good for fitness; hand-eye coordination. I would totally recommend it\".\n\nWhile some people have been playing for years, 74-year-old Steve, who has moved to Suffolk from Kent, has been playing for just eight weeks.\n\n\"It's a great place to come to meet new people and get fit. I am loving it,\" he says.\n\n\"The key is concentration. There are some fantastic players here, so I just try to learn from them, even though I move a little bit gingerly!\"\n\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nPickleball is most addictive sport, player says\n\nPickleball star hopes for long career in the sport\n\nWhat is pickleball - and why is it so popular?",

Salah could well be edging closer to the Anfield exit and there is major interest in him once again from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThere remains the possibility that Salah has ALREADY played his final game for Liverpool - which would represent a sad and bitter end to one of the greatest Reds’ careers of modern times.\n\nHe flies to the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt next week and Salah could well find himself working under new employers by the time the Pharaohs campaign concludes in January.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nTalk would then turn towards which players might come into Anfield to replace Salah - and we’ve already seen the likes of Michael Olise and Antoine Semenyo linked.\n\nBut Salah may well miss out this weekend in the Premier League versus Brighton and there are several games to cover before the January window opens.\n\nThat means a player from within the ranks is going to need to step up. Attacking options are at a premium right now - with Federico Chiesa and Cody Gakpo also absent - and Arne Slot has taken to using Dominik Szoboszlai in the right-sided midfield position.\n\nIf the Dutchman decides to end that arrangement this weekend then it paves the way for a return to action for Jeremie Frimpong.\n\nEarmarked as a potential Trent Alexander-Arnold replacement when he signed from Bayer Leverkusen over the summer, the £29.5m man is actually more comfortable on the right side of midfield or even as a winger.\n\nWith Joe Gomez holding his own at right-back and Conor Bradley suspended, the 25-year-old may well be used in a more advanced position following his recovery from injury.\n\nFrimpong hasn’t played since the game against Eintracht Frankfurt in October - with Arne Slot stating that his injury timeline looked similar to Bradley’s.\n\nThe Northern Ireland captain returned to the fray at Elland Road - suggesting that Frimpong won’t be far behind.\n\nLiverpool need to see the best of Frimpong soon - starting this weekend if he is fit - as he will be expected to showcase his credentials as a Salah stand-in while the two-time African footballer of the year is at Afcon.",

    "fullText": "With victory just seconds away, the Los Angeles Kings saw their lead disintegrate, ultimately falling 3-2 to the Seattle Kraken in overtime on Wednesday evening at Climate Pledge Arena. The loss snapped a six-game skid for Seattle, while Los Angeles saw its win streak end at two.\n\nVince Dunn delivered the dagger in the extra period, scoring the second straight unanswered goal for Seattle to seal a dramatic comeback. It was just his fifth of the season and second since Nov. 15.\n\nTHIS GAME IS DUNN 🦑\n\nVince Dunn scores the winner in @Energizer overtime for the @SeattleKraken! pic.twitter.com/FBjuggyycP\n\nMatty Beniers saved the Kraken late in the third, finding a desperation goal to tie the game at two with under 25 seconds remaining in regulation. A crucial tripping penalty on Kings' goalie Anton Forsberg left his squad shorthanded, allowing Seattle to cash in its third power play score of the evening.\n\nTALK ABOUT CLUTCH!!\n\nMatty Beniers ties the game for the @SeattleKraken! 😱 pic.twitter.com/2j8bgr8P8t\n\nForsberg saved 30 of the 33 shots sent his way, eventually falling to 4-2-3.

Not a single goal for either team on Wednesday night was scored at even strength.\n\nThe Kings entered the day having won three of their last four games at Climate Pledge Arena, boasting a 5-1-1 record all-time in the Emerald City. Three more meetings remain for the two sides this season, with the next two taking place at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nWith the quick two-game road trip in the books, Los Angeles will return home to host the Calgary Flames on Saturday night. Despite an overall slow start to the season (second to last in the Pacific Division), Calgary has won three of its last four to pick up some momentum.\n\nPuck drop is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. PT.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City came from a goal down last night to beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Bernabeu. The performance wasn’t a vintage City display by any stretch. They did suffer at times against Xabi Alonso’s side. But they overcame those moments to leave the Bernabeu with a valuable three points to aid their Champions League campaign. Pep Guardiola’s side displayed another side of their armoury that has formed the backbone of Manchester City’s recent era of dominance. City’s resilience and character stood out at the Bernabeu and it helped City pick up a huge win in Madrid.\n\nIt isn’t a stretch to say that Manchester City were up against it in the opening half-hour of last night’s match. Real Madrid were up for the occasion as were their fans. The atmosphere was hostile and the pressure and atmosphere went up a gear when Rodrygo opened the scoring in the 28th minute for Xabi Alonso’s side. Manchester City know all too well what can happen in the eye of the proverbial storm at the Bernabeu. But City weathered that storm to score two goals before halftime through Nico O’Reilly and Erling Haaland to take a 2-1 lead. Pep Guardiola’s side would hold onto that lead to leave Spain with a crucial win. What stood out was that Manchester City’s character and resilience played a big part in their win.\n\nCity rode out the wave so to speak throughout last night’s match. As Real Madrid pressed for an equaliser in the second half City stood tall as a collective to keep Madrid out. Pep Guardiola’s side were fortunate that an Endrick header hit the bar late on and several other Real Madrid chances came to nothing. Last night’s win won’t be remembered as a vintage City win. But to come away from the Bernabeu with a victory where Manchester City’s resilience and character formed the backbone of their victory could prove to be invaluable as this City team grows together.\n\nAny win over Real Madrid at the Bernabeu doesn’t come easy. Pep Guardiola said as much after last night’s match. Speaking on his team’s win, Guardiola acknowledged that his team still has growing to do as a team. But he acknowledged the importance of winning at the Bernabeu. Speaking on his team’s win over Real Madrid, Guardiola said: “Winning in the Bernabeu is a big big task, really big task, especially in this competition, don’t misunderstand me.”\n\n“But at the same time in February, March we are able to go through the level to arrive in semi-finals, finals, requires a better performance than today. It is not enough to be there.”\n\n“There are many good things, I am so pleased for the players for the effort, soul and heart and how they run but here and Anfield and PSG, Dortmund, Arsenal, Barcelona, knowing the players we will be better. We will improve, that’s for sure.”\n\nErling Haaland believes that last night’s win was an important win for his team. He explained: “This win is really important. It’s difficult to come here. It’s a tough place to come.”\n\n“We could have added another goal but the game was a bit chaotic.”\n\n“It’s a nice place to play. Look at this place it’s incredible. These are the games we want to play. In this format, we get to play more games which is nice. And I like it. In the end, we’re super happy.”\n\nLastly, Nico O’Reilly added that Manchester City’s character helped them come from behind to beat Real Madrid. O’Reilly told the media: “Everyone wanted to get on the ball, everyone wanted to play. I’d say there was a lot of character out there tonight. I think that’s what got us over the line. We knew we could get goals back, so that wasn’t the problem.”\n\n“We just had to stay focused, not be scared by the environment and the counter attacks they were causing. And that was it.”\n\n“We’re all on a high right now. We need to keep pushing and keep going.”\n\nManchester City showed their character and resilience to come from a goal down to beat Real Madrid last night. It isn’t a stretch to say that Manchester City’s win at the Bernabeu was their biggest away result of the season. It takes time for a team to build the character and resilience needed to go to a hostile environment and leave with an important victory. Pep Guardiola’s side is building those aspects of their makeup and their character and resilience could carry them a long way if it continues to grow.",

    "fullText": "Napoli chief Giovanni Manna was pressed on a potential move for Kobbie Mainoo in 2026, and he couldn’t rule it out.\n\nThe reigning Serie A champions have continued to be linked with Manchester United’s young starlet ever since he privately expressed his desire to leave on loan at the end of the summer window.\n\n(Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nNothing materialised from Mainoo’s requests, as United stepped in to block the move and encourage him to stay and fight for his role. He did so, but has continued to be utilised sparingly by Ruben Amorim, and is still awaiting his first Premier League start of 2025/2026.\n\nAmorim has previously suggested the club would not facilitate any mid-season departures to first-team players due to the partially depleted squad he’ll have when the African Cup of Nations gets underway.\n\nHowever, would there really be any justification for keeping Mainoo around if he’s going to spend the majority of the campaign watching on from the sidelines?\n\nIt’s certainly a situation Napoli will take a look at, too.\n\nAntonio Conte is navigating a lengthy absentee list heading into the festive period; he was without Kevin De Bruyne, Billy Gilmour and Stanislav Lobotka – amongst others – for last night’s Champions League clash with Benfica.\n\n(Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nA loan would perhaps suit all parties involved, as it’s thought the 20-year-old, hailed as ‘fantastic’ by ex-teammate Victor Lindelof, is reluctant to fully cut ties with his boyhood club just yet, while Napoli are unlikely to be able to afford him in the winter.\n\n“He is a player who has been linked to Napoli since August, also for his age, his potential, and the transfer opportunity,” said the Naples outfit’s sporting director Manna, as relayed by Football Italia.\n\n“This team is doing well. It is consolidated. We have some important absences right now, but sooner or later, the lads will return, strong and determined.\n\n“We have to make the right evaluations, so we’ll see how things progress along the way.”",

    "title": "Pando (Tree)",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Pando (from Latin pando 'I spread')[1] is the name of a quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone located in Sevier County, Utah, United States, in the Fishlake National Forest. A male clonal organism, Pando has an estimated 47,000 stems (ramets) that appear to be individual trees but are genetical identical parts of a single tree connected by a root system that spans 42.8 ha (106 acres). As a multi-stem tree, Pando is the world's largest tree by measures of weight, landmass and species.[2]\n\nSystems of classification used to define large trees vary considerably, leading to some confusion about Pando's status. Within the United States, the Official Register of Champion Trees defines the largest trees in a species-specific way; in this case, Pando is the largest aspen tree (Populus tremuloides). In forestry, the largest trees are measured by the greatest volume of a single stem, regardless of species. In that case, the General Sherman Tree is the largest unitary (single-stem) tree. While many emphasize that Pando is the largest clonal organism, other large trees, including Redwoods can also reproduce via cloning. Pando being the heaviest tree and the largest tree by landmass, while also being the largest aspen clone, leaves the Pando Tree in a class of its own.\n\nSince the early 2000s, little information has been adequately corroborated about Pando's origins and how its genetic integrity has been sustained over a long period of time, conservatively between 9,000 and 16,000 years old-by the latest (2024) estimate.[3] Researchers have argued that Pando's future is uncertain due to a combination of factors including drought, cattle grazing, and fire suppression.[4][5] In terms of drought, Pando's long-lived nature suggests it has survived droughts that have driven out human societies for centuries at a time. In terms of grazing, a majority of Pando's land mass is fenced for permanent protection and management as a unique tree. Cattle grazing ended in Pando in 2024, but previously, was permitted on a volume basis for 10 days a year in October, weather permitting, in a small edge of Pando's southeastern expanse. Additionally, between 2015 and 2022, the local grazers group, 7-Mile Grazers Association, who rely on Pando's forage and biomass to sustain the landscape, signed off on a long-term protection plan working with Fishlake National Forest and Friends of Pando, and also wrote letters of support for the \"Pando Protection Plan\", a plan to bring nearly 34 hectares (84 acres) of the tree into protective care. In terms of fire suppression, research indicates[6] Pando has survived fires that would have likely leveled the tree many times, after which Pando regenerated itself from the root system. The same research also indicates large-scale fire events are infrequent, which may be owed to the fact that aspen are water-heavy trees and thus, naturally fire resistant, earning them the name \"asbestos forests\" among wildfire scientists.[7] Concerns aside, there is a broad consensus that wildlife controls to protect Pando from overbrowsing by deer and elk are critical to the Pando's Tree's sustainability and care. Protection systems coupled with ongoing monitoring and restoration efforts have been shown to be effective dating back to the late 1980s and early 1990s, with new projects under way.[8]\n\nFriends of Pando[9] and the Fishlake National Forest partners to study and protect the Pando Tree working alongside Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.[10] Notable organizations that also study and advocate to protect Pando's care include Western Aspen Alliance[11] and Grand Canyon Trust.[12]\n\nThe Pando tree was identified in 1976 by Jerry Kemperman and Burton V. Barnes.[13][14] A posthumous biography by Barnes' colleague, Daniel Kashian,[15] details Pando's discovery:\n\nAs a part of his aspen work in the West, Burt began to examine an extremely large trembling aspen clone southwest of Fish Lake, Utah, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Using aerial photography and the same morphological differentiation\ntechniques he developed for aspen at UMBS for his dissertation, Burt concluded that the aspen forest that covered about 106 acres was a single aspen clone, quite possibly the \"world's largest organism.\" Other than a single publication about aspen clone size and another great story to tell his students, Burt's studies on the Fish Lake clone were relatively obscure.\n\n— Daniel M. Kashian, Burton V. Barnes (1930–2014)\n\nWork by Fishlake National Forest to understand and protect the tree began in 1987, according to interviews and articles written by Fishlake Forest as well as accounts gathered by Friends of Pando.[16] Based on Barnes and Kempermans's 1976 paper noting Pando's discovery, Michael Grant, Jeffrey Mitton, and Yan Linhart of the University of Colorado at Boulder re-examined the clone in 1992 and described Pando as a single male aspen clone based on its morphological characteristics such as pollen production, leaves, and root structure. Michael Grant named the tree \"Pando\" which is Latin for \"I spread\" in an editorial which was later published in Discover Magazine.[17] A large-scale genetic sampling and analysis was published in 2008 by Jennifer DeWoody, Karen Mock, Valerie Hipkins, and Carol Rowe.[18] The research team's genetic study confirmed morphological analysis by Barnes and Kemperman as well as Mitton, Grant and Linhart thus, verifying Pando's size and scale of operation.\n\nIn late 1987, Fishlake National Forest began work to remove diseased trees and promote new growth using coppicing (a form of mechanical stimulation),[19] which works by removing diseased stems, that in turn, stimulates a regenerative hormone response which spurs new growth.[20] In 1993, Fishlake National Forest began work on the \"Aspen Regeneration Project\",[16] installing fences to help control deer and elk who threatened to destroy the productive results of work to spur and protect new growth. Today, approximately 84 acres of Pando is protected by 8-foot wildlife controls, which work to control populations of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus canadensis), and to control human uses, such as off-road recreation and formerly permitted grazing by domestic cattle (Bos taurus). Additional fencing protections were added in 2025 bringing approximately 80% of Pando's landmass into protective care while also creating two simplified wildlife management bulwarks to move animals around the tree's landmass.[21]\n\nHistorically, regeneration rates in portions of the \"Aspen Regeneration Project\" which started in the 1990s, showed promise based on photographic evidence and repeated survey plots by land managers, scientists and conservation groups between 1993 and today.[22] Despite this, many have argued more work needs to be done to control wildlife, as the Pando Tree is surrounded by 700 square miles of de facto wildlife preserve managed by people, groups and agencies who do not have Pando's sustainability as a central concern in their land management policies. Paul Rogers and Darren McAvoy of Utah State University completed an assessment of Pando's status in 2018 and stressed the importance of reducing herbivory by mule deer and elk as critical to conserving Pando.[5] In 2019, Rogers and Jan Šebesta surveyed other vegetation within Pando besides aspen, finding additional support for their 2018 conclusions and found that interactions between browsing and management strategy may have had adverse effects on Pando's long-term resilience to change.[23] In 2023, a team of researchers, land managers, wildlife biologists and citizen scientists groups began long-term programs to monitor deer and elk using GPS collars and wildlife cameras to better understand wildlife.[24] In 2022, Executive Order 14702 directed the US Forest Service to inventory old growth and mature forest as part of a plan to protect mature and old growth forest. Data submitted by Fishlake National Forest defined Pando's landmass as \"mature,\" meaning it could be eligible for special care and protections. [25]\n\nBetween 2015 and 2022, Fishlake National Forest, Pando's federal land stewards, developed a plan and gathered public feedback for work to expand wildlife controls and protections of the Pando Tree as part of the Fishlake Basin Recreation Improvement Plan.[26] Work to develop the plan involved gathering formal and informal feedback from community, regional, and state organizations in Land Management, Agriculture, Conservation, and Recreation between 2015 and 2019, followed by a public comment period which ran from March 2021 through March 2022. The plan was approved in June 2022 by Fishlake National Forest Supervisor Michael Elson. In 2023, Friends of Pando worked to gather letters of support for the plan and was invited by Representative Carl Albrecht[27] to give a brief presentation about the plan to the Utah Legislature.(PDF of Presentation)[28] Based on recommendations and community support, Representative Albrecht secured a $250,000 allocation for the Utah Department of Transportation to develop plans and contract work to expand wildlife controls to bring the majority of Pando's landmass into protective care.[29] Between May 2024 and September 2024, Friends of Pando and community organizations worked to organize a series of talks and meetings to finalize the plan.[30] Based on wildlife behavior data gathered by Friends of Pando, Fishlake National Forest and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources[31] the final plan was mapped to maximize wildlife management in and around the tree. Work was completed in September of 2025[32].\n\nMost agree, based on Barnes' work and later work, that Pando encompasses 42.89 hectares (106 acres), weighs an estimated 6,000 metric tons (6,600 short tons) or 13.2 million pounds, and features an estimated 47,000 stems, which die individually and are replaced by genetically identical stems that are sent up from the tree's vast root system, a process known as \"suckering\".[2][33] The root system is estimated to be several thousand years old, with habitat modeling suggesting a maximum age of 14,000 years[34][35] and 16,000 years by the latest (2024) estimate.[3] Individual stems do not typically live more than 100–130 years. Pando's landmass spreads from 2,700 m (8,900 ft) above sea level to approximately 2,773 m (9,098 ft) above sea level along the western side of a steep basin wall.[36]\n\nMitton and Grant summarize the development of stems in aspen clones:[37]\n\n... quaking aspen regularly reproduces via a process called suckering. An individual stem can send out lateral roots that, under the right conditions, send up other erect stems; from all above-ground appearances the new stems look just like individual trees. The process is repeated until a whole stand, of what appear to be individual trees, forms. This collection of multiple stems, called ramets, all form one, single, genetic individual, usually termed a clone.\n\nDue to the progressive replacement of stems and roots, the overall age of an aspen clone cannot be determined from tree rings. Speculations on Pando's age have ranged between 80,000 and 1 million years.[37] Many news sources list Pando's age as 80,000 years, but this claim derives from a now-removed National Park Service web page, which redacted that claim in 2023 and was inconsistent with the Forest Service's post ice-age estimate.[38] Glaciers repeatedly formed on the Fish Lake Plateau[39] over the past several hundred thousand years and the mountains above Pando's landmass were crowned by glaciers as recently as the last glacial maximum.[40] Ages greater than approximately 16,000 years therefore require Pando to have survived climate conditions during the Pinedale glaciation, something that appears unlikely under current estimates of Pando's age and modeling of variations in local climate.[34][35] A 2017 paper by Chen Ding et al. seems to support US Forest Service claims that Pando could not be older than the last Glacial Maximum in the area based on paleo-climate models and genetic traits of aspen sites throughout North America.[41] A 2024 paper indicates the age could be between 16,000 and 80,000 years based on the first somatic mutation model of the tree, but, that research did not complete peer review and also relies on older material and testing methods. Thus, charcoal studies published in 2022 place the lower end of Pando's potential age range at around 9,000 years, while the somatic mutation models' most conservative estimate of 16,000 years of age awaits replication using new material and methods. In addition, any new age claims will need to square their results with climate models to prove conditions were favorable to the Pando seed being able to germinate and establish itself.\n\nEstimates of Pando's age have also been influenced by changes in the understanding of the establishment of aspen clones in western North America. Earlier sources argued that germination and successful establishment of aspen on new sites were rare in the last 10,000 years, and that Pando's root system was therefore likely greater than 10,000 years old.[37] More recent observations, however, have shown seedling establishment of new aspen clones is a regular occurrence and can be abundant on sites exposed by wildfire.[42] These findings are summarized in the U.S. Forest Service's Fire Effects Information System:[43]\n\n(Charles) Kay documented post-fire quaking aspen seedling establishment following 1986 and 1988 fires in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, respectively. He found seedlings were concentrated in kettles and other topographic depressions, seeps, springs, lake margins, and burnt-out riparian zones. A few seedlings were widely scattered throughout the burns. In Grand Teton National Park, establishment was greatest (950–2,700 seedlings/ha) in 1989, a wet year, but hundreds to thousands of seedlings established each year despite drought conditions in 1986–1988 and 1990–1991. Seedlings surviving past one season occurred almost exclusively on severely burned surfaces.",

    "title": "Microfeatures I'd like to see in more languages",
    "description": "There are roughly three classes of language features: Features that the language is effectively designed around, such that you can't add it after the fact....",
    "fullText": "There are roughly three classes of language features:\n\nMost PLT and language design work is focused around (1) and (2), because those are the most important, but I have a deep fondness for (3)-type features. Because they're so minor, they're the most likely to spread between languages, since the overhead of adding them is so small. Since I spend a lot of time in niche obscure languages, I also encounter a lot of cool QoL features that most people might not have seen before. Here's a few of them!\n\nThere's lot of small things we can do to make working with numbers easier. The first is adding a separator, as lots of languages already do. Instead of writing 10000500, you can write 10_000_500, or 1_00_00_500 if you're Indian. You can also do 1e3 instead of 1000.\n\nFor more interesting number QoLs, we can look at J. In science and math you sometimes get equations with powers and roots of π. J has the standardized number format {x}p{y} for xπ^y. For example, you can write 5*sqrt(π) as 5p0.5. There's also x for powers of e and r for exact rational numbers ((2r3 + 1) = 5r3).\n\nIn Lua you can write raw, multiline strings with [[]]:\n\nMost languages have multiline literals, but what makes the Lua version great is that the beginning and ending marks are different characters. This solves the infuriating \"unnestable quotes\" problem string literals have, and you don't have to escape all your literal \\s. My neovim has the string [[\\\\]] to literally mean the string \\\\. With escaping that'd be \"\\\\\\\\\" or something, ick.\n\nI saw this in Noulith and immediately fell in love:\n\nEver wanted to write x max= y while searching for some maximum value in some complicated loop? You can do that here. You can do it with literally any function.\n\nIn other words, x max= y ⇔ x = max(x, y). It should conceivably be extendible to things like text sub= (regex, replacement), which would cover a lot of small munging and plumbing work I'd need to do.\n\nChapel is a language for high-performance computing, where you need to run really fast algorithms across hundreds or thousands of processors. It's got a ton of (1) and (2)-type features I've never seen anywhere else, and I find the language incredibly interesting. Even not knowing it, there's a few QoL things I found in the docs that I now want in other languages.\n\nFirst, there's the config keyword. If you write config var n=1, the compiler will automatically add a --n flag to the binary. As someone who 1) loves having configurable program, and 2) hates wrangling CLI libraries, a quick-and-dirty way to add single-variable flags seems like an obvious win.\n\nSecond, you can write the sequence 1, 2, … n-1 as 1..<n. It's an elegant extension to the standard .. operator languages like Ruby and TLA+ use.\n\nThird— and this is one is a lot more arguable— you have \"promotion\", a sort of automatic type lifting. The gist of it is that if you have a function of type a -> a, Chapel lets you call it with arrays, too, returning a mapped array. So if f(x) = 2*x, then f([1, 2, 3]) = [2, 4, 6]. This is completely type-safe, too. You can get the same effect in other languages with a lift or a map, but it's a nice QoL to make it native.\n\n(Chapel has an extra flex here: it automatically parallelizes the computation. That's definitely outside of (3) territory, though).\n\nThese are just a few of the cool features in Chapel, and I'm not even touching the really fundamental things. I enthusiastically recommend anybody interested in PLT or scientific computing to check it out.\n\nFrink has special syntax for date values. You can write # 2001-08-12 # to mean the date 2001-08-12, instead of writing something annoying like Date(2001, 8, 12) and having a bug because months (but not days) start at 0.\n\nPowershell functions can have an explicit Param block where you define attributes for each function parameter, like default values, help docs, validation constraints, etc. So instead of writing fun f(str path = \"/\", int x), you can write something like (in pseudocode)\n\nNow this makes a lot more sense for a shell language, where you want lots of optional flags, switches, and aliases, but I can see it being really useful in a compiled language too. For one, it makes adding variable-level contracts easier. Second, what if parameter blocks were abstractable? If you look at something like numpy functions, so many of them share the exact same parameter definitions. What if you could write def log(standard-exp-params) instead of having to write them out every single time?\n\nAs seen in most lisps. Instead of naming things two_words or TwoWords, you can use the name two-words. It's easier to write and easier to read. Of course the reason why nonlisps can't do that is because they have infix minus, and it's ambiguous whether x-y is the expression x minus y or the invocation of the x-y function. Seems like a bad tradeoff, though. How often do you use -, and how often do you write multiword functions? Just say that x-y is always a function, and if you want math you can use spaces like the rest of us.\n\n(Granted this couldn't be added to existing languages without breaking everything, but maybe worth considering if you're making a new language?)\n\nRuby has a special data type called a symbol, written like :this.1 A symbol compares equal to itself and has no other functionality. It replaces single-word strings— instead of writing dict[\"employee_id\"], you write dict[:employee_id].\n\nThe advantage of having symbols is that it makes strings easier to work with. In most languages, strings are used to represent a lot of different things: tokens, text, structured data, code, etc. If you see the string \"book\", it's not clear without context whether it's a dictionary key, or a text field with just \"book\" in it, or a trivial CSV, or what. With symbols, you can at least rule it out the former case, because then it'd instead be :book.\n\nAs seen in D's unit-test blocks on functions and P's monitors. While it makes sense to keep the actual testing as library code, testing is so universal in larger software projects that it sounds nice to give it syntactic support.\n\nAnyway I don't think adding these to arbitrary languages would be easy or have no downstream impacts, but they all at least seem more orthogonal to existing language semantics than type-(2) features, which are often back-added (for lots of good benefits). So they'd more easily to spread across languages. Except kebab-case. We live in a fallen world.\n\nThis was sent as part of an email newsletter; you can Common topics are software history, formal methods, the theory of software engineering, and silly research dives. Updates are every week. I also have a website where I put my polished writing (the newsletter is more for off-the-cuff stuff).\n\nSymbols come from lisps, but I encountered them in Ruby first. ↩",

    "fullText": "Palantir and the US Navy have signed a two-year deal to test whether its Foundry operational software can streamline the nation’s shipbuilding efforts and steer the Secretary of the Navy's top budget priority into port.\n\nThe $448 million contract will bring Palantir’s technology to work on shipbuilders, shipyards, and critical suppliers, said US Secretary of the Navy John Phelan and Palantir CEO Alex Karp during a presentation Tuesday evening in Washington, D.C. The company is calling this particular program \"ShipOS.\"\n\n“Every ship builder who partners with us will have AI power tools that optimize their work in real time. Every supplier in the network will be connected through intelligent logistics,” Phelan said on stage, according to US Naval Institute News. “Every program manager will have unprecedented visibility into schedule, cost and risk. We’re not just building ships faster. We’re rebuilding American maritime industrial capacity for the AI age.”\n\nPhelan listed strengthening US shipbuilding and the Maritime Industrial Base as the top priority of his $292.2 billion budget request for 2026, which called for 19 new battle force ships. The budget also invests $2.5 billion just for submarine builders to increase their \"health and supply chain enterprise.\"\n\nPalantir’s software will initially be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three shipyards, and 100 suppliers, all of which are part of the Maritime Industrial Base (MIB), a Navy program established in 2024 to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair. Palantir previously announced a deal with MIB to use its Warp Speed manufacturing software in July.\n\nThat early work resulted in leaps in efficiency, according to a press release. At General Dynamics Electric Boat – which designs, builds, repairs and modernizes nuclear submarines for the U.S. Navy – submarine schedule planning was reduced from 160 manual hours to under 10 minutes. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard cut material review times from weeks to under one hour.\n\nIn order to win more business, Palantir must deliver “measurable cost savings over time, improved schedules, reduced delays, and increased production efficiency, with productivity gains offsetting the initial investment while establishing a more capable and resilient industrial base,” according to the announcement.\n\nPalantir’s head of defense Mike Gallagher told reporters at Tuesday’s event that it was now up to the software company to deliver the operational gains it has promised, according to Breaking Defense.\n\n“We have to prove the value,” he said. “And then at the end of the two-year program, the companies, if we push ourselves, will take on the sustainment costs.”\n\nOnce it's running, Foundry will aggregate data from enterprise resource planning systems, legacy databases, and operational sources to identify bottlenecks, streamline engineering workflows, and support proactive risk mitigation, the announcement stated.\n\n“This is another watershed deal for Palantir on the Foundry platform,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told El Reg. “Big step forward. We believe Palantir will be able to do this at scale.” ®",

    "fullText": "The familiar life horizon has been outgrown: the old concepts, ideals, and emotional patterns no longer fit; the time for the passing of a threshold is at hand.\n\nApproaching a threshold is akin to stepping through a portal; An opening of a new and previously inaccessible path. It’s more than mere change, thresholds imply that transformation has taken place.\n\nArt is long, life short, judgment difficult, opportunity transient. To act is easy, to think is hard; to act according to our thought is troublesome. Every beginning is cheerful: the threshold is the place of expectation.\n\nSome individuals in this world will arrive at these thresholds. These points, any one person can arrive at, but not all will. Once passed, we can never return. For there is no unchanged point we could ever possibly return to, as we hurtle through time and space perhaps it would be wise to take pause at such thresholds. To truly take stock of the era we are entering and to notice how some boundaries once crossed, will never again be uncrossed. We are at many such thresholds this century.\n\nThere comes a time when the pain of continuing exceeds the pain of stopping. At that moment, a threshold is crossed. What seemed unthinkable becomes thinkable. Slowly, the realization emerges that the choice to continue what you have been doing is the choice to live in discomfort, and the choice to stop what you have been doing is the choice to breathe deeply and freely again. Once that realization has emerged, you can either honor it or ignore it, but you cannot forget it. What has become known can not become unknown again.",

    "fullText": "Ecologically important Diadema africanum almost eliminated by unknown disease in Canary Islands\n\nA marine pandemic is bringing some species of sea urchin to the brink of extinction, and some populations have disappeared altogether, a study has found.\n\nSince 2021, Diadema africanum urchins in the Canary Island archipelago have almost entirely been killed by an unknown disease. There has been a 99.7% population decrease in Tenerife, and a 90% decrease off the islands of the Madeira archipelago.\n\nIn the same period, mass deaths have been detected in species from the Red Sea, Mediterranean, Caribbean and western Indian Ocean.\n\nIván Cano, a researcher at the University of La Laguna and author of the study, said: “What we have seen since 2021 is really, really concerning. We are talking about the disappearance of several species in a really short time.”\n\nSea urchins are remarkable creatures. A relative of the starfish, they breathe through their feet, and while their spikes are a formidable defence against predators, they also provide refuge for smaller marine creatures.\n\nThey are known as “ecosystem engineers”, and affect their surroundings by grazing on algae, breaking down food for other animals, and acting as food for predators.\n\n“What fascinated me in the first place about this species is that they change their environment. Like humans, when they are present, they modify their habitat,” said Cano. “We don’t know the cascading effect that this could have in other species.”\n\nThe scientists do not know exactly what has caused this pandemic, but Cano said humans were “probably involved” in the distribution of the disease. Current theories about its transmission include shipping, changes to currents and abnormal wave activity.\n\nCano came to the Canary Islands to study the early life of urchins. He quickly found, to his dismay, that there were not enough young urchins to study. As a result, he changed his doctoral subject to study the rapid decline in their populations.\n\nThe Diadema genus, which populates tropical waters around the world, are the most widespread and ecologically important family of urchin.\n\nThere are only a few pockets of water where Diadema have not been affected by this outbreak of disease.\n\n“We aren’t yet sure how this pandemic will evolve,” Cano said. “So far, it seems not to have spread to other populations in Southeast Asia and Australia, which is good news – but we cannot rule out the possibility that the disease will reappear and potentially spread further.”",

    "description": "Archaeologists have found the earliest evidence yet of fire technology — and it was created by Neanderthals in England more than 400,000 years ago.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNeanderthals were the world's first innovators of fire technology, tiny specks of evidence in England suggest. Flecks of pyrite found at a more than 400,000-year-old archaeological site in Suffolk, in eastern England, push back archaeologists' evidence for controlled fire-making and suggest that key human brain developments began far earlier than previously thought.\n\n\"We're a species who've used fire to really shape the world around us,\" study co-author Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said in a news conference on Tuesday (Dec. 9). \"The ability to make fire would have been critically important\" in human evolution, Davis said, \"accelerating evolutionary trends\" such as developing larger brains, maintaining larger social groups, and increasing language skills.\n\nSince 2013, Davis and colleagues have been excavating an archaeological site in England called Barnham, which yielded stone tools, burnt sediment and charcoal from 400,000 years ago. In a study published Wednesday (Dec. 10) in the journal Nature, the researchers revealed that the site contained the world's earliest direct evidence of fire-making — and that this fire technology was likely pioneered by Neanderthals.\n\nBarnham was first recognized as a Paleolithic human site in the early 1900s due to the presence of stone tools. But recent excavations uncovered evidence of ancient human groups occupying the area more than 415,000 years ago, when Barnham was a small, seasonal watering hole in a woodland depression.\n\nIn one corner of the site, archaeologists found a concentration of heat-shattered hand axes as well as a zone of reddened clay. Through a series of scientific analyses, the researchers discovered that the reddened clay had been subjected to repeated, localized burning, which suggested the area may have been an ancient hearth.\n\n\"The big turning point came with the discovery of iron pyrite,\" study co-author Nick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, said in the news conference.\n\nPyrite, also known as fool's gold, is a naturally occurring mineral that can produce sparks when struck against flint. While pyrite is found in many locations around the world, it is extremely rare in the Barnham area, meaning someone specifically brought pyrite to the site, probably with the aim of making fire, the researchers said in the study.\n\nBecause of the importance of controlled fire, paleoanthropologists have long debated the timing of this invention.\n\n\"There are so many obvious advantages to fire, from cooking to protection from predators to its technological use in creating new types of artifacts to its ability to bring people together,\" April Nowell, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the University of Victoria in Canada who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"We only have to think of our own childhoods gathering around a campfire to understand its emotional resonance.\"\n\nResearchers believe that early humans first used wildfires for cooking food. This was a crucial step in human evolution because cooking widened the range of food available and made it more digestible, which in turn provided more nutrients needed to grow a larger brain, Davis said.\n\nBut there is limited evidence for deliberate early fire technology, and that evidence is often ambiguous, the researchers noted in the study.\n\nFor example, scientists unearthed reddened sediment at Koobi Fora in Kenya that dated to about 1.5 million years ago. Researchers suggested it could hint at early fire use because the key hominin at the site — Homo erectus — had a fairly large brain. And at two sites in Israel dated to about 800,000 years ago, burnt animal bones and stone tools suggest possible control of fire by the human ancestors who lived there.\n\nFire technology then exploded around 400,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found evidence of burning at cave sites in France, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and the U.K., and then more widespread use of fire in Europe, Africa and the Levant (the region around the east Mediterranean) by 200,000 years ago.\n\nBut these previous examples do not show the same kind of conclusive geochemical evidence of fire making that was found at Barnham, Ashton argued. He called the team's careful analysis of the Barnham sediment and identification of pyrite \"the most exciting discovery in my 40-year career.\"\n\nHowever, any bones at Barnham have since disintegrated, so the \"smoking gun\" of butchered and burned animal bones that could prove the site was used for cooking has not been found.\n\nThis also means there are no skeletal remains of the fire producers themselves at Barnham — but study co-author Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the National History Museum in London, has a guess about their identity.\n\n\"We assume that the fires at Barnham were being made by early Neanderthals,\" Stringer said in the news conference, based on a nearby site called Swanscombe, where Neanderthal skull bones were discovered that dated to the same time period as Barnham.\n\nWhile experts have known for about a decade that some Neanderthals could make fire, that evidence goes back only 50,000 years. The Barnham finds push that date 350,000 years further back, suggesting Neanderthals were much smarter than most people give them credit for.\n\nNeanderthals \"are fully human,\" Stringer said. \"They have complex behavior, they're adapting to new environments, and their brains are as large as ours. They're very evolved humans.\"\n\nNowell said that the study's results add fuel to a larger debate about Neanderthals' control of fire and their social and cultural use of it.\n\n\"There is a lot of discussion right now about whether all Neanderthals made fire or if it is only some Neanderthals at some times and places that made fire,\" Nowell said. The new study \"is another important data point in our understanding of Neanderthal pyrotechnical capabilities with all that implies cognitively, socially and technologically.\"\n\nIf the researchers are correct that Neanderthals made fire from flint and pyrite more than 400,000 years ago in England, this raises additional questions, Nowell said.\n\n—Neanderthals could be brought back within 20 years — but is it a good idea?\n\n—Neanderthals cannibalized 'outsider' women and children 45,000 years ago at cave in Belgium\n\n—'Perfectly preserved' Neanderthal skull bones suggest their noses didn't evolve to warm air\n\n\"Despite its obvious advantages, questions remain about the nature of early fire use: When did fire use become a regular part of the human behavioral repertoire? Were early humans dependent on the opportunistic use of wildfires and lightning strikes? Was fire rediscovered multiple times?\" Nowell said.\n\nThe ancestors of Homo sapiens were living in Africa 400,000 years ago and not likely interacting with early Neanderthals half a world away.\n\n\"We don't know if Homo sapiens at that date had the ability to make fire,\" Stringer said, because to date there is no clear evidence for control of fire any earlier than Barnham.\n\nThis means that Neanderthals may have invented ways to make and control fire somewhere in continental Europe, which then enabled our human cousins to move further north into England, heating and lighting their way with fire.\n\n\"It's plausible that fire became more controlled in Europe and spread to Africa,\" Ashton said. \"We have to keep an open mind.\"",

Your savings must also be resilient enough to handle inflation, market swings and the risk of outliving your money.\n\nThe financial bar for this kind of retirement is likely higher than most people expect. Here’s why.\n\nRetiring on $144,000 isn’t typical. In 2025, the “magic number” for retirement savings is $1.26 million, according to a Northwestern Mutual study (1). Using the standard 4% rule, that equates to about $50,400 per year — or $4,200 per month in retirement income.\n\nThat figure aligns closely with the median retirement income of $54,710 for Americans over 65, based on 2023 U.S. Census Bureau data (2).\n\nThat’s already a steep target, but it only scratches the surface. Once you factor in inflation and longevity risk, the bar climbs even higher.\n\nIf you’re hoping to achieve three times the average retirement income, you may benefit from working with an advisor. People who work with financial advisors see a 3% increase in net returns, according to a report from Vanguard.\n\nThe advisors at Range offer white-glove financial services to high-income households.\n\nOnce your equity enters this ballpark, one of the most significant financial pain points can be asset under management (AUM) fees. These fees mean that portfolio managers take a percentage of the value, typically between 0.5% and 2%, of your managed assets — so as your wealth grows, so do their fees.",

    "fullText": "Extremely cold air has been building in northern Canada this week and is poised to roll southeastward into large parts of the central and eastern United States in the days ahead. However, AccuWeather meteorologists say some changes in the pattern will begin to unfold next week, which will root out the coldest air from the U.S. before Christmas.\n\n\"There is a massive area of air in northwestern Canada where temperatures are 20 to 30 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it is on its way southeastward into the U.S.,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said. \"This is the mother lode of cold air and is a term I don't use lightly.\"\n\nThe frigid air will be uncomfortable and potentially dangerous for people across the northern Plains to the Midwest, although temperatures may not be quite as extreme as they are farther north in Canada.\n\n\"The coldest air of the season so far is on the way for portions of the Midwest, Tennessee Valley and much of the Appalachians,\" AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok said.\n\nHave the app? Unlock AccuWeather Alerts™ with Premium+\n\nIn Minneapolis, actual temperatures may fail to climb above zero and will be surrounded by lows between 10 and 20 degrees below zero on Friday night and Saturday night. AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperatures can drop 10-20 degrees or more below the actual temperature. \"Exposure or those without shelter in these conditions, especially with blustery winds, can lead to hypothermia or frostbite in less than 30 minutes,\" Pastelok said.\n\nTemperatures may barely reach the single digits in Chicago on Saturday then drop well below zero Saturday night. \"The RealFeel Temperature in Chicago is forecast to remain below zero all weekend,\" Pastelok said.\n\nThe upcoming Arctic outbreak and most cold blasts in recent weeks have been driven by a displacement or weakening of the polar vortex.\n\nThe dense Arctic air will hover in the lowest part of the atmosphere and may struggle to climb over the Appalachians. However, even in the areas east of the mountains from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, temperatures will approach or exceed the low mark reached during the middle of this week. Should a storm deliver the first accumulating snow of the season to these areas later this weekend, the stage could be set for temperatures to plummet east of the Appalachians as well.\n\n\"The frigid pattern triggered by the recent disruption of the polar vortex will hold its grip over much of the central and eastern U.S. into next week,\" Pastelok said. \"Millions of families will likely struggle with high heating bills, with furnaces, baseboards and heat pumps running frequently to keep homes warm in the harsh cold.\" In unheated areas, there will be a risk of pipes freezing and bursting.\n\nFrigid conditions to ease before Christmas\n\nThe weather pattern is expected to shift next week, adopting a more west-to-east orientation in the U.S. However, it may take some time for the coldest air to leave, and there will still be some bursts of cold air in the central and eastern states, although not as extreme as the mid-December Arctic outbreak.\n\n\"While it may feel like Christmastime already with the cold and snow, the bitterly cold pattern is not expected to last through the holidays,\" Pastelok said.\n\nThe vast snow cover still being added to by the clipper storm pattern through this weekend is likely to be eroded by higher temperatures before Christmas.\n\n\"Don't assume because it is cold and snowy now that it will be so on Christmas Day,\" Pastelok said. \"Skiers and snowboarders should take advantage of the cold air and fresh powder at the slopes that are open in the Appalachians. Ski and boarding conditions could deteriorate over Christmas week at some resorts as warmer air moves in.\"\n\nIn the meantime, those wanting warmth or at least warm thoughts through this weekend can look to the Florida Peninsula and most areas west of the Rockies, except for foggy areas in California's Central Valley or flooded zones in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

Now that Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription service has been overhauled, you can dive into a library of PS3 classics with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. We've rounded up the best PS3 games to stream on PlayStation Plus.\n\nOur list includes games across a wide variety of genres. Some are well-known PlayStation exclusives that have been given new life on the PS5, while others are unsung gems that you may have missed out on during the PS3 era. Keep in mind that unlike other platforms in the new PS Plus library, you can only stream PlayStation 3 titles; you can't download them onto your console. That means you need a stable Wi-Fi connection or a hardwired ethernet connection (recommended) to play them.\n\nYou'll notice that our list includes several remakes and remasters from older PlayStation platforms that were added to the PS3 library. Any game that's streaming-only was eligible for this list. If you want to go further back in time, check out our list of the best classic PS1/PS2/PSP games to play with a PS Plus Premium subscription--classics and PS3 games are limited to Premium subscribers. And if you're more interested in staying in the modern era, we also have a list of the best games to play with a PlayStation Plus Extra or Premium membership. For a full look at the new PS Plus service, take a look at our roundup of every game available in the PS Plus library.\n\nAlthough it’s been somewhat overshadowed by the games that came after it, Fallout 3 was a major turning point for the franchise. This was the first 3D Fallout game, and many of the gameplay mechanics have been celebrated in its successors. Bethesda also attracted some top-notch voice talent for this one, including Liam Neeson, who voices the father of the player’s character.\n\nAfter emerging from a Vault, players get to explore the Washington D.C. area and follow the primary and side missions to enjoy up to 100 hours or \n\nNinja Theory’s Heavenly Sword felt like it was meant to be the beginning of the next great franchise. Instead, it was a one-and-done with fantastic graphics and gameplay that put players in the role of Nariko, a woman who dares to take up the Heavenly Sword to protect her family and clan even though it will slowly overtake her body and destroy her.\n\nThe combat is fluid and a hell of a lot of fun when using the sword to take a large number of enemies on-screen. There are also a few times when players control Nariko’s closest friend, Kai, who has projectile weapons that you can aim and glide towards an enemy with the turn of a controller. This game doesn’t just deserve a modern remaster, it needs a sequel.\n\nRead our Heavenly Sword review.\n\nKonami has left the Castlevania franchise on the shelf for over a decade, and the only way to revisit the reboot, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, is by diving into it on PS Plus Premium. Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima was one of the producers for this title, which reimagined the entire Castlevania mythos and gave the gameplay the 3D makeover it needed.\n\nIn this version of the story, players take control of Gabriel Belmont, a holy warrior for the Brotherhood of Light. Gabriel’s wife, Marie, has been murdered by one of the supernatural creatures he was born to fight. But because Marie’s soul is trapped, she serves as Gabriel’s guide as he takes up a quest to not only save the world, but restore his wife to life. This is a wildly underrated title, and we need more Castlevania games like this.\n\nRead our Castlevania: Lords of Shadow review.\n\nGamers of a certain age should remember Sly Cooper, the anthropomorphic raccoon and master thief who was the main character of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus on PlayStation 2. That game and its first two sequels--Sly 2: Band of Thieves and Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves--were remastered for PlayStation 3 as part of The Sly Collection, and they have withstood the test of time.\n\nThe original versions of the trilogy were developed by Sucker Punch before the studio went on to release Infamous and Ghost of Tsushima. You’ll recognize the DNA of those games by the way Sly moves on rooftops and the way he utilizes stealth to remain undetected. Now, someone just needs to pull off a heist so Sly can get the comeback he deserves.\n\nWhile Arkham Origins game may not have been helmed by Rocksteady Games, developer Warner Bros. Montreal still did an admirable job with this prequel. Featuring all the combat, stealth, and detective work you'd expect from a Batman game, this Arkham title hit all three bat-nails on the bat-heads.\n\nRead our Batman Arkham Origins review.\n\nDecades after they were first released, the Devil May Cry games--yes, even the controversial second one--still stand tall as excellent action romps. Demonic hordes, stylish combat, and a protagonist with a devil-may-care attitude are just some of the reasons why Capcom's classic trilogy deserves a revisit. We recommend playing them in order, but if time is an issue, Devil May Cry 3 holds up better than its predecessors.\n\nRead our Devil May Cry HD Collection review.\n\nA cult-classic Japanese tactics series, you can grab several Disgaea games on PS Plus and feel what it's like to deliver ridiculous numbers of damage, forge relationships, and master exotic weapons within the fantasy frame of these titles. Just the Disgaea games alone offer hundreds of hours of compelling PS3 streaming content.\n\nA technical achievement at the time, The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion's open-world design was nothing short of stunning when it first released in 2006. 16 years later, the game is still a treat, with its in-your-face swords and sorcery action, excellent voice-acting, and dark fantasy tale centered around a Daedra invasion.\n\nRead our The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion review.\n\nBefore it was developing an underrated Devil May Cry reboot or the Senua's Saga series, developer Ninja Theory was making a name for itself with Enslaved. A new take on the classic tale, Enslaved pivots from ancient China to the far future for a thrilling tale of action in a robot post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nRead our Enslaved: Odyssey to the West review.\n\nFallout 3 brought the Bethesda series into a new dimension, but Obsidian Entertainment's spin-off is arguably the most well-remembered entry in the series. The gameplay was largely the same, but the extra improvements, incredible characters, and a fascinating new region made this Fallout the gold standard of the post-apocalyptic franchise. Fallout 3 is also on PS Plus Premium, and it's still worth playing, too.\n\nRead our Fallout New Vegas review.\n\nLiving up to its name, FEAR was part first-person shooter and part psychological horror that combined to create an effective package of high-caliber thrills. Everything from the sound design to the atmospheric levels was a showcase of how to give your audience multiple heart attacks, and even with several sequels, the first FEAR is still the cold standard for terror.\n\nThe original Greek adventures that set a new benchmark for games with brutal combat and quick-time events, the first two God of War games are fascinating throwbacks to the past that introduced the world to Kratos and his undying rage. The HD versions of these PS2 classics are still a treat to play in 2022.\n\nWhile there certainly wasn't a shortage of official PGA games during the PS3 era, but Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational was easily the best arcade golf game on the console. Originally released on the PS Vita, this port spruced up the product and made it feel even better with PS Move features that put you right in the game. Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds is also available to stream on PS Plus, so if you get bored of the courses in World Invitational, there's plenty more golfing fun to be had in Out of Bounds.\n\nRead our Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational review.\n\nIn an era where the PS2 was home to a regular influx of hit games, Ico stood out from the pack with its more tranquil puzzle gameplay and novel storytelling methods. Fast-forward a few years into the future, and an HD remaster brought all of that magic back in a new light.\n\nBefore it was developing an incredible samurai sandbox in Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch was known as the Infamous studio for good reason. An absolute power fantasy trip with fascinating consequences depending on your morality, the Infamous games still make for electrifying entertainment.\n\nReleased at a time when Mega Man had been absent from home consoles for years, the ninth and tenth installments in the series showed that the Blue Bomber hadn't lost his charm during his hiatus. Challenging and colorful, these Mega Man games were some of the best that the franchise had to offer. They captured the nostalgia of early Mega Man games by replicating the pixelated visuals while taking advantage of modern advancements in technology.\n\nThe fourth time was the charm for the Motorstorm series, as Apocalypse upped the ante with its rich selection of vehicles, well-designed tracks, and destructible environments that made each race a nail-biting sprint across hostile terrain.\n\nRead our Motorstorm: Apocalypse review.\n\nShinobi style cranked up to the maximum, Ryu Hayabusa's PS3 adventures were nothing short of effortlessly cool action mixed with devastating difficult gameplay. The Sigma games are harder than a freshly forged kunai, but they're still rewarding to play.\n\nRead our Ninja Gaiden Sigma review.\n\nVisually striking, PixelJunk Eden's Encore edition is a strange but fascinating game of platforming mixed with gardening. Sometimes serene, sometimes intense when the timer starts counting down; the lush visuals, distinct score, and surreal maneuverability makes for an unforgettable game.\n\nRead our PixelJunk Eden Encore review.\n\nPuppeteering might be the creepiest form of entertainment ever devised, but in the hands of SCE Japan, it's a medium that packs charm and imagination into a package of pure charm. Throw in some wonderful platforming, epic boss battles, and a killer soundtrack, and you've got a winner right here.\n\nA great Ratchet and Clank game is pure digital comfort food, and these two titles were simply delicious to dig into. Charming, witty, and full of great level design, PS Plus has a one-two punch of nostalgic fun waiting to be experienced in this pair of games. There are a couple other Ratchet games available to stream, but this pair keeps the traditional Ratchet & Clank gameplay.\n\nRead our Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus review.\n\nTaking a detour from the Grand Theft Auto series into wild west territory, Red Dead Redemption will amaze you with its cowboy sandbox and break your heart with its story. The standalone expansion, Undead Nightmare, is also plenty of fun as it adds a zombie mode that turns the entire game upside down.\n\nRead our Red Dead Redemption review.\n\nBefore the remake arrives, dive into Resident Evil 4 and marvel at how the series underwent a massive shift in tone and style. The controls might take some getting used to, but the rest of the game puts a terrific action spin on Resident Evil's trademark undead horror.\n\nRead our Resident Evil 4 review.\n\nThe final chapter in the Resistance saga is all action, alien devastation, and peak FPS fun from its era. Toss in some stomach-churning terror and a story that constantly increases in tension, and you'll be on the edge of your seat from the main menu through to the end credits.\n\nWhen Sam and Max made their return, it was nothing short of triumphant at the time. Reborn with a fancy new 3D aesthetic and 4D humor, these collections are perfect examples of hilarious storytelling and ingenious puzzles.\n\nRead our Sam and Max: Beyond Time and Space review.\n\nIf you ever wondered what would happen if Michael Bay decided to make a racing game, then Split/Second is your answer to that question. A solid arcade-style racing game, the real attention-grabber here was a selection of tracks that featured explosive turns and plenty of mayhem in every single race.\n\nThe tale of Darth Vader's secret apprentice may have been expunged from Star Wars continuity, but back then, these games were massively ambitious entries that sought to flesh out the years between the prequel and original trilogies. Living up to its name, the Force truly was unleashed in Starkiller's adventures across a galaxy far, far away.\n\nRead our Star Wars: The Force Unleashed review.\n\nStill revered as one of the most influential fighting games of all time, Street Fighter II also set a standard with several enhanced versions of the game that would be released over the years. Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is that legendary game at its best, packed with a great roster of characters, well-oiled fighting mechanics, and plenty of modern touches.\n\nRead our Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nFor a change of pace, grab a quick stream of the delightful puzzle-punching Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix. It's cute, captivating, and still plays like a dream.\n\nRead our Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nIn the mood for a dual-stick spaceship game that lets you see wonderfully colorful worlds as you turn enemy vessels into an explosive collection of pixels? Super Stardust HD has you covered with this stylish blast from the past.\n\nRead our Super Stardust HD review.\n\nPlatforming action starring a small blob might not sound too enticing, but this little gelatinous fellow combined magnetic traversal with relaxing puzzles and comfortable levels to explore. Two games, two adventures that can easily be enjoyed over a weekend.\n\nRead our Tales from Space: About a Blob review.\n\nEasily the weirdest title on this list, Tokyo Jungle is an examination of what life would be like for our beloved pets if humanity decided to just vanish off the face of the planet one day. It's a flawed gem, but one that sparkles with its absurd ideas and lively world.\n\nRevived for a new generation, Firaxis' XCOM was a welcome sight for anyone who felt that The Bureau had derailed the XCOM name. Pure tactical action and layered squad-building, this XCOM modernized the series for a new audience while keeping veterans engaged with its strategic content.\n\nRead our XCOM Enemy Within review.",

    "description": "Paramount's CEO urged shareholders to tender their shares and slammed WBD for an \"opaque sales process\" that gave Netflix preferential treatment.",
    "fullText": "The media war between Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, and Paramount is raging on.\n\nParamount Skydance's CEO, David Ellison, sent a letter to WBD shareholders on Wednesday, urging them to tender their shares in support of Paramount's bid for WBD.\n\n\"It is not too late to realize the benefits of Paramount's proposal if you choose to act now and tender your shares,\" Ellison said in the letter.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix announced that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion, after WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid for WBD, for $30 per share.\n\nIn the letter, Ellison also slammed WBD's advisors for not giving equal weight to Paramount's offer, compared to Netflix's, and described the sales process as being \"opaque.\"\n\n\"To suggest that we are not 'good for the money' (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd,\" he said.\n\nHe said that WBD advisors \"never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers.\"\n\nEllison added that WBD did not grant Paramount a \"single 'real time' negotiating session,\" and had \"sprinted towards a deal with Netflix.\" He said WDB ignored texts from him and his advisors in which they said their $30-per-share offer was not their best and final one.\n\nRepresentatives for WBD did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about Ellison's accusations in the letter.\n\nAfter Paramount launched the hostile bid, Ellison pitched the deal to his own staff in an internal memo on Monday, as seen by Business Insider. He told his staff that the combination of Paramount and WBD would be a \"powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Ellison said at a Tuesday UBS event that he knew why WBD could not accept his latest offer.\n\n\"If they accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty, so I don't think they can just take that,\" Ellison said.\n\nThe bid is partially financed by the wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe media war has not escaped the notice of President Donald Trump, who said he would be involved in the deal. He said on Sunday that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian brigade has released footage of one of its uncrewed ground vehicles opening fire on a Russian armored personnel carrier, offering a rare glimpse at the emerging technology in action.\n\nThe 5th Separate Assault Brigade said on Wednesday that it deployed a Droid TW 12.7 — a remotely operated tracked system developed by a Ukrainian defense tech company — on a road deemed likely to be a route for advancing Russian troops.\n\nThe brigade said that the ground-based drone later encountered a Russian MT-LB, a lightly armored fighting vehicle often used to transport infantry.\n\nThermal footage filmed at night from the uncrewed ground vehicle, or UGV, shows it opening fire on the vehicle, its operator swerving a targeting reticle across the MT-LB's front.\n\nBusiness Insider could neither independently verify when nor where the footage was filmed.\n\nThe Droid TW 12.7 is equipped with an M2 Browning machine gun that fires .50 caliber rounds, which would typically pierce an MT-LB's armor.\n\nThe 5th Brigade said it used armor-piercing incendiary rounds for the mission.\n\nSparks fly from the armored vehicle's chassis as it slows to a crawl and drifts in front of the UGV, which continues firing point-blank.\n\n\"The 12.7 mm bullets punch through the MT-LB's side, striking the crew and onboard systems,\" a narrator said in the 5th Brigade's video, referring to the metric measurement for .50 caliber bullets.\n\nThe MT-LB appears to be aimlessly crawling past the drone, indicating that its driver is incapacitated or its controls are damaged.\n\nThe UGV then pivots and begins firing on the rear of the MT-LB, \"killing the infantry in the troop compartment,\" the narrator said.\n\nThe 5th Brigade said that it found in the morning that the MT-LB crew and their passengers were \"completely wiped out,\" publishing short clips of the aftermath shot by a first-person-view aerial drone.\n\nWednesday's published footage provides insight into how UGVs are increasingly used on the battlefield in Ukraine, where troops on both sides are experimenting with ground drones to perform missions that human soldiers must otherwise conduct.\n\nWhile official statistics show that uncrewed aerial vehicles still dominated the drone warfare space last month, the spread of UGVs offers a possible future where Kyiv can rely on remotely operated systems for ground operations instead of risking its troops.\n\nThis year, Ukraine said that it aims to manufacture and deploy at least 15,000 UGVs across the battlefield.\n\nUkrainian and Russian teams have developed hundreds of such systems, ranging from buggies that can ferry provisions near the front lines to trucks outfitted with remotely operated machine guns.\n\nThe 5th brigade and DevDroid, the company that makes the Droid TW 12.7, did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.",

    "description": "Even with an $8 billion valuation, Harvey's CEO says no company will dominate the $1 trillion legal market.",
    "fullText": "The legal tech market is only just beginning, and it's huge, says Harvey's CEO.\n\nWinston Weinberg said during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Wednesday that the opportunity ahead for the legal tech industry is so massive that no single company — including his — could own it.\n\n\"I don't think a single player is going to capture all of the pretty enormous amount of value that will be created in the next 10 years in this space,\" said the CEO of the $8 billion legal tech startup.\n\nHarvey announced last week that it raised $160 million in a round led by a16z, pushing the startup's valuation to $8 billion.\n\nDespite being one of the most closely watched startups in the sector, Weinberg said Harvey is barely scratching the surface of who AI tools can reach.\n\n\"There are around 10 million global legal professionals, and Harvey serves just single-digit percentage points of them,\" he said.\n\nHe also said the legal tech sector represents only a tiny slice of the overall legal economy. The global legal market is worth an estimated $1 trillion, but only about $30 billion of that is spent on technology today, Weinberg said.\n\n\"Long term, it seems clear that technology penetration in the legal market will grow significantly,\" he said.\n\n\"If we build a great product, we hopefully capture some of that very large upside,\" Weinberg said, adding that there is \"clearly\" room for other legal AI startups.\n\nWeinberg said the startup needs to \"earn that valuation every day.\"\n\nThe share of monthly users who return daily is up 81% since the company launched in 2023, and lawyers using multiple features show engagement patterns \"similar to Slack or email,\" said Weinberg.\n\n\"We have a long way to go with building out a full platform of use cases for lawyers,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said many legal tasks will be absorbed by technology.\n\n\"That doesn't mean the entire job of a lawyer gets consumed; it'll evolve,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg told Business Insider in September that AI is already reshaping the industry, creating new practice areas while reducing the size of some in-house teams.\n\nSome law firms are rethinking their staffing models entirely, flattening their traditional pyramid structures by relying more on associates and fewer partners, he said in an interview on the sidelines of TechLaw Fest in Singapore.\n\nYounger lawyers who grew up using AI tools may gain an edge over senior partners when it comes to fluency, speed, and adaptability, he added.\n\nAI has become an unavoidable part of lawyers' work. Five of the 10 largest US law firms by revenue told Business Insider in July they were already embedding AI into their workflows — including document review, legal research, and spotting compliance risks.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm has also surged alongside the transformation. Legal-tech funding reached $3.2 billion this year, according to Business Insider's December analysis of Crunchbase data and recent deals.",

    "fullText": "Flipping and spinning on a studio floor, 17-year-old Royal is a star in China's breakdancing scene and aiming for gold at the World Championships in Japan this week.\n\nRoyal, real name Guo Pu, shot to fame when she won both the youth and adult Asian Championships in June.\n\nShe is part of a growing Chinese force in breakdancing, which combines acrobatic floor moves, footwork and rhythmic expression to hip-hop or funk and was included as an Olympic sport for the first time at Paris 2024.\n\n\"At first my grandmother would not let me dance breaking because back then, breaking's reputation truly was not very good,\" Royal told AFP at the studio where she trains in her hometown of Pingyi, in the eastern province of Shandong.\n\n\"But after I achieved some results, she stopped saying anything,\" she smiled.\n\nHaving already won the youth world title in August, Royal will compete alongside other \"B-girls\" and \"B-boys\" at the adult World Championships taking place Friday and Saturday in Fukuoka, Japan, the country which has long dominated the sport.\n\n\"I want to win that gold medal for China and show the world that Chinese breaking is getting cooler and cooler,\" she said.\n\nAs a youngster, \"my mother signed me up for all kinds of extracurricular classes, such as playing instruments, then Chinese dance\", Royal said.\n\n\"I also participated in a local children's artistic show for the Chinese New Year. That's when coach Mike saw me.\"\n\nMike, whose real name is Li Shilong, told AFP \"she immediately impressed me\".\n\n\"During her performance I saw a light in her eyes... It was a kind of light that shows a real passion, a real drive for dance and for art.\n\n\"I felt that this girl might have been born for breaking.\"\n\nRoyal has now put school on hold to dedicate her time entirely to dancing.\n\nLike other top athletes in China, she will benefit from easier access to university thanks to her sporting achievements.\n\nRoyal describes herself as \"not very talkative\" and still \"pretty nervous before competitions\", but says she is able to \"open up\" on stage.\n\nIn addition to her Asian and world titles, Royal won gold at this year's World Games -- a top competition for non-Olympic sports.\n\nShe has developed a healthy rivalry with fellow Chinese breakdancer Liu Qingyi, known as \"671\", who won bronze at the Paris Games.\n\nThe country's next generation of breakdancers looks promising, with China winning five out of six medals at the youth World Championships in August.\n\n\"In four years, China has gone from being unknown in the world of breakdancing to ranking among the world's top three and is now seen as the future of breaking,\" Mounir Biba, a 13-time world champion and head coach of the Chinese team, told AFP.\n\n\"There is talent, there is a lot of potential. There are a lot of young dancers in China,\" he said, adding that financial support from the government was helping the sport grow.\n\nHaving breakdancing in the Olympics has encouraged the surge of interest in China, according to coach Mike.\n\n\"Once a discipline is officially recognised as a sport in China it's developed very intensively,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities see an opportunity to win international honours while parents, reassured by breakdancing's new respectability, are more willing to let their children practise it.\n\nThe Chinese DanceSport Federation now organises numerous competitions, Mike said, while funds are allocated to training facilities.\n\nThe only downside, according to the coach, is that some Chinese dancers do not necessarily fully understand the culture of breakdancing, which originated in New York in the 1970s.\n\n\"The (skill) difficulty level in China is exceptionally high. However, the understanding of dance and the depth of exploration into dance artistry remains insufficient,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"This is an area where we need to learn from Western nations,\" Mike said.\n\n\"Breakdancing, and other street dance styles... their essence is innovation. I believe that by understanding the core of this culture, Chinese children will become more creative.\"\n\nRoyal is keen to push the sport's creativity.\n\n\"I really want to inspire the next generation of B-girls,\" she said.\n\n\"By passing on the history and the culture of breaking, and developing a style of breaking that's unique to girls.\"",

    "description": "The Mets reportedly approached the Cardinals with interest regarding a potential trade for three-time All-Star Willson Contreras.",
    "fullText": "The Mets are looking for a right-handed bat in the wake of Pete Alonso departing for Baltimore, and they've reportedly talked to one National League team about potentially doing just that.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, the Mets and Cardinals have had discussions involving a trade for Willson Contreras.\n\nThe Cardinals are looking to move their veteran pieces like Nolan Arenado, Brendan Donovan and Contreras, but president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom has yet to make a deal. MLB.com's John Denton reports that the Cardinals have fielded several calls already for Donovan and LHP JoJo Romero, with the Mets showing interest in Contreras.\n\nDenton added that Contreras is expected to waive his no-trade clause to play in New York.\n\nContreras, who is entering his age-34 season, has two guaranteed years left worth $36.5 million, according to Spotrac. There is also a club option for the 2028 season, which is worth $17.5 million.\n\nThe three-time All-Star is coming off his third season in St. Louis, where he slashed .257/.344/.447 with an OPS of .791 to go along with 20 home runs and 80 RBI in 135 games.\n\nHe also offers versatility in the field. Contreras played 120 games at first base with the Cardinals last year, but has been the Cardinals' catcher in past seasons, as recent as starting behind the plate 50 times in 2024. He also has 39 games of experience in the outfield in his career, his last being during the 2021 season, but that's not expected to be a part of any plan involving Contreras.",

    "description": "Sherrone Moore, 39, was the head football coach for the University of Michigan before the school says it found ‘credible evidence’ of an ‘inappropriate relationship’",
    "fullText": "Head football coach for the University of Michigan, Sherrone Moore, has been detained just hours after being fired for having an “inappropriate relationship.”\n\nMoore, 39, was detained by police in Saline, Michigan, on Wednesday. He was later turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for an “investigation into potential charges,” the Saline Police Department said in a statement to ESPN.\n\nIt’s unclear what the investigation is in relation to.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Moore was fired “with cause” after a University of Michigan probe found “credible evidence” that the coach “engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,” the school said in a statement shared by multiple outlets.\n\n“This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,” the University of Michigan said.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the Pittsfield Township Police Department and the University of Michigan for comment.\n\nThis was just Moore’s second season as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines. He was given the title in January 2024 after six years as a member of the offensive staff. He was the University of Michigan’s first African American head coach.\n\nMoore has a wife, to whom he’s been married since 2015, and three daughters.\n\nAssociate coach Biff Poggi has been named as the University of Michigan’s interim head football coach.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines finished the regular season at 9-3 and have a game against the Texas Longhorns at the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl on December 31.\n\nDave Portnoy, the founder of sports and pop culture media company Barstool Sports, commended the University of Michigan’s decision to fire Moore.\n\n“On a serious note there have been a lot of schools over the years who have looked the other way with scandals. I’d just like to say I’m proud that Michigan refused to do the same,” Portnoy wrote on X Wednesday.\n\n“Sherrone broke the moral code and it cost him his job. It’s a hard lesson but it’s the Michigan Man Way. Leaders and best for a reason. Proud to be a Michigan Wolverine tonight.”\n\nMoore was also part of a sign-stealing scandal, which resulted in record fines expected to exceed $20 million imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association on the University of Michigan.\n\nSign-stealing is when a sports team decodes an opponent’s hand signals. The NCAA bans schools from sending scouts to future opponents’ games and using electronic equipment to record signals.\n\nMoore was given a three-game suspension for his role in the scheme, which he was expected to complete next year. Reports of the NCAA’s investigation surfaced early in the 2023 season, when Moore was working under Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines came out on top in the 2023 season, winning the College Football Playoff national championship in a game against the Washington Huskies.\n\nPoggi successfully led the Michigan Wolverines for two games this year while Moore was suspended.",

Whether that’s enough to steady Indian equities is unclear after Wednesday’s late slide pulled the market to a near month-low. Mid- and small-cap stocks may get some relief from the regulator allowing pension funds to invest in the Nifty 250 and BSE 250 indices. But with the outlook on a trade deal with Washington still murky and bond yields climbing to three-month highs — pressuring the rupee — investors are watching how long India can hold out against the global “lower for longer” narrative.

    "description": "The gradual and systemic over-reliance on LLM outputs, especially with agentic systems, leads to a normalization of deviance.",
    "fullText": "The AI industry risks repeating the same cultural failures that contributed to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster: Quietly normalizing warning signs while progress marches forward.\n\nThe original term Normalization of Deviance comes from the American sociologist Diane Vaughan, who describes it as the process in which deviance from correct or proper behavior or rule becomes culturally normalized.\n\nI use the term Normalization of Deviance in AI to describe the gradual and systemic over-reliance on LLM outputs, especially in agentic systems.\n\nAt its core, large language models (LLMs) are unreliable (and untrusted) actors in system design.\n\nThis means that security controls (access checks, proper encoding, and sanitization, etc.) must be applied downstream of LLM output.\n\nA constant stream of indirect prompt injection exploit demonstrations indicates that system designers and developers are either unaware of this or are simply accepting the deviance. It is particularly dangerous when vendors make insecure decisions for their userbase by default.\n\nI first learned about this concept in the context of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where systemic normalization of warnings led to tragedy.\n\nDespite data showing erosion in colder temperatures, the deviation from safety standards was repeatedly rationalized because previous flights had succeeded. The absence of disaster was mistaken for the presence of safety.\n\nIn the world of AI, we observe companies treating probabilistic, non-deterministic, and sometimes adversarial model outputs as if they were reliable, predictable, and safe.\n\nVendors are normalizing trusting LLM output, but current understanding violates the assumption of reliability.\n\nThe model will not consistently follow instructions, stay aligned, or maintain context integrity. This is especially true if there is an attacker in the loop (e.g indirect prompt injection).\n\nHowever, we see more and more systems allowing untrusted output to take consequential actions. Most of the time it goes well, and over time vendors and organizations lower their guard or skip human oversight entirely, because “it worked last time.”\n\nThis dangerous bias is the fuel for normalization: organizations confuse the absence of a successful attack with the presence of robust security.\n\nTwo ways this can impact systems are:\n\nAnd we already see agents make mistakes in day to day usage, like formatting hard drives, creating random GitHub issues, or wiping a production database.\n\nSo, the signs are there. And it is inherently dangerous, not only because of attacks like indirect prompt injection, but also because these systems are trained on enormous, untrustworthy data sets from the Internet. Anthropic research recently showed that it takes only a small amount of documents to successfully add a backdoor to a model.\n\nConsider a scenario where the Normalization of Deviance has drastic consequences: an attacker trains a backdoor into a model that triggers on certain days to invoke tools, like compromising a user via code execution. Since we have a pretty centralized ecosystem, where attacks often are transferable, and natural language is universally understood by LLMs, this can have consequences across many systems and vendors.\n\nSuch a drift does not happen through a single reckless decision. It happens through a series of “temporary” shortcuts that quietly become the new baseline. Because systems continue to work, teams stop questioning the shortcuts, and the deviation becomes invisible and the new norm.\n\nEspecially under competitive pressure for automation, cost savings, a drive to be first, and the overall hype, this dangerous drift is evident. The incentives for speed and winning outweigh the incentives for foundational security. Over time, organizations forget why the guardrails existed in the first place.\n\nLet me share some examples of how this is reflected in real-world agentic AI systems.\n\nWe are all aware that chatbots have those “AI can make mistakes”, “Double check responses” and so forth disclaimers, and we can observe the drift of normalization occurring in real-time.\n\nThree years after ChatGPT shipped, vendors push agentic AI to users, but at the same time vendors are highlighting that your system might get compromised by that same AI - that drift, that normalization, is what I call “The Normalization of Deviance in AI”.\n\nThis continuous drift is a long-term danger:\n\nWhile some vendors acknowledge the risks, others appear to overlook or downplay them, potentially due to competitive pressure and focus on product and customer acquisition.\n\nIn many cases, we probably collectively hope that “someone” will solve these security and safety challenges.\n\nCompanies like Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and other institutions and organizations perform extensive research in this area, including publishing evals and mitigation ideas. However, the rush to be the first is evident from a product perspective.\n\nNevertheless, before we drift off into a utopian future with agentic AI, I believe the best and safest outcome is to stay realistic around capabilities and control mechanisms, and for AI to remain human-led, particularly in high-stake contexts, to ensure the best outcome overall.\n\nNo, of course not. There is a lot of potential and many low stakes workflows can be implemented already today. Even high-risk workflows can be done with proper threat modeling, mitigations and oversight.\n\nHowever, it requires investment and resources to design and set up systems accordingly and apply security controls (sandbox, hermetic environments, least privilege, temporary credentials, etc.).\n\nMany are hoping the “model will just do the right thing”, but Assume Breach teaches us, that at one point, it will certainly not do that.",

    "title": "NASA just lost contact with a Mars orbiter, and will soon lose another one",
    "description": "If NASA is serious about exploring Mars, it’s past time to send new missions.",
    "fullText": "NASA has lost contact with one its three spacecraft orbiting Mars, the agency announced Tuesday. Meanwhile, a second Mars orbiter is perilously close to running out of fuel, and the third mission is running well past its warranty.\n\nGround teams last heard from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or MAVEN, spacecraft on Saturday, December 6. “Telemetry from MAVEN had showed all subsystems working normally before it orbited behind the red planet,” NASA said in a short statement. “After the spacecraft emerged from behind Mars, NASA’s Deep Space Network did not observe a signal.”\n\nNASA said mission controllers are “investigating the anomaly to address the situation. More information will be shared once it becomes available.”\n\nMAVEN is the newest of NASA’s three operational Mars orbiters. The robotic mission arrived at the red planet in September 2014 after a 10-month cruise from Earth, then settled into an elliptical orbit to begin studying interactions between the Sun and the Martian atmosphere.\n\nEarlier in its mission, MAVEN discovered how the solar wind erodes the Martian atmosphere. Over billions of years, the erosion transformed Mars from a warm, wet, habitable world into the cold, inhospitable planet seen today. MAVEN’s science instruments measured the densities of light and heavy isotopes of argon to show how a process known as “sputtering” removed the majority of the air and water from the atmosphere. The spacecraft also made detailed in-situ plasma observations to help scientists understand Mars’ auroras.\n\nBuilt by Lockheed Martin, MAVEN has far outlived its original design life. More recently, MAVEN became an important node in NASA’s Mars relay network, passing signals between rovers on the Martian surface and controllers on Earth. If NASA is unable to revive the MAVEN spacecraft, the agency has two other orbiters that can pick up the slack.\n\nBut NASA’s two other Mars orbiters have been in space for more than 20 years. The older of the two, named Mars Odyssey, has been at Mars since 2001 and will soon run out of fuel, probably some time in the next couple of years. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched in 2005, is healthy for its age, with enough fuel to last into the 2030s. MRO is also important to NASA because it has the best camera at Mars, with the ability to map landing sites for future missions.\n\nTwo European spacecraft, Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, have radios to relay data between mission controllers and NASA’s landers on the Martian surface. Mars Express, now 22 years old, suffers from the same aging concerns as Mars Odyssey and MRO. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is newer, having arrived at Mars in 2016, but is also operating beyond its original lifetime.\n\nChina and the United Arab Emirates also have orbiters circling Mars, but neither spacecraft is equipped to serve as a communications relay.\n\nNASA’s Curiosity and Perseverance rovers have the capability for direct-to-Earth communications, but the orbiting relay network can support vastly higher data throughput. Without overhead satellites, much of the science data and many of the spectacular images collected by NASA’s rovers might never make it off the planet.\n\nMAVEN’s unique orbit, stretching as far as 2,800 miles (4,500 kilometers) above Mars, has some advantages for data relay. In that orbit, MAVEN could relay science data from rovers on the surface for up to 30 minutes at a time, longer than the relay periods available through NASA’s lower-altitude orbiters. Because of this, MAVEN could support the largest data volumes of any of the other relay options.\n\nBefore the loss of communications last weekend, NASA said MAVEN had sufficient fuel reserves to operate until at least the late 2030s.\n\nMAVEN was one of 19 operating missions targeted for cancellation in President Donald Trump’s proposed NASA budget for fiscal year 2026. Congress largely rejected the Trump’s administration’s proposed budget cuts at NASA.\n\nMars is clearly a second priority at NASA amid a race between the United States and China to land astronauts on the Moon. But the recent trouble with MAVEN will likely rekindle long-running concerns about NASA’s aging spacecraft at Mars, especially the risk of losing capacity for communications relay and high-resolution mapping to support NASA’s active rovers, along with future robotic or human expeditions.\n\nThe space agency has investigated using commercial relay services to replace the government-owned network currently in place at Mars. NASA awarded study contracts to Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and SpaceX in 2024 to examine possible data relay architectures.\n\nNASA was in the early stages of planning for a dedicated Mars Telecommunications Orbiter more than 20 years ago, with plans to put it into an orbit similar to the one occupied by MAVEN. The agency canceled the project in 2005. Since then, NASA has tacked on relay radios to science orbiters sent to Mars, giving them the ability to provide communications support as a secondary mission.\n\nThe Mars Telecommunications Orbiter name appeared again in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress earlier this year. Lawmakers included $700 million for a “high-performance” telecom relay station in Mars orbit to be developed through a fixed-price contract. Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are among the companies that have publicized their concepts for a Mars telecom orbiter in recent months. NASA officials have not said when they will release a request for bids for such a mission.",

    "title": "Linux 6.18: All About the New Long-Term Support Linux Kernel",
    "description": "The newest version of the Linux kernel offers two years of long-term support, plus upgrades to the slab memory allocator, security hardening and more.",
    "fullText": "Linus Torvalds wasn’t thrilled with how the final days leading up to the 6.18 release of the Linux kernel went. “I’d have been happier with slightly less bugfixing noise in this last week of the release,” the Linux kernel creator wrote Nov. 30 on the Linux kernel mailing list.\n\nNevertheless, he added, “While there’s a few more fixes than I would hope for, there was nothing that made me feel like this needs more time to cook. So 6.18 is tagged and pushed out.”\n\nNow that version 6.18 is fully cooked, what are the ingredients? And what, exactly, does “long-term support” mean when it comes to the Linux kernel?\n\nOnce upon a time, long-term support versions of the Linux kernel got six years of long-term support (LTS). That’s no longer the case. In 2023, the kernel developers cut LTS to two years.\n\nWhy? Because Linux code maintainers have been burning out. It’s a hard job. And, as Josef Bacik, Linux kernel file system developer and maintainer, said in a presentation at the 2022 Linux Storage | Filesystem | MM & BPF Summit, “Maintainers are burning out [because] maintainers don’t scale.” Adding insult to injury, they are also rarely paid for maintenance work.\n\nSo it is that we only get two years of “official” LTS — and the clock on the latest release, 6.18, began ticking on Dec. 3, when stable Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced it was officially the newest LTS version. This release also sees the LTS Linux 5.4 falling out of support.\n\nWait? What’s that you say? You need a heck of a lot longer support time than two years for you and your customers? Well, depending on which distribution you use for production, you’re in luck. Many of the top enterprise Linux distributors offer far longer-term support horizons for their paying customers.\n\nRed Hat maintains its own Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) kernels for the distro’s life cycle of 10-plus years. Red Hat does this by backporting security fixes and selected features to a constant kernel version, even when upstream has dropped that branch. RHEL also offers Extended Life Cycle/Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) add‑ons for older releases, which include kernel security updates beyond standard maintenance.\n\nRHEL‑compatible distributions such as AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux track RHEL’s LTS kernels through their own rebuilds, effectively extending kernel maintenance for users on the same timelines as the corresponding RHEL releases.\n\nOpenELA, the RHEL-compatible Linux distribution backed by Oracle, SUSE and CIQ/Rocky Linux, also supports older kernels via the RHEL code tree. In addition, OpenELA explicitly stepped in to maintain the former LTS Linux 4.14 until December 2024. Nevertheless, OpenELA was still releasing Linux 4.14 code in 2025.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) was also supporting 4.14 on Amazon Linux 2.0  through the end of October 2025, and the also otherwise obsolete 5.10 kernel through June 20, 2026.\n\nSUSE maintains SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) kernels with long life cycles, similar to Red Hat, and offers extended support options. Starting with SLES 16 and its Linux 6.12 kernel, SUSE now offers 16 years of support.\n\nFinally, Canonical maintains Ubuntu LTS kernels for up to 15 years with add‑on support packages. Canonical also offers LTS for the 4.14 and otherwise out-of-date kernels. For example, the company still supports the 11-and-a-half-year-old Ubuntu 14.04 distro.\n\nWhy should you use either the official LTS kernel or its commercially supported twins? It’s simple. As Kroah-Hartman said in a 2020 “Ask the Expert” interview at Open Source Summit Europe, they provide developers with a stable application binary interface (ABI). It also provides, he’s said, a continuous stream of security patches. This is far safer than freezing on an old non‑LTS kernel or trying to cherry‑pick fixes yourself.\n\nAt the core of 6.18 is a significant upgrade to the slab memory allocator in the form of “sheaves.” This is a per‑CPU cache mechanism that reduces contention and speeds up memory allocation and freeing operations. The release also includes improved swapping behavior and other virtual machine (VM) tweaks to improve performance under memory pressure, particularly on busy servers and desktops.\n\nOne of the most visible and controversial changes is the removal of the experimental Bcachefs file system from the mainline kernel. Bcachefs is a general-purpose Linux filesystem. It’s designed for systems that need strong data integrity and advanced storage features. In practice, it targets many of the same roles as Btrfs or ZFS: ample local storage, multidisk arrays and setups that combine SSDs and HDDs for performance and capacity.\n\nBcachefs was booted out of the kernel largely because its maintainer, Kent Overstreet, clashed with kernel maintainers, including Torvalds, over patch timing, review practices and public communications. Behind the personal arguments was a technical one: The Bcachefas code fixes often came in late, kernel maintainers said, which clashed with the kernel’s preference for stabilizing during release candidate phases.\n\nTorvalds and other maintainers argued that code that routinely needs that sort of late churn does not yet belong upstream, especially for something as critical as a filesystem. Bcachefx is now shipped as a Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) module, which is maintained outside the kernel tree. Distributions that wish to support Bcachefs must build and ship that external module.\n\nOn the networking side, Linux 6.18 adds support for Accurate Explicit Congestion Notification (AccECN) in TCP. This enables finer‑grained congestion feedback and potentially better throughput under load. The kernel also introduces PSP‑encrypted TCP connections, an approach that offers hardware‑friendly offload characteristics as an alternative to traditional IPsec or TLS in some environments.\n\nSecurity hardening continues with support for cryptographically signed BPF programs. This enables runtime-verified Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) payloads, as well as refinements across the security subsystem and multi‑LSM configurations.\n\nA notable infrastructure change is the ability to manage process namespaces using file‑handle‑like objects, similar in spirit to pidfds. This should make container runtimes and low‑level tooling more robust and race‑resistant.\n\nAdditionally, the gradual integration of Rust into the kernel continues, including support for a Rust Binder driver. This is a Google-driven rewrite of the Android Binder driver in Rust. This vital inter-process communication (IPC) system enables two processes on an Android-powered device to communicate with one another.\n\nAs with most kernel releases, 6.18 carries a large batch of new and updated drivers across architectures, including x86_64, ARM, RISC‑V, and others. It also — surprise! — improves support for recent GPUs, SoCs and storage controllers. It also comes with fixes and enhancements for popular handheld gaming PCs such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go 2, as well as better power management and device‑tree coverage for laptops and embedded boards.\n\nFor end users, that translates into better out‑of‑the‑box hardware support on upcoming distributions that track the new LTS line.\n\nFor Linux desktop users — Jack Wallen and I wave — the main benefits of Linux 6.18 will be faster, more scalable memory allocation, improved network efficiency and broader hardware enablement, especially on modern GPUs and newer ARM‑based systems.\n\nServer operators and cloud providers are likely to focus on dm‑pcache for hybrid storage, the new TCP capabilities, and signed BPF infrastructure as they evaluate 6.18 as a long‑term platform. With support stretching to 2027 and no single “killer” feature, Linux 6.18 positions itself as a conservative but foundational release that many distributions will standardize on for the next few years.",

    "description": "Elon Musk has amassed a $491 billion fortune through his work at Tesla, SpaceX, and more. Here's the tech CEO's daily routine.",
    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "title": "Instead of downsizing, I moved into a bigger home at 74. My grandkids love the extra space, and family visits are finally fun.",
    "description": "At 74, Laurence Gerowitz and his wife upsized to a larger condo in New York City. The grandkids love the space and his son's visits are less of a chore.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 75-year-old Laurence Gerowitz, a real estate litigator, about his move into a larger condo in New York City. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI lived on the Upper East Side for most of my adult life: about 48 years, starting in the late 1970s. My wife and I bought into a co-op on 85th Street in 1999 for $265,000 and lived on the third floor of the five-story walk-up.\n\nOur apartment was 1,200 square feet and had a very nice layout, as well as a working fireplace. The building had no amenities whatsoever, but we were still very happy to be there. We lived there for 25 years and essentially raised our son in that apartment.\n\nIn 2008, he moved to Villanova, Pennsylvania — near Philadelphia — for college, and over the years it became clear he was never moving back to New York. He's now married and they live there with their two young children.\n\nNew York suits me just fine, but not so much for my son — between the impossible parking and our three-story walk-up, he wasn't interested.\n\nI understand why. When he used to visit, I'd have to go downstairs to help him haul everything up. We did have two bedrooms, which is a luxury in Manhattan, but there still wasn't a comfortable place for him and his family to sleep, and I'd end up on a blow-up mattress.\n\nIt was just untenable; they didn't enjoy visiting.\n\nAbout two years ago, my wife noticed that a new complex was being built around the corner from us called the Harper. She's a painter and interior decorator, so she wanted to take a look.\n\nWe toured a two-bedroom apartment, which we thought was very nice, but it was also small. Still, we thought the building's amenities were fantastic. They have a gym, music room, game room, playroom, and creative studio — which we thought would be great for our grandkids.\n\nWe sat with the idea for a while. A couple of months later, we went back to see a larger unit — a model of about 1,853 square feet with an 80-square-foot terrace and three bedrooms, one of which could be used as an office.\n\nAfter that tour, it didn't take us long to decide to move to the Harper. In the end, it took a couple of months to stage our old co-op, and then a few more months to sell.\n\nThe best things I've ever done in my life are being a good father and grandfather. My son texts or calls me at least once a day, and that's my proudest accomplishment — even more than being admitted to the bar at 48 after going to night school for four years while supporting a family.\n\nA big reason we decided to upsize and buy the condo was that my wife and I love being around my son and his family, and we really wanted to create a place where the kids would want to come visit.\n\nWe moved into the Harper in March 2024. It's just around the corner from our old place. It wasn't a far move, but we've spent decades living on the Upper East Side for a reason — we love the neighborhood.\n\nOur new condo has a really well-thought-out layout. We have three bedrooms, including a home office, and two-and-a-half bathrooms. When you walk in, you can turn left into one wing, down that hall are the primary closet, the primary bedroom and bathroom, and the terrace.\n\nIf you go to the right instead, a quick left takes you into the kitchen and great room. Further to the right are the guest bedroom and bathroom, a third bedroom that I use as my office, and a small laundry area.\n\nBesides having a larger apartment and living in a building that actually has an elevator, we're especially happy about the amenities. It's such a contrast to our old place, where the only extra space was the boiler room.\n\nOur grandkids especially love the building's music room. They can bang on the drums, sing into the microphone, and strum a guitar. There's also a playroom with a ball pit.\n\nIn the beginning, whenever the grandkids would come over, they would go down to the ball pit three times a day. In the mornings, I'd have to plead with them to finish their breakfast before heading down to play.\n\nIt's obvious they love visiting our new home. The grandkids talk about it all the time, and it's cute to see them arrive, dragging their little suitcases, already excited to play.\n\nI have very fond memories of our old place — it was the first home I ever bought. But over time, living there became stressful.\n\nI was on the board, constantly worrying about the building — especially whether the boiler would work. It was an older property with no central air, just radiators, so there were always issues with the heat.\n\nHere at the Harper, it's a completely different experience. Everything works, we have three separate HVAC zones that you can set to the exact degree, and the staff is great. My biggest dilemma now is whether to go to my gym on 91st Street or just head downstairs.\n\nI think upsizing later in life is a good thing if you're in a position where it makes sense for you.\n\nIf it's within your means to make that choice, do it. You're not just gaining more physical space; you're also giving yourself and your family more options.\n\nWhen my son and his family visit, they have their own rooms and are well taken care of. I think they genuinely enjoy coming now; it no longer feels like an obligation.",

    "description": "The Navy is investing almost half a billion dollars in Palantir artificial intelligence software that promises to speed up shipbuilding processes.",
    "fullText": "The Navy is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into an artificial intelligence system that it says has sped up key shipbuilding processes.\n\nIn one case, the AI cut painstaking processes of submarine schedule planning — mapping out how the many pieces of construction fit together and making sure people, parts, and yard space are available at the right time — from many hours to only minutes.\n\nThe Navy is launching the new Shipbuilding Operating System, or Ship OS, as it tries to break out of decades-old shipbuilding problems rooted in outdated technologies and work practices. The service announced a $448 million investment Thursday, saying it will accelerate the adoption of AI and autonomy across the industrial base.\n\nThe Ship OS technology is powered by Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform and began in pilot programs at submarine shipyards.\n\nAt General Dynamics Electric Boat, a long-time submarine yard located in Connecticut, submarine schedule planning saw a dramatic reduction from 160 manual hours down to under 10 minutes. And at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine, material review times for submarines went from taking weeks to under an hour.\n\nThe $448 million investment will go toward the submarine industrial base and then expand. It'll be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three public yards, and 100 suppliers, Palantir said in a press release.\n\n\"This investment provides the resources our shipbuilders, shipyards, and suppliers need to modernize their operations and succeed in meeting our nation's defense requirements,\" said Navy Secretary John Phelan in a statement.\n\n\"By enabling industry to adopt AI and autonomy tools at scale, we're helping the shipbuilding industry improve schedules, increase capacity, and reduce costs,\" he added, explaining \"this is about doing business smarter and building the industrial capability our Navy and nation require.\"\n\nMaritime Industrial Base Program, a Navy initiative to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair capabilities, and Naval Sea Systems Command are overseeing the implementation of Ship OS. Both are gathering data from multiple sources to identify where the hiccups are in submarine shipbuilding, how the processes, including engineering, can be sped up, and what specific risks can be mitigated through technology.\n\nProblems in the Navy’s submarine industrial base — from shipbuilders to the repair yards — have been building for decades. Submarines are central to any Pacific fight and a top Pentagon priority, yet major programs like the upgraded Virginia-class submarines and new Columbia-class ballistic missile subs have repeatedly run into delays and cost overruns.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, has documented long-standing problems in the Navy's plans for purchasing and constructing submarines, as well as shipyard deficiencies such as worker inexperience, aging facilities and equipment, and inadequate construction space.\n\nThe introduction of the new Ship OS capability aims to address some of these problems facing US submarine shipbuilding. And once the technology has been used for the submarine programs, the Navy said, it'll apply lessons and adapt them to surface ship programs.",

    "description": "The Fed cut interest rates at its December meeting. Here's how it affects your money — from mortgages and auto loans to credit cards and savings.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve made its final decision of 2025, cutting interest rates for the third meeting in a row — and it set the tone for where interest rates will go in the new year.\n\nThe call will have ripple effects across consumer prices, the job market, and Corporate America through 2026 and beyond. Here's how the decision will affect you.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions.\n\nA quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Lower rates would also make home equity lines and small business loans more accessible to Americans.\n\nElizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told Business Insider the cut could be a positive sign for people applying to roles in the sluggish labor market: If job seekers \"hear that the Fed is responding to an unfavorable labor market, that's going to feel good to them; they may feel like relief is on the horizon,\" she said.\n\nThe labor market has shown signs of weakness in recent months. Job seekers of all ages have told Business Insider that they've been through grueling application cycles without an offer, while recruiters are drowning in resumés. Over the summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of available jobs and labor force participation has been trending downward. The unemployment rate, however, is still relatively low, hovering a little above 4% for most of this year.\n\nSustained rate cuts would bolster the job market by making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest money. This would free up more funds for companies to hire and pay employees, which could lead to higher consumer spending — all factors needed for a healthy economy.\n\nAnd lower interest rates are historically good news for the stock market. When it's cheaper to borrow money and approve loans, both companies and individuals are more likely to invest. With more funds in the market, Wall Street could see a boost in 2026.\n\nMadison Hoff contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Walk, don't run: The latest workout trend combines the great outdoors with low-stakes socializing",
    "description": "Data from Strava and AllTrails show a surge in new hiking clubs, while National Parks continue to be top travel destinations.",
    "fullText": "The run clubs that took off in the past few years were outpaced by hiking.\n\nThat's according to new data from Strava, a fitness tracking app, and AllTrails, a hiking navigation app.\n\nStrava's end-of-year report, analyzing data from over 180 million users and surveying over 30,000 users and non-users, found that hiking clubs grew sixfold in 2025 — nearly double the pace of run clubs. In 2025, AllTrails saw a 20% increase in users (i.e., people who created an account on the app) to 90 million.\n\nOnline, you can find hiking clubs for seemingly every preference, whether you're a creative in LA looking for a morning workout, a woman who doesn't want to hike alone in North Carolina, or a \"hot girl\" on the hunt for new travel companions.\n\nWhile run clubs are still popular, hiking and walking have an advantage: simplicity. They offer similar health benefits and social perks — without requiring the same stamina or potentially pricey gear.\n\nCOVID lockdowns famously drew people to the outdoors, whether they joined run clubs or sought out nearby hikes.\n\nAnd then there were National Parks, which experienced a surge of visitors since 2020 during the pandemic — and don't seem to be losing their allure. According to the National Parks visitation data, 2024 broke the record for the highest number of visitors of all time at over 331 million, a 28% increase since 2020.\n\nFive years after the pandemic, National Parks continue to be popular destinations. \"When you start looking at that number as feet on the trail, bodies in the visitor's center, cars on the road, you see that the parks have exploded,\" Jason Frye, a hiking writer who most recently published a National Parks guidebook, told Business Insider. Strava reported that hiking was the second most popular reason for traveling, behind winter sports.\n\nCarly Smith, chief marketing officer for AllTrails, said its data shows many hikers search for locations over 200 miles from their home. \"So we know that people are using us for planning travel and then for navigating and exploring National Parks and other destinations,\" she said.\n\nSmith believes part of the reason hiking and National Parks continue to be hot is that, for many, life still hasn't changed all that much since the peak-remote work pandemic years. \"There are more people working remotely than there were in the past,\" she said. \"Hiking clubs in particular can give people a good sense of community in ways that maybe they aren't finding in other parts of their life.\"\n\nRunning isn't the cardio workout for everyone. It's also not the only — or best — way to burn fat.\n\nWhile sprinting at a very fast pace (zone 4 or zone 5) is great for your heart health, it consumes more carbs than fat compared to a brisk walk or light jog.\n\nHiking long distances with a heavy backpack can help hit two goals: shedding fat while building muscle.\n\nThat's partly why rucking, or walking with weights, became a buzzy fitness trend last year. We saw a boom in networking events where people chat shop while breaking a sweat.\n\nPrice-wise, hiking, rucking, and walking also more financially accessible than joining a luxury gym. Weighted vests, the walking accessories du jour, cost about $30-$40 on Amazon — though a backpack from GoRuck, one of the biggest players in this space, starts at $115.\n\nPlus, in many cases, hiking and walking can be interchangeable: not all hikes have to be strenuous to count, making them less physically and financially daunting.\n\nFrye, who lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, near Great Smoky Mountains National Park, said there are many hiking trails nearby that are \"really walks in the woods more than true hikes.\"\n\n\"You can hop out of the car and do it in your flip flops from most of them,\" he said — no high-tech gear needed.\n\nAccording to Strava's report, walking was the second-most tracked activity in 2025, after running. Along with hiking, both activities can feel like a more low-stakes group activity than a seven-mile run.\n\nJonathan Jacobs, who started a men's walking group in LA this year, previously told Business Insider that the accessibility of walking made newcomers more likely to show up.\n\n\"Men who come to the walks repeatedly tell me that the low barrier to entry — no need to sign up or pay a fee to join — makes it easier for them to commit,\" he said.\n\nCity dwellers who partook in walking Manhattan from \"tip to tip\" — another popular TikTok trend of the year — also cited it as a memorable (but still low-key) experience with their friends.\n\nFrye believes the hiking hype is all part of the same phenomenon behind the renewed interest in dumb phones and old-school activities like pickling and crocheting.\n\n\"There seems to be this cultural shift, away from the digital and more toward the analog,\" he said. \"We're looking at these ways to return to easier things, and it doesn't get much easier than hiking.\"\n\nDecember 10, 2025: A previous version of this story stated that the Strava report data came from 30,000 Strava users. It came from 180 million users, as well as an additional survey of 30,000 users and non-users.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used naval drones packed with explosives to attack an oil tanker identified as part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Black Sea on Wednesday, a security source told Business Insider.\n\nThe naval drone strike on the tanker, Dashan, marks the third such attack in less than two weeks as Ukraine ramps up its long-range strike campaign against Russia's energy sector, increasingly gunning for ships at sea in addition to land-based oil facilities.\n\nSea Baby naval drones hit the tanker and caused \"critical damage\" to the vessel, with early indications indicating that the strike completely disabled the vessel, the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the country's main internal security agency, revealed on Wednesday.\n\nThe SBU source, only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments, said the Dashan was flying the Comoros flag and moving through Ukraine's exclusive economic zone in the direction of Novorossiysk, a Russian port city and major oil terminal.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data last showed the Dashan in the middle of the Black Sea.\n\nThe tanker was sailing at maximum speed with its transponder turned off, the security source said. They added that the attack was carried out in cooperation with the Ukrainian navy and shared footage captured by the Sea Baby drones showing multiple hits on the ship.\n\nSeveral Western countries and the European Union have sanctioned the $30 million tanker, which has been used for Russian oil exports and is known to sail with its transponder switched off, Ukraine's HUR military intelligence agency said.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the extent of the damage. Russia's defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe attack on Wednesday appears to mark the third time in the last two weeks that Ukraine has disabled a tanker belonging to the \"shadow fleet.\" In late November, the SBU used naval drones to strike and damage two vessels before they loaded at Novorossiysk.\n\nThe \"shadow fleet\" is a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports, a major source of revenue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged Kyiv's international partners to do more to prevent the ships from operating.\n\n\"The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the receipt of petrodollars to the budget of the Russian Federation,\" the security source said on Wednesday, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nUkraine has been stepping up its attacks against the Russian energy sector, the revenue from which fuels its war efforts, in recent months. Kyiv has used long-range drones to strike oil refineries and other facilities and infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe three tanker attacks appear to reflect a new shift for Ukraine — one that now increasingly attacks ships at sea rather than just land targets.",

    "fullText": "The Hollywood bidding war between Paramount Skydance and Netflix has created a meme frenzy.\n\nThe two media giants are in an all-out battle for Warner Bros. Discovery after it accepted Netflix's offer to acquire its studio and streaming businesses for an equity value of $72 billion. David Ellison's Paramount launched a hostile $30-per-share bid for all of WBD on Monday.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery owns the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, the HBO Max streaming service, and TV networks such as CNN, TNT, and TruTV. It confirmed receipt of Paramount's unsolicited offer on Monday.\n\nBoth entities have made their cases on why they'd be the best owner for WBD. Although internet comedians don't have a say in where the deals land, it hasn't stopped them from weighing in with viral jokes about the dueling companies and their quest to acquire WBD.\n\nSome social media users are poking fun at the back-and-forth with memes about how far each company is willing to go to gain WBD's favor. One post compared the battle for the best offer to a scene from the HBO business drama \"Succession,\" a title Netflix would own if the deal goes through.\n\nA post shared by Karl Smith, CFA (L1 Candidate) (@wallstreetintern)\n\nThe Instagram meme account Litquidity used parody images that appeared to be AI-created of two business leaders speaking at the DealBook Summit to mock how each company is trying to prove its offer is better.\n\nNetflix and Paramount trying to show off why their Warner Bros acquisition offers are better pic.twitter.com/mjpP7sjAnA\n\nSome people seem to be using humor to cope with the idea of more consolidation in Hollywood. They are pushing back on both offers with memes about stopping the looming acquisition completely.\n\nChristopher Nolan, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg on their way to stop Netflix from buying Warner Bros: pic.twitter.com/pnCAU4kclM\n\n\"I'm putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger,\" one X user captioned a compilation video of various actors and famous filmmakers.\n\nI’m putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger: pic.twitter.com/wl26YfGCjg\n\nOthers speculated on what the movie-watching experience could be like under Warner Bros. Discovery's new ownership. One TikTok video showed a man sitting down to watch a movie, only for the intros to include a confusing mix of studios, backers such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and even a DJ, being played before the movie began.\n\nevery company is every company #business#news #netflix\n\nIn the midst of all the jokes, Netflix argues that its offer would be better for consumers and creators, while Ellison says Paramount is more likely to win regulatory approval and offers Hollywood more certainty.\n\nWhat all of this means in the long run is unclear so far. It could lead to job cuts in the entertainment industry as the giants consolidate their power. The trends of streaming services getting pricier and fewer movies hitting theaters could also continue, as companies release less content, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEither way — as with many serious big business deals — consumers and industry insiders are finding ways to laugh through it.",

    "fullText": "The Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, and the meeting held some key takeaways for how the central bank is thinking about the economy heading into 2026.\n\nFrom the labor market to inflation to stocks, here's everything to know about the latest Fed decision.\n\nFed leaders anticipate more economic growth in 2026 and stable unemployment levels, but are somewhat concerned about slowing labor demand and participation. Lower rates could help juice hiring, Powell said.\n\nIn terms of AI, the Fed chair said chatbots are not yet replacing jobs — even as Corporate America sees shrinking while collar roles. \"It's part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet,\" he said. And, though some Big Tech firms and major retailers, have had high-profile cuts in 2025, Powell added that overall layoff rates are still relatively low.\n\nThe figure remains slightly above the Fed's 2% goal, though data is limited due to the government shutdown. With lower rates, there's a risk consumer prices will rise too. At the same time, Powell said consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of inflation right now is tariff policy, not broad economic weakness.\n\nIt was a hawkish rate cut overall, but markets rallied sharply anyway.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged up to a near-record close and the Dow jump almost 500 points, adding to gains as Powell's press conference got going. A few things came out of the meeting that boosted investors' bullishness.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to name a successor in January.\n\n\"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place.\"\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee showed significant division on Wednesday, with three members dissenting to the cut call. It's the biggest split seen at a Fed meeting since 2019 and signals ongoing tension between the Fed's dual mandate and how each member weighs employment and inflation risks.\n\nPowell, however, said there's no bad blood.\n\n\"The discussions we have are as good as any we've had in my 14 years at the Fed,\" he said. \"They're very thoughtful and respectful and people have strong views",

    "description": "Paramount's David Ellison wants to buy all of Warner, including its cable networks. How much they're worth is a big part of his fight vs. Netflix.",
    "fullText": "The fight between Paramount and Netflix over Warner Bros. Discovery is ultimately about who gets to control HBO and the Warner movie studio.\n\nBut the way that fight gets settled is going to involve an unusual side quest: CNN, TNT, the Food Network, and a bunch of other cable networks WBD wants to get rid of. Specifically: What are all of those shrinking cable networks worth?\n\nWhich leads us to a pretty weird place: Paramount CEO David Ellison, who wants to buy all of WBD — including its cable networks — is arguing that those cable networks aren't worth very much at all. And Netflix, which doesn't want to buy those cable networks, is implicitly arguing that they're worth much more.\n\nThat's because in the Netflix scenario, current WBD shareholders would go through two transactions: First, WBD would spin out its cable networks into a new company, and WBD investors would be given shares in that new company. Then Netflix would buy the remainder of WBD — HBO and the studio — for cash and stock.\n\nWhich means Netflix, and WBD executives who have blessed the Netflix offer, will want investors to think the cable networks are valuable. Ellison wants them to think the opposite.\n\n\"The lower you value the cable assets, the greater advantage Paramount's bid has. If shareholders believe the cable operations are more highly valued, then Netflix's bid, which assumes they will be spun off, means investors get an overall bigger sum of money.\"\n\nAnd here's the actual gap: Ellison says the spin-off is worth about $1 per WBD share — or roughly $2.5 billion, based on WBD's current valuation. Independent analysts think it might be closer to $4 per share — or roughly $10 billion. Paramount and Netflix reps declined to comment; WBD hasn't responded to my request.\n\nSo one side is describing a rounding error, especially when it's part of a deal that could be worth $108 billion. The other is describing, more or less, a midsize media company.\n\nAnd yes, this is equity value, not enterprise value — this already assumes the spin-off gets saddled with billions of WBD's debt under the Netflix plan. But we're going to focus this conversation on the shares that ultimately end up in a WBD investor's brokerage account.\n\nAnd if you believe David Ellison and Co., those investors aren't getting much. Because CNN, Turner, and all of the networks formerly owned by Discovery aren't worth much at all.\n\nAnd yes, the cable network industry is a falling knife, which is why many big media companies that own cable networks are trying to ditch them. But are things really that bad?\n\nMaybe. Maybe, using Ellison's math, all of CNN plus a pile of other cable networks — which still generate cash, mind you — are worth about 16 Bari Weisses, based on the reported $150 million he paid for her Free Press site.\n\nOr maybe all of that is worth $10 billion — which means it's still less than 1% of Google. Which feels like a metaphor for the entire media industry in 2025: Even a roomful of famous brands barely registers in a world run by giant software companies.\n\nSomewhere in that $2.5 billion to $10 billion range is the real answer. But the headline is clear: The networks that once held the entire cable bundle together are now garage sale leftovers. Worth something to someone — but a whole lot less than they used to be.",

    "fullText": "Talk about the rich getting richer.\n\nAlphabet, parent company of Google, has been one of the best-performing stocks of the year, up nearly 70%, and now has a market capitalization of $3.8 trillion.\n\nThe company also happened to make what could turn out to be one of the most lucrative startup investments of all time, which could finally bear fruit next year.\n\nIn 2015, Google invested around $900 million in SpaceX for a stake of around 7% in Elon Musk's space company, which was then valued at $12 billion.\n\nNow SpaceX is reportedly planning to go public next year at a valuation of $1.5 trillion, which would make Google's stake worth around $111 billion.\n\nEven for a company as big as Google, SpaceX's success has already had a material impact on earnings.\n\nEarlier this year, Google reported an $8 billion gain from \"non-marketable equity securities,\" which Bloomberg identified as SpaceX. That gain represented 25% of Google's net income for the first quarter of 2025.\n\nGoogle is one of the largest outside investors in SpaceX, along with VC firm Founders Fund and Fidelity.\n\nGoogle and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGoogle's 2015 investment, which was focused on Starlink, now looks certain to be a towering success, but at that time, it was met with considerable skepticism.\n\n\"One big technical and financial challenge facing the proposed venture is the cost installing ground-based antennas and computer terminals to receive the satellite signals,\" The Wall Street Journal wrote about Google's investment at the time. \"Another unanswered question is how SpaceX plans to transmit Internet signals to Earth. The company isn't believed to control rights to radio spectrum.\"\n\nMost of those questions have been answered with Starlink, now used by everyone from the Ukrainian army to United Airlines.\n\nAside from just the paper gains, Google's investment has also been a strategic advantage, as SpaceX has used Google Cloud to power Starlink.",

    "fullText": "\"Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story,\" Expedition 33 creative director Guillaume Broche told GameSpot.\n\n on December 10, 2025 at 10:53AM PST\n\nThe Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees--and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive.\n\nEarlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.\n\nNow, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.\n\nBroche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were \"a lot of arguments\" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.\n\nGameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the game's tremendous success?\n\nBroche: I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, \"Is this real?\" or, \"Can you believe that?\" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a \"less is more\" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.\n\nWe always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain \"less is more\" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more \"real\" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.\n\nFor the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.\n\nI've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or \"good\" ending to the game?\n\nThat’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the \"good\" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.\n\nMany sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?\n\nActually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.\n\nOne major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!\n\nWhether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. The Game Awards airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Chromebook Power User Should Know",
    "description": "You can do a lot more with your Chromebook.",
    "fullText": "If you've chosen a Chromebook as a laptop, then you know the main benefits that it brings: namely, speed, ease of use, and affordability. Despite the simplicity of ChromeOS, however, there's more that you can do with it than you might realize. You can use it offline, and you can sync files to and from local storage, for example. The operating system is a lot more powerful and versatile than it often gets credit for.\n\nThese hacks are for power users who want to level up their Chromebook capabilities, and get extra value out of their laptop, beyond the standard use cases that everyone knows about. No matter how you use ChromeOS, there should be something here to help.\n\nChromebooks are often criticized for being useless without wifi, but that's not actually the case: All of the Docs, Sheets, and Slides tools can be used offline, with changes syncing back when your internet connection is restored: From Google Drive, click the gear icon (top right), then choose Settings > General and check the option under the Offline heading.\n\nYou can use Gmail offline, too. You can't send or receive emails, obviously, but you can read through and organize your inbox, and draft emails ready to go once you get your internet back. From Gmail, click on the gear icon (top right), then pick See all settings > Offline. Check the Enable offline mail box and choose how much of your email you want to sync.\n\nThis offline functionality extends to third-party streaming apps too, as ChromeOS supports Android apps. With apps such as Netflix and Spotify, you can sync content to your Chromebook to watch when you don't have a reliable internet connection—when you're on a long flight, for example, or traveling between countries.\n\nTyping is all well and good, but sometimes talking is faster. Launch Settings, then choose Accessibility > Keyboard and text input > Dictation to enable the feature. You can then press the Launcher (G) button and D to start dictating in any app—whether you're composing emails or writing essays.\n\nOne of the pros of using a Chromebook is that everything is synced online pretty much instantly, if you're using one of Google's own online apps or something similar. However, there may be local files that accumulate on the laptop, including screenshots and downloads, and sometimes you'll want to get those synced to the cloud as well.\n\nYou can see these files via the Files app that comes built into ChromeOS, and upload them manually via the Google Drive web interface. There's an easier way to get them into Google Drive, though: From the Files app, select all the local files you want to upload in the pane on the right, then drag them into My Drive under Google Drive in the left-hand menu bar.\n\nChromebooks don't always have the biggest or highest-resolution screens, but you can give yourself more room by managing multiple virtual desktops (which ChromeOS calls \"desks\"). Press the \"show windows\" key (it's the one with little rectangles on it, usually also labeled F3) to view open desks, switch between them, and create new ones.\n\nAs ChromeOS is so tightly tied to your Google account, you don't necessarily want other people borrowing your laptop and being able to get into your Google apps. The solution is guest mode: Restart your Chromebook or sign out of your current user account, then click Browse as Guest to launch a Chrome window without any Google account attached.\n\nChromeOS can sometimes feel limiting in that you can't quickly drag files to the desktop or to a temporary folder in the same way that you can on Windows or macOS. You might also see that as a benefit—it means less junk will be cluttering your system—but there could well be times that you just need to store something temporarily for transfer.\n\nThat's where the ChromeOS clipboard comes in: It actually stores five items rather than one, so it's a useful (if rather hidden) way of moving images, text, and links between websites and apps. Use the usual Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, and Ctrl+V shortcuts to copy, cut, and paste, then hold down the Launcher (G) button and V to see all the clipboard items.\n\nThe ChromeOS Task Manager is useful for everything from shutting down crashed apps to seeing exactly where all your RAM is going, and it can be a key tool in the power user's belt. Open it by pressing the Launcher (G) key and Esc: You'll see you can browse between individual tabs and system processes, or search for something specific on ChromeOS.\n\nChromeOS isn't just for Chromebooks: You can give an older, struggling laptop a new lease of life by installing ChromeOS Flex on it (even old laptops can usually handle Chrome). Google has full instructions for what you need to do to get this working, and will guide you through the process of creating a bootable USB drive with the ChromeOS software on.\n\nAs with a lot of software, there are beta and dev channels of ChromeOS available as well as the stable one. If you want to get the newest Chromebook features before everyone else, and don't mind a few bugs along the way, then you can make the switch. It doesn't take long, and you can always switch back again, though a system reset is sometimes required.\n\nTo change between ChromeOS channels, click on the time panel (bottom right), then click the gear icon to get to the main Settings page. Choose About ChromeOS > Additional details > Change channel, then choose whichever one you want to use. You'll keep getting over-the-air updates for your selected channel until you switch to a different one.",

    "title": "Colorado's Once-Thriving Mountain Town Between Grand Junction And Denver Is Now Abandoned",
    "description": "This Colorado ghost town is an eerie reminder of mining's negative effects and can be seen from Highway 24, not far from the capital of the Mile High State.",
    "fullText": "The story of Gilman, Colorado, reads like a horror movie. The setting: a small Rocky Mountain town in 1984. The characters: the residents of a centuries-old mining community. The plot: the soil is contaminated with deadly toxins, and authorities flood the town, urging people to evacuate. Locals leave with whatever they can, and as they drive away, look longingly at the rows of ranch homes they've left behind. Silent roads are stippled with empty buildings. Above them, at the top of a dirt hill, looms a massive processing plant, a grim symbol of the district's environmental collapse.\n\nLike St. Elmo, one of the American West's best-preserved ghost towns, this place casts a haunting spell. The real history of Gilman was a bit less dramatic, but it ended the same way. The town was founded in 1886, and workers moved to the area to mine zinc, copper, silver, and gold. Over the next century, they would extract 10 million tons of material. Production started to decline in the 1960s, and by the time the Environmental Protection Agency arrived in the mid-80s, mine runoff had tarnished Gilman's groundwater. The landscape was so deadly that residents were ordered to leave, and the town's collapse has since served as a cautionary tale about unregulated industry.\n\nThe remains of Gilman still hug the steep slopes of Battle Mountain. Its ruins now stand on private property, which is off-limits to visitors. But you can still stop and see Gilman from the shoulder of Highway 24, which runs parallel to the site. There's a broad gravel area to park on, which overlooks a building-studded valley. Stopping there is free, and it's the only legal way to see Gilman's remains. Bring binoculars, or better yet, a telephoto lens.\n\nGilman is hardly alone when it comes to abandoned Colorado towns. Seven hundred ghost towns were scattered across the state as of 2018, representing a wide range of industries and eras. Intrepid explorers have made their way into Gilman, photographing and filming the town's crumbling remains. What's so unsettling about these images is how contemporary they all look. The buildings aren't frontier shacks, but split-level homes you could find in modern-day suburbs.\n\nYoung trespassers have left patches of graffiti on the old walls. Many of these roads are still paved in modern asphalt, although their surfaces are cracked after countless winters without maintenance, with mature evergreens growing through their cracks. At its peak, nearly 9,000 people lived on this ridge, overlooking the confluence of Rock Creek and the Eagle River. Today, even that modest population is hard to imagine. A few rows of gutted houses are still visible on the grassy terraces, but they offer only a vague impression of what life there was once like.\n\nGilman feels more remote than it is. Highway 24 weaves its way through the mountains and connects with Interstate 70, the main motorway between Denver and the major western Colorado town of Grand Junction. If you're already seeking the ultimate destinations to visit on a trip through Colorado, this site is surprisingly close to some of the state's major landmarks. Just 20 minutes from Gilman is the world-famous ski town of Vail, which draws 2.8 million visitors every year.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?",

    "title": "Instagram Is Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Some Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—we can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we can control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, Instagram is now experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the clickbait treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Google told Maiberg the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI reached out to Meta for comment, and this story originally published before they responded. However, a Meta spokesperson has since confirmed to me that Instagram has recently started generating these titles using AI. The goal, according to the spokesperson, is to make it easier to know what a post is about before you click the link. They also noted that these headlines might not be totally correct, as with all AI products. In addition, the spokesperson explained that search engine optimization indexing is not necessarily new. The company has been doing this for years in the U.S. to increase visibility for posts from professional accounts.\n\nThat last point is all fine and good, of course. No one is surprised that Instagram is indexing posts for search engines: Most social media platforms do that. Otherwise, you'd never find any of their posts on platforms like Google. The issue is generating fake headlines with AI without letting anyone know about it. Just because Meta AI is capable of generating headlines doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts, a risk the Meta spokesperson readily admits to. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"\n\nWhile Meta has yet to add a dedicated on/off switch for these headlines, one thing you can do to ensure your posts don't get an AI clickbait makeover is to opt out of indexing as a whole. If you run an account that relies on discoverability, this might not be worth it, since you'll be impacting how users find your posts outside of Instagram. However, if you don't care about that, or you don't need the SEO at all, you can stop Instagram from making your posts available on search engines—and putting an end to the AI-generated headlines, at that.\n\nThere are three ways to accomplish this, according to Instagram:\n\nMake your account private: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. Here, tap the Private account toggle.\n\nSwitch your account from professional to private: Open Instagram's in-app settings, scroll down and tap Account type and tools. Here, choose \"Switch to personal account.\"\n\nManually opt out of indexing: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. You should see an option to stop your public photos and videos from appearing in search engines.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Android User Should Know",
    "description": "Identify battery-hungry apps, force dark mode system wide, and block ads and trackers.",
    "fullText": "Android remains one of the most customizable mobile operating systems out there, despite Google's recent efforts to rein it in. You don't necessarily have to root your Android device to get it to do something off script, either. The fix you need might be hidden behind a system menu or Developer Options. You can personalize Android to address common frustrations with speed, battery life, privacy, and the interface as a whole. I've compiled ten helpful Android hacks that require no third-party apps, no ADB commands, and no rooting. All you need is the patience to dig through the operating system and tap as required.\n\nPlease note that many of these hacks require you to enable Developer Options, Android's hidden menu of settings. To do so, head to the Settings menu, scroll to About phone, then tap Build number. Tap it seven times to unlock developer mode. (You'll see a countdown pop-up if you did it correctly.)\n\nHave you ever looked at your battery usage stats and wondered what to do about a specific app that's draining your battery? Android needs apps to run in the background, sync with the cloud, and check for updates by default. As it does this, it wakes the device and consumes battery in the background.\n\nAndroid introduced a battery optimization feature in version 6.0 that's supposed to help with apps that drain too much battery. While it's helped shut down unused apps, it can be either too aggressive or not aggressive enough at identifying bad apps. And while you can force-close an app to kill it when you notice it's causing issues, it will likely start up again the next time you reboot your device.\n\nYou can manually set an app's background privileges to the most restrictive setting without deleting or disabling it. In Settings, under Apps, scroll down and tap to view all your apps in a list. Then, tap App battery usage. Here, you will find details about the last time the app was accessed. Tap on the app to adjust its background usage. You can choose to have it optimized by the Android system or unrestricted—something you might use on a wearable to ensure it works properly, for instance. If you want it restricted completely, use the master switch to toggle off background usage. On Samsung devices, this same option is called \"sleeping apps\" or \"deep sleeping apps.\"\n\nOptionally, you can turn to Developer Options to get more robust control over background processes. Head back to Developer Options, then scroll or search for Background process limit, and from here, you can decide how many background apps fire off at a time.\n\nEven with an ad blocker, background apps can still track your phone use, where you shop, and which ads to show you. You could easily circumvent this by installing a VPN app to route traffic, but that relies on a third party app, and slows down performance. You are better off configuring your phone's Private DNS settings to filter web traffic through a service of your choosing.\n\nPrivate DNS seals the request your device makes to look up a website's IP address, so your carrier can't see the website you're visiting. Since that browser data stays hidden, third parties don't have the data they need to track your habits and, subsequently, target you with ads.\n\nNavigate back to the Settings panel and select Network & Internet > Private DNS. Change the setting to Private DNS provider hostname. You will need to find the URL of a filtering service to link here. Options include Ad Guard, Control D, and Mullvad, which is what I use to block ads in Chrome.\n\nOnce you save, this will redirect all DNS requests from every app and browser on your Android device through this specific block list. It should help cut down on ads and tracking servers watching you without cutting down on performance or battery life. This is also a great hack if you're a parent and your kid has access to an Android device. Use Private DNS to route them away from unsafe sites and adult content.\n\nSometimes, we accidentally dismiss a notification on Android. If you're always snoozing and missing out on important pings, you can turn on notification history.\n\nIn Settings, under Notifications, tap to turn on Notification history. Now, when you swipe to dismiss your alerts, you can peek in here to see what you forgot or accidentally swiped away. This feature is also helpful for tracking any apps that might be quietly running in the background.\n\nI don't know what it is about these latest versions of Android, but the text feels either too small or too big when adjusted with the built-in display size settings. You could go into the Accessibility settings to make the text smaller or larger, though it doesn't affect the rest of the interface much. Or you could deploy Android's display density (DPI) scaling hack.\n\nThis is where the developer options come in handy again. You can use the Smallest Width setting to control the DPI precisely, which scales every interface element up and down. Change the value to a higher number if you want fonts and images to shrink down within the resolution—if it starts in the 400s, for instance, try 500 and work backwards until you like what you see. To make fonts and graphics even larger, start around 300.\n\nWhen you plug an Android phone into a PC, it defaults to charging the device rather than turning on file transfer. You can change the option from the notification shade, though it adds a few extra steps to something that should be straightforward. Fortunately, you can tweak the USB default behavior to prioritize file transfers when the device is plugged in via USB-C.\n\nIn the Developer Options, look for Default USB configuration. Change the setting to File Transfer/Android Auto. Test it by plugging a USB-C cable into a PC to ensure it defaults to file transfer mode.\n\nWhen you stream music or podcasts through headphones or another external source, the audio isn't at its best. And while you could adjust the equalizer settings in the app that's streaming media, it won't fix much. Your phone and the audio device default to standard codecs rather than high-fidelity ones, which is why it doesn't sound as crisp and loud as it could.\n\nYou can force Android to use the highest-quality codecs whenever the audio device connects in Developer Options. Search for a Bluetooth audio codec and select the highest-quality option supported by your wireless device. Note that you must be connected to the device when you look for this option, or it will appear grayed out. While you're in the Developer Options, look for Bluetooth Audio Sample Rate and Bits Per Sample. You can adjust these to higher sampling rates if your hardware supports it.\n\nEven on the latest Android flagships, the interface can feel sluggish as you're moving between screens. That's because Android deliberately animates between every swipe and flick. But you can eliminate or shorten these animations to make the interface feel more fluid.\n\nIn Developer Options, look for Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. You can adjust their defaults; the lower the number, the faster the animation. You can also choose to turn the animation off completely if it's just too much.\n\nI suffer from migraines, and the brightest background can trigger the pain. I figured out how to force every Android app into dark mode, regardless of whether the developer coded it in.\n\nFirst, ensure \"Dark Theme\" is on in your main display settings. Then, navigate to Developer Options and search for Override force-dark. Toggle it on to save your eyes. This feature is also super helpful if you prefer to stare at the screen at night to read. Note that it may cause some apps not to display text properly, in which case, you might want to reserve this ability for when it's most necessary.\n\nSometimes you need the display to stay on without timing out. Most Android devices tap out at 30 minutes. But in the developer settings, there is an option to keep the screen \"awake\" as long as the device is plugged into a power source. I've had this feature enabled since I started covering Android phones. It's the best way to run benchmarks without being affected by random variables.\n\nIn Developer Options, search for Stay awake, then switch it on. Note that you will need to turn off the screen when charging the device overnight. Your phone could get hot from being connected and having the screen on for too long.\n\nThis has happened to me so many times: my phone rings, I answer it, but the call is routed to my smartwatch instead of my buds. While you could manually go into the phone and select the appropriate Bluetooth device, make it easier on yourself by eliminating the devices that you never want to answer the phone.\n\nIn the Settings panel, under Bluetooth, select the offending device. The easiest way to keep it from rearing its ugly head is to find the switch that completely disables phone calls. You should see an option for it at the bottom of the device's Bluetooth settings. I've disabled the Pixel Watch 4 from answering any calls because there's no instance I'd ever want to take a call from my watch. It's too public!",

    "description": "Wasn't this a thing already?",
    "fullText": "Forgetting where you parked your car isn't just a sitcom trope—though it does make for classic TV. Even in the age of the smartphone, it's all too easy to walk away from your car and retain zero memory of where you left it. As it happens, Google Maps has a solution—provided you have an iPhone.\n\nSo long as you're running the app on an Apple device, Google Maps can automatically remember where you parked and display that information on the map. There's no need to mark the location yourself, tell the app to save your spot, or take a picture of the cross streets in case you forget: You can simply glance at the screen to find a \"You parked here\" label.\n\nThe thing is, while some are reporting this feature is relatively new to them, others suggest it's been out for a while. What gives?\n\nThis feature works if you connect your iPhone to your car, whether via Bluetooth, CarPlay, or a USB cable. When you disconnect your iPhone from your car, Google Maps will assume you've parked, and will automatically mark that location on the map. The feature will also work if you give Google Maps permission to access your Motion & Fitness data, which allows the app to tell when you've started and stopped driving. (You can check on this setting from Google Maps' in-app settings: Head to Navigation, then, under \"Automatically save parking,\" tap Let maps use your motion to save your parking.)\n\nYou can also choose to set Google Maps' location permissions to \"Always,\" which gives the app persistent access to your location data, and also lets it figure out when you've stopped your car. You can change this option on your iPhone by navigating t0 Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Google Maps.\n\nThis feature is genuinely great, and I'm happy Google Maps supports it—even if Android users are inexplicably being excluded for now. But you might also be wondering to yourself, wasn't this already a feature? It doesn't sound all that new. Yet you might have even seen a flurry articles like this one today, all reporting on this \"new\" Google Maps parking feature.\n\nAs it turns out, the answer is a bit complicated. The coverage today all references this announcement on LinkedIn from Google Maps senior product manager Rio Akasaka—only that post is, according to LinkedIn, a month old. Some of the comments are more recent, but others appear to be from the original posting date.\n\nPotentially adding to the confusion, other navigation apps, like Apple Maps, already support automatically saving your parking spot, and while Google Maps has also had an option to save your parking spot for some time, it previously wasn't automatic. If you wanted the app to remember where you stopped, you needed to tap your blue dot on the map and choose \"Save your parking.\" That's how it still is on Android, since the automatic feature only works on iOS.\n\nLooking through the comment sections on articles from outlets like The Verge or MacRumors, some users insist they've had this feature for some time—well before that month-old LinkedIn announcement. This commenter says they've had the feature for years, while this one claims they've had it for \"ages.\" So what gives? Have at least some iPhone users have had this feature for years? It is possible Google has been testing out the feature with smaller subsets of users and only recently rolled it out en masse, but whether or not that actually happened is unclear at this time.\n\nI've reached out to Google for clarification about the timeline of this feature's implementation, and I will update this article if I get an answer. Until then, I can only hope Google is actively working on rolling out the feature to Android, as that really would be something new.",

    "title": "10 Ways to Use Your Hand Tools and Power Tools Together to Do More",
    "description": "For your next DIY project, get creative.",
    "fullText": "One of the best lessons I've learned across years of DIY projects is the fact that, whether powered by hand or by electricity, your tools can can serve more than the purpose for which you purchased them—provided you get creative with how you put them to use. Often, you can use two tools together to improve their performance, make them more versatile, make them easier to use, or even to to replace a tool you’re missing.\n\nHere are 10 unexpected ways to combine your hand tools and power tools to make DIY work a little easier.\n\nEye hooks serve a wide range of uses, but if you’ve ever had to drive a bunch of them into wood, you know how frustrating they can be. The usual move is to either slip a screwdriver through the hook and twist, which is slow and awkward, or to clamp a wrench or pair of pliers on top and twist, which is...also slow and awkward.\n\nThis works better: Place an Allen wrench in your power drill’s chuck, slide the end of the wrench into the eyehook, and let the drill do the work. It's faster, it saves your elbows and wrists the strain, and you’ll wonder why you never thought of it before.\n\nWood glue can be a lifesaver when you have a damaged piece of lumber—but only if you can actually get the glue inside the crack. If you’ve ever tried, you know that you wind up with glue smeared everywhere, but only a small amount seeps into the crack, leading to a pretty quick failure.\n\nDrywall knives and putty knives can develop a thick, lumpy buildup of drywall mud, paint, and anything else they’re used to scrape. Eventually, they’re almost useless because their flat surface has developed its own topography.\n\nYou can try cleaning them, but water will rust them and it’s often a laborious process, especially if they’re covered in cement or thinset. If you’ve got an orbital sander, however, cleaning your putty knives and drywall knives is pretty easy. Using a moderate grit (120 works well) pad, just sand down your blade with gentle pressure—don’t overdo it; just let the sandpaper do its work. You’ll have shiny, clean blades in no time.\n\nGetting things level is surprisingly challenging—at least for me. I can measure things five times and still somehow wind up slightly off. That makes a spirit level an essential part of my toolbox for any project (and even then, I am level-challenged, somehow).\n\nIf I forget my level, I’m in trouble—unless I happen to have a carpenter’s square and a chalk line. Place the bottom of the square on the surface you’re checking, and loop your chalk line over the top at the 90° mark so it dangles down. Then adjust until the line is directly over the 45° mark on the bottom. That’s means it's level.\n\nTrying to remove a stuck nail can be an entire project in itself. Your progress freezes while you sweat and strain, and eventually you start to damage the surface as your attempts to pull that nail get wilder and more violent.\n\nTo protect a surface you don’t want to damage and give yourself a little extra leverage on the nail, place a screwdriver under your hammer. This will give your pull a little more oomph while stopping your hammer from gouging the surface beneath.\n\nGot a stubborn nail and don’t have your hammer or prybar? Or dealing with a nail that’s lost its head? You can get it free with the help of a vise grip and a putty knife. Lock the vise grip onto the nail and slide a putty knife onto the surface behind the nail. Rotate the vise grips like a lever, and the nail will slowly pull free, while the putty knife blade protects the surface underneath from damage.\n\nWhen dealing with a screw that seems to be frozen in place, your hand screwdriver often can’t deliver enough torque, and using a power drill with a screwdriver bit is often overkill, stripping the screw in no time. To increase the torque your screwdriver can provide, combine it with a wrench or pair of adjustable pliers. Lock the pliers onto the screwdriver at a 90° angle, push down, and turn with the plier handles. Even the most stubborn screws will work themselves free.\n\nAnother way to tackle a nail that just won’t work itself free (or that’s lost its head) is to combine a vise grip and a flat prybar. Lock the grips onto the top of the nail to act as the head, then angle the prybar underneath and apply pressure. You can also slide a putty knife under the prybar blade if you want to protect the surface you’re extracting the nail from.\n\nWhen I used to rent, I was always infuriated by the “landlord special” repairs that covered screw heads with multiple layers of paint, often to the extent that I couldn’t get a screwdriver or bit to bite. That meant a lot of slow effort scraping paint out of the grooves until I got them clean enough to extract.\n\nInstead of doing that, combine a hammer and a screwdriver bit: position the bit on the screw head and give it some solid taps with the hammer. The crusted paint will fall right out, and you can get on with your work.\n\nHow much time do you think you’ve wasted trying to eyeball a drill bit when driving bolts? You estimate the bit size, you drill the hole—nope, too small. So you grab the next-largest bit and do it again. Or, worse, you estimate the drill bit and the hole is too big, and now you’ve got a problem.\n\nIf you’ve got an adjustable wrench, spare yourself the drama. Tighten the jaws of the wrench onto the bolt, then see which drill bit matches the wrench’s opening. You’ll never have to drill three times for one bolt ever again.",

While Season 1 did include a small celebration of the holidays, it wasn't until Season 7 that Fortnite held a major event with holiday-themed gameplay changes, daily challenges, and lots of free cosmetics.\n\nSeason 7 was an eventful one from the very start, as the Battle Royale island expanded with the addition of a new snow biome in the southwest corner of the map after a massive iceberg crashed into the island. It also introduced airplanes, added possibly the most infamous weapon in Fortnite history, and held one of Fortnite's most memorable live events. Scroll on to see everything you can expect from Fortnite OG Season 7.\n\nThe Season 7 OG pass includes new versions of three skins from the original Season 7 battle pass: Sgt. Winter, Lynx, and Onesie. Onesie seems to be particularly interesting, since the teaser image we have for it shows the new version with a pattern that uses one of Fortnite's emoticons. The new Onesie may be customizable with any emoticon you have.\n\nIt's interesting that the pass did not include a new version of the Ice King, despite the fact that he's the season's main character. Because of that, he's a great candidate to receive a new skin in the item shop.\n\nThe OG pass also includes style options for each skin, along with back blings, pickaxes, wraps, and emotes for each of them. The pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and it's included with Fortnite Crew.\n\nWhen the original Season 7 began, several items were removed from the loot pool, but nothing was added. Over the course of the season, though, a number of new guns and other weapons and items were added, and some existing guns were unvaulted. And one of the most notorious weapons in Fortnite history, the Infinity Blade, was added a week after launch. But more on that a bit further down.\n\nHere are the weapons that will make up the Fortnite OG loot pool in Season 7:\n\nThis weapon, which comes from Epic's mobile game of the same name, is an utterly unique weapon that takes up your entire inventory and gives bonus health and shields when you pick it up, gives siphon on kills, and makes you move faster. The Infinity Blade was so absurdly overpowered that it was vaulted after three days and never returned. Until now.\n\nThe two biggest things added to Battle Royale when Season 7 began were airplanes and ziplines. The Fortnite airplane is the X-4 Stormwing, an old-style biplane with a machine gun on the front. The X-4 only has one seat, but passengers can ride on the wings. Be warned that you will take fall damage if you fall out of one of these.\n\nFortnite had one major live event midway through Season 7, and then was rocked by a series of earthquakes during the final stretch of the season--a trick Epic has used many other times since then.\n\nThe mid-season Ice Storm event, which went down on January 19, 2019, was relatively short but extremely memorable, as it involved the spirit of the Ice King standing over the island and conjuring a blizzard that covered the entire island with snow. When the match began only one corner of the island had snow, and when it ended the snow was everywhere. And it stayed that way for weeks.\n\nThe southwestern corner of the island got a dramatic makeover and expansion for the start of Season 7 with the addition of a large iceberg and a layer of snow cover. The iceberg destroyed the beloved Greasy Grove and Flush Factory, but it added three new named locations with Polar Peak, Frosty Flights, and Happy Hamlet. Season 7 also saw the introduction of The Block in the northwest corner of the island later in the season.\n\nThe Block was a big empty space where Epic would showcase places created using Fortnite Creative tools, which were introduced for the first time at the beginning of Season 7--these user-created spots would rotate regularly. We don't know what, if anything, Epic will do with The Block in Fortnite OG",

    "title": "How (and Why) I Use My Garmin Running Watch to Track Rests During Strength Workouts",
    "description": "Garmin has the most useful rest timer of any wearable I've tried.",
    "fullText": "The strength training mode in Garmin watches like the Forerunner 570 is a little confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly useful in the gym. Garmin handles rest timers better than any other wearable I've tried, and when combined with a third-party app called LiftTrack, you can even track your volume and PRs. I'll lead you through how I use this workout mode, and how it's helped me do more work in less time in the gym.\n\nI’ll get into how to create workouts in a minute, but first I just want to let you know that there are some strength workouts already available for download, if you’d like to just select one and start doing it right now. Go to either your Garmin Connect app or to Garmin Connect on the web, tap Training & Planning, then Workouts, then Find a Workout.\n\nYou’ll be able to choose workouts from a library, and you can search by type (including weights, yoga, and bodyweight cardio). Most of the workouts are short, simple, and don’t use much equipment. If you’re experienced at strength training, you’ll probably want to create your own workouts or use the coach feature, but these will get you started in the meantime.\n\nAs for that coach feature, it works much like the adaptive running coach plans. You can read more here from Garmin, but basically you set it up by selecting Garmin Coach and telling it your goals and schedule. Workouts will then appear for you each day. The image above shows a Push/Pull/Legs workout programmed by Garmin Coach. It let me choose which workout happens on which day, had me set my max lifts as benchmarks (this program uses percentages), and even let me edit the workouts to swap exercises before finally putting them on my calendar.\n\nI’m going to walk you through this step-by-step, because I was so confused the first time I tried to build a workout. Again, you can do this either on your phone or on the web. I usually end up creating my workouts on the phone, and it’s not hard once you get the hang of it. One tip, though: you can skip this whole process if you're willing to install a third-party app. LiftTrack takes care of workout planning and syncs to your Garmin account, and you can read more about how to use that app here.\n\nGo to the “More” menu on your phone (or the sidebar on web) and select Training & Planning, then Workouts, and then Create a Workout. From here, select Strength, and you’ll be given a skeleton of a workout with a warmup, cooldown, and one slot for an exercise.\n\nTo start adding exercises, tap Add Round, which will give you a workout card and a recovery card, both in a little box that says “2 Rounds” at the top. Here’s what you do to turn this into a traditional sets-and-reps format (in this example, we want to do four sets of five deadlifts at 200 pounds):\n\nTap the card that says workout.\n\nSelect an exercise (deadlift), a weight (200 pounds), and a target type. In this case, the target type will be Reps (five). Hit the arrow on the top left of the screen to return to the main workout editing page.\n\nFor the recovery card, you’ll want to change that to Rest rather than Recovery. For that one, the target type should be Time. Let’s set it to three minutes. Return to the main workout screen again.\n\nNow, tap the dropdown at the top of the round and set it to the number of sets you want to do (four). If your watch supports it, you can select Skip Last Recovery to avoid the final rest period.\n\nBefore you add another set, go to the bottom of the screen and tap Add Step. Change this new step to Rest (it will be outside of the repeat) and set the target to Lap Button Press.\n\nNow you have a repeat that will give you four sets of five deadlifts with a three-minute rest timer in between. After you finish that, there will be a rest period that lasts until you press the lap button. This is to give you as much time as you need to find your equipment and set up for the next exercise. Continue adding repeats and steps as desired, and make sure to save the workout when you’re done.\n\nAfter creating a workout, it doesn’t automatically show up on your watch. You need to tap the “send to watch” icon that you’ll see on the top right of your screen when you’re looking at the workout.\n\nYou can also schedule a workout (which will automatically send it to your watch for the scheduled day) by using the three dots menu to add it to your calendar.\n\nThere are a few ways to access the strength workouts, but here’s the easiest: When it’s gym time, hit the button that starts an activity, and rather than selecting Strength, scroll down until you find Workouts. Tap the one you want to do.\n\nPay attention here: You’ll need to select the workout, tell it you want to do the workout, and start the workout. (Just keep pressing the select button until the workout actually begins.)\n\nThe exact details of which buttons do what will vary from watch to watch, but on a Forerunner, your top right button starts and stops the workout, and your bottom right button is a lap button. (During a timed rest, you can press the lap button to skip to the end of that rest and start the next set.) From the top right button, you can also skip a group of sets (say, if the squat rack was busy, you can skip squats) and then use the same menu later to View Skipped and add it back in.\n\nI love using the strength workout feature for one main reason: the customizable timed rests. Rest is important in the gym because you'll be able to lift more if you dial in the perfect rest time for each exercise. It’s easy to sit around scrolling on your phone between sets and realize too late that it’s been 10 minutes since you did your last deadlift. But when I program the workout as above, all I have to do is hit the lap button after my set. Three minutes later, my watch will buzz to let me know it’s time to do the next set.\n\nPro tip: Set your rest timer for the longest time you might want to rest between sets. If you’re aiming for three to five minutes, set it for five minutes. If you’re ready to go after three, just hit the lap button to skip the remainder of that rest.\n\nYou can also program exercises in other ways besides the traditional sets and reps. For example, set the Target Type to Time to do a five-minute density set. Or do EMOMs (every-minute-on-the-minute intervals) by putting just one card inside a repeat, and setting that card to a one-minute target time. You’ll get a beep at the top of each minute.\n\nI don’t worry too much about the weights or reps in the app, to be honest. By default, the watch will ask you after each set how many reps you did and how heavy the weight was. I’ve turned that feature off, and I don’t even bother to set rep or weight targets in the app. I use the workouts for timing, not to log the details of my workout. (I have a notebook for that.)\n\nI also haven’t found the automatic set detection or rep counting to be very useful. The watch is impressively good sometimes—how did it know I was doing pullups?!—but it’s just not good enough to be generally useful. It also doesn’t recognize a lot of the Olympic weightlifting exercises I do. And the rep counting? Sometimes OK, but more often useless. Again, I’d rather jot down my reps in that notebook than fiddle with selecting a number on my watch screen after each set.",

    "title": "Instagram Is Finally Letting You Control the Reels You See",
    "description": "The mysterious algorithm is now (somewhat) customizable.",
    "fullText": "After years of suffering from a crippling TikTok addiction, I decided enough was enough: I quit the app cold turkey and deleted it from my phone. Then, I discovered Instagram Reels, and my attention span hasn't been the same since.\n\nTikTok's algorithm is infamous, but we don't give Instagram's enough credit. This platform is addicting. I hardly use the app to keep up with friends and family anymore: Reels grabs my attention and doesn't let go, and before I know it, it's midnight, and I've done nothing with my evening. How many videos did I watch? What did I even watch? Whatever Meta has going on in that algorithm is dangerous stuff.\n\nYou can influence the algorithm, of course: The decisions you make in the app—likes, comments, watch time, sharing—tell the algorithm which videos you like, which you don't, and inform its fraction-of-a-second decisions about what to show you next. But until now, you haven't been able to see what's driving those decisions. You're kind of flying blind—you can try to steer the algorithm in a new direction, but you'll never know exactly what direction you're really going in.\n\nThat's now changing. As reported by Wired, Meta is rolling out a new tab for Reels viewers that will let us see why the algorithm is delivering us these particular videos. This tab, called, appropriately, \"Your Algorithm,\" is now rolling out, first in the U.S., but soon to the rest of the world—at least, only to English speakers. It seems reminiscent of TikTok's \"Manage Topics\" feed, which lets you adjust the content types that appear in your For You feed.\n\nWhen \"Your Algorithm\" hits your phone, you'll find it in the top right corner of the Reels feed: two lines with heart icons placed on each. (I had to update the app and force quit it a couple times to get it to appear.) Once you open this tab, you'll see a short summary of the type of content the algorithm says you've liked recently. In Meta's example, it says, \"Lately you've been into creativity, sports hype, fitness motivation, [and] skateboarding.\" Mine says, \"Lately you've been into classic video games, laughing at comedy clubs, and making beats in the studio.\"\n\nBeneath this summary, you'll find the \"What you want to see more of\" section. Here, you can choose specific content categories you'd like to appear in your feed more often. Instagram will populate some choices here based on your past interests—Meta's example from above shows things like \"Sports,\" \"GRWM,\" \"Thrifting,\" and \"Horror movies\"—but you can tap an \"Add\" button to contribute your own requests. You can tap any of these content types to find the option to watch Reels in that category, in case you want to test drive any before locking in your choices.\n\nBeneath this, you'll find \"What you want to see less of.\" This is the same concept, but the reverse: You can choose any content types you don't want in your feed anymore. If you're sick of seeing hiking videos, but Instagram continues to show them to you, here's your chance to directly tell the algorithm to cut it out.\n\nIf you tap the three dots in the top right, you'll find some shortcuts to existing content controls, too, like whether to suggest political content on your feed, \"sensitive\" content controls, and specific words and phrase filters, to name a few. You can also tap the share button to share your algorithm summary to your story. I'm not sure who would want to do that, but I guess I shared my summary here, so who am I to judge.\n\nWired highlights how these changes come as the European Commission is pushing Meta to present more data controls to EU users: These users have so far been able to pay to not see ads, but since the European Commission didn't think that was enough, Meta will allow users to choose whether to allow all their data to be used for personalized ads, or only a small percentage.\n\nThat's not happening here in the U.S., but that doesn't mean Meta is staying the same, either. \"Your Algorithm\" is launching as Meta is facing criticism over how it handles younger users on its platforms. Reports suggest Meta understands how addictive its apps are, especially to teens, and the company's internal policies for chatbot interactions with minors was, frankly, appalling. The company has rolled out Teen Accounts across apps like Instagram and Facebook, which offer limits on communications and interactions, and new AI parental controls are also on their way. \"Your Algorithm\" seems to be the latest in a string of efforts to make it easier for users to control the experience on Meta platforms. Theoretically, you could even use these controls to make your Reels experience less addicting.\n\nThose are all good developments as far as I'm concerned, but I fear there's still quite a lot of work to do to make Meta's products—as well as many other social media products—less addictive, and, overall, better for us. Case in point: I opened the app to test out \"Your Algorithm,\" and not only did I not find it at first, I ended up losing five minutes of my life watching the first video that appeared in my feed. I need to delete Instagram from my phone.",

    "fullText": "A Russian feminist reflects on Julia Ioffe’s history of modern Russia.\n\nMOSCOW—Julia Ioffe’s new book, Motherland: A Feminist History of Modern Russia, from Revolution to Autocracy (Ecco), immediately brings to mind Soviet Women: Walking the Tightrope (1989) by Francine du Plessix Gray. It was one of the first popular books about Soviet women, published as the Iron Curtain was coming down. The characters of Gray’s book were successful and professional women who talked a lot about their burdensome living conditions, the horrible conditions of Soviet maternity hospitals, about their “emancipation fatigue.” They dreamed of hiding behind a reliable and strong man, whom they often missed from their lives. As a matter of fact, this was indeed the yearning of many women in the Perestroika years. They had become fed up with Soviet hypocrisy and were longing for that “American dream” they had glimpsed in the first films about the West that reached the USSR.\n\nThis illusion evaporated in the1990s—the early days of “Wild Capitalism.” As Katrina vanden Heuvel noted in her review in the Nation, du Plessix Gray failed to discern quite a few of the perestroika realities Nevertheless, the book sparked interest and prompted many researchers and scholars to begin working together with colleagues from the former Soviet Union—and this collaboration proved to be successful. Over the past thirty years, Russian women became the subject of dozens of books and hundreds of articles on both sides of the Atlantic, of newly created university centers, and of dozens of scholarly events and conferences. Unfortunately, most of them are known only to a narrow circle of specialists. At present, academic contacts with Russia are virtually frozen, and dialogue is barely maintained, even though not completely extinguished.\n\nAgainst this background, Ioffe’s book presents itself “as reopening the subject,” almost as if from scratch. It reminds American readers that a vast country of 145 million people has other residents beside Vladimir Putin. This is unquestionably important.\n\nThe author left the USSR with her parents in 1990 as a child. She tells her family story of four generations of women who were educated professionals, while accurately noting that this was commonplace in the Soviet Union. From my standpoint, her family saga is the most interesting part of her book; she alternates the chapters of this story with brief notes on historical figures, including the wives of Soviet leaders, and on many important events of the Soviet era. In the preface, Ioffe defines her task: to understand how “the country of [Alexandra] Kollontai and women fighter pilots become a country of women who wanted nothing more than to become housewives.”\n\nIn essence, she repeats the claim of du Plessix Gray, which is perplexing, and not just for a Russian reader.\n\nIoffe has clearly done a lot of research and surveyed important publications of the period; she reminds readers of the names of historical figures, most of them unfamiliar to Americans, and she does so in an engrossing, at times even cinematic manner. The chapters of the book resemble fragments of a TV series script—with attention paid to the requirements of the genre (and to audience expectations), with the requisite eroticism, glamour and a touch of horror.\n\nAt the same time, those readers who are somewhat familiar with the subject will notice significant gaps in the narrative, arbitrary emphases, a mixture of hearsay and facts, allegiance to the stereotypes transmitted via mass media, and other shortcomings. Undoubtedly, the author of a journalistic book is not a historian and is entitled to her own interpretation. Yet it is regrettable that Ioffe’s version of the history of Russia’s women tells us so little about Russian feminism as such, which emerged long before Kollontai and continues to this day.\n\n“Three projects for the emancipation of women in Russia—pre-revolutionary, Soviet, and post-Soviet feminism—were cut short due to historical factors,” says Russian sociologist Olga Zdravomyslova. “Yet each of them was important for the life and self-perception of the country.” And the Soviet experience of women’s active participation in the economy and society, even though under total control, enabled women to join forces in the 1990s, with the rise of the “wild market,” in efforts to solve their most pressing problems, such as how to put bread on their families’ table, how to maintain sanity, how to “find themselves” in the new, often rough conditions.\n\nIn the years when Ioffe was learning the basics of English grammar in the US, millions of Russian women had lost their jobs (for reasons that included the popular neoliberal myth that women are bad workers and jobs should be given to men), were deprived of government support, kindergartens, and other benefits, they began to learn the basics of entrepreneurship . Those who only the day before were still engineers were now baking pies and trading in the market, importing cheap clothes from China and Poland, and were setting up clubs and coteries while sharing their experience.\n\nI was writing about these women in the mid-to-late 1980s into the 1990s, for glasnost- era publications Ogonyok and Nezavisimaya Gazeta, marveling at their courage and talent, and realizing that they were the ones saving the country, as has often been the case in Soviet history. The independent women’s movement of the 1990s largely emerged as a result of Gorbachev’s democratic perestroika (Gorbachev, incidentally, wanted to involve women more actively in its processes) and quickly gained momentum.\n\nAccording to the results of a study commissioned by the Russian government in 2000, one in five Russians, that is, 30 million people per year, were the recipients of assistance from Russian civic organizations—and most of it was the work of women. NGOs employed two million people. And quite a few of these organizations were not dependent on Western grant money, as businesses and individual citizens started to contribute to them. Women’s organizations existed in every city and village, seeking to solve practical problems. There were academic initiatives, feminist centers, crisis support centers, gender departments in universities, self-help groups, soldiers’ mothers, political clubs, and for a short period, a women’s caucus in parliament. Not all of these efforts were mutually supportive, yet despite this, the results of their work turned out to be impressive.\n\nJust as the six years of perestroika changed the country beyond recognition, so did a decade and a half of active development of the independent women’s movement deeply impact and, most importantly, women’s self-awareness. The 1993 Constitution of the Russian Federation had Article 19, establishing equal rights and opportunities, while the Labor Code and Family Code now included provisions on social and economic protections for mothers.\n\nThere were short-term programs on reproductive health and sex education; even though they were subsequently curtailed, they were kept alive by NGOs. As a result of this, Russia is now on a par with Europe with regards to the number of abortions, while before that it had, along with Romania, the largest number of them among the countries of the world. According to prominent population studies expert Anatoly Vishnevsky, this came about precisely because of all this work, as the new generation internalized new rules of behavior.  believed that this was the result of such work, with a new generation learning new rules of behavior. The rhetoric of patriarchy and its propaganda have not significantly impacted the new rules of behavior.\n\nAs of this year, women make up 45 percent of all entrepreneurs, are included in the Forbes list of billionaires, and hold high level positions not only in the service sector, but also in finance and the oil industry. Most importantly, people’s mindsets have changed.\n\nThese days, a woman in a position of leadership is not perceived as an oddity. The overwhelming majority of Russians consider domestic violence to be a crime, regardless the absence of a corresponding law, and despite the propaganda of patriarchy, and pressure on NGOs. Hotlines and shelters operate in Russia, and the Consortium of Women’s NGOs handles hundreds of cases each year, often winning in court. Mari Davtyan, a lawyer and the head of the Consortium, as well as journalist Eva Merkachova are important voices in the Russian media landscape. Under the new restrictions, many groups operate informally, helping prisoners and refugees from war zones. This huge layer of everyday life in a country spanning nine time zones is not reflected in either the Russian or international media. Women’s activism and feminist thought, awakened by perestroika, continue to develop in cities with millions of inhabitants and modest regional centers. Working in spite of censorship and pressure from the authorities is a long-standing Russian tradition: a wealth of experience has been accumulated, and it is very much in demand today.\n\nOne of the most vivid chapters in Ioffe’s book is called “The Hunt.” It is about women hunting for millionaires and about their coaching school, the Moscow Life Academy. Even though it describes the events of 2012 when Ioffe came to Moscow as a reporter, they also recall, unwittingly, the TV programs from the 1990s.\n\nIoffe believes that the “fairy-tale country” was submerged under authoritarianism waves. The feminist project failed because of men in power.\n\nIs this really so? And is it true that young Russian women dream exclusively of marrying a millionaire?\n\nI remember in the 1990s, some female students really did want to find a sugar daddy so they could live a glamorous life and write for fashion magazines.  In the 2000s, they thought about the benefits of having a rich husband to support their own creative projects.  Meanwhile, in recent years, many stopped thinking of marrying at altogether; instead, they are obsessed with their own projects and would like to pick a like-minded partner in the future. Their life strategy is completely at odds with the propaganda that actively promotes the patriarchal model of the family and the place of women in society.\n\nBut in Russia, propaganda and reality have long been moving apart from each other. A recent study on women in entrepreneurial life by Elena Rozhdestvenskaya, a professor at the Higher School of Economics, yielded unexpected results: a new group of women has emerged, consisting of executives and top managers, often the daughters and granddaughters of influential men. They have no need for rich husbands; they are ambitious and super professional, picking men who are convenient for them. They are transforming the traditional family structure, yet at the same time almost all of them have families and children. They do not express open solidarity with feminist ideas, yet they defend a feminine style of leadership and set up their own private clubs. This is a new type of modern Russian elite.\n\n“As for the future of feminism in Russia,” says Olga Zdravomyslova, “it is hard to say what it will be like. Perhaps young feminists will start all over again, disregarding the past. But it could be different.”\n\nIn the final chapters of the book, Ioffe bitterly concurs with her father’s words that “our homeland is a country without a future.” And yet her book does not leave an unequivocal impression on the reader. Precisely because of its unevenness, its incompleteness, its subjectivity, it is more likely (I would like to think) to encourage us to learn more about the lives of people living in a vast territory spanning nine time zones, and to hear their vibrant and very dissimilar, voices—just like the book by Francine de Plessix Gray did in its own time. At the meetings of the gender caucus of the Yabloko Party in Moscow, in university lecture halls, at artistic events in various cities, I encounter young women who speak passionately about the future of Russia, and the things that can already to be done today to achieve this vision, or what they have already been doing, here and now. Some of them are studying the history of feminism. And while listening to them, I believe in their success.\n\nTranslated by Antonina W.

    "description": "Vance appeared to joke when replying to a user sharing the rumored image: \"I always wear an undershirt in public to fight with my wife.\"",
    "fullText": "A photo shared online in December 2025 authentically showed U.S. Vice President JD Vance arguing with his wife, Usha Vance, in a restaurant.\n\nIn December 2025, an image circulated on social media purportedly showing U.S. Vice President JD Vance arguing with his wife, Usha Vance, in a restaurant.\n\nThe image appeared to show JD Vance wearing a white T-shirt and a stern expression while sitting across from Usha Vance. One Facebook user who shared it (archived) wrote:\n\nLooks like things are not so good in Republicanistan. Usha is a liberal. Always has been. Apparently they were having and [sic] argument loud enough to quiet the restaurant. Why is he wearing a tee shirt?\n\nThe image circulated elsewhere on Facebook and X (archived here and here). In short, it was fake.\n\nAfter Snopes initially published its story, YouTuber Keith Edwards reached out to confirm the image was a thumbnail he created for an October 2025 video, describing it as \"fake.\" Edwards told us he used the artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT to create the image.\n\nThe thumbnail matched the image circulating on social media. In both, the man wore the same facial expression and the woman was positioned the same way. A reverse image search did not lead us to any earlier version of the fabricated image.\n\nJD Vance himself appeared to support the conclusion that the image was fake in a Dec. 9 X post (archived), replying to a user who shared the image with a comment that seemed to poke fun at the rumor: \"I always wear an undershirt when I go out in public to have a fight loudly with my wife.\"\n\nI always wear an undershirt when I go out in public to have a fight loudly with my wife. https://t.co/LUivOsVv2u\n\n— JD Vance (@JDVance) December 9, 2025\n\nWe also ran the image through three AI-detection platforms: Hive, Sightengine and Image Whisperer. Sightengine estimated a 97% probability that the image was AI-generated, while Image Whisperer concluded with \"high confidence\" it was AI-generated.\n\nHive, however, flagged the image as \"not likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content.\" It's worth noting that these tools are not always accurate and their results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nPrior to Edwards' confirmation, the team at GetReal Security, which specializes in authenticating digital media, also analyzed the image for Snopes.\n\nHany Farid, co-founder of GetReal and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told us that the image's low quality made forensic analysis difficult. However, the team found \"biometric anomalies\" suggesting the image \"may be AI-generated or is simply a photo of someone that resembles [JD] Vance.\"\n\n\"In particular, the facial features in the image do not match contemporaneous images of Vance,\" Farid added. Contemporaneous images are photos taken around the same time that are used to verify another image's authenticity.\n\nMatthew Stamm, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Drexel University, told Snopes that he and his doctoral student analyzed the image to determine whether it was AI-generated, using a specialized forensic tool that detects subtle \"fingerprints\" left by generative AI. Stamm said the tool \"determined with roughly 95% confidence that it was unable to detect traces left by generative AI.\"\n\nHowever, he cautioned that this does not prove the image is real and cannot definitively rule out AI generation. Factors such as its size, low resolution and repeated sharing on social media made the analysis difficult, changing \"the quality of the forensic traces that we analyze, similar to how fingerprints at a crime scene might be smudged,\" Stamm explained.\n\nThe fabricated image spread online amid rumors of a rift in the Vances' marriage, which began to spread in October 2025. Photos of Usha Vance without her wedding ring taken the following month further fueled speculation.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson told USA Today in a Nov. 21 statement that Usha Vance \"is a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.\" Other publicly available Getty Images from November showed Usha Vance wearing her wedding ring.\n\nIn a Dec. 4 interview with NBC News, JD Vance said the couple's marriage is \"as strong as it's ever been.\"\n\nX (Formerly Twitter), 9 Dec. 2025, x.com/JDVance/status/1998459532977099256.

    "description": "Scientists used X-rays and CT scans to explore a mummified crocodile, uncovering incredible details about its last meal, and ancient Egyptian rituals.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAncient Egyptians regularly mummified crocodiles in elaborate ceremonies in dedication to their crocodile god Sobek.\n\nA study of one of these crocodiles reveals details about the animal’s death and the methods through which Ancient Egyptians captured these fearsome predators.\n\nUsing x-ray and CT-scanning technologies, archaeozoologists can now explore the insides of these animals, which, unlike human mummification, have their organs intact.\n\nTo uncover the mysteries of the past, scientists employ a wide variety of techniques to get at the truth. Climate scientists drill two-mile-long ice cores to glimpse Earth’s past climatic conditions. Paleontologists analyze sediment layers to visualize the physical timeline of past epochs. And while Egyptologists similarly deploy lots of state of the art archeological techniques, sometimes it’s best to just use a mummified crocodile stomach.\n\nThat’s exactly what researchers at the University of Manchester did with a 3,000-year-old, 7.2-foot-long crocodile corpse, kept at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and known simply as 2005.335. Although Ancient Egyptians typically removed organs when mummifying humans, crocodiles sacrificed to the crocodile god Sobek kept their innards intact, and this small deviation from tradition allows scientists in the 21st century to analyze the organs to unlock mysteries of this strange sacrificial ritual.\n\nTo preserve the specimen for future display, the research team deployed non-invasive techniques, such as x-rays and CT scanning, to catalog the contents of the crocodile’s stomach. Among the ancient gastronomic detritus, scientists found some usual suspects called gastroliths, which are small stones crocodiles regularly swallow to aid digestion.\n\nHowever, the scientists also found intact fish baited to a bronze hook. Because the time frame between the croc’s last meal and its death was so short—the gastroliths hadn’t reached the stomach yet—the crocodile was likely intentionally caught by Ancient Egyptians to be part of a sacrificial ceremony to Sobek.\n\n“Whereas earlier studies favored invasive techniques such as unwrapping and autopsy, 3D radiography provides the ability to see inside without damaging these important and fascinating artifacts,” University of Manchester archaeozoologist Lidija McKnight, co-author of a study published in the journal Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage, said in a press statement.\n\nWhile keeping the long-dead crocodilian intact, McKnight and her team also “virtually” recreated the bronze hook lodged in the specimen’s stomach for future museum displays. McKnight says that in the past Ancient Egyptians likely used hardened clay to create a mold and then poured molten metal over a charcoal fire to create the hook.\n\n“Despite the passing of several millennia between the production of the ancient fish hook and the modern replica, the casting process remains remarkably similar,” McKnight said in the press statement.\n\nAlthough 2005.335 met a grisly fate, crocodiles were actually revered in Ancient Egyptian society for their strength but also their displays of gentleness (especially with their young)—but perhaps they were too revered. Archeologists believe that this Nile-based culture, in which the crocodile was the top predator (besides humans, of course), likely bred the animals specifically for sacrificial purposes by “crocodile cults.” In the Egyptian town of Fayoum, which was the center of worship for Sobek, experts have uncovered thousands of mummified crocodiles, many of them babies.\n\nBut thanks to these long-ago sacrifices, the story behind these ancient mummified crocodiles is finally spilling its guts.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "On Air Force One, Donald Trump was surprised when a door flung open to smack the 79-year-old on his backside.\n\nThis happened on Tuesday night while the President was talking to reporters. Donald was on his way to Monroe County, Pennsylvania, at the time to deliver a speech. While the awkward moment was captured on tape, the President seemed to take it all with a grain of salt, having fun with it all.\n\n.@POTUS: \"You're going to have to take it easy with that thing. It's a government plane, but I like to take care of it.\"\n\nALWAYS WATCHING OUT FOR THE TAXPAYER! pic.twitter.com/i31QMF62XL\n\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 9, 2025\n\nWhat began as friendly banter with the press became a rather bizarre moment on the Presidential plane on Tuesday. Donald happened to be near the bathroom at the time before realizing someone was inside. The door happened to hit the President in the back.\n\nMembers of the media seemed to have a good chuckle over that, including the President, who told the person inside to “come on out.” The nameless person proceeded to close the door, perhaps out of fear of embarrassment or being identified.\n\nTuesday’s moment, while awkward, was one of the more light-hearted ones that we have seen involving Donald and the media. The President doesn’t seem to have a particularly healthy relationship with the press and has notably had very harsh responses to female reporters.

    "fullText": "Noni Madueke might reflect on the Champions League win at Club Brugge as a landmark night in his Arsenal career.\n\nThe 23-year-old scored two goals in Wednesday's 3-0 victory, including a stunning effort from 20 yards, with his all-action performance again showing he can be more than a rotation option for manager Mikel Arteta.\n\n\"An unbelievable goal,\" Arteta said. \"When you talk about individual quality and magic moments, that's it.\"\n\nMadueke has a tough task dislodging Arsenal's key player Bukayo Saka on the right wing, but against Club Brugge he offered a reminder of his talents as one of five players brought into the side after Saturday's defeat at Aston Villa.\n\nIn the summer, his £48.5m signing from Chelsea was questioned by some supporters but the England international won them round with some impressive performances before picking up a knee injury in September that kept him out for about a month.\n\nHe returned at the end of November and scored his first goal for Arsenal in the win over Bayern Munich in the Gunners' last Champions League match.\n\nWhen given the opportunity, he has demonstrated that his versatility and ability to beat a defender can be a key part of Arsenal's season.\n\n\"I think the bare minimum I need to give to my team is threat,\" Madueke told TNT Sports after the win in Bruges. \"Obviously trying to score and be as decisive as possible, that's the next level I need to get to in terms of being consistently decisive for club and country. I think I can reach that level.\n\n\"The first goal was really nice, second a tap-in but the first one was sweet. Delighted with the result.\n\n\"We're fighting on all fronts. I feel like we can win this competition and win the league - that has to be the aim. We're in a good place at the moment.\"",
