    "fullText": "This Warriors news leak about a Draymond Green for Giannis trade is hilarious originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors would be a thrilling landing spot in a trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo if the Milwaukee Bucks actually decide to deal their superstar.\n\nThe question would shift, then, to whether the Warriors have enough assets to land Antetokounmpo in a trade.\n\nWell, thanks to an insider report, we now know one player they'd trade: Draymond Green.\n\nThat's what Jake Fischer reported on Thursday:\n\n“The only player I think in the league that Golden State would be willing to move Draymond Green for would be Giannis Antetokounmpo. That’s the only player. Between him and Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski, all of a sudden Golden State probably does have an intriguing package if you're Milwaukee. But I don't think that they are going to be pushing Draymond's salary onto the table — or Jimmy Butler’s salary — for anyone short of him.”\n\nWe're not here to discuss whether that's a good enough package for Giannis.\n\nOh yeah, the Warriors would really trade a past-his-prime Draymond to acquire Giannis?\n\nSomeone involved with the Warriors' organization or a connected agency had to leak that information to Fischer. They had to tell him, \"Yeah, we wouldn't trade Draymond for 99% of the league, but Giannis, that's where we'd cave.\"\n\nSure, Green is a Golden State legend. But there are unequivocally more players in the league that he'd be worth trading for, too.\n\nIt's just funny to picture how this report came together. The whole news is that Draymond is available in an Antetokounmpo deal? Thanks for that, Captain Obvious (meaning the leak, not Fischer).\n\nThe Bucks would surely want to start a rebuild by acquiring an older forward who's great at doing the little things really well.\n\nThis one is just a little silly all around.\n\n3 Eastern Conference teams chasing after Anthony Davis trade\n\nPelicans' Derik Queen puts up crazy numbers only done in recent NBA history by LeBron James, Nikola Jokic\n\nRich Paul makes the LeBron James trade plans clear\n\nDesmond Bane offers $35,000 explanation for NBA Cup outburst",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMichigan has fired head coach Sherrone Moore for cause, per a report.\n\nESPN's Pete Thamel first reported the news on Wednesday afternoon. The news comes shortly after Michigan's early signing period, as Moore was just finishing up his second season with the Wolverines.\n\nBENDER:Sherrone Moore firing creates 4 major questions for Michigan\n\nAccording to the school, the firing comes amid allegations of an inappropriate relationship with a UM staffer.\n\nMichigan announces that Sherrone Moore has been fired for cause & school found “credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.”\n\n— Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) December 10, 2025\n\nUM athletic director released a statement after reports came out. Manuel added that More's conduct is a clear violation of university policy, and the school has \"zero tolerance\" for such behavior.\n\nStatement from University of Michigan Athletic Director Warde Manuel:\n\n“U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate…\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 10, 2025\n\nMoore had just finished his second season as Michigan's head coach, finishing with an 18-8 record. The Wolverines lost 27-9 to Ohio State to finish 9-3 on the season. Moore has been married to his wife, Kelli Moore since 2015. The couple shares three daughters together.\n\nBeyond his suspension earlier in the 2025 season, Moore had faced two prior penalties: a one-game ban for the 2023 season opener stemming from recruiting violations, and an outstanding one-game suspension tied to the sign-stealing investigation that was scheduled for the first game of the 2026 season.\n\nMORE: Who is Biff Poggi?

He was booked at 8:30 p.m., according to court records.\n\nSaline police chief Marlene Radzik confirmed to The News earlier Wednesday that nearby Pittsfield Township's police department was handling a complaint involving Moore. After 10 p.m. Wednesday, Pittsfield Township police confirmed it handled an assault investigation, without naming Moore. Police said the investigation began around 4:10 p.m., minutes before UM announced Moore's firing.\n\nIn a statement to the media, Pittsfield police chief Patrick Gray stated that \"the incident does not appear to be random in nature, and there appears to be no ongoing threat to the community.\"\n\nHe added that an investigation is ongoing. Saline, Mich. lies about 9.5 miles south of Ann Arbor.\n\nMORE:Michigan's best coaching replacements for Sherrone Moore\n\nFiring him for cause means the school has a legitimate reason to dismiss Moore. In this case, an inappropriate relationship with a staff member likely resulted in a breach of contract, allowing the school to terminate him without paying a buyout.\n\nThere are various clauses within a head coach's contract that subject coaches to firing for cause. Oftentimes, the coach is contractually obligated to represent the university with high standards. Michigan State fire Mel Tucker in 2023 after an investigation revealed that he sexually assaulted a Title IX advocate, Brenda Tracy, who previously spoke to the MSU football program. The Spartans had to vacate 14 wins under Tucker earlier this year.\n\nThere is a chance that firing Moore for cause means the school would not have to pay him his buyout of $13,897,916.\n\nMichigan's interim head coach is former Charlotte head coach Biff Poggi. The longtime Michigan staffer had coached under Jim Harbaugh and re-joined Moore's staff midseason.\n\nWhen Moore was suspended earlier in the 2025 season, Poggi took over for two games and led the Wolverines to a 2-0 record. Combined with his tenure at Charlotte, Poggi has an 8-16 career record as a head coach.\n\nThe Wolverines are set to take on Texas in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31.\n\nRevisiting Michigan's sign-stealing scandal\n\nJim Harbaugh's timeline of trouble at Michigan\n\nExplaining NCAA's Jim Harbaugh show-cause penalty\n\nIn two years as Michigan head coach, Moore finished with a record of 18-8. He was 16-8 in his two-year tenure as the official head coach, with two additional wins coming as acting head coach when Jim Harbaugh was suspended.\n\nHe led the Wolverines to an 8-5 record (5-4 Big Ten) in his first full season, a campaign defined by two monumental victories. Moore secured a fourth consecutive win over No. 2 Ohio State in Columbus and followed it by defeating Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl. Michigan also won all four of its rivalry trophy games that year.\n\nIn 2025, Michigan finished the regular season 9-3 and will face Texas in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31. The Wolverines’ three losses all came against ranked opponents — No. 18 Oklahoma, No. 16 USC and No. 1 Ohio State — and they managed just two total touchdowns across those games.\n\nThis is a breaking news story that will be updated.",

    "fullText": "The San Antonio Spurs are headed to the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, 132-119, on Wednesday, and might have Victor Wembanyama back in the lineup for the big tournament matchup. Following the team’s quarterfinal victory over the Lakers on Wednesday, Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson to reporters that Wemby might be ready to make his return from injury over the weekend.\n\n“Very much so,” coach Johnson said. “He had a really good day today. He had a very intense day this morning, and we’ll have to see how he responds or reacts (Thursday).”\n\nWemby went through an intense workout on Wednesday morning and then worked out again during pregame warmups before the Lakers game. He was able to get through that workout without any extra protection on his strained calf, according to Johnson.\n\nWembanyama has been sidelined with his calf strain and hasn’t played since Nov. 16. However, the Spurs have been able to get through this stretch and post a 9-3 record without their All-Star big man and defensive anchor. Wemby’s potential return couldn’t come at a better time as the Spurs will face the defending NBA Champion Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nIn Wembanyama's absence, other players like last season's Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle have had to step up even more to help carry the load. In Wednesday's win over the Lakers, Castle scored 30 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and dished 6 assists. De'Aaron Fox chipped in with 20 points, and Keldon Johnson scored 17 off the bench.\n\n“I think Victor would tell you we have a deep team, and we rely upon playing together as a team,” Johnson said. “He may be the biggest puzzle piece, but he needs everybody else to complete the puzzle.”\n\nAlthough Wemby has missed half of San Antonio’s 24 games this season, the Spurs are 17-7 overall and currently fifth in the Western Conference. When Wembanyama is on the court, he’s been as dominant as ever this season, averaging career-highs of 26.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, along with 3.6 blocks.\n\nSan Antonio and OKC square off in the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday, Dec. 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The NBA Cup championship game will be played on Dec. 16 in Las Vegas.",

    "description": "Both parties walked out of court together and expressed positivity",
    "fullText": "I’m pleased to say we have positively settled this matter.\n\nRepresenting 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports in its antitrust lawsuit against NASCAR, lead attorney Jeffrey Kessler made the announcement to Judge Kenneth D. Bell at 10:03 a.m. in the Potter Courtroom on the second floor of the Western District of North Carolina.\n\nThere was still more work to be done to formalize the end of the trial, however.\n\nEverything you need to know about the NASCAR, 23XI and Front Row antitrust trial\n\nThis statement was just verbalized and both parties’ representatives needed to go back to a separate room to type out a written settlement to codify the agreed upon principles. Judge Bell said he would remain on the bench ‘to encourage your progress.’\n\nDay nine of the trial was scheduled to begin at 8:30 but the parties had arrived much earlier. When Judge Bell arrived to the Potter Courtroom, he dismissed the jury and told them he needed to ‘sacrifice an hour of your time to hopefully save several hours more’ of it.\n\nAt the time, there weren’t even monitors in the court room like there had been for every other day of the trial, a signal that neither party was prepared to continue witness examination.\n\nJudge Bell returned from his chamber at 9:58 a.m.\n\n\"Do you have everyone you need to continue your examination?\"\n\nA lawyer said, ‘let me see if I can wrangle Mr. Kessler,’ to which Bell dryly said, ‘an indispensable man.’\n\nAt this point, 23XI co-owners Michael Jordan, Denny Hamlin and Curtis Polk emerged from their holding room, quite the sight because the latter would not be allowed in the room if examinations were truly going to continue.\n\nPolk was a witness that had not testified yet and federal rules prevent his attending the proceedings until he testified. Thus, Judge Bell asked the defendants (NASCAR) if they ‘had objections’ to Polk being in the room.\n\n“We do not, your honor,” said NASCAR attorney Lawrence Buterman, who had started the discovery process by ‘throwing documents’ Polk during a deposition and ended it with handshakes.\n\nButerman shook hands with Jordan while NASCAR CEO Jim France personal lawyer John E. Stephenson dapped with the NBA legend.\n\nThis is where Kessler appeared and told Judge Bell that he ‘needed a moment to see if we can close the loop’ and ‘get you some news.’  Kessler reappeared and told the Judge the news that the settlement was being drafted.\n\nNASCAR, 23XI and FRM release joint statement as settlement is reached\n\n“As so happens, an hour turns into two but we indeed saved you a great deal of time. This trial has been settled, meaning, it’s over.”\n\nBell went on to tell the jury that he recognizes that it could be ‘dissatisfying’ to spend all this time listening to testimony and consuming evidence without the chance to render a decision. However, Judge Bell said, the jury should be proud because they accomplished through their attentiveness what ‘His Honor’ could not accomplish during two days of court overseen settlement mediation.\n\nHe told the jury that he recognized they were attentive. ‘You knew the details of this case and I commend you for that.’\n\n\"Thank you for your hard work. Congratulations to both parties and I mean that. I wish we could have done this months ago. … I think this will be great for the entity of NASCAR, the NASCAR industry, the teams, the drivers, and as you have so often said yourselves, ultimately the fans.\"\n\nBoth parties thanked the judge and court was dismissed. After 14 months, 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports v NASCAR ended with a settlement.\n\nThe agreement itself was not immediately publicized but the Associated Press had the provisional details that –\n\nTeams will now share international revenue for the first time The three-strike veto rule removed from the 2025 agreement is back as a five-strike rule Teams get a third of revenue from Intellectual Property Terms to be renegotiated with each media rights agreement 23XI and FRM has had their charters returned to them\n\nIn other words, charters are now franchises that cannot be taken away from teams and are effectively equivalent to stick-and-ball teams. Unlike stick-and-ball teams, however, the teams do not have equity in NASCAR.\n\nThe France family will continue to operate NASCAR has it has done every year since its inception in 1948.\n\n23XI and Front Row secured evergreen charters, which immediately increases enterprise value, to no cost of NASCAR while the Frances do not get put in a position to have to sell tracks or divest of its interests, which could have happened had they lost.\n\nNASCAR has scheduled a call on Thursday with the non-party teams to discuss implementation and ratification of the new agreement, which will need to be signed by all parties.\n\nWith 30 minutes of court dismissing, all parties walked out of the Charles R. Jonas Federal Court House together.\n\n“I’m pleased to say the parties have positively settled this matter in a way that will benefit the industry going forward,” said Kessler on the court house steps.\n\nButerman was the next to speak.\n\n“One of the key issues here for NASCAR has always been the preservation of the charter system,\" Buterman said. \"And we are thrilled that through this system we get to preserve the charter system for the teams and stakeholders while at the same time providing NASCAR with the flexibility to run the sport in the best interest of all of the shareholders.”\n\n“I’ve said this from Day 1: Only way this sport is going to grow is we have to find some synergy between the two entities, and I think we’ve gotten to that point,” Jordan said. “Unfortunately, it took 16 months to get here, but I think, level heads got us to this point to where we can actually work together and grow this sport. I’m very proud about that. And I think (France) feels the same.”\n\nPermanent charters \nNASCAR's continued leadership \nMoving the sport together pic.twitter.com/A9ZGLr1CmP\n\n— Matt Weaver (@MattWeaverRA) December 11, 2025\n\n“We can get back to focusing on what we really love, and that’s racing,” France said. “We spent a lot of time not really focused on that as much as we need to be. So, I feel like we’ve made a very good decision here together and we have a big opportunity to continue growing the sport.”\n\nJordan was asked what eventually forced a settlement.\n\n“Level heads,” said Jordan, getting a laugh from everyone on both sides on the steps. “In all honesty, when you get to the finish line sometimes, you have to think, not just about yourself but the sport as a whole.\n\n“I think both parties got to that point and we realized we have an opportunity to do this, so we dove in and actually did it. Unfortunately, it took us this long, but we got there and that’s all that matters.\n\nJordan was asked if he felt like all of this was worth it in the end.\n\n“Well, both parties feel like it was worth it,” he said.\n\nAt this point, Stephenson was shaking his head, an endorsement from the France side.\n\n“We understand that we had to work together,” Jordan continued. Compromise in every negotiation is one of the toughest things to do. I think we both compromised on our agendas and we both came to the conclusion that this is better for the sport.”\n\nThat was the end of press conference.\n\nStephenson said ‘let’s go race’ and lead NASCAR attorney Chris Yates said ‘go to Bowman Gray’ and ‘go to Daytona.’ Kessler said ‘everyone show up to the tracks.’\n\n“I feel like everything within this settlement is going to grow this sport and it's going to be better for everyone, there's no doubt about.\"\n\nChildress blindsided, France evasive in NASCAR trial\n\n23XI, Front Row attorney Danielle Williams, even after the settlement was announced, still wanted to discuss in the court the source of the Bobby Hillin news and the documents. Judge Bell said they would work on that later.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The ex-head football coach at the University of Michigan remained in jail on Thursday, a day after the university fired him \"with cause, effective immediately\".\n\nThe university said an investigation found \"credible evidence\" coach Sherrone Moore had \"engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member\".\n\nThe same day he was fired, Mr Moore was detained by police in a nearby suburb for alleged assault, according to police.\n\nThe termination and detention represent the latest shakeup in the billion-dollar world of college sports, after Lane Kiffin announced last week that he was leaving the University of Mississippi to coach at Louisiana State University under a $91m contract.\n\nLike coach Kiffin's departure, Mr Moore's exit from the team occurred on the eve of the College Football Playoff and a slate of championship games referred to as bowl games.\n\nIn his second year as head coach, Mr Moore was due to lead the Michigan Wolverines in a storied rivalry against the University of Texas on 31 December in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl.\n\nThe school's athletic director, Warde Manuel, said in the statement provided to the BBC that Mr Moore's alleged inappropriate relationship \"constitutes a clear violation of university policy\", and the school \"maintains zero tolerance for such behavior\".\n\nMr Moore, 39, will be replaced by Biff Poggi, the team's associate head coach.\n\nAccording to police in Pittsfield Township, about 15 minutes from the university in Ann Arbor, officers responded at 16:10 EST (21:10 GMT) on Wednesday to investigate reports of an alleged assault.\n\nPolice from the neighbouring city of Saline then \"assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore\", a statement from Saline police said, according to ESPN.\n\n\"Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.\"\n\nPittsfield police said a suspect was \"lodged\" at a Washtenaw County jail while prosecutors reviewed charges.\n\nDetails of the alleged inappropriate relationship and assault were not released.\n\nMr Moore could not be reached for comment. Police said he remained in custody on Thursday, and family members did not respond to inquiries from the BBC.\n\nMr Moore joined the Michigan Wolverines in 2018 as a tight-end coach. He became acting head coach in the 2023 season for three games, while then-head coach Jim Harbaugh was under suspension.\n\nMr Moore won each of the three games and was officially made head coach after Mr Harbaugh left to coach in the NFL.",

    "fullText": "The NCAA Transfer Portal doesn’t officially open for another three weeks, but that hasn’t stopped hundreds of players from announcing their intentions to enter.\n\nOfficially, players can be entered into the portal beginning January 2, and will have a two-week window until January 15 to get in. For players who are playing in the College Football Playoff beyond those dates, they’ll have a five-day window after their team’s final game to get in as well.\n\nMore than 300 players have already expressed their plans to enter the portal, and On3’s rankings team has graded the entrants as of Dec. 11. Last year, more than 4,900 FBS players — including walk-ons — entered their name in the portal between the two windows.\n\nNow with only one window, we could see that number dwindle some, or it could be a mad dash to get into college football’s version of free agency. Here are the top 10 players currently expected to enter next month:\n\nLeavitt entered the 2025 season as a darkhorse Heisman candidate after a breakout campaign as a redshirt freshman, where he completed nearly 62 percent of his passes for 2,885 yards and 24 touchdowns to just six interceptions. He was riddled by injuries though, missing the team’s final five regular-season games. Last month, On3’s Steve Wiltfong and Pete Nakos reported Leavitt was being shopped around to other programs by his representatives, and he didn’t attend the team’s end-of-season banquet over the weekend.\n\nIn spite of very up-and-down quarterback play during his two seasons with the Spartans, Marsh established himself as one of the Big Ten’s premier receivers. In his debut campaign, Marsh tallied 41 catches for 649 yards and three touchdowns. His receiving yards and receptions stand as the most by a true freshman in school history. This year, he hauled in 59 catches, totaling 662 yards and six touchdowns. With two years of eligibility left, he’ll be one of the most sought-after players in the portal.\n\nCarter’s winding career in Knoxville looks to officially be over after two seasons. An early commit during his senior year to the Vols, Carter flirted with other programs ahead of Signing Day in 2023, but did officially ink with Tennessee. He quickly made his presence felt as a freshman, totaling 38 tackles, three tackles for loss and an interception. But issues began to pop up last offseason, and he was nearly dismissed from the team prior to fall camp. He appeared in nine games as a sophomore in a significantly reduced role, and will be looking for a fresh start elsewhere.\n\nA late addition to Notre Dame’s 2023 class, Minchey sat behind Sam Hartman and Riley Leonard his first two seasons with the program. This spring and into the fall, he battled with redshirt freshman CJ Carr for the starting job, with Carr ultimately getting the nod. During his three years in South Bend, Minchey completed 23 of 29 passes for 212 yards and will be one of the more intriguing quarterback options in the portal come January.\n\nDespite coming from the MAC, Trick is the highest-rated pass-rusher currently in the portal. Across his last two seasons, he has appeared in 27 games for the RedHawks, totaling 96 tackles, 18 tackles for loss and 13 sacks. The 6-foot-4, 245-pounder has also been a turnover machine with three forced fumbles and was named first-team All-MAC this year.\n\nA native of Huntington Beach (Calif.), Brown burst onto the scene this fall after missing most of his career due to injury. Fully healthy this season, he caught 71 passes for 1,085 yards and 11 touchdowns while averaging better than 108 yards per contest. The 6-foot, 185-pounder is another who will be highly coveted as a plug-and-play wideout.\n\nDavis joined the Tigers late in the 2025 cycle, flipping from SEC rival Kentucky to Missouri just days before National Signing Day. Rivals ranked him as the country’s No. 7 running back in the class, and he showed why in small spurts as a true freshman. While playing behind All-American Ahmad Hardy and standout Jamal Roberts, he rushed 34 times for 200 yards and a pair of touchdowns. The Cleveland product will have all four years of eligibility remaining after only playing in three games.\n\nDel Grande, a native of Pennsylvania, developed into a three-year starter at left tackle and earned a preseason All-Sun Belt selection in 2025. As a sophomore, in 2024, he helped anchor a unit that led the Sun Belt in fewest sacks allowed (15), a mark which ranked tied for 17th in the NCAA FBS.\n\nDickens started his career at Georgia Tech, but transferred to play for the Flames ahead of last season. In his lone year in Lynchburg, he rushed for 1,339 yards and 16 touchdowns on just 229 carries, averaging 5.8 yards per attempt. His 17 total scores ranked No. 4 nationally, while his rushing average (121.9 YPG) was third-best in the country. The second-team All-CUSA has two years of eligibility left.\n\nA three-year starter at left tackle for the Huskies, Malcore led a unit that paved the way for one of the best rushing offenses in the country in 2024 and 2025. In total, he started 32 games during his time at NIU and projects as a plug-and-play tackle for teams seeking experience along the offensive line this fall.\n\n+ Perry Thompson (No. 13) – The Auburn wide receiver showed up on The Plains with high hopes, but struggled to carve out a significant role behind Eric Singleton, Cam Coleman and Malcolm Simmons. Thompson hauled in 17 passes for 154 yards this season and will have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\n+ CJ Baxter Jr. (No. 14) – A former five-star, Baxter never quite rebounded from the ACL injury he suffered at the beginning of his sophomore season 2024. As a true freshman the year prior, he accounted for 815 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns, but this year he carried just 54 times for 196 yards. The Florida native will be one to watch for a number of Sunshine State programs.\n\n+ Dylan Edwards (No. 15) – Edwards’ journey continues after playing at both Kansas State and Colorado during his first three seasons. An all-purpose weapon, he accounted for nearly 700 yards and seven touchdowns as a sopho\n\n+ Jerrick Gibson (No. 20) – Another highly touted back coming from the Longhorns, Gibson spent two seasons in Austin where he struggled to break through on the depth chart. He played in all 15 games as a freshman after Baxter’s injury, totaling 402 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns. But he only played in four games as a sophomore, rushing for 152 yards before leaving the program in October to preserve his redshirt.\n\n+ Derek Williams (No. 27) – The third notable Texas entrant on the list, Williams appeared in 29 games across his three years on the Forty Acres, registering 76 tackles, two tackles for loss and an interception. He had a breakout season as a true freshman in 2023 with 42 tackles, but suffered a season-ending injury the following year and only appeared in four games in 2024.\n\nHe returned in 2025, but primarily served as a backup to senior Michael Taaffe, a second-team All-American last season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJust one day after the conclusion of the 2025 MLB Winter Meetings, multiple relievers found new homes for 2026 and beyond.\n\nThat included left-hander Hoby Milner, as according to Michael Cerami of Bleacher Nation, Miler and the Chicago Cubs are in agreement on a contract. The length and salary of the contract is not yet known.\n\nMilner seemed like he was destined to head to Chicago prior to the 2025 season. The Cubs were in need of left-handed bullpen help and with Milner's background in Milwaukee with current manager Craig Counsell, a pairing of the two sides made perfect sense. That ultimately didn't happen, and Milner headed to Texas to pitch for the Rangers last season.\n\nThe version of Milner that Chicago will be getting is an intriguing question. Is it the 1.82 ERA and 1.7 WAR in 2023? Or is it the -0.6 WAR each of the previous two seasons with a 3.84 ERA being the lowest of those respective seasons? The Cubs obviously hope it is the 2023 version, but the previous two seasons have not indicated that the old version will be returning.\n\nChicago is expected to remain in the market for bullpen arms, a group that was a strength down the stretch last season.\n\nMore MLB: Cubs predicted to trade for $6.5 million All-Star ace to create 1-2 punch with Shota Imanaga",

    "fullText": "Alexander Volkanovski hasn't given up on his goal of becoming a two-division UFC champion.\n\nIn his first reign as UFC featherweight champion, Volkanovski (27-4 MMA, 14-3 UFC) fell short twice in lightweight title fights against Islam Makhachev. After getting knocked out by Makhachev in their rematch at UFC 294, Volkanovski went on to lose his featherweight title to Ilia Topuria at UFC 298.\n\nHowever, Volkanovski found himself right back in the title picture when Topuria relinquished his belt, and he was given an opportunity to fight for the vacant title against Diego Lopes at UFC 314. Volkanovski beat Lopes (27-7 MMA, 6-2 UFC), and now the pair will run things back in the UFC 325 headliner on Feb. 1 at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney (Paramount+).\n\n\"I'd love to rematch and get them wins back, like Islam Makhachev or Ilia Topuria, but I'm pretty real with it,\" Volkanovski said in an interview with 10 News. \"I understand I can't just call for champ-champ fight right now. I know I've got work to do in my division. Being a champion is a responsibility, and I take that seriously. I know I've got guys in my division, and I don't want to hold up the division.\n\n\"So, I'm going to do what I need to do and then you never know, maybe after what I've said I plan on doing in Sydney, Feb. 1, go do that, and then maybe have the turnaround and then get another victory over an undefeated guy, maybe I think that's fair enough to be calling for maybe a champ-champ fight then.\"\n\nVolkanovski, 37, assures he still has plenty of fight left in him.\n\n\"I'm seeing that everywhere, as well. I don't know where that came from,\" Volkanovski said on retirement rumors. \"No, it hasn't been planned to be my last fight. So, you don't need to really worry about that. I think you're just going to take it as it goes from here on, but there's definitely no plans of that.\n\n\"My plans are going out there, not taking too much damage, really setting a statement, and be really impressive in there and maybe get a quick turnaround. Then we'll see what happens from there. You've got a couple of other guys like Movsar (Evloev) and Lerone Murphy, they're undefeated. For the legacy, they look like they might be pretty good, as well.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Alexander Volkanovski still has UFC champ-champ status on his mind",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLong before Jalen Brunson, the New York Knicks swung and missed on countless attempts to lure another superstar to the Big Apple. The Carmelo Anthony-Amar’e Stoudemire days were long gone, and the Kristaps Porzingis era never truly took off.\n\nBack in 2019, the Knicks had a perfect opportunity to make a statement. Kevin Durant was going to be a free agent, and the open secret around the league was that he wanted to move to New York City, where his company had its headquarters.\n\nWith that in mind, Knicks owner James Dolan made sure to get his best people on the job. As revealed by investigative journalist Pablo Torre on his “Pablo Torre Finds Out” podcast, the Knicks actually hired the Wu-Tang Clan to record a recruiting song and video to get the future Hall of Famer on the team.\n\nWu-Tang Clan founding member Method Man confirmed that the legendary hip-hop band was gladly on board with the idea, since they knew Durant wanted to be in New York and they’re all Knicks fans:\n\n“I don’t remember the track, but I remember we shot a visual for it,” Method Man said. \"We really wanted KD to come, and I knew that KD wanted to come to New York. He just wasn't clear on where he wanted to go.\"\n\nThe video, dubbed  \"The Multi-Million Dollar Wu-Tang Clan Music Video Meant for One Person,” showed Wu-Tang Clan members wearing Durant’s Knicks jersey, and it featured an epilogue in which several members of the band made their pitches to lure the two-time NBA champion to Madison Square Garden.\n\nDurant ultimately headed to New York, but he signed with the Brooklyn Nets instead. He teamed up with Kyrie Irving and hoped to take the Eastern Conference by storm, but it didn’t take long before that team imploded.\n\nDespite having a plethora of All-Stars along the way, such as James Harden and then Ben Simmons, injuries and their dysfunctional nature ultimately doomed the Nets, and they’re still trying to work their way back up.\n\nAs for the Knicks, they wound up trading for Jalen Brunson a couple of years later. He’s now become the face of the franchise, and with fellow Villanova stars Mikal Bridges and Josh Hart, plus Karl-Anthony Towns and OG Anunoby, they have one of the strongest teams in the East.\n\nDurant, on the other hand, is now on his third team after leaving Golden State, and he has yet to return to the NBA Finals.",

    "fullText": "A far cry from hand-scrawled letters to Santa, on graphic design platform Canva users have created a whopping 1.4m Christmas wishlist presentations\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nTwas three weeks before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, except for my 13-year-old daughter, who emerged from her lair with a level of vim uncommon in daylight hours.\n\nAs she made her approach with laptop aglow, her droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow. It then became apparent that I was about to become the audience (some may say “victim”) of a recent cultural phenomenon: the Christmas wishlist slideshow.\n\nGraphic design platform Canva seems to be the tool of choice for many teenagers. Canva say the first Christmas wishlist template was added to their library in 2019. Since 2022, people have created more than 3.35m Christmas wishlist designs. Presentation-style wishlists have jumped 61% between 2024 and 2025, totalling 1.4m. Social media is awash with videos of exuberant adolescents in expensive sweatsuits making family presentations on huge TVs, along with countless tutorials on how to make them “aesthetic” – a word I never tire of reminding my children is a noun, not an adjective.\n\nSuffice to say it was not visions of sugar plums that had been dancing in my daughter’s head. Instead, I was treated to an initial collage of brands and stores that she holds in mysterious esteem, followed by a series of categorised slides covering the teenage perennials: clothes, jewellery, decor, beauty products and, thankfully, some books. While her slideshow featured images, “inspo” and prices, she refrained from the vulgarity of hyperlinks, which, judging by the online evidence, are a common addition. And, I guess, could be handy.\n\nIn my rigorous and highly scientific research (read: texting every parent in my contacts list) it was revealed that girls are the main perpetrators, usually embracing this nouveau custom in their late tweens before growing out of it a few years later. Many who were on the receiving end of these pitches appreciated the initiative and practicality, while at the same time lamenting the creep of bland online “get ready with me” and “unboxing” tropes into family traditions. As one friend, whose two boys had never subjected her to the experience, put it – it sounds a bit like people who spend too much time in office mode, then plan their camping holiday meals in an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nEfficient? Certainly. But is it as adorable as the hand-scrawled, misspelled and glitter-smeared entreaties for Santa’s benevolence we knew and loved? Not quite. But as those sanguine mementoes of her innocence gather dust in a drawer somewhere, I was surprised to appreciate the thought, effort and moderation she applied to her newfangled approach. She even added some “dupe” options “as a backup”. Well played, kid.\n\nWhile it’s hard to feel much seasonal magic emanating from a template-built pitch deck, there’s no denying it beats the look of thinly veiled disappointment when your best attempts fall flat. As my cousin said: “There are times in parenting when you just have to admit defeat and play by the rules of the new guard. God knows there’s only so much pity one can take from their teenager!”\n\nArmed with a mood board of colour palettes, preferred necklines, coveted cosmetics and (weep) a teddy bear, I told her, with confidence, it all looked feasible. Her eyes – how they twinkled! Her dimples, how merry!\n\nAnd there it was anew, that joy parents live for. Now, go to bed, please.",

    "title": "Sanitizing HTTP/1: a technical deep dive into HAProxy's HTX abstraction layer",
    "description": "HTX acts as the interface between HAProxy’s low-level parsing and version-conversion logic, the HTTP multiplexers, and the application layer.",
    "fullText": "HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol where the message framing is mixed with its semantics, making it easy to parse incorrectly. The boundaries between messages are very weak because there is no clear delimiter between them. Thus, HTTP/1.1 parsers are especially vulnerable to request smuggling attacks.\n\nIn older HAProxy versions, HTTP/1.1 parsing was performed \"in-place\" on top of the raw TCP data. It was not an issue while connection keep-alive and massive header manipulations were not implemented/supported. However, when reusing connections to process several requests and adding more and more header manipulations (it is not uncommon to see configurations with hundreds of http-request rules), performance and security became concerns. In addition, supporting HTTP/2 raised compatibility challenges between both protocols, especially around the ability to transcode one version into another.\n\nTo be performant, secure, and future-proof, a new approach had to be envisioned. This is what we achieved by using our own internal HTTP representation, called the HTX.\n\nHTX is the internal name for the HTTP abstraction layer in HAProxy. It serves as the interface between the low-level layers of HAProxy, particularly the one responsible for parsing and converting different HTTP versions, the HTTP multiplexers, and the application part.  It standardizes the representation of messages between the different versions of HTTP.\n\nThanks to its design, almost all attacks that have appeared on HTTP/1 since the arrival of HTX have had no effect on HAProxy.\n\nOriginally, HAProxy was a TCP proxy and L4 load balancer. The HTTP/1 processing was added on top of it to be light, handle one request per connection, and only perform a few modifications. Over time, the trend has changed, and using HAProxy as an HTTP/1 proxy/load balancer has become the main usage, with more complex configurations and increasingly expensive HTTP processing.\n\nTo protect HAProxy and servers behind it from attacks against the HTTP/1.1 protocol, costly and complex manipulations were mandatory, making processing even more expensive and the maintenance harder. The limits of the pre-HTX model were reached, mainly because of its design:\n\nWe directly received HTTP/1 from the socket into a buffer, and on output, we directly emitted this buffer to another socket.\n\nThe buffer therefore contained requests with all their flaws and variations (extra spaces, etc). The start and end of headers were indexed on the fly, and the various analyzers had to account for all possible variations (upper/lower case header names, spaces after the :, spaces at the end of the line, lone line feeds (LF) instead of carriage return line feed (CRLF), forbidden characters).\n\nRewriting a header required anticipating the change in size (up or down), and potentially deleting an eventual CR and an LF if a header was deleted, or inserting one if a header was added. These modifications also required updating the header index so that subsequent analyzers remained well synchronized. Some rewrites could insert CRLFs haphazardly (\"hacks\"), resulting in headers not being detected by subsequent stages because they were not indexed. The same applied to checks.\n\nData brought up as chunks appeared in raw format with the chunk, including optional extensions, so it was not possible to perform simple string search processing without having to account for chunking. This is notably why the http-buffer-request directive only processed the first chunk.\n\nFor very light and historical uses (with minimal header consideration, a model closer to early HTTP/1.0), this operation was relatively optimal since everything received was sent back with very little analysis.\n\nWith the arrival of keep-alive, which required parsing many headers, performing many more checks (Content-Length vs. Transfer-Encoding, host vs. authority, connection, upgrade, etc.), and making even more changes (adaptation between close vs. keep-alive sides), the simplicity of the original model became a liability. All advanced parsing work had to be redone at each processing stage, often multiple times per request and response.\n\nWith the arrival of HTTP/2, HAProxy was faced with a completely different paradigm. A text-based protocol with no real framing for HTTP/1 against a binary-based protocol with a well-defined framing for HTTP/2. The main challenge was to find a way to add HTTP/2 support while making it compatible with the HTTP processing stack of HAProxy.\n\nThe HTTP/2 support was originally implemented as a protocol conversion layer between internal HTTP/1 and external HTTP/2. However, this raised several security issues due to the ambiguities of this conversion. But this also came with an unfortunate extra cost. The model was as follows:\n\nOn input, a block of HTTP/2 data was received and decoded. HEADERS frames were decompressed via the HPACK algorithm and produced a list of headers as (name, value) pairs. This list was then used to fabricate an HTTP/1.1 request by combining the method, URI, and adding the headers with : after the names and CRLFs after the values. This already posed several problems, because H2 is binary-transparent, meaning it is technically possible to encode : and CRLF in field values, making header injection possible if not enough care was taken.\n\nThe reconstructed URL was generally an absolute URL because the elements provided by the client (method, scheme, authority, path) were concatenated, and URL matchings in the configurations no longer worked (e.g., url_beg/static).\n\nData received in DATA frames resulted in HTTP chunks if the Content-Length was not announced. Similarly, it was difficult to analyze request chunks when needed (e.g., impossible to perform state modifications in HTTP/2 on the stats page, which used POST).\n\nOn output, the HTTP/2 converter had to re-parse HTTP/1.1 headers to fabricate a HEADERS frame. The parser used was simpler because it was assumed that HAProxy could be trusted to send valid protocol, but this caused many problems with error messages (errorfiles), responses forged in Lua, and the cache, which could sometimes store content that had undergone few protocol checks. Furthermore, to read the data, the parser also had to account for chunking and emit a DATA frame for each chunk. As a result, an HTTP/1 response sent back over HTTP/2 had to be parsed twice: once by the HTTP/1 parser for analysis, and a second time by the HTTP/1 parser integrated into the HTTP/2 converter.\n\nThe HTTP/2 converter also had to infer the correct operating mode for the response based on the Connection header and the announced HTTP version (HTTP/1.0 vs HTTP/1.1). It also struggled with edge cases involving Transfer-Encoding combined with Content-Length, as well as cases with no announced length where closing the server-side connection signaled the end of the response. Trailers were not supported because they were too risky to implement in this conversion model.\n\nHTTP/2 was not implemented on the server side because of the increase in special cases to handle and the difficulty in converting these responses into valid HTTP/1. Furthermore, it quickly became clear that with this model, it was impossible to maintain a correct level of performance by doing end-to-end H2 because it required four conversions for each exchange.\n\nThe \"legacy\" model having shown its limits, we logically decided to undertake a transition towards a more rational model. Continuing to base all internal operations on HTTP/1 was clearly a hindrance to the adoption of HTTP/2 and any other future versions of HTTP. The HTX was born from this thinking: to achieve a common internal representation for all current or future versions of HTTP.\n\nIf we take the previous example, here is how it happens today to transmit a request from an H2 client to an HTTP/1.1 server:\n\nIf we look more closely at what happens on the H2-to-HTX conversion side, we now obtain a structured message that has nothing to do with the previous HTTP/1 version:\n\nIt is at the moment of sending the request to the server that the conversion to HTTP/1.1 occurs, and this is done using standardized information:\n\nThe HTX is a structured representation of an HTTP message, intended to serve as a common foundation for all versions of HTTP within HAProxy. Internally, an HTX message is stored in a buffer. It consists of a part containing information about the message, the metadata, followed by a set of blocks containing a portion of the message resulting from parsing. This eliminates formatting differences tied to specific HTTP versions and standardizes the data. For example, header names are stored in lowercase, and spaces at the beginning and end of header values are removed, as are CRLFs at the end of the header.\n\nBecause an HTX structure is limited to the size of a buffer, only part of a large HTTP message may be present in HTX at any one time. An HTX message can be thought of as a pipe: as parsing progresses, new blocks are appended; HAProxy processes them (header rewriting, body compression, etc.); and they are then removed on the output side to be formatted and sent to the remote peer.\n\nHTX blocks are stored in a contiguous memory area, an array of blocks. Each block is divided into two parts. The first part, the block index, contains information related to the block: its type, its size, and the address of its content in the array. These indexes are stored starting from the end of the block array. The second part, meanwhile, contains the block data and is stored starting from the beginning of the array.\n\nThe block indexes remain ordered and stored linearly. We use a positive position to identify a block index. This position can then be converted into an address relative to the beginning of the block array.\n\n\"head\" is the position of the oldest block index\n\nThe part corresponding to the block data is a memory space that can \"wrap\" and is located at the beginning of the block array. The block data is not directly accessible; one must go through the index of the corresponding block to know the address of its data, relative to the beginning of the block array.\n\nWhen the free space between the index area and the data area is too small to store the data of a new block, we restart from the beginning to find free space. The advantage of managing block data as a circular memory area is to optimize the use of available space when blocks are manipulated — for example, when a header is deleted — or when the blocks are simply consumed to be formatted and sent to the remote peer.\n\nHowever, this sometimes requires a defragmentation step when the distribution of blocks becomes too fragmented, and it is necessary to recover free space to continue processing. Concretely, the data can be arranged in two different ways:\n\nContiguous and ordered: with two possible free spaces — before and after the data. To preserve the order of the blocks as much as possible, additions are made primarily at the end of the array. The gaps between the blocks are not directly reusable:\n\nScattered and unordered: where the only usable space for inserting new blocks is located after the most recent data:\n\nDefragmentation is necessary when the usable free space becomes too small. In this case, the block data are realigned at the beginning of the array to obtain the largest possible contiguous free space. The gaps between the block data are thus recovered. During defragmentation, unused block indexes are erased, and the index array is also defragmented.\n\nA block index contains the following information about the block:\n\nA 32-bit field: 4 bits for the block type and 28 bits for the size of the block data.\n\nThe address of the block data, on 32 bits, relative to the beginning of the block array.\n\nAmong the different types of HTX blocks, we find the elements that constitute an HTTP message:\n\nA start-line: (method + uri) for a request, or (status + reason) for a response.\n\nA header or a trailer: a (name + value) pair.\n\nThere are also internal block types used to mark the end of headers and trailers, or to mark a block as unused (for example, when it has been deleted).\n\nDepending on the type, the information of a block will be encoded differently:\n\nAn HTX message is typically composed of the following blocks, in this order:\n\nA start-line (request or response)\n\nZero or more data blocks (HTTP)\n\nAn end-of-trailers marker (optional, but always present if there is at least one trailer block)\n\nZero or more data blocks (TUNNEL)\n\nIn the case of responses, when there are interim responses (1xx), the first three blocks can be repeated before having the final response (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, or 5xx). In all cases, whether for requests or responses, the start-line, headers, and end-of-headers marker always remain grouped. This is true at the time of parsing, but also at the time of message formatting. The same applies to trailers and the end-of-trailers marker.\n\nHTX block data comes in several forms, each representing a specific part of an HTTP message. The following sections describe how each block type is structured and used.\n\nThe start line is the first block of an HTX message. The data in this block is structured. In HTTP/1.1, it is directly extracted from the first line of the request or response. In H2 and H3, it comes from the pseudo-headers (:method, :scheme, :authority, :path). Furthermore, because this block is emitted after all message headers have been parsed, it also contains information about the message itself, in the form of flags. For example, it can indicate whether the message is a request or a response, whether a size was announced via the Content-Length header, and so on.\n\nHeader data and trailers are stored the same way in HTX. There are two different block types to simplify internal header processing, but from the HTX perspective, there is no real difference, apart from their position in the message. Header blocks always come after a start-line and before an end-of-headers marker, while trailers always come after any data and are terminated by an end-of-trailers marker. In both cases, it is a {name, value} pair.\n\nThe message payload is stored as data blocks, outside of any transfer encoding. Thus, in HTTP/1.1, the chunked formatting disappears. The same blocks are also used to store data exchanged in an HTTP tunnel.\n\nThese are blocks without data. Depending on their type, they mark the end of the headers of a message or the end of the trailers. The end-of-headers marker is mandatory and marks the separation between the headers and the rest of the message. The end-of-trailers marker is optional and marks the end of the HTTP message and can potentially be followed by data exchanged in an HTTP tunnel.\n\nAs header names are normalized and indexed, searching is straightforward; it is enough to iterate over the blocks and compare them without having to re-parse them. There are relatively few headers per request or response (very often less than ten per request, between one and two dozen per response), so any additional indexing would be superfluous. This simplifies operations by eliminating the need to preserve relative positions between all headers.\n\nRewrites are also well-controlled. The name of a header is normally not modified, and the value that needs modification (e.g., cookie modification) is already perfectly delimited and cleared of leading/trailing spaces and CRLFs. The API prevents insertion of forbidden characters such as NUL, CR, or LF. As a result, it is effectively impossible to leave CRLFs in a value accidentally, and each HTX header corresponds to exactly one outgoing header.\n\nIn HTTP/1, the CRLF at the end of each line is automatically added by the protocol conversion, so the user or analyzer working on HTX has no direct control. Except in cases of conversion bugs, this design makes it impossible to pass one header for another or inject portions of a request or response to cause smuggling. Risks of bugs in the analysis or application layer are minimized because this layer no longer needs to manage available space for modifications; HTX handles it automatically, making the API trivial to use.\n\nRegarding the data, its delimitation is performed by the output converter. A block emitted in HTTP/1 will lead to the creation of a chunk, while the same block emitted in HTTP/2 will lead to one or more DATA frames. The total size of the converted data must match the announced size, otherwise an error is reported. Here too, the user has no control, so there is no risk of confusion about the output protocol. We again benefit from the intrinsic knowledge of the remaining data to be transmitted, avoiding the misinterpretation of boundary formatting that could lead to exploitation.\n\nThis design is why nearly all HTTP/1 attacks since HTX’s introduction have had no effect on HAProxy. A few early issues affected the first versions due to missing checks in the conversion stage (e.g., spaces in the name of an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 method), but these had very limited impact.\n\nModern HTTP specs (RFC911x) have been carefully separated by distinguishing the semantic part from the protocol part. Thus, all HTTP versions are subject to the same rules described in RFC9110, and each version also has its own constraints. For example, HTTP/1 describes how the body length of a message is determined based on the method used, the status code, the presence or absence of a Transfer-Encoding header, etc., while HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 do not have this last header. Conversely, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are not allowed to let a Connection header pass and have specific rules regarding mandatory headers depending on the methods, and which may also be subject to negotiations within the framework of optional extensions (e.g., RFC8441 to pass WebSocket over HTTP/2).\n\nThese types of checks were tedious to implement in the analysis layer because they all had to be subject to version checks to know what to verify. And errors are even easier on the response path because an HTTP/2 request transferred over HTTP/1 will lead to an HTTP/1 response that must be re-encoded in HTTP/2, but the error of relying on the request version rather than the response version for a given treatment is very quick to happen. All this code was therefore considered very sensitive and was subject to very few improvements for fear of making it fragile.\n\nThe HTX made it possible to report protocol checks to the ends, in the converters, and to leave only semantic checks in the analyzers, operating on the HTX representation. Thus, each protocol converter is more free with its checks and can stick to its own rules without the risk of others benefiting from it as a side effect.\n\nAdding support for new protocols only requires writing the new converters, potentially by drawing inspiration from another similar protocol. There is no longer any need to modify the analyzers or the core semantic layer. This is how HTTP/3 support on top of the QUIC layer was added so quickly—with fewer than 3000 lines of code, some of which came from the HTTP/2 implementation (and were later shared between them). Indeed, in practice, implementing a new protocol mostly comes down to writing the HTX transcoding code to/from this protocol and nothing else.\n\nSupport for the FastCGI protocol was introduced in much the same way, since this protocol is primarily just a different representation of HTTP. As a result, the codebase is now well positioned to accommodate new experimental versions of protocols while remaining maintainable. For example, when HTTP/4 eventually takes shape, the HTTP/3 code will probably be reused and adapted to form the beginning of HTTP/4, thus preserving a proven basis that can evolve alongside the protocol and be ready with a functional version once the protocol is ratified.\n\nThis approach keeps the focus on the essential, namely the protocol itself and its interoperability with the outside world rather than on the impacts it could have on the entire codebase. By comparison, the first implementation of HTTP/2, starting from an already ratified protocol, took more than a year to complete.\n\nThe HTX enables us, among other things, to free ourselves from the details related to the different versions of HTTP in the core of HAProxy, allowing the conversion layers to handle them on input and output. HAProxy is thus capable of enabling clients and servers to communicate regardless of the HTTP versions used on each side.\n\nUltimately, this abstraction immunizes HAProxy against numerous classes of bugs affecting HTTP/1. In HAProxy, HTTP/1 is not processed for analysis (rewriting, routing, or searching). Once the translation into HTX is done, HAProxy is no longer subject to HTTP/1 attacks. The focus is therefore concentrated solely on the conversion layer.\n\nFor example, a well-known request smuggling attack, which involves sending an HTTP/1 request with both a Content-Length header and a Transfer-Encoding header in order to hide a second request in the payload of the first is not possible in HTX, by design. Information related to data size is extracted from the message and stored as metadata.\n\nWhile HAProxy cannot block every possible request smuggling attack (consisting of hiding one request inside another), it will not be vulnerable to them and will prevent a certain number of them from being sent to servers, precisely because with the switch to HTX, the HTTP message undergoes normalization, and HAProxy can only transmit what it understands.\n\nHAProxy Enterprise features next-generation multi-layered security, including DDoS protection, bot management, web application firewall (WAF), and AI gateway. These security layers are exceptionally accurate with ultra-low latency, have low resource usage, feature dynamic and adaptive detection, and can be orchestrated at scale using HAProxy Fusion Control Plane.\n\nHTTP/1.1 is indeed an ambiguous and complicated protocol to parse correctly. Before HTX, HAProxy was probably affected by some of these known attacks, and a lot of time was spent resolving parsing and processing bugs. Today, this no longer happens. This is a significant benefit brought by the switch to HTX.\n\nChristopher Faulet has been developing on HAProxy for ten years and has spent the past nine years at HAProxy Technologies as a member of the core development team.\n\nHAProxy's high-performance security capabilities are utilized as a key line of defense by many of the world's top enterprises. Application layer DDoS attacks are aimed at overwhelming an application w\n\nAWS re:Invent 2024 has officially wrapped up, but not everything that happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

    "fullText": "Agreement comes amid anxiety in Hollywood over impact of AI on the industry, expression and rights of creators\n\nWalt Disney has announced a $1bn equity investment in OpenAI, enabling the AI startup’s Sora video generation tool to use its characters.\n\nUsers of Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that draw on more than 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars characters as part of a three-year licensing agreement between OpenAI and the entertainment giant.\n\nThe agreement – a landmark deal amid intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment – will not cover talent likenesses or voices.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, hailed a deal which paired his firm’s “iconic stories and characters” with OpenAI’s AI technology. It will place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”, he claimed.\n\nThe deal is OpenAI’s most prominent move into Hollywood after a contentious rollout of Sora and longstanding pushback against AI from many entertainment industry workers. Concerns from writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives over AI replacing jobs and using likenesses without consent has led to union protests and copyright lawsuits against AI companies.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched its latest iteration of Sora earlier this year, it immediately ran into a slew of potential copyright issues, as feeds became dominated by videos featuring characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants or Pikachu – sometimes generated to appear in Nazi-like clothing.\n\nRacist depictions of Martin Luther King Jr prompted OpenAI to ban the use of his likeness on the platform, while the daughter of Malcolm X called seeing her father’s image on Sora “deeply disrespectful and hurtful”.\n\nDisney itself has also been concerned over the unauthorized use of its characters by generative AI platforms. The company sent a stern cease-and-desist letter to the Character.AI chatbot firm in October, alleging that the platform was “blatantly infringing on Disney’s copyrights” through using the likeness of its characters.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, attorneys representing Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, demanding that the technology company’s AI systems stop alleged infringement, Variety reported.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has been on a charm offensive that included a recent appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the US talkshow. On Thursday, he touted the firm’s deal with Disney as proof that artificial intelligence companies could partner with the entertainment sector.\n\n“This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences,” Altman said.\n\nIn addition to Disney letting its characters appear in Sora, the company will also use OpenAI’s application programming interfaces to build new products and tools, becoming a major customer of the ChatGPT maker. A selection of the videos made by users on Sora will also be available for streaming on the Disney+ platform. It will also deploy ChatGPT for its employees, the companies said.\n\n“Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world,” said Iger. “The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”",

    "title": "U.S. Steps Up Campaign Against Maduro in Seizing Tanker Off Venezuela",
    "description": "The seizure comes as the United States builds up its forces in the Caribbean as part of a campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.",
    "fullText": "The United States seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday, a dramatic escalation in President Trump’s pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela.\n\nSpeaking at the White House before an event on a new luxury visa program, Mr. Trump announced the operation and said it was “a large tanker, very large,” adding, without elaboration, that “other things are happening.”\n\nWhen asked about the ship’s oil, Mr. Trump said, “Well, we keep it, I guess.” He declined to say who owned the tanker. “It was seized for a very good reason,” he added.\n\nThree U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a law enforcement operation, said the ship was carrying Venezuelan oil. They said there was no resistance from the crew and no casualties.\n\nIn a statement, Venezuela’s government called the seizure a “barefaced robbery and an act of international piracy” aimed at stripping the country of its oil wealth.\n\nThe operation was the latest tactic in an expanding effort to squeeze Venezuela and pressure Mr. Maduro. The Trump administration has accused him of running a “narcoterrorist” cartel sending drugs to the United States, although many current and former officials in Washington say the campaign is ultimately aimed at regime change.\n\nSince September, the United States has launched more than 22 known strikes against boats in the region, killing more than 80 people. The Trump administration insists, without publicly providing evidence, that the boats are smuggling drugs. Legal experts say the strikes may violate international law.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted a video on Wednesday evening on social media showing armed U.S. forces rappelling from a helicopter onto the deck of the tanker. The video could not be independently verified.\n\nMs. Bondi said the operation included the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard, supported by the Pentagon. She said the tanker had been used to transport “sanctioned oil” from Venezuela and Iran.\n\nThe U.S. officials said they expected additional seizures in the coming weeks as part of the administration’s efforts to weaken Mr. Maduro’s government by undermining its oil market.\n\nOne of the officials identified the tanker as a vessel called the Skipper, and said it was carrying Venezuelan oil from Petróleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil company known as PDVSA. The official said the ship had been previously linked to the smuggling of Iranian oil — a global black market that the Justice Department has been investigating for years. The vessel was sailing under the flag of another Latin American nation in which it was not registered, the official said, and its ultimate destination was Asia.\n\nA federal judge issued a seizure warrant roughly two weeks ago because of the ship’s past activities smuggling Iranian oil, not because of links to the Maduro government, the official said. Prosecutors have said that Iran uses money generated from oil sales to finance its military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which the United States has designated a terrorist entity.\n\nThe administration did not address many details about the operation, including what happened to the crew and what ultimately will happen to the ship. It was not clear whether the seizure warrant — which is sealed — was for the ship or the oil or both. The White House did not immediately respond when asked whether the United States had the legal authority to keep the oil.\n\nThe ship, under a different name, had been put under sanctions by the Treasury Department in 2022. U.S. officials said it was part of “an international oil smuggling network that facilitated oil trades and generated revenue” to support Hezbollah and Iran’s revolutionary guard force.\n\nThe tanker may have been trying to conceal its whereabouts by broadcasting falsified location data before the seizure, according to an analysis of satellite imagery and photographs by The New York Times.\n\nThe Navy, the Coast Guard, Southern Command and the Pentagon all declined to discuss the episode, referring questions to the White House.\n\nVenezuela is exceptionally dependent on oil, which makes these kinds of seizures potentially damaging to the country’s fragile economy. Oil accounts for the bulk of the country’s export revenues. In turn, Venezuela’s government spends much of the proceeds from oil exports to import basic necessities like food and medicine.\n\nAlthough Venezuela is believed to have colossal untapped oil reserves, the country produces far less oil than it did at the start of the century, after mismanagement, U.S. sanctions and corruption at PDVSA hobbled output.\n\nThe United States was long the largest buyer of Venezuela’s oil, but political tensions have eroded those ties. China now buys roughly 80 percent of Venezuela’s overall oil exports.\n\nSmaller amounts of Venezuelan oil are exported to the United States, often to refineries on the Gulf Coast, and to Cuba, where the island nation’s Communist leaders have long relied on such cargoes to provide a semblance of economic stability.\n\nIn recent months, Mr. Trump has ordered a huge buildup of U.S. forces in the region, with more than 15,000 troops and a dozen ships in the Caribbean, including the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford. Mr. Trump has authorized covert action against Venezuela and has warned that the United States could “very soon” expand its attacks from boats off the Venezuelan coast to targets inside the country. But Mr. Trump has also recently spoken by phone with Mr. Maduro about a possible meeting. The president said on Wednesday that he had not spoken to Mr. Maduro since their last conversation.\n\nThe administration has developed a range of options for military action in the country, including targeting Mr. Maduro and seizing control of the country’s oil fields. The president has repeatedly expressed reservations about an operation to remove Mr. Maduro from power, aides say, in part because of a fear that the operation could fail. Mr. Trump has been in no rush to make a decision, though he has shown a particular interest in extracting some of the value of Venezuela’s oil for the United States.\n\nThe oil tanker operation came on the same day the Nobel Peace Prize was formally bestowed on a Venezuelan dissident, María Corina Machado. She was not at the ceremony on Wednesday in Oslo, where her daughter received the prize on her behalf, but the Nobel Peace Prize committee said she had left Venezuela and was traveling to Oslo.\n\nReporting was contributed by Simon Romero and Genevieve Glatsky from Bogotá, Colombia; Charlie Savage from Washington; Anushka Patil, Christiaan Triebert, Riley Mellen and Rebecca F. Elliott from New York; and Carol Rosenberg from Miami.",

    "fullText": "One of the most fundamental algorithms that appears in interviews at big tech companies is Binary Search. Of course, nobody will ask you to implement binary search directly. However, as Jon Bentley cited in his famous book Programming Pearls, only a small percentage of people he asked—10% to be precise—were able to code this algorithm without any errors.\n\nHere, I will show you a correct implementation of binary search, its variants that appear in interviews, and LeetCode problems that you can solve using these techniques.\n\nGiven an array of items, we can find the position of a specific item linearly by iterating over the array, comparing each item with the desired item, and returning the position when the current item equals the desired item.\n\nWe must also consider the case where the desired item is not in the array; in this case, we can return any value. Since we are talking about positions in an array, we can return -1 if the item is not present. This is a very simple concept and implementation. However, if the array is sorted, we can do better.\n\nWe can find the position of an item in logarithmic time (O(log n)), where n is the number of items in the array, when the array is sorted.\n\nTo do this, we repeatedly compare the item we are looking for with the middle element of the array. If the middle element is the one we are looking for, we have our result. Otherwise, we need to update the range of the array we are considering accordingly.\n\nIf the element we are looking for is greater than the middle element, we need to search in the higher part of the array. Otherwise, we need to search in the lower part of the array.\n\nWhat we just described is the Binary Search algorithm. Below is the implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++:\n\nThis is less than 20 lines of code that you need to understand very well if you want to be successful in an interview. Note that I said “understand,” not “memorize.”\n\ncould be implemented in different ways, such as:\n\nCan you explain why the first implementation is better than the second?\n\nThe answer is integer overflow. When we add two integer numbers, we can exceed the maximum value allowed in the computer’s representation of an int. Knowing these details and how to answer such questions puts you in a much better position compared to other candidates.\n\nAs you can see, even a small detail can demonstrate your expertise and experience. All these small details together help you get the position you want.\n\nDespite these details, as I said, nobody will ask you to implement binary search directly. However, there are some important variants of the binary search algorithm that appear as part of problem-solving. I will describe four of them in the next sections.\n\nLet’s consider we have a sorted array with duplicate elements, such as [10, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 50]. Also, let’s assume we are searching for the element 30 and we need to find the smallest position of this element in case of duplication.\n\nWith the binary search algorithm implementation shown above, we cannot guarantee we will always return the smallest position of an element in case of duplication. However, we can modify the original algorithm to answer this question correctly.\n\nAnd here is a very important point: You can only make this modification if you know the binary search algorithm and its implementation well.\n\nThinking about the problem, instead of returning the position when we find the element in the array, we need to update our result and continue the search in the lower part of the array.\n\nUpdating the result instead of returning immediately is easy to see. You cannot return immediately because there may be duplicate elements in the array. Since we want the smallest position, we cannot just return.\n\nSo, why go to the lower part of the array instead of the higher part? The answer is because of the problem definition: we want the smallest index. So, if we find the element, in case of duplication, we are interested in the presence of this element before the current position.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis problem is similar to the one above, but now we are interested in the higher part of the array in case of duplication. This is because we want the largest index instead of the smallest one.\n\nIn this case, the implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis is a little different, but only slightly. Now, we are not interested in finding an element, but the largest value less than the given element. So, every time we find an element that is smaller than our desired element, we need to update our result. We also need to update the considered range of the array.\n\nIn this case, we are interested in the higher part of the array, since we are trying to find the largest value less than our element.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nSimilar to the problem above, but now we are interested in finding the smallest value greater than the desired value. So, we need to update our result when we find a larger element instead of a smaller one.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nHere are some interesting problems to solve on LeetCode using the techniques explained in this post:",

    "description": "Analysis of more than one million people shows that mental-health disorders fall into five clusters, each of them linked to a specific set of genetic variants.",
    "fullText": "Psychiatrists have long relied on diagnostic manuals that regard most mental-health conditions as distinct from one another — depression, for instance, is listed as a separate disorder from anxiety. But a genetic analysis of more than one million people suggests that a host of psychiatric conditions have common biological roots.\n\nThe results, published today in Nature1, reveal that people with seemingly disparate conditions often share many of the same disease-linked genetic variants. The analysis found that 14 major psychiatric disorders cluster into five categories, each characterized by a common set of genetic risk factors. The neurodevelopmental category, for example, includes both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, which psychiatric handbooks classify as separate conditions.\n\nMany supposedly individual conditions are “ultimately more overlapping than they are distinct, which should offer patients hope”, says study co-author Andrew Grotzinger, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “You can see the despair on someone’s face [when] you give them five different labels as opposed to one label.”\n\nGrotzinger says his team’s work was motivated by the finding that people diagnosed with one mental-health condition are highly likely to be diagnosed with another one. For example, previous research has shown that most people diagnosed with depression have also been diagnosed with a condition called generalized anxiety disorder, and vice versa2.\n\nTo learn whether there is a biological explanation for these correlations, Grotzinger and his colleagues aggregated genomic data from more than one million people with psychiatric conditions and from millions of healthy controls.\n\nThe researchers found that the 14 mental-health conditions they studied generally fall into five distinct buckets, each with its own genetic profile. There’s a schizophrenia/bipolar disorder category; an ‘internalizing’ category that includes depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; a neurodevelopmental category; and a compulsive category that includes obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.\n\nA final category includes substance-use disorders such as alcohol-use disorder and nicotine dependence. People whose genetic profile corresponds to a given bucket are at elevated risk of any of the conditions in that bucket. Other genetic and environmental triggers also affect risk.\n\nThe team then worked backwards from the categories that they had identified and found 238 specific genomic regions that are associated with at least one of these shared categories. For example, the researchers found that one region on chromosome 11 raised genetic risk for eight separate disorders, because the region codes for genes linked to dopamine signalling.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-04037-w\n\nRead the related News & Views, ‘Shared genetic risk in psychiatric disorders’.\n\nGrotzinger, A.

    "description": "Will Twitter finally return?",
    "fullText": "The startup claims X Corp. ‘legally abandoned its rights’ to Twitter’s brand.\n\nThe startup claims X Corp. ‘legally abandoned its rights’ to Twitter’s brand.\n\nA startup called Operation Bluebird is trying to reclaim Twitter’s branding, as reported earlier by Ars Technica and Reuters. Last week, Operation Bluebird filed a petition that asks the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to cancel X Corp.’s ownership of the “Twitter” and “Tweet” trademarks, claiming they’ve been “abandoned” by the Elon Musk-owned company.\n\nOperation Bluebird is led by founder Michael Peroff, an Illinois trademark and brand protection attorney, along with Stephen Coates, a trademark attorney who worked as Twitter’s associate director of trademarks, domain names, and marketing from 2014 to 2016. The startup also filed a trademark application for “Twitter,” aiming to include it in a new social media site called Twitter.new.\n\n“We have built a social platform that will look familiar to those that used legacy Twitter, but with new tools that provide a safer experience and empower the user to decide what types of content they engage in,” Coates tells The Verge. A post on Operation Bluebird’s LinkedIn page suggests the startup would use AI for fact-checking and moderation.\n\nIn its petition, Operation Bluebird alleges that X has “legally abandoned its rights” to Twitter’s brand “with no intention to resume use.” It also claims that X “continues to commit fraud on the USPTO through the filing of false statements and declarations.” As noted by The National Law Review, US trademark law states that someone looking to cancel a trademark registration for abandonment must prove that its owner hasn’t used the mark for three consecutive years, or show that the owner has discontinued its use and no longer intends to resume it.\n\nAfter acquiring Twitter in 2022, Musk changed the site’s name to “X” and replaced the bird logo in July 2023. Musk also began redirecting Twitter.com traffic to X.com last year. Operation Bluebird’s petition cites a post from Musk, who said “soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds” just before the site’s rebrand.\n\nAlexandra Roberts, a professor of law and media at Northeastern University School of Law, tells The Verge that Operation Bluebird has a “solid argument” that X has abandoned the rights to the Twitter marks. But Roberts also brings up something called residual goodwill, or when a trademark “may live on even when the original owner ceases use.” That means people may still associate X Corp. with the Twitter logo and brand.\n\n“Many users continue to refer to X as ‘Twitter’ and posts on X as ‘tweets,’ which demonstrates continued association and strengthens the case for residual goodwill,” Roberts says. She points to a 2020 case where a party attempted to register “Aunt Jemima” for breakfast foods, but was rejected “based on a likelihood of confusion” with Quaker Oats’ Aunt Jemima marks, even though the company had announced earlier that year that it was discontinuing the name and logo.\n\nIntellectual property attorney Douglas Masters says he is doubtful that Operation Bluebird’s claims will be successful. “I don’t know that the record ultimately will show that even though they [X Corp.] switched to X, that they intended to give up all of their commercial use and rights in the word Twitter,” Masters tells The Verge.\n\nX has until February to respond to the petition. If the company chooses to fight it, the process of determining whether or not to cancel X’s ownership of the “Twitter” marks will take a while. “It could take two, three years just to get through the trial process and another couple of years for the trademark office to make a ruling,” Masters says.\n\nThe possibility of a lengthy legal battle doesn’t appear to be stopping Operation Bluebird, however. “We believe our position is very strong,” Coates says. “X Corp. could escalate this away from the trademark office and to court, but we are ready to fight.”",

    "description": "\"Tesla couldn't even get their robot to serve popcorn at their new restaurant.\"",
    "fullText": "A six-second clip of a Tesla Optimus robot's \"suspicious tumble\" emerged on Reddit, Electrek reported, reviving skepticism about the electric vehicle manufacturer's autonomous technology.\n\nIn recent months, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been laser-focused on the company's artificial intelligence and robotics endeavors. Musk has asserted that \"AI and robotics\" were the only things that can save the United States from financial doom, and that those technologies would make money obsolete.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Tesla hosted an \"Autonomy Visualized\" event at a dealership in Miami, and a user on Reddit's r/TeslaMotors shared a brief clip of Optimus' reverse face-plant.\n\nTesla Optimus\n byu/Decent_Cheesecake643 inteslamotors\n\nIn the six-second video, Optimus was seen knocking over a few plastic water bottles before toppling over backward. However, the robot's unmistakably human gesture served as a \"Wizard-of-Oz\"-like reveal of the man behind the curtain. (Click here if the embedded video does not appear.)\n\n\"Looks like the operator took off their VR headset,\" a user observed, which was the general consensus on a different Reddit thread shared two days later.\n\n\"That's exactly what happened,\" another user replied, with another possibility that a teleoperator simply noticed they had knocked over some bottles and threw up their arms in dismay, unintentionally causing the robot to lose its balance.\n\nOne Reddit comment depicting a GIF of a \"Robocop 2\" scene in which a malfunctioning Robocop prototype makes a similar gesture to lift off its helmet racked up over 17,000 likes. Electrek commenters were equally unimpressed.\n\n\"Tesla couldn't even get their robot to serve popcorn at their new restaurant,\" one wrote. \"Everything Tesla does with robots seems to be a disappointing disaster.\"\n\nAnyone who follows Tesla developments is deeply familiar with Musk's tendency to wildly underestimate timelines.\n\nIn 2019, he famously predicted that 1 million driverless Tesla Robotaxis would be criss-crossing American roads in 2020.\n\nWhen they finally debuted on a small scale in June, it was obvious to riders that human operators were involved — yet Robotaxi crashes also occurred at a surprising rate.\n\nDo you worry about robots taking away our jobs?\n\nYes — but it will create new ones too\n\nPossibly — but not significantly\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nTesla's Optimus was first unveiled in 2022, but coverage of its purported capabilities often focused on the obvious human intervention. If Optimus were Tesla's sole focus, its level of autonomy would be less of a concern.\n\nHowever, Musk has long prioritized autonomous EVs over other advancements. He recently promised that Tesla drivers could soon \"text and drive\" safely, forcing law enforcement agencies to reiterate that the activity remains illegal.\n\nAmid plans to release an autonomous model called the Cybercab without seeking the necessary regulatory approvals, Tesla's struggles to make autonomous driving a reality can undermine consumer trust and discourage drivers from making their next car an EV.\n\nFor better or worse, Tesla remains the most prominent EV manufacturer; if a perception that the brand is unsafe persists, fewer EVs on the road and more tailpipe pollution could result.\n\nAfter a challenging 2025 and Tesla's Optimus-related missteps, the brand is leaning heavily on the Cybercab's debut to turn things around.\n\nThis month, Musk said Tesla's Robotaxi fleet would double in size before the year was out, but questions about its level of autonomy lingered.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nTan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters.\n\nTan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company.\n\nMeta’s interest spurred Intel to ​make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion.\n\nMeta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.\n\nThe events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources.\n\nIntel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.\n\nIntel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a ‌venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.\n\nSince Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.",

At Italian Tech Week in October, the Amazon founder looked back on an early piece of feedback that changed the way he approached invention—and may have helped save Amazon from becoming its own worst enemy.\n\n\"I am an inventor,\" Bezos told the audience. \"This is my fundamental nature.\" His favorite place? In a room with a whiteboard, surrounded by a small group, spitballing ideas. \"You can literally put me in front of a whiteboard and I can come up with a hundred ideas in half an hour,\" he said with a grin.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nBut that endless flow of innovation—once considered a superpower—nearly became a liability. In the early years of Amazon, one longtime executive pulled Bezos aside with a blunt warning. \"Jeff, you have enough ideas to destroy Amazon,\" Jeff Wilke told him.\n\nIt stunned him. \"This was such a shocking idea for me,\" Bezos admitted. Wilke, a manufacturing expert, saw the problem clearly: every new idea was essentially a task dropped into a queue. If the company couldn't absorb it fast enough, it wasn't just useless—it was destructive.\n\n\"You have to release the work at the right rate that the organization can accept it,\" Bezo said, quoting Wilke. \"You're creating a backlog, a queue, work in process. It's adding no value and in fact, it's creating distraction.\"\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThat was the moment Bezos shifted. Instead of flooding Amazon with nonstop initiatives, he started filtering. \"I started prioritizing the ideas better, keeping lists of them, keeping them to myself until the organization was ready,\" he said.\n\nEven more important, Bezos began thinking like a builder—not just of ideas, but of infrastructure. \"How can I build an organization that can be ready for more ideas?\" he said. The answer was scaling leadership, growing bandwidth, and creating systems that could handle multiple innovations at once.\n\nAmazon didn't slow down after that—it got smarter. \"We built a company that's very good at inventing and doing more than one thing at a time,\" Bezos said. But none of it worked until he accepted a hard truth: ideas are powerful, but only if they're released at the right moment. Without discipline, even genius becomes a liability.",

BI's economy team broke down the announcement and answered your questions. BI's Allie Kelly also has a recap on what the latest rate cut means for your wallet along with some key takeaways.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell called his shot roughly a year ago when he projected three rate cuts in 2025.\n\nLove him or hate him, that type of consistency and transparency has been a staple of Powell's tenure. Rarely, if ever, has there been real uncertainty about what the Fed would do in the immediate run-up to a rate-cut meeting.\n\nBut differing views on managing the Fed's two biggest mandates — keeping inflation low and maximizing employment — and an upcoming change in leadership mean a lot less certainty going forward.\n\nThat was on display yesterday, as there were three dissenting votes, the most in over six years. The split was also widespread, with Stephen Miran preferring a big cut while Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid voted against dropping rates entirely.\n\nThe Fed's latest \"dot plot\" is projecting one cut next year, but individual opinions on how the next 12 months could shake out vary greatly. Last meeting's dot plot was also all over the place.\n\nThat could become the new norm at the Fed. Powell's term ends this May, and President Donald Trump could name his replacement pick before Christmas.\n\nThe favorite to replace Powell is National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, a Trump ally who has been vocal about aggressively slashing rates. That's got some investors nervous — and previously sent bond yields spiking — over fears Hassett would cut rates even in the face of rising inflation.\n\nInvestors have some tricks up their sleeve to counteract the potential for an unconventional Fed.\n\nSo-called \"bond vigilantes\" have been known to fight monetary policies or fiscal budget decisions they disagree with. They sell bonds, which sends yields spiking and ultimately increases borrowing costs.\n\nTrump is hyper-aware of market reactions to his choices, which gives investors some power. The TACO trade — Trump Always Chickens Out — was all the rage as tariffs ramped up.\n\nEven if investors have levers they can pull to reel in the Fed, that type of constant back-and-forth is not ideal for the bond market.\n\nVolatility has become a staple of the stock market, but the bond market is supposed to represent stability and security. That'll be tough to maintain if it turns into a battleground between investors and the central bank.",

In all of 2025, Fortnite only released one new Lego build in the item shop--the Daft Punk Pyramid.

    "description": "Drone schools in Ukraine say they've realized what traits tend to make people the best pilots for the fight against Russia.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's drone schools say it's clear: young, tech-savvy people with a gaming background make the best drone pilots.\n\nAcross the country, drone schools are training new operators for what has become one of the most important roles in Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion — flying the drones that scout Russian positions, find targets, and blow up tanks and troops.\n\nThree leaders working at two schools told Business Insider that younger students with gaming or tech experience tend to consistently pick up skills the fastest. These students often are already comfortable with controllers, joysticks, and staring at a screen for a long time.\n\nThe instructor comments offer insight into what kind of person makes the best pilot, useful as Ukraine continues to fight for its survival and Western militaries study the war, investing more heavily in drone programs for a potential future fight.\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said younger people and gamers, \"are really good because their system of motor movements in their hands is already well developed.\"\n\nHis colleague, Tetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, agreed, telling BI that \"those who used to play video games, those who are accustomed to using a joystick, would be better in terms of running an FPV drone.\"\n\nTechnical fluency matters too. It's easier to train people with IT or engineering backgrounds than it is teachers, marketing specialists, or accountants. This war is one of rapidly evolving technology and tactics, especially in drone warfare.\n\nBeing an operator isn't just about physical control; it's about really understanding how drones work and what they can do. The school strives to instill these principles in all students.\n\nAnd gaming experience, technical knowledge, and flexible adaptation in the face of new technology tend to be more easily found among younger students. If they're over 50, Tetyana explained, \"it is a bit more challenging for students to get hold of controlling some types of drones.\"\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said someone who flies well isn't automatically a strong combat operator — but after a year of training, his team has identified what works.\n\n\"Young people aged 18-27 are the easiest to train,\" he said. \"They memorize information and acquire skills faster and more effectively. As we have noted, the older a person is, the more difficult it is for them to learn.\"\n\nSimilar to the other drone school leaders, Pervak said people who have a technical mindset can absorb training \"more easily and understand the intricacies of using UAVs in combat better.\" Those who were programmers and gamers often \"find it easiest to focus on a monitor for long periods of time. Everyone else must develop this skill.\"\n\nGood health is also key, but he said the school has nonetheless \"successfully trained people with visual and hearing impairments, back problems, contusions, and even head injuries.\"\n\nDrones account for about 60% of Ukraine's front-line strikes, according to the country's commander-in-chief. With shortages of artillery shells and other weaponry, Ukraine has leaned heavily on drones. The inexpensive systems have been highly effective at damaging and destroying equipment worth millions.\n\nCheap drones offer an asymmetric advantage and provide the Ukrainian military with combat power it couldn't generate with humans and crewed assets alone. But its drone force is only as strong as its pilots are capable, making drone training essential.\n\nThe drone school leaders are not alone in their assessment of who tends to make the best pilots.\n\nUkrainian soldiers with gaming backgrounds have also credited that experience for their skills, and Ukraine's special drone unit, Typhoon, previously told Business Insider that gamers make great drone pilots. But they also cautioned that real drone warfare is much more complicated and dangerous than any video game.\n\nOne Typhoon operator said that \"people think flying a military drone is like playing 'Call of Duty,' until they realize there's no restart option,\" referring to the popular video game.\n\nWestern drone pilots have previously expressed similar sentiments. Tanner Yackley, a former US Air Force drone operator who left in 2018, previously told Business Insider that it's fundamentally different because \"you're making life or death calls every single day.\"\n\n\"There's not a single game in the world that can prep you for what you're going to do,\" he said.\n\nAs NATO watches the war in Ukraine, worried about a wider conflict, its forces are already adapting and also looking to gamers, even embracing tech from the gaming world to make it easier for younger troops to quickly skill up on new technology.\n\nSome American and European troops, for instance, are training on a new air-defense system that uses an Xbox controller to launch interceptor drones.\n\nThe drone schools, however, are constantly grappling with challenges, such as limited funding, reliance on donated drones, and the threat of Russian strikes. They have to keep their curricula updated, with instructors traveling to the front and rewriting lessons every couple of weeks to match the rapid battlefield shifts.",

A panel of judges selected 10 highly commended images and six winners in categories such as birds, fish, and reptiles, as well as an overall winner.\n\nThe Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards donate 10% of its revenue to Whitley Fund for Nature, a wildlife conservation organization.\n\nHere are the funniest wildlife photos of the year.\n\nMulkahainen took this photo of a brown bear in the Martinselkonen area of Finland.\n\n\"When I was photographing bears, this one-year-old bear cub saw it and started smiling at me,\" Mulkahainen wrote.\n\nEllwanger caught three lions yawning at the same time, calling it \"a hilariously lucky moment.\"\n\n\"The red-throated loon is quite a poor flyer, and its landing is usually very wobbly,\" Badermann, who took the photo in Finland, wrote. \"It seeks balance with its legs stretched backwards and then belly-lands to glide. I like to say they use the water as their runway.

But the cubs, like any persistent little ones, would chase her down, nipping at her and yelping for more attention.\"\n\nLuca photographed a lemur in Madagascar licking its fingers \"with the grace of a stage actor and the timing of a comedian,\" as if it had just eaten a bag of Fonzies snacks.\n\n\"The photo immediately reminded me of that old snack commercial: 'If you don't lick your fingers, you're only half enjoying it!'\" Luca wrote.\n\nTuck captured the moment when nesting grass blew into a gannet's face on the Bempton Cliffs in Yorkshire, England.\n\nKirby photographed a Steller's sea eagle guarding a fish it had caught in Hokkaido, Japan.\n\n\"Other birds were flying above, and as they came closer, I captured the look it gave them,\" Kirby wrote. \"There was no way it was parting with its catch.\"\n\nCohn photographed a baby gorilla appearing embarrassed by its mother in the Virunga Mountains in Rwanda.\n\nPrice wrote that he photographed these \"fiercely territorial\" guillemots in the midst of a dispute \"on a small rocky cliff ledge where space was at a premium.\"\n\n\"I liked the way the guillemot was looking directly into my lens, its white eye-liner eyes highlighting its predicament!\" Price wrote. \"Sometimes you just want to bite your neighbor's head off…literally!\"\n\n\"Whilst on a scuba dive in the Philippines, this little fish kept popping its head out of its home, a hole in the patterned coral,\" Stock wrote of the bluestriped fangblenny featured in her winning image. \"I took a few photos and I loved its cheeky face smiling back at me. What an expressive-looking face!\"\n\nBell, a 13-year-old photographer, took this photo of male frogs establishing their territory in a pond in Maine.\n\n\"I took my camera and lay on my belly, watching them and taking shots,\" Bell wrote. \"It wasn't until I got back to the house and looked at the pictures that I saw this one and realized how much I liked it. I showed it to my parents and they loved it too and it became one of my favorites. We all thought it looked like one frog was trying to baptize the other!\"\n\nRustemeier photographed playful foxes on a nature reserve in the Netherlands, documenting the same den over several months.\n\n\"The time with them taught me a lot about their social behavior,\" Rustemeier wrote. \"I saw them fight, hunt, sleep, groom, and of course play, which is always my favorite to watch! You really have to giggle a lot watching foxes play with their quirky personalities.\"\n\nHoffman caught a female chimpanzee picking her nose in a series of photographs taken in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.\n\nCohn snapped this winning photo of a gorilla from a family group known as the Amahoro family in Rwanda's Virunga Mountains.\n\n\"One young male was especially keen to show off his acrobatic flair: pirouetting, tumbling, and high kicking,\" Cohn wrote. \"Watching his performance was pure joy, and I'm thrilled to have captured his playful spirit in this image.\"",

    "description": "AI disrupts ARR: Startups and SaaS firms face new hybrid valuation models as investors prioritize usage, efficiency, and outcome-based metrics.",
    "fullText": "Startups and other tech companies love to boast about \"annual recurring revenue.\" AI could make this metric obsolete, though.\n\nAccording to a new report by consultant AlixPartners, investors are on the cusp of abandoning the traditional ARR-multiple playbook that defined the SaaS era. In its place will emerge hybrid valuation models that reward companies not for the size of their subscription base but for how effectively they use AI to elevate customer outcomes.\n\nFor decades, ARR served as the bedrock for valuing enterprise software firms. It measures revenue from subscriptions by taking the value of current contracts and extrapolating that out over a full year.\n\nAlixPartners now argues that ARR is becoming increasingly \"meaningless\" in an AI-first economy, especially as usage- and outcome-based business models replace the per-seat licenses that have dominated the SaaS industry.\n\nThe big change is related to how expensive AI models are to run. Every time a new AI software service taps into this intelligence, the provider has to pay a per-token price. That makes fixed, per-seat SaaS subscriptions tougher to offer.\n\nThis means revenue could fluctuate \n\nAlixPartners says investors are already shifting focus toward a hybrid valuation approach in the AI era:\n\n• AI leverage ratios — These measure how effectively companies convert AI investments into revenue and margin gains. Rather than rewarding scale for its own sake, investors will reward operational efficiency and automation-driven profitability.\n\n• Outcome-based performance benchmarks — Metrics such as customer margin expansion, reduced task completion time, or increased throughput will matter more than raw seat-based user counts.\n\n• Traditional ARR multiples — Still relevant but no longer sufficient on their own.\n\nNew forecasting metrics, such as \"time to usage,\" \"usage ramp rate,\" and \"usage volatility,\" are emerging to help investors gauge how quickly customers adopt AI features and how stable their consumption patterns are over time.\n\nThe message is clear: In the AI era, value follows impact. Companies that can demonstrate real productivity gains for customers and operational leverage for themselves will earn premium valuations. Those clinging to legacy ARR-driven models risk being left behind as investors pivot to frameworks that better capture the economics of intelligent software.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Todd Combs thanked Geico employees, trumpeted the auto insurer's prospects, and championed his successor as CEO in a farewell email on Monday obtained by Business Insider.\n\nCombs — one of Warren Buffett's two investment managers at Berkshire Hathaway for the past 15 years, and the CEO of Berkshire-owned Geico since 2020 — struck a grateful tone in his goodbye message, saying it was a \"privilege\" and \"honor\" to lead the company.\n\nThe departing boss said he was confident in Geico and its \"ongoing transformation,\" and that it had \"tremendous momentum — and that momentum belongs to you.\"\n\nCombs hailed new CEO Nancy Pierce, an almost 40-year Geico veteran who was previously its operating chief, as the \"right leader\" for Geico and \"uniquely qualified\" to take it to the \"next level.\"\n\nThe former hedge fund manager is leaving Berkshire to head up JPMorgan's $10 billion Strategic Investment Group and serve as a special advisor to the bank's CEO, Jamie Dimon.\n\nGeico declined a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nGEICO Associates,\n\nAs I reflect on today's news and my time with GEICO, I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude and pride. It has been my privilege to serve as your CEO since early 2020, and to work alongside the people who have made this company what it is today.\n\nI believe strongly in GEICO and in the vision that drives its ongoing transformation. As our company and our industry have continued to grow and evolve, you have brought your talent, dedication, and innovation to your work every day. Together, we've built an organization ready to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future with tremendous momentum - and that momentum belongs to you.\n\nWhat gives me the greatest confidence as I step into a new role at JPMorganChase is the strength of our leadership team - and especially the strength of your new CEO. Nancy Pierce is the right leader for this company, and she is uniquely qualified to lead GEICO to the next level and continue the gains that have been achieved.\n\nThank you for your trust in our team and our strategic vision. Most of all, thank you for your energy and hard work on behalf of our customers and one another. It has been my honor to be part of this organization.\n\nWith sincere appreciation,\n\nTodd\n\nCombs spearheaded a turnaround at Geico that saw it swing from a pre-tax underwriting loss of $1.9 billion in 2023, to a $3.6 billion profit in 2024, then a $7.8 billion profit in the 2025 financial year.\n\nBuffett told Berkshire shareholders in his annual letter this year that Combs had \"reshaped Geico in a major way, increasing efficiency and bringing underwriting practices up to date,\" and described the company's performance in 2024 as \"spectacular.\"\n\nThe legendary investor, now in the final stretch of his six-decade run as Berkshire's CEO with Greg Abel set to take over on New Year's Day, wrote that Geico was a \"long-held gem that needed major repolishing\" and Combs had \"worked tirelessly in getting the job done.\"\n\nDo you work for Berkshire Hathaway and have a story to share?

Tschang, an associate professor of strategic management at Singapore Management University.\n\nIt is the AI paradox facing companies today: as corporate leaders invest billions in AI, many frontline workers remain deeply skeptical for many reasons.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey published earlier this year found that nearly a third believe it will lead to fewer job opportunities for them in the long run. Meanwhile, a survey by the University of Melbourne and KPMG of over 48,000 people across 47 countries found that only 46% of respondents are willing to trust AI systems.\n\nBridging this gap — getting workers to both trust and adopt AI — has become one of HR's most urgent challenges. Becoming comfortable with AI takes time and practice, but most organizations rarely make time for this, Tschang says.\n\n\"That's why HR leaders need to create space for safe learning and experimentation with AI's uses and limits, starting with their own teams,\" Tschang says.\n\nTo do that effectively, HR leaders need to develop AI fluency, meaning they must understand the technology well enough to identify where it can solve real problems and guide their workforce in using it. That's easier said than done.\n\nThe standard purview of HR includes both operational tasks, like recruiting, onboarding, benefits, and compliance, as well as strategic ones like developing talent and managing organizational change. Put simply, it's not a department known for being particularly tech-savvy.\n\nBut in the dawn of the AI era, that's changing, says Heather Conklin, CEO of Torch, a corporate coaching firm that helps companies navigate change, including AI adoption. \"It's forcing HR people to reinvent themselves,\" she says. \"And the ones I see succeeding are the ones who are going first.\"\n\nThese teams are treating their own departments as testing grounds, experimenting with different tools and learning what works and what doesn't, says Conklin. \"They're getting hands-on with AI themselves, even if they're not technical,\" she adds. \"They can't drive it across the company if they haven't lived it. They need to drive it from a place of credibility.\"\n\nThat credibility becomes currency when employees are wary. The CHROs winning people over are leading with problems worth solving, says Dexter Bachelder, CEO of Propel People, an AI recruiting platform for the construction industry.\n\n\"It's not about HR promoting AI. It's about the questions on employees' minds: How can AI do some of my paperwork so that I can leave work earlier and get home to my family faster? How can I automate some of the manual tasks of my job that aren't fun? How can I make this process better or faster?\" Bachelder says.\n\nIn other words, when workers see how AI makes their daily work easier, they're more likely to use it. \"If you solve the employee's problems, you're using the technology for a purpose,\" he says. \"\n\nNothing drives trust and adoption faster than having a coworker explain it. When a foreman explains to another foreman how they use a certain tool in the field —'This is how it works on our project, this is how it could work on yours' — that goes a long way,\" he says. \"It's not from IT or management or HR. It's from a peer, and that's what really drives adoption.\"\n\nPart of HR learning how to work with AI and earning employee confidence means understanding what's no longer working in the organization, and what AI could do to address those gaps.\n\nHR leaders have their own vested interest in this transformation. Many departments have long dealt with inadequate technology, and lots of the tools and processes HR has relied on for years weren't built for this moment, Bachelder says.\n\n\"To some degree, I don't think HR has had a lot of voice in the technology they use because a lot of tools are tied to financial systems,\" he says. \"There's a real opportunity here.\"\n\nTraditional learning management systems, for instance, struggle to keep pace when skills requirements change more frequently than every few years. Yearly engagement surveys can't capture employee sentiment quickly enough to respond to fast-moving organizational changes.\n\nMoreover, performance review cycles designed around annual goal-setting are often disconnected from organizations where priorities change on a quarterly basis. And recruitment systems built to screen for specific technical abilities may miss candidates who have the desired problem-solving skills needed for AI-related roles.\n\nOf course, upgrading HR systems won't entirely solve the trust challenge. Employee fears about job security and algorithmic bias go beyond what any tool can fix. And HR leaders still need to answer employee questions about transparency, fairness, and who's accountable for AI's decisions.\n\n\"It's challenging to do this right now,\" Conklin of Torch says. \"But if HR leaders aren't able to figure this out, they're going to be left behind.\"",

    "fullText": "I ordered three hot chicken tenders from Chicken Guy! in Atlantic City. It cost $10.49, excluding tax, and came with a choice of two sauces.\n\nCompared to Dave's Hot Chicken, Chicken Guy! is a smaller chain.\n\nThere are 19 locations in the US, while Dave's Hot Chicken operates 245 locations as of 2024, according to Restaurant Business.\n\nThe tenders were dusted in spicy seasoning that clung to every inch.\n\nI chose two sides of donkey sauce, a blend of mayonnaise, lemon, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and roasted garlic, to pair with the tenders.\n\nWhile I thought the chicken was tender and shreddable, the spice level fell a bit short of my expectations. It was on par with the spicy chicken nuggets from McDonald's or Wendy's, but nowhere near as hot as the Original Hot tenders from Wingstop, for reference.\n\nIf Chicken Guy! really wants to live up to the \"hot tender\" name, it might need to bump up the heat.\n\nI ordered a two-piece hot tender combo, which also came with fries, bread, Dave's sauce, and pickles, for $15.49, plus tax and fees.\n\nThe breading on the Dave's tenders was thicker than that on the ones from Chicken Guy!, but I thought it added even more flavor to the tenders.\n\nRather than a dusting of spicy seasoning, the tenders from Dave's were visibly bright red, an indication of how hot they would be when I bit in.\n\nThe accompanying side of Dave's sauce tempered the heat somewhat, but these hot tenders were at the peak of what I can handle in terms of spice.\n\nSimilar to a Nashville hot chicken, the spice lingered in my mouth. It brought maximum flavor, but I was definitely feeling the heat.\n\nThe chicken tender itself was big — almost the size of a half-breast — juicy, and deliciously flavorful. I also thought the tenders, as part of the combo meal, were a good value, given the generous serving of fries, pickles, and bread, as well as the sheer size of the tenders.\n\nEven though I got three tenders at Chicken Guy!, the two from Dave's were arguably more filling due to their bigger size and thicker breading.\n\nI'd order both of these tenders again, but if you're looking for spice, Dave's Hot Chicken was the only chain that lived up to its spicy name.",

    "title": "Interceptor drones are taking over in Ukraine, but soldiers are still using machine guns to battle Russian threats",
    "description": "The drones are still in limited supply and are not always the ideal interception method, Ukrainian soldiers and an official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces are still using decades-old machine guns and small arms to defend against Russian air attacks, even as cheap interceptor drones surge in popularity.\n\nInterceptor drones, which are armed with small warheads and fly directly into their targets or explode nearby to destroy them midair, have become a crucial tool for Ukraine as it struggles to defend against worsening Russian bombardments.\n\nHowever, Ukraine still doesn't have enough of these drones, and they aren't always the best tool for every intercept, making guns a practical fallback, Ukrainian soldiers and an official familiar with the security situation told Business Insider.\n\nOleksiy, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces mobile air defense unit who could only be identified by his first name for security reasons, said his troops are training to use new interceptor drones to strengthen their arsenal.\n\nOleksiy's unit, tasked with protecting Irpin, a city on the outskirts of Ukraine's capital Kyiv, has historically used the .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun mounted on the bed of a pickup truck to battle the Russian one-way attack drones that are regularly launched at Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this year, though, Russia started modifying its drones to fly faster and at higher altitudes, beyond the range of the Browning, a popular US-made heavy weapon designed around the end of World War I.\n\nOleksiy said his unit is still using the Browning, but it hasn't scored any hits recently because the Russian drones are beyond its capabilities. He said that other Ukrainian air defenders also rely on the machine gun, which has decades of combat experience.\n\nOleksiy argued that guns will likely continue to have a role in air defense. Ultimately, soldiers will decide which weapon best suits their needs in the moment.\n\n\"Defense forces always use all available means of deterrence, and a machine gun is currently one of the cheapest means if there are enemy air targets in its range,\" he said.\n\nA special operator in Ukraine's 4th Ranger Regiment, who previously worked with the Browning in an air defense sub-unit, said the gun is a reliable weapon troops can master in just a few days.\n\nRussian drones don't always maintain a consistent altitude in flight; sometimes they fly closer to the ground, where they become vulnerable to the Browning, said Drago, who could only be identified by his call sign for security reasons.\n\nOfficials, however, would like to see a shift toward the newer capabilities. Yehor Cherniev, the deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, told Business Insider that air defenders still largely use \"outdated weapons,\" including guns, to battle Russian drones.\n\nCherniev said Ukraine is replacing these weapons with interceptor drones at a rapid pace, describing them as \"far more effective.\"\n\nHe said that \"due to a lack of funding and limited assistance from our partners, we have not yet been able to implement the use of interceptor drones everywhere and on the necessary scale.\" Limits on these capabilities leave crews dependent on older options that are useful but not always well-suited for the threat.\n\nInterceptor drones emerged earlier this year as a top defense priority for Ukraine because these systems are inexpensive and can be manufactured in large quantities. They are among the latest battlefield innovations and crucial technology as Kyiv faces growing Russian investment in its long-range drone operations and ever-expanding nightly attacks.\n\nSome Ukrainian interceptor drones are worth as little as $2,500; by comparison, Russia's one-way attack drones are estimated to cost $35,000 on the low end. Officials stress that it's crucial to be on the right end of the cost curve.\n\nUkraine's defense industry is now producing hundreds of interceptor drones daily, and the military frequently shares footage showing them downing Russian attack and reconnaissance drones.\n\nWestern military officials and Ukrainian organizations have said that interceptor drones are responsible for taking down thousands of Russian drones in combat.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO is taking note of the success of interceptor drones in Ukraine. Some allies have purchased and are deploying their own systems, recognizing the value as a low-cost air defense solution that doesn't necessarily require extensive training.\n\nOleksiy's unit began training on the new interceptor drones earlier in the fall, and they expect to wrap up soon. While he acknowledged that there is a bit of a learning curve, he said that it \"doesn't scare us.\"",

    "fullText": "If you were one of the tens of millions of AT&T customers whose personal data was leaked online in recent years, you could be eligible for up to $7,500 as part of a settlement.\n\nThe company revealed in March 2024 that information belonging to millions of current and past customers had been leaked on the dark web. Four months later, AT&T said additional customer data had been illegally downloaded from a company workspace on a third-party cloud platform back in 2022.\n\nBoth incidents spurred lawsuits against AT&T, which has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAffected customers filed a consolidated class-action suit against the company in May. Two months later, AT&T agreed to establish two settlement funds totaling $177 million: a $149 million all-cash fund for customers affected by the first data breach and a $28 million all-cash payment for customers affected by the second data incident.\n\n\"While we deny the allegations in these lawsuits that we were responsible for these criminal acts, we have agreed to this settlement to avoid the expense and uncertainty of protracted litigation,\" an AT&T spokesperson told Business Insider. \"We remain committed to protecting our customers' data and ensuring their continued trust in us.\"\n\nThe deadline for eligible customers to submit a claim and receive settlement money is one week away. Here's what affected AT&T customers need to know.\n\nKroll, a third party that manages class action settlements, said that eligible AT&T customers fall under two categories: AT&T 1 Settlement Class and AT&T 2 Settlement Class.\n\nAT&T 1 Settlement Class refers to people living in the United States whose data — including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, birth dates, passcodes, billing account numbers, and Social Security numbers — were included in the first leak.\n\nThe AT&T 2 Settlement Class refers to any customers whose data was involved in the second leak, which could include information like phone numbers with which customers interacted and other data related to those interactions, such as the duration of calls or the number of times those numbers were contacted.\n\nIf your information was part of either breach, AT&T would have contacted you.\n\nWithin the AT&T 1 Settlement Class, customers can submit a claim for a \"Document Loss Cash Payment\" of up to $5,000 for losses that happened in 2019 or later, \"upon presentation of documentation that the losses are fairly traceable to the AT&T 1 Data Incident.\"\n\nThey also qualify for a Tier 1 or Tier 2 cash payment, which is an alternative to the Document Loss Cash Payment and represents a pro rata share of the AT&T 1 Net Settlement Fund cash.\n\nUnder the AT&T 2 Settlement Class, customers are eligible for a Documented Loss Cash Payment of up to $2,500 for losses that happened on or after April 14, 2024. The Tier 3 cash payment is a pro rata share of the AT&T 2 Net Settlement Fund cash.\n\nKroll said some customers may be an \"overlap settlement class member,\" so they could walk away with a total of $7,500.\n\nCustomers have until December 18 to submit a claim. Submitting a claim is the only way a settlement class member can receive a payment.\n\nThe United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas will hold a final approval hearing for the settlement on January 15, 2026.",

    "description": "My son was born in December, and while he was young, he thought Christmas was for him. I want to keep his birthday separate, though.",
    "fullText": "When I figured out that my son would be born in December, I was instantly worried that he'd deal with having his birthday overshadowed by the season. Luckily, over the years, my son developed a different attitude and began to think of Christmas as something for him. But I have still always been careful to protect his birthday as a separate festivity.\n\nMy son was born during the first week of December, so he was just over two weeks old for his first Christmas. His birth was really marked by the holiday season. The hospital where I had him was decorated already, and I survived those first late-night feedings by keeping myself awake with cookies and Christmas reruns.\n\nWhen he was finally old enough for me to ask what kind of birthday he'd like, it was still \"Christmas.\" To ensure his special day still felt distinct from the season, I'd make sure his cake was something he was interested in at the time, such as a Batman or football theme. However, besides putting up a \"Happy Birthday\" sign and getting balloons, the Christmas decorations have essentially always doubled as the party decorations.\n\nI'd say the biggest December birthday issue we've run into is when someone gives my son a gift, saying it's both for his birthday and Christmas. This usually happens with extended family and friends that we don't see as often. Luckily, I have a great kid who would never complain about receiving a combined birthday and Christmas gift, but that doesn't mean I'm blind to the fact that it hurts his feelings a little.\n\nThe best way I have found to avoid this happening is by throwing him a true birthday party. So far, no one has ever come to celebrate him with a Christmas present. Making sure his birthday is an occasion on its own sets a boundary between it and the rest of the holidays.\n\nOne unexpected upside to his birthday being during the holiday rush has been that it feels like a break from the season. This year, my son turned 12 and had some friends over to celebrate. And this year, nothing about his party had to do with Christmas. We hadn't gotten our tree up or decorations out yet, and I served all traditional party foods, including pizza, cake, and an ice cream sundae bar. Best of all, all of the gifts from his friends were wrapped in birthday wrapping paper with birthday cards. They all spent the party hanging out, having the absolute time of their lives.\n\nThe season's activities can become a lot, especially with school events like Spirit Week, so I think a pause from that to do something that's still fun is refreshing for everyone. But mostly, I think my son felt really special to be celebrated like that by his best friends. It was probably his first birthday party that really felt like something separate from Christmastime.\n\nMy son is a Sagittarius, like anyone with a December birthday before the 22nd. They are known for being adventurous and optimistic, and my son is as well. He could make the most out of any situation, which is part of why I believe having a birthday so close to Christmas doesn't bother him at all. It's me who wants to protect the day we celebrate him from being lumped into Christmas.\n\nI've now seen the difference between the Christmas-adjacent birthday and the birthday-birthday, and it proves to me that it's important not to combine the two. As his mom, I notice the subtle differences. It's the small look I see on his face when he gets a \"Happy Birthday and Merry Christmas,\" instead of hearing each individually on their respective days.\n\nHaving a Christmas birthday doesn't make it any less important. However, it is essential to make the distinction.",

    "description": "Trivago CEO Johannes Thomas shares how he rose from intern to chief executive without finishing college, driven by curiosity and learning.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Johannes Thomas, CEO of Trivago. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2011, I took a six-month internship at Trivago. I was in my third year of university, nearing completion of a four-year degree in economics and tourism. I had started a digital travel company on the side, and I planned to learn from the internship and apply the new skills to my own company.\n\nThe internship came with a steep learning curve. Back then, the company had about 50 employees, many of whom were interns. I had a lot of responsibility and room to grow. Being at Trivago felt like playing in a crazy sandbox where I could try anything.\n\nI never had the expectation of following a traditional career path. My father was an entrepreneur who ran a tour company in Germany. I considered joining the family business, but I was interested in the digital side of tourism. Coming from an entrepreneurial family, I was taught to follow my curiosity.\n\nStill, my mother wasn't thrilled when I dropped out of school. She argued that I only had one more year, and I should just finish. I have no regrets about not getting my degree, however. I rarely think about it these days.\n\nMy internship at Trivago was focused on online marketing in the UK. At the time, Google's performance marketing was the new frontier. You couldn't learn about it at school, because once a book was published, its information was outdated.\n\nYou had to learn by trying things out, which gave young people like me a real advantage. Since I was able to understand performance marketing, I was hired to handle global search engine marketing. I stayed in that role for three years before moving on to strategic projects.\n\nI've changed jobs at Trivago every two to three years. I try to make myself obsolete within a team, and always move on to something that's a new learning experience. Since my internship, I've held six different positions.\n\nThe pandemic, which hit when I was chief revenue officer, was a near-death experience for Trivago. We lost 95% of our revenue within a matter of weeks. No one knew when it would come back.\n\nThat's when I stepped away from the company for the first time. I formed a startup with other Trivago folks. I'm still involved with that as an investor, but in 2023 I returned to Trivago as CEO.\n\nWhen I came back, the team was very demoralized. As the leader, I needed to take decisive actions to stabilize the company and create success. Luckily, travel came back stronger than ever. Today, Trivago has about 600 employees (down from about 1,500 before the pandemic), but we're able to make a great impact due to technology like AI.\n\nThree of the four leaders of Trivago started as interns, so my experience is not unique. We aim to be a company where people can grow long-term.\n\nTrivago still has a strong internship program: in fact, I've about doubled the number of interns since 2023. It's great for recruiting. When someone has a six-month internship, you really get to see whether they're going to contribute to your team.\n\nWhen I hire, I always ask people about their portfolio before I ask about their degree. A degree is important for getting into the workforce, but it becomes less important when you're able to demonstrate the real impact you've had. I've been successful because I take initiative and execute ideas. That's more important than any degree.",

While ⁠the Chinese and Dutch governments ‌eased restrictions on Nexperia, court fights and an internal battle are continuing.\n\nDISAGREEMENT ON WHAT TO TALK ABOUT\n\nA spokesperson for Nexperia BV said ‍the company was aware of the invitation, which follows its own call for talks with its Chinese operations in late November, but it had seen \"no indications of any willingness to engage ​in meaningful discussions on the restoration of the supply chain\".\n\nWhile Nexperia wants to ‌discuss restoring normal operations, Wingtech said on Wednesday that ownership and control questions must come first.\n\n\"(The) core prerequisite and fundamental basis for resolving Nexperia's current governance impasse is the restoration of Wingtech's lawful control,\" it said in a statement.\n\nArnold Croiset van Uchelen, the lawyer appointed as custodian of Nexperia's shares, confirmed he and court-appointed non-executive manager ⁠Guido Dierick had received a letter from Wingtech.\n\n\"We ​have indeed received an invitation like that, and ​we'll respond shortly,\" he told Reuters. \"We're available for a conversation, but about the who, what and where, we're not disclosing that in the media.\"\n\nNexperia's ‍Chinese packaging arm has ⁠declared independence and is seeking to replace European chip wafers with others made in China. The European production arm has halted wafer shipments to China, citing ⁠nonpayment. Stockpiles of the company's chips are dwindling and the car industry fears shortages may re-emerge in ‌January.",

    "description": "It's important to know.",
    "fullText": "Research suggests a surprising link between blood type and stroke risk, with people carrying one specific group A blood type facing a higher likelihood of stroke before age 60.\n\nThis discovery, published in a 2022 paper, deepens our understanding of how our unique biological makeup can impact our health.\n\n\"This important and surprising research finding adds to our current knowledge about non-modifiable risk factors for stroke – including a person's blood type,\" said University of Maryland physician-scientist Mark Gladwin when the study was published.\n\nWatch the video below for a summary:\n\nYou've probably heard of the A, B, AB, and O groups, which refer to the various chemical markers, known as antigens, found on the surface of our red blood cells.\n\nEven within these major blood types, there are subtle variations caused by mutations in the genes involved.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from 48 genetic studies, which included approximately 17,000 stroke patients and nearly 600,000 non-stroke controls. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 59.\n\nTheir findings revealed a clear relationship between the gene responsible for the A1 blood subgroup, and early-onset stroke.\n\n\"The number of people with early strokes is rising,\" senior author and vascular neurologist Steven Kittner from the University of Maryland said.\n\n\"These people are more likely to die from the life-threatening event, and survivors potentially face decades with disability. Despite this, there is little research on the causes of early strokes.\"\n\nA genome-wide search revealed two locations strongly associated with an earlier risk of stroke. One of these locations coincided with the spot where genes for blood type sit.\n\nA second analysis of specific types of blood-type genes then found people whose genome coded for a variation of the A group had a 16 percent higher chance of a stroke before the age of 60, compared with a population of other blood types.\n\nFor those with a gene for group O1, the risk was lower by 12 percent.\n\nThe researchers noted, however, that the additional risk of stroke in people with type A blood is small, so there is no need for extra vigilance or screening in this group.\n\n\"We still don't know why blood type A would confer a higher risk,\" said Kittner.\n\n\"But it likely has something to do with blood-clotting factors like platelets and cells that line the blood vessels as well as other circulating proteins, all of which play a role in the development of blood clots.\"\n\nWhile the study findings may seem alarming – that blood type could change early stroke risk – let's put these results into context.\n\nEach year in the US just under 800,000 individuals experience a stroke. Most of these events – around three out of every four – occur in people 65 years and older, with risks doubling every decade after the age of 55.\n\nAlso, the people included in the study lived in North America, Europe, Japan, Pakistan, and Australia, with people of non-European ancestry only making up 35 percent of participants. Future studies with a more diverse sample could help clarify the significance of the results.\n\n\"We clearly need more follow-up studies to clarify the mechanisms of increased stroke risk,\" Kittner said.\n\nAnother key finding of the study came from comparing people who had a stroke before the age of 60 to those that had a stroke after the age of 60.\n\nFor this, the researchers used a dataset of about 9,300 people over the age of 60 who had a stroke, and some 25,000 controls over the age of 60 who didn't have a stroke.\n\nThey found that the increased risk of stroke in the type A blood group became insignificant in the late-onset stroke group, suggesting that strokes that happen early in life may have a different mechanism compared to those that occur later on.\n\nStrokes in younger people are less likely to be caused by a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries (a process called atherosclerosis) and more likely to be caused by factors to do with clot formation, the authors said.\n\nThe study also found that people with type B blood were around 11 percent more likely to have a stroke compared to non-stroke controls regardless of their age.\n\nPrevious studies suggest that the part of the genome that codes for blood type, called the 'ABO locus', is associated with coronary artery calcification, which restricts blood flow, and heart attack.\n\nThe genetic sequences for A and B blood types have also been associated with a slightly higher risk of blood clots in veins, called venous thrombosis.\n\nThis paper was published in Neurology.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in September 2022.\n\nOne Critical Factor Predicts Longevity Better Than Diet or Exercise, Study Says\n\nBottled Water Isn't as Pure as You Might Think, Expert Warns\n\nNew Cancer Therapy Offers Hope For 'Incurable' Leukaemia in Early Trial",

    "description": "AI spending is front and center again for investors. Oracle plunged Thursday, with top hardware makers including Nvidia and Broadcom also dropping.",
    "fullText": "Oracle just raised a fresh red flag for investors worried that tech companies are getting ahead of themselves when it comes it their massive capex spending.\n\nOracle stock plunged 14% on Thursday after the tech giant reported an earnings beat but delivered revenue that was below Wall Street estimates, posting $16.06 billion compared to $16.21 billion expected by analysts. Cloud sales rose 34% from the previous quarter but also fell short of estimates.\n\nImportantly, Oracle also pledged to spend about $15 billion more next year than previously forecast, sparking fresh concerns about aggressive capex among the biggest tech firms.\n\nThe tech titan's stock drop was enough to weigh on other AI names and drag markets lower in Thursday's session.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood at the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Thursday:\n\n• Nasdaq 100: 25,563.72, down 0.8%\n\nOracle stock has been highly volatile lately, dropping almost 20% in the last month after a huge surge following a blockbuster revenue forecast issued in September.\n\nIt's flurry of deals cemented the company as an AI power player, announcing a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, new partnership commitments with both Nvidia and Meta Platforms, and plans to expand its AI and cloud computing infrastructure in booming international markets.\n\nNow Oracle's lackluster earnings are prompting speculation that its big plans in the space are going to take awhile to payoff, and that it's spending plans are too ambitious. Morgan Stanley described the results as a moment when investors might resume their disbelief about the AI trade.\n\n\"Cloud growth at the low-end of the guide with building pressure on gross margins and op margins may further sap investor confidence in ORCL's ability to execute efficiently against a large and growing book of GPUaaS business, leaving the shares lacking a clear catalyst,\" analysts at the bank wrote on Thursday.\n\nSeveral other high-growth AI stocks were pulled down by Oracle's earnings report, dragging down the entire S&P 500 index, which fell 0.31% in premarket hours, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index rose slightly.\n\nHere are some of the biggest losers on Thursday:\n\nFor many investors, it is likely concerning that a company like Oracle could manage to fall short of analyst estimates after doing so much to position itself as an AI infrastructure leader this year. The key takeaway is likely that the company overpromised on what it could deliver.\n\n\"Oracle faces its own mounting scrutiny over a debt-fueled data center build-out and concentration risk amid questions over the outcome of AI spending uncertainty,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"This revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending.\n\nThe concerns aren't limited to Oracle. While some have recently argued that the biggest AI fears may be overblown, it's possible that if one major tech player overspent on AI in 2025, others may have done the same. This could weigh on investor sentiment around AI as the market heads into 2026.",

This is a question posted by a Reddit user recently.\n\nThe original poster (OP) explained that he is 55 years old with $2.5 million in liquid investments but no debt. He is currently spending around $6,000 per month but would like to go up to $10K per month so he can afford to do more things he'd enjoy including traveling more, living better, and helping his brother.\n\nHe wanted to know if he'd be able to afford the extra spending and said he was OK with his net worth going down over time. So, given those parameters, is he OK to increase his expenditures?\n\nWhile $2.5 million may seem like a lot of money, the reality is that the OP is just 55 years old and he will need these funds to last for the rest of his life. So he must carefully decide on a safe withdrawal rate and can't just start taking money out because he wants to.\n\nExperts used to believe it was safe to withdraw 4.00% of your retirement funds in year one and then make adjustments based on inflation, but this was revised recently down to 3.7% because of concerns about longer lifespans and lower projected returns in the future. As a younger retiree, the OP really should err on the side of caution and follow the more conservative withdrawal rate.\n\nWith a $2.5 million nest egg, that would mean that he'd be able to withdraw around $92,500 per year. That puts him a little higher than his current $6K in spending, but not nearly to $10,000.\n\nHe'd be wise to limit his withdrawals to the recommended amount to avoid risking his nest egg running dry while he's still depending on his investments to live off.\n\nThe poster made clear in his Reddit thread that he was OK with spending down some of his money. However, just because you are comfortable with your portfolio balance going down a bit does not mean that you can exceed a safe withdrawal rate.",

    "description": "Chet Kittleson created Tin Can to help kids build independence, make their own plans, and connect confidently through simple, screen-free communication.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chet Kittleson, founder of Tin Can. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three years ago, I was picking my daughter up from school and started chatting with parents about how arduous it is to run the kids' social lives. One mom said that she felt like an executive assistant for her daughter. There was a lot of frustration and angst toward the kids, and as a dad of three, I understood it.\n\nBut that day, I played devil's advocate. What else are the kids supposed to do, I asked. My first social network was the landline, but my kids didn't have that. Most of the parents I knew were delaying cellphones, but that left the kids reliant on us for coordinating meet-ups.\n\nI got to thinking: wouldn't it be cool if there was a landline my kids — who are now 10, 8, and 5 — could use to organize their own social dates?\n\nI had been working at the tech and real estate company Redfin, which I loved because the company environment allowed me to be a rising executive and an active dad. Still, I had this itch to build a company of my own. I left to start another real estate-related company, but ultimately, we didn't have a product-market fit, and had to call it quits after about two years.\n\nThe same week I wrapped up that venture, I brought my co-founders over to talk about making my landline idea a reality. We spent a week at my kitchen table, making prototypes. By the end of the week, we had five phones.\n\nTwo of the prototypes went to my daughter's friends. Right away, we started noticing the kids organizing more playdates and sleepovers. My favorite moment came when the phone rang at about 8:15 in the morning. My daughter's friend was inviting her to walk to school for the first time.\n\nRight away, I started getting texts from other local parents, asking if they could get a phone. I made about 50 prototypes and installed them myself. I asked customers what they liked about the phone and what they were worried about when it comes to kids and tech, which helped me refine the product.\n\nWe officially started selling Tin Cans in April of this year. For parents, the phone is a symbol of a simpler time. For kids who have often never experienced independent communication, it delivers a new superpower they didn't know they wanted.\n\nToday, we have Tin Cans in every state and Canada. We've raised $3.5 million. I'm excited to build a different type of technology company: one that uses tech to build connections and healthy relationships.\n\nPersonally, that's extremely meaningful to me because I've always struggled with anxiety and had my own challenges with screen addiction. I stopped using social media a few years ago after noticing that it was distracting me from moments with my kids.\n\nToday, my family has two Tin Cans: one in a shared area of the home and another in my oldest's room. These days, my kids frequently get calls from friends asking them to walk to school. They have more sleepovers or just chat with their grandparents.\n\nThere are also more subtle changes. When we pick up takeout, my kids are often the ones to go in and claim the order. That confidence is a symbol of the strong, autonomous children my wife and I are trying to raise.\n\nOne mother told us that Tin Can helped her daughter find her voice — literally. The girl started off talking quietly and timidly, but within weeks, was louder. That confidence translates to the real world, and the Tin Can lifestyle we're hoping to foster.",

    "fullText": "It's looking like SAVE can't be saved — and it'll mean millions of borrowers could soon face higher monthly payments.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced a settlement with the State of Missouri to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nSince last summer, SAVE — created by former President Joe Biden — has been paused due to litigation from Missouri and other GOP-led states. The plan was designed to provide affordable monthly payments to the 7 million enrolled borrowers, along with a shorter timeline for loan forgiveness.\n\nIf a court approves the settlement, the department will stop accepting new applications to SAVE, require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan, and resume payments.\n\nThe Trump administration is \"bringing an end to this deceptive scheme,\" Nicholas Kent, the undersecretary of education, said in a statement. \"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back.\"\n\nThe proposed settlement is pending court approval, and borrowers will not face any changes until the court finalizes it. If the settlement is approved, borrowers will have \"a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan and resume repayment.\n\nIn addition to the 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE, the Department of Education said that 450,000 borrowers have \"expressed interest in enrolling in the plan\" and will be affected by the settlement, as well.\n\nThe proposed settlement said that the department would deny pending applications and help borrowers transition out of SAVE, and it would undergo negotiated rulemaking — which includes negotiations with stakeholders on the department's proposal — to effectuate the settlement.\n\nThe department did not provide a timeline for the negotiated rulemaking process.\n\nCarolyn Fast, the director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that borrowers who transition out of SAVE will likely face higher monthly payments. She referred to the Repayment Assistance Plan, a new plan the department is set to launch in July 2026, which would allow for loan forgiveness after 30 years.\n\n\"It is less generous in terms of monthly payments, and also to the extent that you have to be in the program longer before you can get forgiveness,\" Fast said.\n\nWhile the department resumed interest charges on SAVE plan accounts in August, enrolled borrowers previously had until 2028 to transition to a new plan. This proposed settlement accelerates that timeline, and it would be a significant undertaking for servicers to carry out, Fast said.\n\nAbby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, said that eliminating SAVE \"without access to a clear and affordable alternative is reckless and short-sighted, creating even more needless confusion, uncertainty, and financial stress for millions of Americans already struggling with the rising cost of living.\"\n\n\"In the midst of a national affordability crisis, their way forward is murky and complicated,\" she said.",

    "description": "Michael Burry pointed to the Fed's plan to start purchasing short-term Treasurys as a sign of weakness in the banking system.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry thinks he's spotted another sign of trouble in the US financial system.\n\nThe famed investor of \"The Big Short\" said he was eyeing one comment in particular that came out the Fed's meeting on Wednesday. That's the mention that the FOMC believes the Fed's reserve balances had declined to \"ample levels\" — and that the central bank would start making \"reserve management purchases.\"\n\nIt's a jargony way of saying the Fed will start purchasing short-term US Treasurys \"on an ongoing basis,\" per the committee's statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPurchasing short-term T-bills — which the Fed will start doing on December 12 and total around $40 billion a month — is one way the central bank can boost liquidity in markets and the banking sector. It's slightly different from quantitative easing, which is when the Fed purchases long-term Treasurys to stimulate the economy by keeping a lid on borrowing costs. However, in the short term, it has a similar effect of boosting the amount of money circulating through the financial system, making it easier for banks to meet their reserve requirements.\n\nBut the fact that the Fed has to provide that support at all is a worrying sign, in Burry's view. The Fed's reserve balances currently hover around $2.8 trillion, according to the latest weekly data from the central bank.\n\n\"I would add if the US banking system can't function without $3+ trillion in reserves/life support from the Fed, that is not a sign of strength but a sign of fragility,\" Burry wrote in a post on X Wednesday evening. \"So I'd say US Banks are getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nStocks surged after the Fed's policy meeting, largely fueled by optimism about the central bank's plan to purchase short-term Treasury bills, JPMorgan's market intelligence team wrote in a note.\n\nThe purchase of short-term Treasurys marks the first time the Fed has meaningfully expanded its balance sheet since it ended its quantitative easing prgram in 2022, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.\n\n\"Seems that after every crisis now the Fed needs to expand its balance sheet permanently or guarantee a bank funding crisis. No wonder stocks are doing well,\" Burry said, adding that he was avoiding bank stocks and choosings to keep his money in cash accounts or Treasury money market funds.\n\n\"Rip QT; long live 'reserve management purchases,'\" he added.\n\nBurry, who correctly called the subprime mortgage crisis, has cemented his reputation as a permabear in recent years. Since returning to social media this year, he has repeatedly sounded the alarm on a stock market bubble, unveiled fresh bets against AI titans like Nvidia, and warned about the huge amounts of spending by the biggest tech companies.",

    "fullText": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be freed from immigration detention while he fights his deportation, a judge ruled Thursday, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis.\n\n“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.\n\n“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, and messages seeking comment from Abrego Garcia’s attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nA court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials' affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.\n\nXinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.\n\nSeparately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHe is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

    "description": "These AI startups founded by bright young minds in their teens and early 20s are disrupting industries and attracting top investors in the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "They are moving fast, raising serious cash, and leaving established paths behind. Across Business Insider's Young Geniuses series, which highlights next-gen leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs, urgency is the constant.\n\nThe AI window has opened, but it may not stay that way for long. That's why these young founders are fleeing college classrooms, skipping dream internships, and leaving full-time roles to take advantage of this moment.\n\nA Stanford graduate student dropped out and raised $64 million for her AI math company. A pair of MIT freshmen dropouts secured $2.7 million for their police tech startup.\n\nThese are just a couple of young founders who are stepping into the AI race at full speed, backed by investors willing to bet early and big, driven by the sense that hesitation costs more than risk.\n\nMeet 16 young founders who spoke with Business Insider this year about their ideas for transforming everything from healthcare and shopping to how we interact with technology and one another. (Ages and figures are accurate to the time of reporting.)\n\nZach Yadegari, 18, sold his first video gaming app at age 16 for almost $100,000 and used the proceeds to fund Cal AI, an AI-powered nutrition app he co-founded.\n\nHe first discovered an interest in coding at a coding camp his parents sent him to when he was 7. For years, he'd spend hours watching people program video games on YouTube and try to emulate them.\n\nHe got the idea for Cal AI while trying to bulk up at the gym and quickly learning that most results come from diet. So, he and his co-founders set out to build a calorie-tracking app that integrates AI technology.\n\nOver the last year and a half, the app has taken off, generating around $30 million in annual revenue and employing a 30-person team, Yadegari told BI reporter Agnes Applegate in October.\n\nCarina Hong, 24, is on a mission to build a superintelligent reasoning system through her AI startup, Axiom Math.\n\nHong, a Rhodes Scholar, dropped out of her graduate studies at Stanford to found the company in March and has since hired top talent across Meta's Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) lab, Meta's GenAI team, and Google Brain.\n\n\"One thing I heard from some of the top researchers and mathematicians I've recruited to Axiom is that solving for mathematical superintelligence will be their legacy,\" Hong told BI reporter Geoff Weiss in December. \"When the problem is hard enough, talent density gets very high, and that makes you a magnet for other great thinkers.\"\n\nAnd Hong isn't only recruiting from Big Tech. She has also hired her former professor, the renowned mathematician Ken Ono.\n\nArlan Rakhmetzhanov, 18, dropped out of high school in Kazakhstan in March 2025 to pursue his AI coding agents startup, Nozomio, at Y Combinator, a startup accelerator for many young founders.\n\nBoth of his parents are entrepreneurs, so his entrepreneurial journey began at a young age. He taught himself coding and built his first company at 15.\n\nHis journey to Y Combinator wasn't easy. He applied twice before finally getting accepted the third time. Even though he didn't have a Stanford PhD, he was told his YC partner selected him because he ships fast, which is critical in the age of AI, he told BI's Weiss in September.\n\nPhoebe Gates, daughter of Bill Gates, and Sophia Kianni launched an AI-powered shopping assistant in April and said it had reached 600,000 users by October, when they spoke with BI's Jordan Hart.\n\nBoth 23 at the time of their interview, Kianni and Gates met as roommates at Stanford University, where they conceived the idea for Phia.\n\nPhia is a free app and browser extension that uses AI to help compare prices on fashion items across tens of thousands of linked sites to help users find deals.\n\nThe duo raised $8 million in a seed funding round in September, led by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and featuring investors such as Kris Jenner, Hailey Bieber, and Michael Rubin.\n\nToby Brown, 16, has been fascinated with tech from a young age. His parents aren't in tech, but that hasn't stopped him from teaching himself to code everything, from math games to alarm systems.\n\nIn 2023, he developed the concept for his AI project Beem. \"I can't share too much about it,\" he told BI's Joshua Nelken-Zitser in October. \"I hope that if done right, it will redefine how people interact with technology.\"\n\nHe dedicated his summer break 2024 to pitching to firms and other potential investors in London, New York, Silicon Valley, and San Francisco. \"There was nobody to coach me on pitching to investors, so I just took a maniacal approach of bashing away at it until I got the right solution,\" he said.\n\nIn November 2024, he got a call from South Park Commons, founded by some of Facebook's early engineers, saying they wanted to invest $1 million in Beem. Instead of finishing school exams the following year, he left the UK to pursue his project in Silicon Valley.\n\nOne day in her Harvard University dorm room, Alyx van der Vorm felt lonely. Her friends were out of town, and while she could easily open an app to order food or stream a movie, she wanted more. Enter Clyx.\n\nVan der Vorm, 25, founded the social app in 2020 and has since rolled it out in four major cities worldwide: Miami, London, New York, and São Paulo.\n\nClyx is a social app that leverages AI to connect people in real life. It utilizes AI-powered tools to scrape events from across the web, converts those events into meetups within the app, and then helps identify which of your friends are attending the event or matches you with new connections if you don't know anyone going.\n\nAt the time of reporting, Clyx had 50,0000 active users joining events and about 200,000 looking at events, BI's Sydney Bradley reported in September.\n\nMathieu Rihet, 19, saw the inefficiencies of the healthcare system firsthand while working as a medical translator. So, he set out to try and fix some of it.\n\nHe met Georges Casassovici, 18, via his LinkedIn post seeking a non-technical cofounder to build with. Together, the two of them founded Novoflow, an AI startup that builds AI agents for medical clinics to help automate tasks, starting with cancellation recovery and appointment booking.\n\nBoth told BI's Weiss in November that they have no plans to pursue a college degree after leaving school to join Y Combinator's Spring 2025 class.\n\nRudy Arora and Sarthak Dhawan, both 20, met in sixth grade, and by high school, they were coding and building viral apps together, including a Christmas light installation app that made $60,000 in annual revenue one year.\n\nWhen they both started college in 2023, Dhawan said he struggled to take notes and listen to the teacher at the same time. So, he and Arora set out to build an AI-powered notetaking app called Turbo AI. It's attracting 20,000 new users per day, BI's Lakshmi Varanasi reported in November.\n\nSince launching Turbo AI, they've both now dropped out of college and say their startup is on track to earn eight-figures in annual recurring revenue.\n\nCollege juniors Nathaneo Johnson and Sean Hargrow say LinkedIn has become bloated with vanity metrics like follower counts and likes, which distract from the professional qualities that matter when landing a job.\n\nSo, they launched their own AI social network while attending Yale. Skipping the likes and clicks, Series connects professionals over text message. The idea is that it only focuses on who you are and what you can bring to the table, Hargow told BI's Bradley in April.\n\nBalancing college and a startup isn't easy. Johnson later told BI's Nelken Zitser that he often ends up working 120-hour weeks to manage both.\n\nOver the summer, 19-year-old Christine Zhang turned down an internship to spend two months living in a hacker house. There, she built a startup with her college roommate and cofounder, and by the end of the summer, they'd raised $1 million for it.\n\nInstead of returning to Harvard, she's taking a gap year to stay in San Francisco and help scale her startup, which has grown to six people, she told BI's Applegate in October.\n\n\"I miss a lot of things about school. I had to delete my Instagram during the first week of classes so I wouldn't get FOMO. However, I don't regret my decision,\" she said.\n\nEarly this year, Aidan Guo, 19, and Julian Windeck, 23, launched their startup, Attention Engineering, which is essentially a desktop assistant powered by AI to automate everything you do on your computer, much like a \"cursor for everything,\" Guo told BI's Varanasi in November.\n\nGuo said he's on his \"second gap year\" from college. He found encouraging mentors by joining programs like Z Fellows and Emergent Ventures. Ultimately, he decided to forgo Carnegie Mellon and move to the Bay Area to build his startup.\n\nWindeck studied computer science in Germany and at Cambridge University, and then conducted AI research at MIT before deciding academia wasn't for him.\n\nThe two met through mutual friends, discovered they worked well together, and have since raised over $1 million from noteworthy backers, including Lukas Haas, a product manager at Google DeepMind, Marvin von Hagen and Felix Schlegal, the cofounders of Interaction, and Bryan Pellegrino, the cofounder of LayerZero.\n\nJay Neo, 21, has been studying what makes a video go viral since he was a teen.\n\nAt 18, he landed a job with MrBeast, helping make short-form video content and learning the ins and outs of how the YouTube mogul grows his business and popularity. For the last year and a half, however, Neo has been focused on his own AI startup called Palo.\n\nPalo is a content creator's assistant. It utilizes AI to analyze a creator's entire catalog and then writes scripts for short-form videos with related themes, outlining content with storyboards. It also has its own network, where creators can follow one another.\n\nLarge-language AI models \"are a perfect thing not for replacing the creator, but for analyzing every little thing,\" Neo told BI's Bradley in November.\n\nShraman and Shreyas Kar, 19 and 20, participated in hackathons together throughout middle and high school.\n\nThey were busy studying at Stanford when they were accepted to Y Combinator, and seeing their peers take the risk and drop out of Stanford gave them the courage to do so, too.\n\nThey began working on their AI startup, Golpo, while at Stanford. Golpo generates animated explainer videos from documents and prompts. For example, customers can use it to create interactive lessons for school districts or training programs for work.\n\nAs of mid-October, 14,000 people had generated videos with Golpo, Shraman Kar told BI's Weiss.\n\nGeorge Cheng and Dylan Nguyen, both 19, dropped out of MIT as freshmen and raised $2.7 million in seed funding out of Y Combinator for their tech startup Code Four, which aims to arm police officers with AI.\n\nThey say their technology can generate reports from bodycam footage for record-keeping, redact footage and reports for records requests, and generate transcriptions and summaries from video interviews and security footage. Basically, it aims to reduce the time spent on paperwork, allowing officers to dedicate more time in the field.\n\nCode Four is working with 25 police departments, BI's Weiss reported in November. While Code Four uses AI to generate preliminary drafts of reports, officers review and edit them for accuracy, Cheng said.\n\n\"Many of the great AI companies of the next decade are being built right now, and I want to be a part of that,\" Raymond Zhao told BI's Nelken-Zitser in October.\n\nZhao studied math and statistics at the University of Oxford, thinking he wanted to enter the financial sector. However, after an uninspiring internship at Goldman Sachs, Zhao ultimately pursued AI instead.\n\nWhile at Oxford, he joined the venture capital society, which introduced him to a network of VCs, founders, and one of his future cofounders. They've raised about $1 million in pre-seed funding for their AI startup, Structured AI, and are pursuing it further at Y Combinator.\n\nStructured AI builds AI agents that can perform quality control on technical documents and drawings. It's laying the groundwork for the AI workforce for construction design and engineering.\n\nDavid Kobrosky, 26, dropped out of college twice. The first time was to work for businessman and social media personality Gary Vaynerchuk, at his company VaynerX. The second was to launch his own company, Intros AI.\n\nKobrosky said he always thought AI would play a huge role in how humans interact, and that's exactly what Intros AI does. Intros AI was acquired by software company Bevy in July.\n\nCompanies can use Intros AI's product to connect their most active customers to each other, creating a space for knowledge sharing and networking that helps boost their customer retention, BI's Charissa Cheong reported in November.\n\nKobrosky didn't disclose the amount he sold Intros AI for, but he is now an AI product manager at Bevy, earning over $100,000 a year, plus bonuses. \"I think starting and selling a company sets me up for the future in a way that a more traditional path wouldn't have,\" he told Cheong.",

New England fishermen, especially those from Maine, used to catch millions of pounds of small pink shrimp in the winter, but the business has been under a fishing moratorium since 2014.

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Regulators voted Thursday to extend a shutdown preventing New England fishermen from catching shrimp, a historic industry that has recently fallen victim to warming oceans.\n\nNew England fishermen, especially those from Maine, used to catch millions of pounds of small pink shrimp in the winter, but the business has been under a fishing moratorium since 2014. Rising temperatures have created an inhospitable environment for the shrimp, and their population is too low to fish sustainably, scientists have said.\n\nAn arm of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Thursday to shut down the fishery for at least another three years. Abundance of the shrimp remained “poor” this year despite slightly improved environmental conditions, the Atlantic States said in documents.\n\nThe decision came after shrimp harvesters were allowed to catch a small number of shrimp as part of an industry-funded sampling and data collection program. The fishermen, who battled some rough weather, caught only 70 shrimp totaling less than 3 pounds.\n\nHowever, \"even with the bad weather, exceptionally low catch levels observed throughout the program reinforce concerns about the viability of the northern shrimp stock in the Gulf of Maine,” the documents state.\n\nNew England shrimp were a winter delicacy when the fishery was active, and fishermen sometimes caught more than 10 million pounds (4,536 kilograms) of them in a year. The small pink shrimp were a small part of the country's large wild caught shrimp industry, which catches some of the most valuable seafood in the world.\n\nMaine's catch of shrimp cratered in 2013, when fishermen caught less than 600,000 pounds (272,155 kilograms) of the crustaceans after hauling more than eight times that the previous year. Fishing groups have sometimes lobbied for the shrimping industry to be reopened on a smaller scale basis, but most former Maine shrimpers have moved on to other species.",

    "description": "Instead of our usual big holiday celebration with extended family, the four of us spent Christmas traveling and making new traditions on our trip.",
    "fullText": "Christmas is a really, really big deal in our house.\n\nIt's when our close-knit extended family gets together to celebrate, feast, and spend time with one another.\n\nHowever, my husband, two young kids, and I spent last Christmas sitting in our caravan on a remote beach in South Australia, just the four of us.\n\nIt was a far cry from the holidays before. But after years of deliberating, we'd just recently packed up our lives and belongings and headed toward the Australian outback for a yearlong adventure in a small caravan.\n\nComing home for Christmas wasn't an option — but, with a bit of planning, we still ended up having a brilliant (and unique) holiday.\n\nWhen you travel with everything you own packed into a caravan, space is at a premium.\n\nWe would've loved a standard Christmas tree, but we opted for a small, travel-sized version that had been stashed in the back of a cupboard for months as it silently traveled Australia.\n\nAs the holiday season approached, we dug out the tree and our kids decorated with the small selection of trimmings we'd brought with us.\n\nQuickly, the whole caravan turned into a Christmas ornament, with tinsel and fairy lights hanging from every nook and cranny. To our surprise, it was really magical. The kids loved the space so much that the lights stayed up long after December 25.\n\nWe also got creative when planning our Christmas feast, especially since our caravan doesn't have an oven and we'd be miles from any major city on the big day.\n\nInstead of roasting a whole bird, we made nachos with our barbecue and stove and topped them with ground turkey and other fixings.\n\nWhile sitting on a blanket on a beach, we used our best plastic plates and shared our low-stress Christmas-inspired feast. As a bonus, cleaning up after dinner was a breeze.\n\nLike any inquisitive 4-year-old, my daughter asked: \"How will Santa find us?\" She was concerned we didn't have a chimney, a letterbox, or even space for Santa to fit in our van.\n\nOnce again, we did some serious problem-solving. Thanks to the magic of Christmas — and preparations we made months in advance — Santa did find us.\n\nGrandparents also wanted to send gifts, which proved difficult on the road. Since we'd be in a remote area at Christmastime and unable to receive parcels, we arranged for relatives to get their presents to a town we knew we'd be visiting a few weeks prior.\n\nThen, we hid them in the van the best we could until Christmas Day.\n\nThat morning, thanks satellite coverage and modern technology, we were able to video call members our extended family so they could see the kids unwrap their gifts.\n\nOur holiday wasn't traditional, and we'll absolutely remember it for years to come.\n\nBeing on the road forced us to problem-solve and come up with ideas as an extended family. It allowed us to rethink many traditions and leave some behind simply because, logistically, they couldn't happen.\n\nInstead, we created new traditions and memories as a young family, while still staying connected with loved ones over video calls.\n\nWould we do it again? Absolutely. But this year, we plan to celebrate in person with our larger family again … and we might even bring the turkey nachos!",

    "title": "I thought reality TV was trash, then 'Real Housewives' helped me connect with my daughter while she's at college",
    "description": "I once dismissed reality shows like 'RHOSLC,' but now I tune in happily. Watching gives me a way to talk about important issues with my 22-year-old.",
    "fullText": "As a former English literature major, I really thought I was above reality TV.\n\nI don't watch a lot of content, and when I do, I'm more of a \"Game of Thrones\" person than a \"Real Housewives\" person. I love analyzing themes, motives, and emotional arcs, and I assumed the Bravo franchise had nothing to offer but mindless drama.\n\nFor years, I had avoided the shows and would usually leave the room when my teenage daughter turned them on. Today, things have changed. I now happily watch the drama, appreciative of how my daughter and I have connected and found a way to talk about important topics through what many consider to be a guilty-pleasure show.\n\nMy daughter went off to college, and got busier, more independent, and harder to read from a distance. I missed her like crazy and often felt like I had fewer and fewer windows into the woman she was becoming.\n\nSo when she suggested I watch an episode of \"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,\" a show I'd long viewed as the epitome of trash TV, I surprised us both by reconsidering.\n\nEven though we were two states away from each other, while my daughter is away at school, I decided to watch an episode on my own. I didn't expect to like it, but I love my daughter more than I dislike reality TV, so I gave it a try.\n\nWhen I sat down for my first episode, I expected tacky glam, tired stereotypes, and fake conflict, and I got all of that. But I also saw a lot more, including women wrestling with shame and accountability, resisting unrealistic expectations, confronting faith transitions, and reinventing themselves after major midlife upheavals.\n\nTo my surprise, I was hooked, especially when I started talking through the storylines with my daughter.\n\nI was shocked at how fast the show became our shared language. We started out laughing at the bad behavior and wild fashion, but soon the conversations deepened, and we found ourselves discussing body image, mental health, and relationships, especially women's friendships. In fact, we've talked \n\nWatching \"RHOSLC\" has opened a new connection between my daughter and me at a stage of parenting when I wasn't sure how to reach her. Through our weekly Housewives debriefs, I've learned so much about her views on loyalty, identity, ambition, faith, and belonging.\n\nShe notices patterns in relationships that took me decades to understand. Her emotional intelligence, especially her ability to call out toxicity and name her boundaries, reassures me that she's not just okay, she's thriving.\n\nAnd in turn, I've been able to share my own insights, not in my lecturing \"mom voice,\" but as another woman navigating friendships, reinvention, and societal pressures. Watching the show has created a neutral space where we can meet as equals, rather than parent and child.\n\nI'm still not a fan of how the show perpetuates negative stereotypes, promotes conspicuous consumption, and glamorizes toxic relationships for entertainment value. But I appreciate how the show gives us a way to talk openly about those issues. Watching women in midlife grapple with everything from body image to an empty nest provides young women with a wider, more complex picture of adulthood than they might find elsewhere.\n\nThis experience has changed how I think about connecting with my adult children. Sometimes the best bridge isn't a carefully crafted heart-to-heart, it's the willingness to try new things and meet them where they are. And I'm reminded that I would do anything for my kids. Even watch reality TV.",

    "description": "Darth Vader and other Disney characters are coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app as part of a three-year licensing deal.",
    "fullText": "Darth Vader is coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app.\n\nThe House of Mouse and OpenAI struck a three-year licensing agreement on Thursday to make Disney \"the first major content licensing partner on Sora.\"\n\nIt's also investing $1 billion into the AI pioneer and receiving warrants to purchase additional equity.\n\nShares of Disney climbed over 2% after the opening bell.\n\n\"As part of this new, three-year licensing agreement, Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that can be viewed and shared by fans, drawing from a set of more than 200 animated, masked and creature characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, including costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments,\" OpenAI said in a Thursday announcement.\n\nIn addition to striking a licensing deal, Disney is also becoming a \"major customer\" of the AI company, according to the announcement, and buying ChatGPT enterprise licenses for its employees.\n\nWhile Sora, OpenAI's TikTok-like AI video app, has been generating buzz and downloads since its launch earlier this year, users of the company's more popular product, ChatGPT, will also have access to AI versions of Disney's characters as part of the deal.\n\nThe AI-generated Disney characters will be available starting in early 2026.\n\nThe move is likely to prove controversial in Hollywood, where many actors have publicly voiced concern about AI use and concerns over how their likeness is used. Disney and OpenAI stated that \"the agreement does not include any talent likenesses or voices.\"\n\nCreators are core to Disney, and its CEO Bob Iger stressed that the deal represented no threat to creators.\n\n\"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday.\n\n\"The other thing it does is it enables us to be comfortable that Open AI is putting guardrails essentially around how these are used, so that really there's nothing for us to be concerned about from a consumer perspective, meaning this will be a safe environment and a safe way for consumers to engage with our founders in a new way,\" he added.\n\nIger hinted at such a transaction during the company's most recent earnings call, making extensive comments about the potential he sees for AI to enhance Disney's direct-to-consumer strategy. He said the company was having extensive talks with AI companies to protect its IP as well as generate more engagement with users.\n\nHis comments demonstrate how Disney — like other Hollywood players — is looking for new ways for people to interact with its platforms and brands as user-generated content platforms and independent creators gain popularity.\n\nDisney, like those other players, has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content, while YouTube has grown. The bet with AI is that it can get people to spend more time on its platforms by giving them more ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nThe companies hinted as much in the announcement, saying that they would \"collaborate to utilize OpenAI's models to power new experiences for Disney + subscribers.\"\n\nDisney is also wary of the tech's risk to its IP. In June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. The suit is ongoing.\n\nDisney's $1 billion cash infusion comes at a critical time for OpenAI, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $1.4 trillion the AI company has pledged to spend over the next eight years on data centers.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously said that large rights holders would ultimately welcome their content being used on Sora, provided it was done with proper guardrails in place. His comments came after OpenAI stepped up restrictions on the Sora app in the wake of viral user-generated videos depicting SpongeBob as Walter White and Pikachu in \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\n\n\"Most of the rights holders that I've spoken to are actually extremely excited to get their content in here,\" Altman told tech analyst Ben Thompson in October. \"They just want to be able to set more restrictions than they would need for images because videos feel different.\"",

A line of text that was discovered references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is \"moving out of state.\" Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, \"Our son is finally moving away from home.\" People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now.",

    "description": "AI bubble be damned, the data center bet still looks great according to the top private markets investors. Just be careful who you're leasing to.",
    "fullText": "Concerns of an AI bubble may be mounting, but at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference on Wednesday, the biggest private investors were bullish on their own investments.\n\nBlackstone President Jon Gray said it was the firm's biggest moneymaker. Ares CEO Michael Arougheti said that the firm's international data center investments are accelerating ahead of expectations and boosting revenue expectations. Blue Owl co-CEO Doug Ostrover said the firm is \"incredibly bullish\" on its own data center investments.\n\nAll signs point to a continued investment boon.\n\n\"If you \" Gray said.\n\nApollo CEO Marc Rowan said that no matter where he is in the world, the world's biggest users of \"compute\" (data center capacity) tell him they need more of it.\n\n\"When are they going to get more compute?\" Rowan said. \"No time soon, because there are natural limits and there are energy limits and there are regulatory limits and zoning and everything else.\"\n\nOstrover said he has \"never seen a market\" with this level of supply-demand imbalance, and he sees \"demand accelerating,\" but he doesn't \"see the supply increasing.\"\n\nHowever, behind the excitement, the industry's biggest investors are mulling over the risk they can't capture right now — whether leases for these data centers will be renewed 15 to 20 years from now.\n\nRowan, looking at the present situation with his \"credit hat\" on, said, \"The risk I'm prepared to take is lease-up risk,\" Rowan said. \"The risk I'm not prepared to take is renewal risk.\"\n\nRowan said he has a chart on the wall of his office that compares different big consulting firms' projections of energy usage in 2030, and the \"spread is like a child throwing darts.\"\n\n\"The experts in this have no idea on energy use, much less chip use, compute, the impact of quantum.\" Rowan said. \"Do I really want to, with my credit hat on, take renewal risk?\"\n\nThe answer is no, and Rowan said there are plenty of ways for a credit investor to make money without taking renewal risk. In equity, you're betting on renewals, with the possibility of massive upsides or the \"chance of losing everything.\"\n\n\"There will be both great fortunes made and lost in the equity of data centers,\" Rowan said.\n\nOne way to make those bets a little safer is to vet who you're betting on.\n\nBlackstone, a major infrastructure investor, is only betting on \"long-term lease data centers where you don't put a shovel in the ground until you have a 15-plus year lease with a very large market cap company.\"\n\nOther potential bets include the power behind the AI revolution. It may be true that projections of power usage in 2030 are disparate, but they're probably all up and to the right.\n\n\"I can't come up with a scenario where we're not using significantly more power five years from today,\" said Gray.\n\nOne way to do it is to sign favorable leases with the best tenants. Blue Owl has a large \"triple-net-lease\" business, an industry term for commercial leases where taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs are paid by the tenant, instead of the landlord.\n\nUsually, Ostrover said, these leases are to solid businesses like Walgreens or Cracker Barrel, with 3% annual increases over 15 to 20-year leases. They're investment-grade tenants, around BBB credit, and have generated \"in excess of 20% return in that product.\"\n\nNow, they get those same terms with A or AA-credit tenants.\n\n\"So now, we're faced with an opportunity where instead of working with Walgreens, Cracker Barrel, firms like that, we can go to Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, the biggest companies in the world, signing identical 20-year leases,\" Ostrover said.\n\nThat way, even if they can't renew a lease, they're making their money.\n\n\"The way we look at it to our downside is even if the facilities are worth zero at the end of their lives, we can still make a teens return,\" Ostrover said.\n\nA Blue Owl spokesperson told BI that the firm's \"expectation\" is that there'll be \"meaningful residual value\" at the end of a lease.",

    "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company's licensing deal with OpenAI will let it capitalize on a fast-growing technology and engage younger audiences.",
    "fullText": "Disney CEO Bob Iger says his company's major licensing deal with OpenAI is all about establishing a foothold in a new realm of entertainment and engaging younger audiences.\n\nThe licensing agreement gives ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora video platform access to Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader. Disney is also investing $1 billion in the AI company and becoming a \"major customer.\"\n\nSpeaking on CNBC about the deal with OpenAI's Sam Altman on Thursday, Iger said it gives Disney a chance to get in on a fast-growing area of tech.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" Iger said.\n\nIger said the deal also fulfills a longtime desire by Disney to put user-generated content on its Disney+ streaming platform. Disney initially plans to put select videos created on Sora onto Disney+ to increase engagement with users, especially younger ones. Ultimately, Iger wants to let Disney+ users create such videos within the platform itself.\n\n\"That's a big step for us,\" he said.\n\nDisney has long been highly protective of its famous characters and storylines, and Iger is widely seen in Hollywood as a champion of the creative set. But like other entertainment players, Disney has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content. Social media and user-generated content, in contrast, continue to rise. The bet with OpenAI is that the deal can get people to spend more time on Disney platforms by giving them new ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nIger has long positioned the company as pro-technology, and he said, in reference to the OpenAI deal, that he'd rather participate in technological innovation than be disrupted by it.\n\n\"We think this is actually a way for us to be part of these developments, as opposed to being harmed by them,\" he said.\n\nIger said the deal is also a way for Disney to participate in the big rise in user-generated short-form video on social-media platforms.\n\nAltman said Thursday that the demand for Disney characters, in particular, is \"off the charts\" on OpenAI's products. He said he sees the deal enabling people to do things like putting themselves in a lightsaber scene from \"Star Wars\" or creating a custom birthday video for their kid using the Buzz Lightyear character.\n\nAI firms have been \"frenemies\" to media companies, as many in Hollywood are concerned about how they use copyrighted material and the threat that they could pose to the creative process. Iger said the OpenAI deal is good for creators rather than a threat.\n\n\"This does not in any way represent a threat to the creators at all. In fact, the opposite,\" Iger said. \"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it.\"\n\nDisney said the agreement does not include any talent likeness or voices and that OpenAI would have guardrails in place to make sure Disney's IP was used in a safe way.\n\nIn June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons.

    "description": "A grandmother from New Orleans stays healthy at 79 with daily walking, social clubs, and two workouts a day. Science says she has the right idea.",
    "fullText": "When I first met 79-year-old Anne Thibodeaux, she was fresh out of two back-to-back workout classes and excited to show me what she was reading for book club.\n\nThe book was \"Outlive,\" a longevity handbook from Dr. Peter Attia, an anti-aging specialist beloved by tech CEOs and Hollywood actors, and now, apparently, this grandmother from New Orleans.\n\nThe funny thing, Thibodeaux told me via Zoom last month, is that Attia's advice for a long life matches what she's been doing for decades already.\n\nWe all might want to take a page out of her book when it comes to longevity.\n\nThibodeaux said she works out 11 times a week, on average, doing everything from yoga to dance to strength and stability training. Her social calendar is packed. In her free time, she loves to garden, check out museums, and hit the dance floor.\n\nThese habits, which Thibodeaux believes have kept her vibrant and healthy, are science-backed strategies for healthier aging.\n\nThibodeaux has been retired for more than two decades, but spent her career teaching and never lost her love of learning.\n\nThese days, she channels her curiosity into learning new types of exercise (among other things).\n\nHer weekly routine includes a variety of different virtual classes from SilverSneakers, an exercise program for adults 65 and older (available at no cost with eligible Medicare plans).\n\nThat's why, flipping through Attia's book, she found his anti-aging exercise recommendations were already familiar.\n\nStability work? Check, her regular classes include plenty of core and balance moves.\n\nStrength training? Check, courtesy of dumbbell exercises.\n\nLow-intensity cardio? Double-check: Thibodeaux loves to dance in class and out on the town.\n\nThibodeaux isn't just active in her virtual classes twice (or more) a day. She's also out and about — keen to avoid becoming too sedentary, which can shorten lifespan, especially for older folks.\n\n\"A lot of people my age sit all day. And that's not healthy,\" she said.\n\nHer typical habits include working in her garden, walking in the park, or strolling around local landmarks, especially in nice weather.\n\n\"We have a beautiful sculpture garden right by our museum, so I like to get out and get some of that vitamin D,\" she said.\n\nAll the walking adds up over time on her FitBit, Thibodeaux told me.\n\nShe's often going above and beyond 10,000 steps a day. (Research suggests as few as 4,000 steps a day can boost heart health.)\n\nOne recent highlight: at her granddaughter's wedding, Thibodeaux logged 22,315 steps.\n\n\"I never left the dance floor. I was determined I was going to enjoy that wedding, and I did,\" she said.\n\nThibodeaux's social life is as action-packed as her gym routine. She said she regularly hangs out with friends on outings to the mall or to catch a movie. Her workout classes, while virtual, are also intensely social, with members often connecting during and outside class for daily chitchat.\n\nHer daily mantra is to stay in touch with people in her life, whether it's a quick chat or getting lunch. Her granddaughter, for instance, calls regularly.\n\n\"It's important to check on your family and friends, make sure they're doing OK, because sometimes you have no idea what challenges some people are dealing with,\" Thibodeaux said.\n\nLongevity isn't about staying physically active. The longest-living people on earth are renowned for strong community ties, and research suggests good relationships are key to healthy aging.\n\nSpending time with loved ones is also linked to another longevity-boosting habit: gratitude. Feeling appreciation in your daily life can even lower the risk of dying early, according to some studies.\n\n\"I'm a person of simple pleasures,\" Thibodeaux said. \"I think it's important to be grateful for the blessings you have.\"",

For now, Bethesda's Todd Howard is keeping the company's plans close to his vest, but he has indicated there's more happening with Fallout than any other Bethesda property at the moment.\n\"We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today,\" Howard told IGN. \"I'll just say this, it's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now.\"\nHoward also indicated that the success of Prime Video's Fallout TV series hasn't altered those plans or caused Bethesda to move up its timetable.",

    "description": "I always have a few bottles of wine on hand in case I have people over. From sparkling to red, here are my recommendations as a certified sommelier.",
    "fullText": "As a certified sommelier, when I entertain, I want to serve the perfect wines to match any meal, occasion, and person.\n\nWhether I'm ordering takeout, making one of my trusty weeknight dishes, or preparing a fancy meal for guests, they expect something delicious in their glasses.\n\nHere are a few of my go-to wines that never fail to please when I'm hosting.\n\nWith many styles to choose from, there's a sparkling wine for every occasion.\n\nI've found that opening a bottle of bubbly for guests makes them feel special, which is what hosting is all about.\n\nWith its high acidity, sparkling wine is also perfectly food-friendly — meaning, it pairs quite well with so many bites.\n\nSome of my favorite brands include Gloria Ferrer, a domestic sparkler from California; Alta Langa Bera Brut, an excellent Italian sparkling wine; and Champagne Telmont, when only true French Champagne will do.\n\nWith its palate-cleansing nature, a refreshing white wine pretty much always hits the spot.\n\nIf you're eating something spicy (such as Indian, Mexican, or Thai cuisine), it will also help cool your palate between each bite.\n\nGrapes like sauvignon blanc, vermentino, and Chenin blanc are some of my favorites, and you can't go wrong with Teneral Cellars vermentino, William Hill sauvignon blanc, or Hye Meadow Winery Chenin blanc.\n\nNothing is cozier than a glass of Italian red wine.\n\nThe variety has come a long way from the ubiquitous Chianti served at neighborhood restaurants.\n\nTop-quality Italian reds come from every region of the country now, and it's no surprise that Italian food is the perfect pairing.\n\nA structured Brunello di Montalcino from Castello Banfi pairs well with grilled meats and hearty stews. Super Tuscan wines never let me down, especially if I'm serving them with a spectacular Italian feast.\n\nI also enjoy the wines from Tenuta Argentiera in Bolgheri, and Madrevite wines from Umbria, which are made with indigenous Italian grapes.\n\nI like ending the night with a dessert wine when I entertain.\n\nPort reigns supreme and can please a wide range of palates.\n\nFonseca Bin 27 Reserve Ruby port is a classic red — perfect on its own or with any chocolate-based dessert. Taylor Fladgate's 10-Year-Old tawny port is sweet with a nice balance of nuttiness for those looking for more complexity.\n\nVin de Paille is also a great dessert wine for those who appreciate a good white. It's made from raisins, which gives it a sweeter, more concentrated flavor.\n\nAlta Colina Winery and Tablas Creek Vineyard in California make two of my favorite bottles.\n\nNonalcoholic wines are one of the fastest-growing varieties in the industry.\n\nIf my guests are abstaining — for any reason — I want to have something available for them to enjoy as well.\n\nFre makes great non-alcoholic white wines like pinot grigio. Noughty has a delicious nonalcoholic sparkling wine that I think tastes as good as the real thing, and Kally sells bottles made from classic wine grapes, like chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 19, 2024, and most recently updated on December 11, 2025.",

    "title": "Here are 4 ways Rivian just stepped deeper into Tesla's turf",
    "description": "Rivian revealed ambitious plans for fully autonomous driving, featuring an in-house chip, an in-car AI assistant, and a Tesla-like subscription model.",
    "fullText": "Rivian is all-in on autonomous driving, stepping deeper into a territory Tesla has long positioned itself to dominate.\n\nOn Thursday, at Rivian's R&D office in Palo Alto, the EV maker unveiled a road map to develop autonomous-driving capabilities for its future lineup of vehicles, including new hardware for the highly anticipated R2 — Rivian's cheapest car to date.\n\nThat road map includes a new silicon chip, designed in-house, that will power Rivian's next-generation hardware and support self-driving functions. The new hardware is expected to ship with R2 by the end of 2026, Rivian said.\n\nRivian CEO RJ Scaringe has been hinting at autonomous ambitions in recent years. However, since the company's first shipment of vehicles in 2021, Rivian's advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) software — Driver+ and the Rivian Autonomy Platform — has been more akin to Tesla Autopilot than Full Self-Driving Supervised. Tesla's Autopilot provides lane-centering and adaptive cruise control, while FSD can recognize traffic lights, conduct turns, and drive to a destination under constant driver supervision.\n\nThursday's announcement deepens Rivian's rivalry with Tesla as both companies have expressed goals of fully autonomous driving and licensing their software platforms to other automakers.\n\nRivian's partnership with Volkswagen, announced last year, was a clear first shot at those licensing ambitions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently balked on X that no automaker wanted to license FSD.\n\nHere are four ways Rivian is taking a page out of Tesla's playbook.\n\nRivian has been using a combination of Nvidia and Qualcomm Snapdragon chips to power various vehicle functions, including driver-assistance and infotainment systems.\n\nNow, the company is turning to in-house silicon to power its next-generation autonomous driving hardware.\n\n\"At the core of Rivian's technology roadmap is the transition to in-house silicon, designed specifically for the vision-centric physical AI,\" the company said.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the chips will be manufactured by TSMC.\n\nTesla began a production shift toward in-house chips in 2019 and has since released two iterations, AI3 and AI4. Musk has said that Tesla's next-generation chip, AI5, will be 40 times better than its predecessor.\n\nRivian's \"Gen 3 Autonomy\" hardware is under validation and is expected to be shipped with R2 by the end of 2026, the company said.\n\nWith the new chips, Rivian's explicit goal is to achieve full autonomy — that's Level 4, or the kind of self-driving technology seen in Alphabet's Waymo, in which driver supervision is not required.\n\nMusk has already made full autonomy Tesla's north star, pledging to turn every personally-owned Tesla into a robotaxi that can generate revenue.\n\nThe Tesla CEO's goals have been met with considerable skepticism, particularly due to the company's decision to abandon lidar, a sensor that many industry leaders consider essential for safety and redundancy in self-driving cars.\n\nRivian, for its part, plans to incorporate lidar into the R2 vehicle. The sensor appears to be installed within the car, just above the middle of the windshield.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the company collaborated with a third party on the \"exterior design\" of Rivian's \"lidar implementation.\"\n\nThe company did not share a timeline for launching fully autonomous driving.\n\nIn the near term, Rivian will update its ADAS with hands-free assisted driving capability. The feature won't be functional on every road, according to a press release.\n\nRivian said it will be available on \"over 3.5 million miles of roads across the USA and Canada\" and can operate \"off-highway on roads with clearly painted lines.\"\n\nAt Thursday's event, Scaringe also suggested potential robotaxi ambitions.\n\n\"This also enables us to pursue opportunities in the rideshare space,\" the CEO said.\n\nRivian is following Tesla's FSD subscription model for what it's calling \"Autonomy+.\"\n\nThe software will launch \"early 2026\" and be priced at $49.99 a month or $2,500 for a one-time purchase.\n\nTesla's FSD is $99 a month or $8,000 up front.\n\nRivian said the software will be continuously updated. The \"trajectory\" for the feature will be \"point-to-point\" navigation — where users type in a destination, and the car drives itself just like FSD — as well as eyes-off driving capabilities and \"personal L4\" capabilities, according to the automaker.\n\nThe Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that \"hundreds of millions of miles contribute to the development of Autonomy+.\"\n\n\"This data is comprised of samples from around the US and Canada year-round, capturing diversity in both geography and seasonality,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMusk announced in July an integration of xAI's Grok in Tesla vehicles, providing a chatbot that drivers can talk to and, more recently, ask for directions.\n\nRivian will be following a similar playbook with \"Rivian Assistant,\" an AI voice interface that will be \"model-agnostic,\" according to the automaker.\n\n\"Our framework allows us to orchestrate different models and choose the best one for the task,\" a Rivian spokesperson said.\n\nThe company said in a press release that the AI assistant can connect to third-party apps and will start with the integration of Google Calendar.\n\nThe AI assistant can also assist with vehicle diagnostics and control certain vehicle functions, such as activating the car's seat heaters.\n\nThe feature will be shipped early 2026 on Gen 1 and Gen 2 R1 vehicles.",

    "description": "Amid the recent return-to-office push in corporate America, young workers are romanticizing their commutes in a new TikTok trend.",
    "fullText": "When Danielle Pogue hits the pavement each morning for the cross-borough trek to her office in Brooklyn, she relies on two essentials to propel her forward: a perfectly curated Spotify playlist and the mental power to romanticize each step.\n\n\"I have perfected the New York City strut,\" Pogue told me.\n\nPogue, 27, graduated from college in 2020 and entered the labor force at the height of the pandemic, when working remotely was more necessary than trendy. After moving to New York the following year, she jumped at the chance to work in the office at both postgrad jobs she's held in digital marketing. Part of the reason was the commute.\n\n\"It definitely is something that I look forward to now,\" Pogue said of her 25-minute journey to the office. \"I think of the alternative, which would be living really close to my office, maybe having it just be around the corner — and for some reason, that doesn't feel as appealing to me anymore. A lot of that has to do with the routine that I've made for myself.\"\n\nThat routine is a kind of portable daydream: As she navigates her way through foot traffic and train platforms, Pogue might imagine herself as a high-powered executive or a trendy young professional in a movie montage, having her main character moment.\n\nIn October, Pogue posted a video of her daily strut on TikTok set to KT Tunstall's \"Suddenly I See,\" the song that memorably plays during the opening credits of 2006 movie \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" Pogue captioned the post, \"hot tip: romanticize your commute to work by listening to this song & acting like you're in a '90s romcom.\" It's amassed over 70,000 views and counting.\n\nfirst video I made abt this went viral but I feel some people need a reminder 🫂 comment ‘Spotify’ if you want the link to my full 90’s romcom playlist\n\n\"Clearly, it's something that people resonate with, and also want to replicate in their own morning routine,\" Pogue said of why she thinks her post gained traction. After all, romanticizing an existing routine is easy, accessible, and free of charge — perfect for inspiring the online masses.\n\nPogue isn't the only woman with a go-getter protagonist like Anne Hathaway's Andy Sachs on her digital mood board. Videos similar to Pogue's are littered across my For You Page on TikTok, with captions like \"being employed means getting to act mysterious and romanticize my morning commute,\" or \"romanticizing the commute I dreamed of when I was younger.\" They're often paired with nostalgic tunes or cinematic pop songs, including \"What a Wonderful World\" by Louis Armstrong, \"Young and Beautiful\" by Lana Del Rey, and, of course, \"Everything Is Romantic\" by Charli XCX.\n\nWhile the call to \"romanticize your life\" on TikTok can sometimes lean aspirational, as much of the internet does, devotees reject the implication that romanticizing your life requires buying new things. Rather, the goal is to appreciate what's already in reach.\n\nBrianna Paruolo, a licensed mental health therapist and founder of On Par Therapy, said that while showing off for strangers online can be a \"slippery slope\" if it leads to a craving for more validation, romanticizing can be a positive way to reframe mundanity.\n\n\"When we romanticize, we take notice in the small moments of beauty,\" Paruolo said. \"When you film your morning coffee routine or walk to the subway, you are using your digital lens to train your mental lens to scan for positive experiences rather than functioning on autopilot.\"\n\nFor Pogue, that holds true. \"It kind of just sets my day up for success,\" she said of why she romanticizes her commute, online and otherwise. \"If you're dreading your morning commute, you're dreading getting to the office, and then everything that happens after that is more likely to feel a little bit negative.\"\n\nAlthough TikTok has been awash in videos about romanticizing everyday life since the early pandemic, videos about romanticizing your commute are part of a newer subgenre whose rise coincides with the recent return-to-office push in corporate America.\n\nData from Placer.ai, a leading foot-traffic analytics firm, found that office visits nationwide were up about 10% in 2024 compared with 2023. Other stats paint an even starker picture: A McKinsey survey of over 8,000 people across 15 industries found the number of employees working mostly in person, as opposed to mostly remote or hybrid, doubled in 2024 compared to the previous year.\n\nEarly indicators suggest these figures continued to grow in 2025. As Business Insider previously reported, July set a post-pandemic record high for office attendance, up 10.7% from July 2024. In September, the so-called \"hybrid creep\" continued to ramp up, with more and more companies enacting strict RTO policies, including Intel, NBCUniversal, and Starbucks. Earlier this month, Instagram's chief, Adam Mosseri, announced that most US staff would be expected to return to the office five days a week starting in February.\n\nAndrea Yamhure Sepúlveda, 25, started her corporate consulting job in January 2023. About two years later, her company began asking employees to spend 60% of their workweek in the office; lately, managers have been sending quarterly reports to recap their employees' in-person stats.\n\nNew York-based Sepúlveda, who's also a content creator in her spare time, has taken this sea change in stride. She enjoys filming the morning minutiae — her first cup of tea, the sunrise glow over the Manhattan skyline — and sharing the clips on TikTok like a public gratitude journal.\n\n\"It's like, you're going to have to do this anyway, so you might as well find the positive,\" she said. \"If I dread the fact that I have to wake up at 5 a.m. and travel, then it's gonna suck. And then I'm going to have to do it next Monday, and the next Monday.\"\n\nMaria Lysy, a 25-year-old marketing professional in the Washington, DC, metro area, agreed that casting her commute in a positive light helps boost her morale for the workday ahead.\n\nLysy said her commuting routine lately has involved listening to pop singer Audrey Hobert, especially her songs \"Phoebe\" and \"Sex and the City,\" and reminding herself that her younger self would be proud of where she is today. She described this process as \"finding the extraordinary in the ordinary.\"\n\n\"It sounds so simple, but I've always dreamed of going to my 'big girl job,'\" Lysy said. \"I feel like it's so easy to take a negative approach on a lot of things, but it's just as easy just romanticize the littlest things you do. It totally changes your perspective.\"",

    "description": "Prosecutors accused Carl Rinsch, who directed the Keanu Reeves-starring \"47 Ronin,\" of fraud after an ambitious sci-fi Netflix project collapsed.",
    "fullText": "Carl Rinsch spent years in director jail. Now he's facing real jail.\n\nA Manhattan federal jury on Thursday found Rinsch guilty on charges that he scammed Netflix out of $11 million in a lavish spending spree.\n\nAfter less than five hours of deliberation, the jury said it found Rinsch guilty on all seven counts, including fraud, money laundering, and illegal money transmission. He faces up to 90 years in prison, but is expected to receive a far less severe sentence.\n\nMost of the 12 jurors walked into the jury box with somber expressions on their faces. Rinsch, wearing a purple-plaid tie and matching pocket square, looked straight at the judge with a neutral expression as the foreman read the verdict.\n\nRinsch and his attorneys declined to comment to Business Insider while leaving the courtroom.\n\nThe case centered on the millions of dollars Netflix paid Rinsch to film \"White Horse,\" a sci-fi epic about a world where clone-like beings, after a schism with humankind, create their own society walled off from the rest of the world. Rinsch testified in his own defense earlier this week.\n\nRinsch — a Ridley Scott protégé who previously directed the Keanu Reeves-starring \"47 Ronin\" — shot footage for \"White Horse\" on two continents. But by the fall of 2019, he exceeded the $44 million Netflix budgeted for the project and asked for more money.\n\nIn March of 2020, after months of negotiations, the streaming service agreed to give Rinsch's production company another $11 million.\n\nOn the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Rinsch said he believed the bulk of the $11 million was meant to reimburse him for keeping the production of \"White Horse\" afloat the previous fall, when it had gone over-budget. He testified that Netflix expected him to conduct only \"soft pre-production\" on a potential second season.\n\nRinsch had grand ambitions. He said he envisioned a franchise like \"Star Wars\" and \"Game of Thrones,\" complete with an elaborate fantasy world, that could become part of Netflix's catalogue.\n\nFormer Netflix executives testified in the trial that they had previously agreed on one season, and the $11 million was meant to go toward finishing episodes that Rinsch never delivered. According to prosecutors, the entire negotiation for the $11 million was a sham, and Rinsch meant to defraud the company all along.\n\nAt closing arguments on Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney David Markewitz presented the jury with a Buzzfeed-style list of \"10 Ways You Know Carl Rinsch is Guilty.\" He argued it was absurd to think Rinsch's risky stock and cryptocurrency trades, as well as his lavish purchases — such as a $439,000 handmade Hastens mattress — could have been intended for the production of \"White Horse.\" He also pointed out that Rinch's 2021 purchases of Rolls-Royces were insured in his own name, rather than insured by Netflix.\n\n\"In a TV show, a mattress is going to be covered by sheets and a blanket,\" Markewitz told the jury. \"No one watching 'White Horse' from home is going to have any idea what is under those linens.\"\n\nDaniel McGuinness, an attorney representing Rinsch, told the jury that Rinsch never had the \"intent\" required to find him guilty.\n\nRinsch always believed Netflix owed him about $11 million in reimbursement, McGuinness said, pointing to emails and text messages leading up to the March 2020 agreement, and never said he would spend all the money on additional production for \"White Horse.\"\n\nIn reality, according to McGuinness, the situation was a \"contract dispute\" based on misunderstandings between Rinsch and Netflix.\n\n\"They were talking past each other, and the government has turned it into a nefarious fraud conspiracy,\" McGuinness said.\n\nJurors sent multiple notes to the judge on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning. They asked for transcripts of key witness testimony and an additional laptop to review the trial exhibits.\n\nBut shortly after noon on Thursday, they had come to a unanimous conclusion: Rinsch was guilty.",

    "fullText": "SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgaria’s government resigned on Thursday after mass protests gripped the country and just weeks before the European Union nation is due to join the eurozone.\n\nThe resignation of the minority coalition, led by the center-right GERB party, was announced minutes before parliament was scheduled to vote on a no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition over economic mismanagement and supported by growing public anger with widespread corruption.\n\n“Ahead of today’s vote of no confidence, the government is resigning,” Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov told reporters in parliament.\n\nThe demonstrations on Wednesday came after last week’s protests that were sparked by the government’s budget plans for higher taxes, increased social security contributions and spending increases. The government later withdrew the contentious 2026 budget plan.\n\nThe protesters’ demands had expanded to include calls for the center-right government to step down.\n\n“The decisions of the National Assembly are meaningful when they reflect the will of the people,\" Zhelyazkov said, referring to the anti-government protests. “We want to be where society expects us to be.”\n\nStudents from Sofia’s universities had joined the protests, which organizers said outnumbered last week’s rallies that drew more than 50,000 people. Media estimates based on drone visuals put the number of protesters at over 100,000.\n\nAt the core of the protesters’ frustrations is the role of Bulgarian politician and oligarch Delyan Peevski, who has been sanctioned by both the United States and the United Kingdom, and whose MRF New Beginning party backs the government. Peevski has been accused by opponents of helping shaping government policy in line with oligarchic interests.\n\n“We have no doubt that the government will receive support in the upcoming vote of no confidence. Regardless, the decisions of the National Assembly are important when they reflect the will of the sovereign,” the prime minister said.\n\nZhelyazkov’s government survived six votes of no confidence since it was appointed in January, but this time the large turnout of protesters on the streets was a game changer.\n\nThe resignation will be formally submitted to parliament on Friday, which must adopt a resolution to accept it. After this formal procedure, President Rumen Radev will give the biggest group in parliament the chance to form a new government. If it fails, the second-largest grouping will get a chance before the president choses a candidate.\n\nIf all attempts fail — which is likely — he will appoint a caretaker Cabinet until a new election is held. Political analysts expect that another vote — the eighth since 2021 — will likely produce a similar deeply fragmented parliament facing an uphill task to form a stable government.\n\nAssen Vassilev, the leader of the opposition We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria coalition, called the government’s resignation “the first step in making Bulgaria a normal European state.”\n\n“The next step along this path is to conduct fair and free elections rather than elections compromised by vote manipulation as in the previous campaign,” he added.\n\nThe Balkan country of 6.4 million people is due to make the switch from its national currency, the lev, to the euro on Jan. 1, to become the eurozone's 21st member. Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007.",

The vehicle had been reported stolen from Buena Vista. When the deputy activated their lights, the driver accelerated and reportedly fled at a high rate of speed, the release said.\n\nA pursuit continued along Hermitage Road and onto Saint James Road before crossing Long Meadow Road. After the suspect vehicle went onto Entry School Road in Fishersville, it crashed and rolled multiple times. The driver, 27-year-old Cody J.E. Shores of Staunton, was ejected.\n\nVirginia State Police responded to the scene and investigated.\n\nShores and a passenger in the vehicle were taken to Augusta Health in Fishersville for treatment, the release said. Shores was later transferred to UVA Health in Charlottesville. Following treatment, he was taken into custody at the hospital by the University of Virginia Police Department.\n\nShores is charged with felony eluding, possession of a stolen vehicle, reckless driving and driving with a revoked or suspended license.

Chickasha Festival of Light remains one of the best Christmas light shows throughout the nation in a new poll from USA TODAY readers.\n\nThe 2025 USA Today’s 10Best Reader’s Choice Awards polls the nation on a slew — or sleigh — of holiday events, stores, and light shows, and Oklahoma scored with bright colors and the Public Holiday Lights Display category.\n\nJust under an hour away, Oklahoma City residents can see the third-best public lights display in the country at the Chickasha Festival of Light.\n\nThe free light show allows guests to walk or drive through the grounds. The award-winning light show is not the only attraction at the Chickasha grounds. This year's events include the Santa shuttle, ice skating, a Ferris wheel and carousel, carriage rides, camel and pony rides and photos with the big guy himself.\n\nThe festival, which spans 43 acres, is a magnificent light display during the holiday season. This year marks 33 years since the nonprofit debuted the annual festival.\n\nThe festival will run until New Year's Eve this year, opening at 6 p.m. every day of the week. From Sunday to Thursday, the lights will go dim at 10 p.m., but groups looking for a show on Friday and Saturday can see until 11 p.m.\n\nWhile it is a free event, guests are charged for additional activities.

    "fullText": "An entire Russian column has been destroyed during a Ukrainian counter-attack in Pokrovsk.\n\nScores of military vehicles were left burning along a road in the eastern city, newly published footage shows.\n\nA Ukrainian drone can be seen sweeping over the wreckage, while earlier video appeared to show Russian troops and vehicles being struck with cluster munitions.\n\nThe battle for the strategic logistics hub in Donetsk has raged for more than a year. Vladimir Putin recently claimed Pokrovsk had fallen, but Ukrainian officials said he made the announcement during peace talks to persuade Donald Trump that a Russian victory was inevitable.\n\nKyiv insists its forces still hold positions in the northern part of the city, once home to 60,000 people before the full-scale invasion in February 2022. A video released on Tuesday showed Ukrainian soldiers waving their country’s flag to prove the city had not yet fallen.\n\nUkrainian commanders reported on Wednesday an unusually large Russian mechanised assault inside Pokrovsk, where Moscow is believed to have massed around 156,000 troops.\n\n“The Russians used armoured vehicles, cars and motorcycles. The convoys attempted to break through from the south to the northern part of the city,” Ukraine’s 7th Rapid Response Corps said of the attack.\n\nPokrovsk, which stands on elevated ground, would be the first city captured by Russia since Avdiivka in early 2024. Moscow believes taking it would unlock the rest of the Donbas, territory Putin wants Ukraine to surrender in any peace settlement.\n\nBut experts do not believe Pokrovsk’s seizure by Russia would lead to the collapse of the front line, with Ukraine having spent years fortifying the nearby “fortress belt” cities of Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka.\n\nThe Donbas remains a central issue in US-mediated peace talks. Putin is demanding that Kyiv relinquish the remaining 12 per cent of the region not already occupied by Russian forces, a concession Volodymyr Zelensky has so far resisted.\n\nDonald Trump could travel to Europe this weekend for talks with Mr Zelensky, Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz.\n\nThe US president hopes to secure a peace deal by Christmas but has said he does not want to “waste time” on a trip that will not advance negotiations.\n\nUkraine delivered its latest response to the US plan on Thursday evening, as a European diplomat said discussions were “progressing quickly.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Amanda...",
    "fullText": "In a text exchange, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino calls his operation a “massive disturbance” in the making.\n\n“Operation Catahoula Crunch is making New Orleans safer by finding and arresting illegal aliens who have been endangering this community,” Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino posted on X shortly after his roving corps of immigration enforcers arrived in the city. In a similar PR offensive, the Department of Homeland Security recently launched the “Worst of the Worst” website, which features some of the arrests that the federal agents implementing the Trump White House’s mass deportation policy have carried out across the country. (The legal resolution of these arrests, like the 13 cases dropped in court after Bovino’s Operation Midway Blitz campaign in Chicago, are not featured.)\n\nAnd despite the online efforts to portray the Trump raids as heroic peacekeeping exercises, Commander Bovino’s New Orleans team seemed to be operating by a different set of rules, to judge by its conduct this past Saturday. A caravan of Louisiana state troopers escorted three rental cars full of federal agents, including Bovino himself, to an apartment complex in Kenner, Louisiana. A secondary caravan, made up mostly of journalists and protesters, followed close behind. State police blocked off a road in the complex, driving both groups out of their vehicles and into the street, where Bovino and his agents could move in on them. The federal agents slowly drove down the road, stopping for minutes at a time. The small group of protesters grew, bolstered by neighbors who lived in the apartments.\n\nSafe inside an SUV, surrounded by agents with weapons, Bovino texted away on his phone from the parking lot of an apartment complex. The messages, recorded by journalist Ford Fischer, offer some insight—into both Bovino’s mind and the state of the Louisiana operation.\n\n“Kind of cool we are a massive wrecking crew. The idiots can’t do anything to us…. I can’t understand why DHS is hiding us when we are handing them strategy on a silver platter,” Bovino wrote to a contact listed as “Diz.” Minutes later, Bovino followed up with a summary of their on-the-ground strategy that afternoon: “Massive disturbance at apartment complex in Kenner. We are running tags and such.”\n\nThe “disturbance” was hardly massive. The protesters were yelling at the agents as they sat in their vehicles with the windows up, but they didn’t offer any physical resistance. After running the tags of the cars down the length of the road, Border Patrol agents got out and knocked on a door. The sound of whistles pierced the air, and one loud protester yelled out for his neighbors not to open their doors: “They cannot come in if you do not give them verbal, allowed permission.”\n\nThe stunt seemed to be a way to agitate the neighborhood more than anything else. And the photos showing Bovino’s messages cast the operation’s alleged legal aims into further doubt. Just for starters, why would a targeted enforcement operation rely on running tags in the parking lot of an apartment complex located in the town with the highest Hispanic population in the state of Louisiana? This seemed to be a “Kavanaugh stop”—the practice of racially profiling residents recently sanctioned by the US Supreme Court—running on steroids.\n\nBovino’s reference to the DHS’s “hiding” his team raises further questions. It certainly seems at odds with his constant media appearances, and his photo-ops in the snack aisles of gas stations\n\nPerhaps Bovino was simply venting because the New Orleans raids aren’t producing the kind of strong-arm spectacle that he’s staged in Chicago and elsewhere. According to the Associated Press, his team has carried out just 38 arrests over the first four days of Operation Catahoula Crunch. And of the 38 people detained, only nine had criminal records—a percentage that’s generally in line with the national numbers for the immigration raids, which show that more than 70 percent of the people arrested had no criminal convictions.\n\nBovino’s texting partner, at least, seemed to be mindful of the team’s lackluster show of force. “You need to do interviews. Fox and friends wants you. We will come up for a talking point on the low numbers,” Diz texted Bovino.\n\nStill, when he doesn’t feel like he’s being hidden, Commander Bovino remains stoutly on message. “The Big Easy is the Big Hard for illegal aliens,” Bovino bragged this week on X.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",

    "fullText": "Two of the three people authorities charged with crimes related to the killing of a Boise 19-year-old pleaded guilty to robbery, and both will spend the first portion of their sentences in juvenile detention.\n\nOnce they transfer to the Idaho Department of Correction when they turn 21, they will serve years behind bars before they are eligible for parole, even though they were not directly responsible for 19-year-old Boise man Tiger Canoy’s shooting death.\n\nThree people were accused of hatching a plan to rob Canoy and his girlfriend “by force or by fear,” an Ada County prosecutor said during sentencing, and Canoy was shot and then died in a hospital in January 2025.\n\nMiguel Angel-Martinez, 16, was sentenced to up to 26 years in prison and will have to serve 11 years before he’s eligible for parole. Jordan Castillo, 17, received a 28.5-year sentence, with 13 years and six months fixed, meaning no possibility of parole until then.\n\nAngel-Martinez and Castillo were originally charged as adults with first-degree murder and aiding in grand theft, in addition to two counts of robbery. Under Idaho law, someone may be charged with murder even if they didn’t actually commit the killing, as long as they were in the process of committing another crime.\n\nAs part of plea agreements, the other charges were dismissed in exchange for guilty pleas to robbery.\n\nDaniel Alaniz Pineda, 19, is accused of shooting Canoy and has pleaded not guilty to six charges, including first-degree murder, robbery, aggravated battery and concealment of evidence.\n\nDuring Castillo and Angel-Martinez’s sentencings, Tiger Canoy’s mother, Capri Canoy, said that while five young lives were deeply affected that night, she hoped to see punishments that reflected the emotional pain her family has faced.\n\n“We are already serving our sentence,” Capri Canoy said. “Tiger was given no choice but to pay the ultimate price, his entire life. We, his family, are serving a life sentence without him. No visits, no phone calls, no letters, no Christmas Eves, no New Year’s, no celebrations, nothing.”\n\nAngel-Martinez contacted Canoy asking to buy marijuana wax from him, according to Ada County prosecutors, and they made a plan to meet on Jan. 19 in the Albertsons parking lot on Cole Road.\n\nCanoy knew Angel-Martinez from high school, Canoy’s mother told the court during the sentencings.\n\nShe said the last words she got from her son were: “OK mom, I’m gonna go meet up with a homie Angel from high school. I’ll be back in a few minutes. I love you.”\n\nBefore the meeting, Angel-Martinez, Castillo and Alaniz Pineda procured firearms, prosecutors said.\n\nCanoy and his girlfriend, who lived with the family, drove to the parking lot. Surveillance footage showed Angel-Martinez, Castillo and Pineda getting out of their vehicle wearing masks and holding guns, the prosecution said.\n\nCastillo was seen slashing a tire on the vehicle, and Alaniz Pineda pointed a gun at Canoy, demanding the wax, along with the phones and IDs of Canoy and his girlfriend, prosecutors allege.\n\nThe couple gave the perpetrators their belongings, and those three got back in their car and drove down Cole Road, according to authorities. Tiger and his girlfriend followed their car to get a view of their license plate, prosecutors said in court.\n\nAngel-Martinez, Castillo and Pineda stopped at a church parking lot, and Canoy drove past; prosecutors said Alaniz Pineda got out of the car and fired two shots at Canoy’s vehicle.\n\nThe prosecution said in court that one bullet struck Canoy in the head and the other struck his girlfriend in the hip and elbow. Canoy was taken to a local hospital, where he died shortly after.\n\nAttorneys for Castillo and Angel-Martinez argued for the court to give the two minors opportunities for rehabilitation while serving their sentences, and said they would have a better chance at reform at the juvenile facility.\n\nAngel-Martinez’s defense attorney, Randall Barnum, talked about the formative years before the age of 21 and said that in juvenile correction, Angel-Martinez has been involved in the honor system and participated in the education process.\n\n“I have seen (Angel-Martinez) dedicate himself to following rules, making himself better, improving himself, doing what he can to make tomorrow better despite those particular circumstances, because at the end of the day that is all he can do,” Barnum stated.\n\nAda County Judge Borton Joseph, who presided over both cases, agreed to allow Castillo and Angel-Martinez to stay in juvenile detention until the age of 21.\n\nBoth Angel-Martinez and Castillo made statements to Canoy’s family and his girlfriend during the sentencings.\n\n“I am truly sorry for what I did the day of the tragedy. I also hope that one day that you will not see me as a monster, because I want to use my life to do something good for others and respect the lives I’ve harmed,” Castillo said.\n\nCapri Canoy told the court that the second-worst moment in her life was when she received the call that her only son had been shot. She said the worst was when she had to decide to remove him from life support in the hospital.\n\n“The impact of his loss will continue to haunt our family for the rest of our lives,” Capri Canoy said. “I died beside my son that day. The only difference is that I continue breathing; Tiger does not.”\n\nShe said her son was a very trusting and loyal person, and the defendants took advantage of that.\n\nShe recalled how her son overcame many obstacles in his life, after being diagnosed with multiple behavioral disorders at an early age. She said he struggled to make friends growing up.\n\nCapri Canoy said that during high school, her son became more social and made many friends. She said he met his girlfriend around that time, and they became inseparable. The two were saving money to move into their own apartment, “excitedly planning their future together.”\n\n“He was a person people remember, even if they only met him once or twice,” she said. “He had such a big personality and at 6-foot-3-inches tall he really stood out in a crowd. He loved to laugh, joke around, and most of all he loved his music.”",

    "title": "Use the ‘Five Whys’ to Get to the Root of Your Productivity Problems",
    "description": "The problems you face aren't independent. You need to address their root causes.",
    "fullText": "Planning is a key part of staying productive, but it has to be done right. To succeed, you need to understand why previous attempts at planning didn’t pan out. Conducting a personal after-action review is one way to assess your work and determine how to be more efficient, but to truly understand what went wrong and prepare for the future, you need to dig deep. Try the “Five Whys” technique to get to the bottom of things.\n\nYou should know, first of all, that this is yet another productivity protocol that springs from Japan’s famed factory system, like the 5S and 3M techniques. With this one, once you identify a problem, you’re going to ask, “Why?” five times, which will ultimately reveal the true root cause of the issue—and what you need to focus on fixing.\n\nSome variations of the technique call on you to assemble a team for brainstorming before doing this, but if you’re assessing a personal issue, that part isn't necessary. Your “team” can be the people posting on forums about the problem, for instance, or a group chat with your friends. If the issue is a household one, chat with your family. This doesn’t have to be super formal, but if the problem is one related to work and you do have coworkers involved, bring them into the discussion. In some cases, there may be no team at all—but that doesn't mean you can't use the Five Whys.\n\nWhether you’re consulting a team or not, the real work begins when you define the problem. State it clearly and concisely. Ideally, write it down. Let's say the problem is you didn’t get the dining room clean in time for dinner, so everyone had to eat at the counter. Simplify that to, “I didn’t clean the dining room on time.”\n\nNext, ask, “Why?” Write down the answer—maybe it's “I had to take a phone call from work.”\n\nAsk, “Why?” Write down the answer and ask again. Then again, again, and again, until you’ve asked five times. So, your paper might look like this: I didn’t get the dining room clean > I had to take a phone call from work > I didn’t finish the reports my boss wanted > I didn’t have the data I needed from the sales department > The sales department was not aware of my deadline.\n\nWhen you’re finished digging into the problem, you can see how the answer to the last “Why?” caused a domino effect that led to the original issue. Fixing these more granular problems will ultimately help prevent bigger ones. So, in this case, write down, “I will communicate deadlines and needs with other departments at work early on when working on a project.” The next time you have a project to do, when you’re planning out your to-dos around it, be sure to include, “Communicate with the sales department about the deadline for the data.”\n\nThere are plenty of productivity and scheduling apps that call on you to break your larger tasks down into smaller ones, like ABCDE or turning your responsibilities into \"bites,\" and it's likely that the solution to your fifth Why will be something small enough to easily slot into one of those. Make sure you prioritize whatever that small step is, however. Use an approach like the MIT technique to prioritize your to-dos around their impact on your life. In this case, letting the sales team know about your deadline is a small task with a big impact, as it could have cleared the way for you to clean the dining room and enjoy a nice meal with your family.\n\nBear in mind that root causes aren’t always evident after five rounds of “Why?” For instance, maybe it’s not your job to communicate your deadline to the sales department. Maybe the person who was supposed to do that messed up or the people on that team didn’t check their emails. In that case, overhauling your protocols at work might be the answer. The “Five Whys” aren’t concrete; they’re a way to change your thinking around problems so you can easily identify their root causes and address those. Once you get in the habit of asking why and working backward, you’ll be able to do this quickly and alter your future plans more efficiently.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this year, the famed Kum and Go brand disappeared from the world of convenience stores, even though its former owner thought that wasn't the plan.\n\nWhen former Kum & Go CEO Kyle Krause and his family made the deal to sell their chain to Maverik, they had been led to believe that their iconic brand name would be kept.\n\nDuring the talks to sell the chain, Maverik “communicated to me that they intended to run both brands,” Krause told the Des Moines Register.\n\nThat was not what happened, as Maverik spent the 18 months after the deal closed taking the Kum & Go brand off its stores and replacing it with its own branding. Nothing in the contract prevented that from happening, but Krause, whose father founded the Kum & Go Brand in 1959, did not expect it to happen.\n\n“It’s their decision,” Krause told the newspaper of Maverik’s decision to get rid of Kum & Go. “They can choose what they do... But certainly talking to them, their intent prior to the sale was to maintain both brands.”\n\nNow, without as much fanfare or nostalgia, due to the nature of the brand, another convenience store chain name will soon disappear.\n\nAlthough it's certainly not as well-known as bigger chains like Wawa or Sheetz, Freedom Oil has a deep history and made its mark on parts of the United States.\n\n\"Freedom Oil was founded in 1948 and grew from a few neighborhood stores into a network of 27 locations throughout Illinois and Florida. The sale was a bittersweet moment remembering the journey as to how the company had grown from a couple of convenience stores to its present-day level,\" said third-generation family member Mike Owens in a press release.\n\nThe Owens family on Dec. 9 closed on the sale of its 27-store chain to Mizpah Ventures LLC, a Chicago-based company that operates convenience stores and fuel wholesale businesses in Illinois and Wisconsin, according to Owens, who had served as the president of his family's business.\n\nAll of the chain's stores will close, drop the Freedom Oil branding, and be reopened under the Mizpah name.\n\nTerry Monroe, president of American Business Brokers & Advisors, based in Fort Myers Beach, Fla., and Bill Fecht of WJF Services Inc., based in Normal, Ill., provided merger and acquisition advisory services to Freedom Oil.\n\nThose services included valuation advisory, marketing the business through a confidential process, and negotiation of the transaction.\n\nWhile Kum & Go had about 400 locations when it was sold and closed, a number of smaller convenience stores have changed hands. In 2024, Tri Star Energy acquired Cox Oil, Offen Petroleum purchased Douglass Distributing, and Par Mar Oil bought Santmyer Companies.",

    "title": "I Tried Photoshop in ChatGPT, and It Went Better Than I Expected",
    "description": "You can now get Adobe's AI image editor inside OpenAI's AI chatbot.",
    "fullText": "Generative AI tools continue to improve in terms of their photo editing capabilities, and OpenAI's latest upgrade brings Adobe Photoshop right inside your ChatGPT app window (alongside Adobe Acrobat for handling PDFs, and Adobe Express for graphic design). It's available to everyone, for free—you just need a ChatGPT account and an Adobe account.\n\nAs per Adobe, the idea is to make \"creativity accessible for everyone\" by plugging Photoshop tools directly into ChatGPT. The desktop version of Photoshop already comes with plenty of generative AI features of its own, so this is AI layered on top of more AI—but is it actually useful?\n\nAdobe Photoshop, Adobe Express and Adobe Acrobat are available now inside ChatGPT on the desktop, on the web, and on iOS. At the time of writing, you can also get Adobe Express inside ChatGPT for Android, with Photoshop and Acrobat \"coming soon.\" To weigh the capabilities of the new integration, I tested it in a desktop web browser.\n\nTo get started, all you need to do is type \"Photoshop\" at the start of your prompt: ChatGPT should recognize what you're trying to do, and select Adobe Photoshop as the tool to use for the next prompt. You'll also need to click through a couple of confirmation dialog boxes, and connect an Adobe account (if you don't have one, you can make one for free).\n\nWith all the connections and logins completed, Photoshop is then added to the overflow menu in the prompt box, so just click on the + (plus) to select it. You can start describing what you want to happen using the same natural, conversational language you'd use for any other ChatGPT prompt. You do need to also upload an image or provide a public link to one—if you don't do this before you submit your prompt, you'll be asked to do it after.\n\nYou don't need to know the names of all the Photoshop tools: Just describe what you want to happen and the relevant tools will be selected for you. One example Adobe gives is using the prompt \"make my image pop,\" which brings up the Bloom, Grain, and Lens Distortion effects—and each one can be adjusted via sliders on screen. It's actually quite simple to use.\n\nIf you do know the name of the tools you want, you can call them up by name, and the classic brightness and contrast sliders are a good place to start. You can either say something like \"make the picture brighter\" or \"adjust the image brightness\"—both will bring up an overlay you can use to make brightness adjustments, but if you use the former prompt, the image will already have been made a little brighter.\n\nChatGPT and Photoshop let you add edit upon edit as needed, and you can save the image at any stage. There's also the option to open your processed file in the Photoshop web app whenever you like: This web app uses a freemium model, with advanced features requiring a subscription, and seems to be what the ChatGPT integration is largely based on.\n\nAdobe offers a handy ChatGPT prompts cheat sheet you can browse through, which gives you a good idea of what's possible, and what you're still going to need Photoshop proper for. Note that you can specify certain parts of the image to focus on (like \"the face\" or \"the car\") but this depends on Photoshop-in-ChatGPT being able to correctly figure out where you want your selection to be. It needs to be pretty obvious and well delineated.\n\nWhen I tried cutting out objects and removing backgrounds, this worked well—but then I had to turn to Photoshop on the web to actually drop in a different background. There's no way to work with layers or masks here, and you can't remove people or objects from photos, either. Sometimes, however, you do get a spool of \"thinking\" from ChatGPT about how it can't do what the user is asking for.\n\nI was able to apply some nice colorizations here, via prompts like \"turn all the hues in this image to blue,\" and I like the way ChatGPT will give you further instructions on how to get the effect you want. You can even say \"show some examples\" and it gives you a few presets to choose from—all of which can be adjusted via the sliders again.\n\nThe ability to run prompts like \"turn this into an oil painting\" or \"turn this into a cartoon\" are useful too, though the plug-in is limited by the effects available in Photoshop for the web: You'll be directed to the closest effect and advised how to tweak it to get the look you want.\n\nActually, some of these effects work better in ChatGPT's native image editor, which maybe explains why Adobe wanted to get involved here.\n\nIf ChatGPT's image manipulation gets good enough, then Photoshop is no longer going to be needed by a substantial number of users: ChatGPT can already remove people and objects from photos, for example, quite effectively. What it's not quite as good at is some of the basic adjustments (like colors and contrast) that Adobe software has been managing for years.\n\nFor quick, basic edits you want to type out in natural language—especially where you want to adjust the edits manually and need advice on what to do next—Photoshop inside ChatGPT is a handy tool to be able to turn to, especially as it's free. For serious edits, though, you're still going to want to fire up the main Photoshop app, or maybe even shun Adobe altogether and make use of ChatGPT's steadily improving editing tools.",

    "title": "Disney Will Now Let You Make AI Slop of Its Characters on Sora",
    "description": "Disney is literally paying $1 billion for this.",
    "fullText": "If you've engaged in any sort of doomscrolling over the past year, you've no doubt encountered some wild AI-generated content. While there are plenty of AI video generators out there producing this stuff, one of the most prevalent is OpenAI's Sora, which is particularly adept at generating realistic short-form videos mimicking the content you might find on TikTok or Instagram Reels. These videos can be so convincing at first glance, that people often don't realize what they're seeing is 100% fake. That can be harmless when it's videos of cats playing instruments at midnight, but dangerous when impersonating real people or properties.\n\nIt's that last point that I thought would offer some pushback to AI's seemingly exponential growth. These companies have trained their AI models on huge amounts of data, much of which is copyrighted, which means that people are able to generate images and videos of iconic characters like Pikachu, Superman, and Darth Vader. The big AI generators put guardrails on their platforms to try to prevent videos that infringe on copyright, but people find a way around them. As such, corporations have already started suing OpenAI, Google, and other AI companies over this blatant IP theft. (Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April 2025, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nBut it seems not all companies want to go down this path. Take Disney, as a prime example. On Thursday, OpenAI announced that it had made a three-year licensing agreement with the company behind Mickey Mouse. As part of the deal, Sora users can now generate videos featuring over 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars characters. The announcement names the following characters and movies specifically:\n\nThat includes licensed costumes, props, vehicles, and environments. What's more, Disney+ will host a \"selection\" of these \"fan-inspired\" Sora videos. (I'll admit, that last point genuinely shocks me.) This does only apply to Disney's visual assets, however, as Sora users won't have access to voice acting. ChatGPT users will also be able to generate images with these characters, so this news doesn't just affect Sora users.\n\nYou might think OpenAI is paying Disney a hefty licensing fee here, but it appears to be quite the opposite. Not only is Disney pledging to use OpenAI APIs to build \"products, tools, and experiences,\" it is rolling out ChatGPT to its employees as well. Oh, and the company is making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI. (Is that all?)\n\nI know many companies are embracing AI, often in ways I disagree with. But this deal is something else entirely. I'm not sure any Disney executives actually searched for \"Sora Disney\" on the internet, because right now, you'll find fake AI trailers for Pixar movies filled with racism, sexual content, and generally offensive content—all generated using an app Disney just licensed all of its properties to. OpenAI asserts in its announcement that both companies are committed to preventing \"illegal or harmful\" content on the platform, but Sora users are already creating harmful content. What kind of content can we expect with carte blanch access to Disney's properties?\n\nNow that Disney's characters are fair game, I can't imagine the absolute slop that some users are going to make here. The only hope I have is in the fact that Disney+ is going to host some of these videos. Staff will have to weed through some garbage to find videos that are actually suitable for the platform. And maybe seeing the \"content\" that Sora users like to make with iconic characters will be enough for Disney to rethink its plans.",

    "title": "16 Shows Like 'Slow Horses' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "Spying liars and lying spies.",
    "fullText": "It's begin to feel like successful streaming shows are increasingly the exception, rather than the rule, and Slow Horses is something else again: a successful show with a more-than-consistent schedule. With five seasons since 2022, rather than the increasingly common \"every few years or when we get to it\" scheduling of other streaming shows, it's rather lovely to actually be able to remember the events of the previous series when the new one starts.\n\nIf this all sounds like damning with faint praise, it's also a smart, brilliantly entertaining show, with Gary Oldman as the slovenly, flatulent, once-brilliant spy Jackson Lamb now in charge of Slough House, the MI5 office for agents who aren't good enough to trust with important tasks, but who haven't really done anything worth getting fired for. Their very expendability puts them in the line of fire early and often, with ambitious spymaster Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) finding the team alternately useful and a liability. The show's been renewed for at least two further seasons—the novel series by Mick Herron on which it's based runs to nine books so far, and so there's potential for even more.\n\nThis is perhaps the most obvious streamalike here, if only because the shows are both Apple TV productions and are both based on Mick Herron novels. This one is more spy-adjacent, however, starring Emma Thompson as hard-living, hard-drinking private investigator Zoë Boehm. She's hired by Ruth Wilson's Sarah Trafford, a married art restorer who nobody takes very seriously (including and especially her husband), even when she becomes invested in the fate of a young girl whose family is killed in a gas explosion (allegedly) down the street. The girl, whose parents were killed, disappears into the system and no one really seems to care until Sarah hires Zoë and her husband to look into it. Turns out both women are in way over their heads, as the missing girl points to a much broader conspiracy. The shows villains are a bit cartoonishly distracting, but Thompson and Wilson are brilliantly paired, and their performances are more than worth the price of admission. Stream Down Cemetery Road on Apple TV+.\n\nMichael Fassbender as stars here as \"Martian,\" codename of Brandon Colby, a former undercover CIA agent just returned to London after six years in Sudan. He left behind a lover, Dr. Samia Zahir (Jodie Turner-Smith)—a relationship he wasn't terribly forthcoming about with his handlers. When Sami turns up in London as part of a diplomatic delegation, Martian is forced to choose between his job and his personal life, which becomes more complicated when it appears that she's involved in a broader scheme involving the Sudanese government, MI6, and an undercover agent in Belarus. It's all very twisty-turny in the best tradition of spy shows. Jeffrey Wright plays Martian's boss and mentor, Richard Gere is the CIA London Station Chief, and Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville is a shifty senior MI6 operative. Stream The Agency on Paramount+.\n\nIn addition to, or instead of, The Agency, you can also catch Le Bureau des Légends, the French original on which it's based (they're similarly addictive, though many will prefer the original on principle). Same general premise: Mathieu Kassovitz stars as Guillaume Debailly, a spy just recently returned from a six year undercover mission in Damascus, Syria. Trying to re-adjust to his life, everything is thrown into turmoil when Nadia (Zineb Triki), the woman with whom he'd had a relationship, turns up in Paris. Stream The Bureau on Paramount+.\n\nCinematic in scope, this new adaptation of the Frederick Forsyth novel is buoyed by rather brilliant casting: Eddie Redmayne plays the Jackal, a cold and steely international assassin pursued by MI6 operative Bianca Pullman—she's played by Lashana Lynch, putting her experience as the new 007 in No Time to Die to good use. I'm not sure there's anything here we haven't seen in countless other spy thrillers (including, of course, the 1973 and 1997 film adaptations), but the performances and production values are top-notch, with each episode playing out like a tense mini-movie. Stream The Day of the Jackal on Peacock.\n\nAn original drama from Scott Frank (The Queen's Gambit) and Tom Fontana (Homicide, Oz), Monsieur Spade finds Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade, of The Maltese Falcon fame, living a quiet life in retirement in the South of France. It's all going very well of the rumpled former detective—until six nuns are brutally murdered at a nearby convent, the same convent that's been home to Sam's ward for some time. Naturally, he finds his past has caught up with him, and is forced to surrender his idyllic life in order to help uncover the complex mystery that endangers his (very few) loved ones. Clive Owen is great as the rumpled, emphysemic detective, and the story feels like a fitting sequel to Hammett's novel. Stream Monsieur Spade on Prime Video and AMC+.\n\nSandra Oh and Jodie Comer star as the two halves that form one of television's great cat-and-mouse narratives, with Oh as Eve Polastri, a bored MI5 analyst who becomes obsessed with hunting down the brutal and notorious assassin known only as Villanelle. It starts as a professional compulsion before it becomes personal: Eve and Villanelle begin toying with each other, and it soon becomes clear that the fascination goes both ways. Stream Killing Eve on Prime Video, Paramount+, Britbox, Tubi, and Netflix.\n\nComing, as it does, from John le Carré, the wellspring of many modern spy sagas, it's probably no surprise that The Night Manager (from a 1993 novel) was successful—though it certainly doesn't hurt to have a cast lead by Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, and Olivia Colman. Hiddleston is Jonathan Pine, working the night shift at a luxury hotel in Switzerland when he encounters an unexpected guest: arms dealer Richard Roper (Laurie). Former Army veteran Pine had previous dealings with Roper in Cairo, and the reluctant night manager is persuaded by Foreign Office head Angela Burr (Colman) to infiltrate the criminal's organization. A long-gestating second season is coming in 2026, to be followed by a third. Stream The Night Manager on Prime Video.\n\nSlow Horses isn't a send-up of the spy genre, precisely, but it does enjoy taking the piss. The more overtly funny Deadloch is both an excellent crime procedural and an effective satire of the genre; the Australian import does about as well as setting up its central mystery as Broadchurch and its many (many) imitators. Kate Box stars as Dulcie Collins, fastidious senior sergeant of the police force in the fictional town of the title. When a body turns up dead on the beach, Dulcie is joined by Madeleine Sami's Eddie Redcliffe, a crude and generally obnoxious detective brought in to help solve the case. Unraveling the web of secrets and mysteries in the tiny Tasmanian town is appropriately addictive, with the added bonus of cop thriller tropes getting mercilessly mocked all the way. Stream Deadloch on Prime Video.\n\nThere are several imports on this list; Peacock is just too new to have a large stable of homegrown shows, but they’ve managed a handful of impressive acquisitions. In this British series, a young, ambitious detective with the London police department is tasked with the investigation of a soldier who’d only recently been exonerated for a war crime, but who seems to have turned around and assaulted and then kidnapped his lawyer (sorry, his barrister). There’s plenty of police procedural drama and international intrigue, but the show has a slightly different target: it’s looking at the dangers of our reliance on CCTV surveillance, and on the dangers of a widespread assumption that cameras don’t lie. London is one of the most heavily surveilled cities in the world, so there’s a particularly British point of view here, but the issues will be recognizable to anyone who’s spent time in any major city. A third season is on the way. Stream The Capture on Peacock.\n\nOne-upping the Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie on which it's based, Mr. & Mrs. Smith stars Donald Glover and Maya Erskine as a couple of spies tasked to pose as a married couple while coordinating (and sometimes competing against one another) on missions. Smartly, each episode takes on a standalone mission in a different location, while complicating the relationship between the two and gradually upping the stakes until the season finale, which sees them pitted against each other. The show has been renewed for season two, but it's been delayed, and it's unclear if Glover and Erskine will be returning, or if we'll be getting a new Mr. & Mrs. Stream Mr. & Mrs. Smith on Prime Video.\n\nH. Jon Benjamin, lovable schlub of Bob's Burgers, leads this show as Bob Belcher's polar opposite: a handsome spy who's also a deeply narcissistic womanizer with an endless capacity for alcohol. This is a full-on comedy, dealing with the exploits of a New York–based freelance intelligence agency led by Jessica Walter's hard-drinking Malory Archer—but it's such a smart send-up of James Bond-style shenanigans that it works as a spy series, as well, and sometimes the team's missions aren't all that much more silly than the plots of more overtly serious spy movies and shows. Addictive and irreverent, the show includes one of TV animation's best-ever voice casts, including Aisha Tyler, Amber Nash, and Judy Greer as the sociopathic heiress Cheryl Tunt. Stream Archer on Hulu and Tubi.\n\nThe Queen Latifah-led Equalizer reboots the 1980s series (and sidesteps the Denzel Washington movies) by spinning the premise in a slightly different direction: Latifah plays single mom Robyn McCall, an impossibly skilled former CIA operative who puts her talents to work for those in need. It splits the difference between crime and spy drama, with episodes involving close-to-home crime and others dealing with international espionage. While the original's vibe was more about the cops being handcuffed by things like \"rules\" and \"giving perps their basic human dignity,\" this one is more about those who've been failed by systems that don't care about them—and who might benefit from the help of a woman who can beat just about anyone's ass. It's very satisfying watching Robyn and company spy and/or punch their way out of sticky situations to help the oppressed. Stream The Equalizer on Paramount+ and Tubi.\n\nPark Chan-wook (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy) directs this series, based on the John le Carré novel, and brings an undeniably sexy period style. Florence Pugh is Charlie, a young actress recruited by Mossad spymaster Martin Kurtz (Michael Shannon) to infiltrate a group of Palestinian terrorists, even as she's being manipulated by an Israeli intelligence officer played by Alexander Skarsgård. Crucially, and as in the book that preceded it, the show offers nuanced characters on multiple sides of the conflict, raising serious questions about who the real villains are. Stream The Little Drummer Girl on AMC+ or buy it from Prime Video.\n\nSet during the Cold War 1980s, and created by former CIA officer Joe Weisberg, Americans follows Soviet KGB intelligence agents Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys), living lives as an American couple in the DC metro area—and raising their American-born children. The critically acclaimed (also popular!) show makes much of its period setting and a central conflict that places two spies in the heart of suburban America, even as they're tasked with undermining the Reagan-era government under which their children will grow up. Stream The Americans on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nThe focus shifts a bit after Homeland's first few seasons, the series begins with CIA case officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) coming to suspect that that decorated Marine Corps scout sniper Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), recently rescued from an al-Qaeda compound, has been turned and is planning a terrorist attack on the United States. Having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, her superiors don't give Mathison's suspicions much credence, kicking off a cat-and-mouse/is-he-or-isn't he? game between the two. Both leads won Emmys for their performances, and the series took the Outstanding Drama prize in its first year. Stream Homeland on Hulu and Netflix.\n\nNot a spy drama (at all), but a funny, and often very moving, comedy from the creator of The Good Place. Still: Undercover antics abound, so I'm going to say it counts as a bit of spy-adjacent counter-programming. Based very, very loosely on a true story, the show stars Ted Danson as Charles Nieuwendyk, a recent widower and retired professor who's started settling into a life of...not much, when, on a whim, he takes a temp job with a detective agency. They're investigating some missing jewelry at a local retirement home, and the dorky, awkward Charles makes for the perfect undercover resident, even as the job evokes memories of his late wife's Alzheimer's diagnosis. Ted Danson is in great form here, as is a supporting cast that, in the second season, includes real-life wife Mary Steenburgen. Stream Man on the Inside on Netflix.",

    "title": "The Best Gifts for DIYers (That Aren't Tools)",
    "description": "Getting stuff done around the house requires a lot more than just tools.",
    "fullText": "Gift shopping for the DIYer in your life can be a challenge. Tools are the obvious choice, but truly handy folks probably already have most, if not all, of the tools they need (in addition to a long list of tools they only needed once but still hang onto). And even if they do need a specific tool, your chances of picking out the precise make and model they want are pretty slim.\n\nBut no matter what level of DIYer you're shopping for, they likely need other stuff besides tools, from safety gear (which too many DIYers neglect), to cold-weather accessories, to the little extras that can make around-the-house projects a little easier, and maybe even more fun.\n\nSafety is paramount—it’s terrifyingly easy to injure yourself while working with any kind of tool. Just as important is the “wear and tear” your body goes through while working with loud power tools and while contorting your body in ways nature never intended. A few safety and comfort essentials for the DIYer in your life include:\n\nWork boots: Cold, wet feet make any job more miserable than it has to be, and if your DIY friend hasn’t dropped a hammer on their foot yet, don’t worry, they will. A pair of waterproof, toe-protecting work boots is a great gift.\n\nCut-resistant gloves: Working with power saws or hand saws means risking a nasty cut. Cut-resistant gloves protect those hands from all kinds of nicks and scrapes—and worse.\n\nSafety glasses: The number of DIYers who think they don’t have to worry about eye injuries is, frankly, stunning. Do your handy loved one a favor and give them some protective eyewear.\n\nKnee pads: I once spent a few days bent over in my crawl space, working, and my knees took a real beating. Knee pads may not be sexy, but they will be appreciated.\n\nHearing protection: Working with power tools can be hard on the ears. A pair of noise-canceling, rechargeable headphones that play music and allow hands-free operation of your phone while preventing hearing damage are a must-have.\n\nWhen I first started my DIY journey, my solution for working outside in the cold was to put on multiple layers of my regular clothes, which limited my mobility and made me sweat up a storm. A better idea? Some work gear designed for the cold weather:\n\nThermal gloves will keep hands from going numb while still offering protection.\n\nBase layers: The key to staying warm without getting chilled by your own sweat while working outside lies in having the right base layers—tops and bottoms.\n\nHeadgear: Keeping the head and neck warm while working outside is the key to keeping your whole body warm, because so much heat is lost through the head. A combination hat, scarf, and headlamp solves the problem.\n\nSome gifts for the DIYer are just about making every job a little easier or a little more fun.\n\nTool belts and work aprons: I went an embarrassingly long time carrying my tools around in my pockets or in awkward bundles. A tool belt gives you a perfect hands-free way to transport your gear, and a work apron does the same while protecting your clothes and body from dirt and projectiles.\n\nThe Bucket Boss: Another solution for lugging around your tools is a bucket organizer like the Bucket Boss, which makes bringing along every tool you might need a lot easier.\n\nA magnetic wristband: Give the gift of never having to carry a dozen nails in your mouth ever again.\n\nA headband lamp: At some point, every DIYer gets tired of trying to balance a flashlight in just the right spot. A lamp they can use hands-free will quickly become a favorite gift.\n\nA rugged Bluetooth speaker: Sure, everyone owns a bluetooth speaker these days—but handypeople will appreciate a Bluetooth speaker that’s durable enough for a worksite and that also uses the same batteries as their power tools.\n\nAnti-fatigue mat: Ah, the simple joys of standing hunched over a workbench for hours at a time. An anti-fatigue mat will spare your DIYer’s back and leave them refreshed after every job.\n\nBoot and glove dryer: There’s nothing worse than getting up to continue a big project only to discover that your boots and gloves are still soaked from the day before. Drying those items out in an hour or less? Magical.\n\nBeverage holster: Anyone who’s done work around their house knows that DIY work is fueled by refreshing beverages. Whatever your drink of choice, make it easy to have on hand at all times with this nifty holster.",

They [Stevenage] are near the top of the league for doing that well.\n\n\"But we can't play like that – it's not us. We've got a group that would probably struggle to play like that, if we were like that we'd be towards the bottom of the table.\n\n\"So we've got to play the way that gets the best out of our players and that's the way we play at the minute and we're doing it well.\"",

    "fullText": "Former England wicketkeeper Matt Prior says Jamie Smith needs to relish being the \"heartbeat\" of England's team and be up for \"the fight\" of trying to help the tourists recover from 2-0 down in the Ashes series.\n\nSmith has struggled in recent matches, failing to pass 33 in his past eight Test innings, while mistakes have crept in behind the stumps with the Surrey man dropping Australia's Travis Head in the second Test in Brisbane.\n\n\"The keeper's role has always been the heartbeat of that group on the field,\" Prior, who won three Ashes series with England in a 79-Test career, told the BBC's Stumped podcast.\n\n\"You're the drummer of the band, you help the captain and bowlers with angles. You know how the bowlers are getting on, how they're coming, are they still in rhythm, are they hitting the gloves well, are they not? Are the plans and tactics right for any given batsman, do they need changing?\n\n\"If you're internalising everything and just focusing on your own game, you can't concentrate on anything external which is hugely important to the captain, bowlers and the rest of the team.\n\n\"Jamie Smith, in that role as wicketkeeper, needs to want to be out there, want to be in the middle and want to be in the fight.\"\n\nEngland need to win the third Test in Adelaide to retain a chance of winning the Ashes and Prior said a re-focused Smith was vital to turning round England's fortunes in the series after two opening defeats.\n\n\"The best thing Jamie Smith can do is prep, make sure that your game's in good order,\" said Prior.\n\n\"Once that's done, you can't do any more than that - if you make a mistake, it's because you're human. When you get into the game then it's about everything external.\n\n\"Sometimes you have to force yourself massively, but just focus on 'Is Jofra hitting the gloves well? Is he swinging it back, is it going across, is the ball swinging, is it not?'\n\n\"Grab the fielders, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Zak Crawley - 'Right we're going to go pick a fight with Steve Smith'. That's the stuff you have to do.\"\n\nSpeaking on the Stick to Cricket podcast, former Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy said Smith needed to contribute tactically, but could rely on his team-mates to put pressure on the opposition.\n\n\"If you care for your team and care for your role as a wicketkeeper, you're going to give that bowler some advice, you're going to hatch a plan together. And the plan might not work but you feel like you're focused,\" said Healy.\n\n\"Being boisterous or talkative, someone's got to do it - when they're batting, they need to hear a presence. If you hear silence behind you then you're halfway through it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Healy added that Smith would be thinking of the excellent form of opposite number Alex Carey: \"It's a niggle in the back of your head.\n\n\"I've got to lift or I'm gone here, or my confidence is low – this bloke's making it look really easy. You have got an eye on the opposition keeper for sure.\"",

    "fullText": "Following the Chicago Bears' disappointing loss to the Green Bay Packers last Sunday, quarterback Caleb Williams is finding value in losing to their bitter rival.\n\nWilliams struggled in the first half before leading an impressive second-half comeback that included three scoring drives, including the game-tying touchdown. But he came up short on the final play of the game, throwing an interception to Keisean Nixon in the end zone in what would've been a game-tying touchdown to tight end Cole Kmet.\n\nNot only was the game a big one in terms of the rivalry between the Bears and Packers, but it had major implications on the playoff race in the NFC and NFC North. The loss to Green Bay knocked the Bears down from the top seed in the conference to the seventh, barely hanging onto their playoff hopes.\n\nFollowing the game, Williams discussed the positive takeaways from the high-stakes matchup and how it helps prepare him for the stretch run.\n\n\"Yeah, you know obviously our goal is to win every single game, and our goal is to win these games, and you know, get to the playoffs,\" Williams said. \"It’s a playoff atmosphere, going versus a rival and things like that. So, it’s good for us to be able to find ways to rally and obviously we want to focus on having a better outcome and starting faster and all these different things. But it’s definitely useful for us, just in case we go on the road at some point and in the playoffs and things like that. It’s something that we are going to use in the future and throughout my career. But we got to focus on this next game up to get to that point.\"\n\nFollowing an abysmal rookie season, which saw just five wins and multiple coaches fired, Williams has plenty of significance each and every week for the rest of the season. Getting started faster will be a big part of how the Bears can close out their season on a high note, and while Williams may not reach all his individual goals, getting the team to the playoffs is the best accomplishment he could have.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears QB Caleb Williams shares lessons learned in loss to Packers",

    "title": "Can a nepo baby be an underdog? The remarkable rise of Shedeur Sanders",
    "description": "The quarterback was seen as living off his father’s name when he entered the NFL. But he has slowly started to prove himself at the Cleveland Browns",
    "fullText": "It seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, the Cleveland Browns’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.\n\nHe excelled at two colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most dramatic stock crashes in league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.\n\nEarlier this week Sanders was named the Browns starter for the rest of the season, inviting even more scrutiny of a an already polarizing player. His supporters say Sanders is entitled to his shot; his critics say he lacks the skills to play in the NFL, question his attitude and paint him as a spoiled rich kid. Every argument seems to excavate deeper feelings about Deion Sanders, his Prime Time father who paved the way for his son’s success. In the age of the nepo baby, Shedeur makes for a strange underdog story.\n\nThere are expectations that come with being a starting quarterback in the NFL, after all. In addition to the requisite physical attributes and arm talent, the cliche dictates that quarterbacks are men of character – players who speak in the first person plural, deflect credit, absorb blame and lead with modesty. It’s how the quarterback position became shorthand for a standard of American leadership that was largely reserved for conservative white men until recently. But Shedeur doesn’t even resemble the Black quarterbacks who have in the last few years broken from that tradition and transformed the league. Instead, in character at least, he resembles his father. Deion is a flashy, brash and supremely self-confident two-sport superstar universally recognized as one of the best players in NFL history.\n\nAfter becoming the first Browns quarterback to win his first start since the team’s 1999 relaunch, a soundbite of Shedeur effectively congratulating himself for playing well despite his limited practice time overshadowed the more diplomatic remarks he’d make in praise of the team later. (“Imagine what a full offseason looks like,” he beamed. “It gets dangerous!”) When he was asked last Sunday if a botched two-point conversion attempt had worked during practice, he laughed. (“I don’t think you call plays in a game that didn’t work in practice,” he cracked.) After being criticized for his remarks in the media earlier this season, he was asked about the Browns’ quarterback situation. Sanders repeatedly answered by grinning and then silently moving his mouth in response – which had fans jokingly referring to him as Mime Time in a nod to his father.\n\n“We want our quarterbacks to be very, very humble,” says Louis Moore, the Michigan State history professor and author of The Great Black Hope: Doug Williams, Vince Evans, and the Making of the Black Quarterback. “He’s not that. He’s grown up believing that he’s allowed to have confidence in himself. The world beats down a lot of young Black kids, and Deion never let it happen.”\n\nThe biased nature of the scrutiny on Shedeur, especially when things don’t go his way, often results in fans bringing up racism. They further wonder whether Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski holds a grudge against the Sanders family because his father-in-law, Tim McCarver, had an infamous run-in with Deion during the latter’s baseball career.\n\nBut the issue isn’t quite so black and white. Somehow, the Sanders family manage to inspire Obama-level respect and enthusiasm among Black Americans (who helped make Shedeur’s Browns jersey a bestseller) while also having Donald Trump in their corner. The current president hasn’t hesitated to cannonball into the Shedeur Sanders discourse, calling NFL owners “stupid” for letting him fall in the draft and trumpeting “I TOLD YOU SO!” on social media after Shedeur led the Browns past the Raiders. Trump couldn’t let those moments pass without making some mention of Shedeur’s “exceptional genes” in what was otherwise a forceful show of support.\n\n“I’m just thankful for [Trump] even taking time out of his day to speak out,” said Shedeur, reveling in his nepo baby status. While Peyton Manning was determined to overshadow his father Archie’s fruitless years with the New Orleans Saints and Bronny James shrinks from the allusions to the more prominent Lakers player in his family, Shedeur has been happy to share a spotlight with his famous father for more than a decade.\n\nA good chunk of his adolescence was documented on Deion’s Family Playbook, a reality TV series that ran on Oprah’s cable channel. Shedeur then played under his father when Deion coached at Mississippi’s Jackson State University and the University of Colorado, and the pair were instrumental in reviving both of those programs. Wherever Shedeur goes, there’s usually a camera following him – and oftentimes his older brother Deion Sanders Jr, the architect of the family’s vast online media presence, is the one holding the camera. Around family, Shedeur reverts from a football star to a little brother who gets razzed about his fashion choices and his position on his father’s sibling power rankings.\n\nBeing Deion Sanders’s son made Shedeur savvy to how NFL storylines are shaped, and the one he’s crafted about himself strikes the media – who are used to taking charge of the narrative – as presumptuous. He calls himself “legendary”, shrugs off brickbats (“You think I’m worried about what critics say?”) and throws words like “destiny” around when projecting his career path. Resentments linger about his starry approach to the draft process that may well have cost him the chance to be picked higher. It was thought that Deion was the one quarterbacking things behind the scenes at this year’s draft, but he has since revealed that it was Shedeur who may have rebuffed higher draft opportunities in Philadelphia and Baltimore because he didn’t want to sit behind two established starters, Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson – a pretty smart read as it turns out.\n\n“I know the fight behind the fight,” Deion Sanders said earlier this season. “I know what’s been transpiring behind the curtains, and I’m just proud of him. Because he’s not just saying the right things, he’s doing and living the right things. That’s just who he is … He’s a Sanders.”\n\nShedeur has only played in four NFL games, two of those against bad teams, which is too small a sample size to make concrete pronouncements about his career. But his performances so far for the Browns, a team who have sunk the careers of countless quarterbacks, hint that he is dramatically better than his lowly draft position suggests. And while his chance to finish out the season is the first true vote of confidence he has received since joining the organization, there’s a sense that he isn’t so much playing for his Browns future as he is playing for the chance to thrive elsewhere. That’s because the Browns made a $230m commitment to the injured Deshaun Watson and are determined to see if they can get their money’s worth when he returns to fitness. With this season long lost, really all that Shedeur has to play for is trade value, pride and teammate Myles Garrett shattering the single-season sack record – but of course that’s the popular spin.\n\nFor Shedeur, it’s just the latest chapter in a story that ends with him going down as the one of the biggest underdog success stories in sports – the draft afterthought who became an NFL legend. (Sound familiar?) That dissonance of an underdog with privilege shows the extent to which nepo babies have taken over the narrative.",

    "title": "Browns vs. Titans: 5 takeaways from Cleveland's NFL Week 14 loss",
    "description": "The Browns lost yet another one, and this time to the measly Titans. So, yeah, we have some thoughts.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns' 31-29 loss to the Tennessee Titans in Week 14 was a study in frustrating contradictions.\n\nOn one hand, the team showed flashes of a potentially bright future, particularly on the offensive side of the ball. Rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a statistical performance that should give the organization and its fans genuine hope for the future, leading the offense on a thrilling, if ultimately incomplete, fourth-quarter comeback attempt. His connection with fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. was explosive and dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the loss starkly illuminated the systemic flaws that have plagued the Browns throughout this disappointing season. The defense, usually a bedrock of strength, struggled significantly, particularly against the run game, allowing a career-day for Titans running back Tony Pollard. Furthermore, the persistent issues on the offensive line and costly mistakes, including a momentum-killing interception and two failed two-point conversions, proved to be the difference against a struggling Titans team.\n\nThis defeat, dropping the Browns to 3-10, was a painful reminder that potential, even when dazzling, is no substitute for consistency and flawless execution, especially when facing a team desperate for a win.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the snowy, frustrating afternoon at Huntington Bank Field.\n\nShedeur Sanders showed another significant step in his development on Sunday, logging the best statistical game by a rookie quarterback this year with 364 yards passing and three touchdowns, plus a rushing score.\n\n23/42, 364 pass yds, 3 pass td, 29 rush yds, 1 rush td, 1 int\n\nmore highlights on https://t.co/xMzvHOeNay pic.twitter.com/mfCA7cgkGc\n\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 8, 2025\n\nSanders showed up when the team called his number, orchestrating two late touchdown drives. However, the one play he definitely wants back is a costly third-quarter interception on what looked to be a scramble drill attempt, where he overshot his man, flipping the game's momentum.\n\nSanders is still holding onto the ball longer and more often than any other quarterback in the league, leading to unnecessary pressure, sacks, and backbreaking turnovers. But if his can be ironed out further and his internal clock can be sped up, the Browns might just have their future quarterback already at the helm, proving he can handle the NFL stage.\n\nThe rookie tight end out of Bowling Green, Harold Fannin Jr., continued his impressive run as a leading pass-catcher for the Browns.\n\nFannin racked up 114 yards and a touchdown on eight receptions against the Titans, marking a career-high for the young player and joining Ozzie Newsome as the only rookie tight ends in Browns history to record a 100-yard receiving game.\n\nHis blend of size, hands, and route-running ability makes him a matchup nightmare, and he is quickly solidifying his place as a core component of the Browns' offense for years to come. In an offense struggling for consistent playmakers, Fannin Jr.'s emergence is a major win.\n\nLinebacker Devin Bush has been lights out for Jim Schwartz's defense this season.\n\nAgainst the Titans, he added a key interception to his stat sheet, reading quarterback Cam Ward's eyes perfectly for a 44-yard return that set up a Browns scoring drive. Bush is playing like the dynamic, first-round pick the Steelers thought they were getting out of Michigan all those years ago.\n\nDevin Bush intercepts Cam Ward!\n\nTENvsCLE on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/adKxo8zSCL\n\nIn a league that values three-down linebackers, his strong, consistent performance this year, especially in coverage, has positioned him for a substantial contract in the upcoming free agency period.\n\nThe myth of the weather advantage was definitively debunked on Sunday. As the snow fell, the Titans' lead grew, largely due to the Browns' defense slipping and sliding all over the grass.\n\nThe conditions seemed to hamper Cleveland’s pursuit angles and tackling, leading to a career game from Titans running back Tony Pollard, who ran for 161 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nTony Pollard 65-yard TOUCHDOWN.\n\nTENvsCLE on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/UZ9c5ifvfN\n\nThe Titans' effective ground-and-pound strategy mitigated the Browns' fearsome pass rush, turning the supposed home-field edge into a distinct disadvantage for the defense.\n\nWhile Shedeur Sanders' tendency to hold onto the ball for a long time certainly allows for more pressure to be created, the offensive line is not without blame.\n\nThe unit's lack of consistency in play and availability has been a recurring and season-long problem, culminating in a performance where key starters suffered significant injuries. With starting center Ethan Pocic reportedly suffering a likely season-ending Achilles injury and other starters battling injuries, the unit is in shambles.\n\nThe team is likely looking to replace four of the five starters this offseason. A number that could be jumping to five of five if veteran left guard Joel Bitonio finally decides to hang up the cleats at season's end.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns vs. Titans: 5 takeaways from Cleveland's NFL Week 14 loss",

    "fullText": "ESPN's Greg Wyshynski has released his latest trade board for ESPN, and three Chicago Blackhawks have made the cut: Jason Dickinson, Connor Murphy, and Laurent Brossoit.\n\nDickinson making this trade board is not particularly surprising. The 30-year-old center is a pending unrestricted free agent (UFA) and is the kind of player that playoff teams like to add at the trade deadline. This is because he is a solid veteran two-way forward who works on the penalty kill and also provides some grit. In 17 games so far this season, he has recorded two goals, three assists, five points, and a 52.3 faceoff winning percentage.\n\nLike Dickinson, Murphy is another Blackhawks pending UFA who should grab the attention of clubs. It is no secret that playoff teams are always on the hunt for big right-shot defenseman, and Murphy fits that description. Because of this, the veteran defensive defenseman should be a popular target if the Blackhawks make him available near the deadline.\n\nAs for Brossoit, it is not a secret that they have been looking to find him a new home. The 32-year-old goaltender is currently on a conditioning assignment with the Rockford IceHogs, where he is playing in his first game action since the 2023-24 season.",

    "description": "The Yankees' shortstop, currently recovering from shoulder surgery, may have serious competition for his job in 2026.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Anthony Volpe is one of the brighter players in the Yankees clubhouse — he would’ve ended up at Vanderbilt as the Plan B out of high school — so I’m confident the news from the Winter Meetings on Wednesday was not lost on the 24-year-old.\n\nGeneral manager Brian Cashman effectively announced the shortstop position is up for grabs next season. A report also emerged from The Dallas Morning News indicating the Yankees had checked in with the Rangers about shortstop Corey Seager. Both developments came within the span of a few hours.\n\nThe warning should be clear: The goodwill from the front office is now bundled with a deadline for 2026.\n\nIt’s time for Volpe to finally become the stud the Yankees thought they drafted in 2019.\n\n“The game separates it all, the men from the boys (and) dictates who should and who shouldn’t be playing,” said Cashman as one of several money quotes.\n\n“People continue to earn their playing time or they don’t,” Cashman said.\n\n“If it’s competition of the guys on the club, may the best man win and keep it, the general manager said.\n\nCashman made sure to ask and answer his own question about Volpe — “Do I believe in Anthony Volpe? The answer is yes,” — but didn’t let that vote of confidence stand on its own.\n\nThat’s because utilityman Jose Caballero has ascended to the Yankees’ circle of trust. He has a legitimate chance to replace Volpe.\n\nListen to Cashman acknowledge the battle is on:\n\n“Do I believe Caballero has got a lot of talent? The answer is yes,” Cashman said.\n\nThe head-to-head battle, as riveting as it sounds, will have to wait a bit. Volpe is still recuperating from shoulder surgery and won’t be fully healed until late April or maybe early May.\n\nBut that’ll give Caballero the time and exposure to convince the Yankees he’s more than just a charismatic role player. In a tale of the tape, Caballero is the better defender and base stealer, while Volpe has more power and — that maddening word — potential.\n\nWe’ve been hearing about his upside since 2023. Yet, three years later, Volpe’s average is still stuck in the .220s for his career while he’s regressed in the field.\n\nNo American League player committed more errors than Volpe’s 19 in 2025. Volpe, in fact, was arguably MLB’s worst everyday player.\n\nHis surgery only further complicates matters. There’s no guarantee Volpe will be himself even after an all-clear from the doctors.\n\nTorn labrums are no joke. They heal slowly and sometimes not entirely. Orthopedists say repairing that particular tendon has only a 75% success rate. Luckily for the right-handed Volpe, it’s his left shoulder that’s being rebuilt.\n\nThrowing and swinging the bat will be unaffected. It’s diving for ground balls up the middle — re-creating the very move that tore Volpe’s shoulder in the first place — that poses the greatest risk for re-injury.\n\nCashman said Volpe is “doing well” in his third month of physical therapy at Yankee Stadium. The shortstop has headed down to Tampa to continue his rehab for the rest of the off-season.\n\nThe heavy lifting now rests with the front office. Sooner or later, Cashman will have to make a call on Volpe’s future.\n\nThe process begins with a searing question: What kind of player is Volpe, really, and how good can he be?\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone, who’s stood behind the kid for the last three years, offered a surprisingly candid answer.\n\n“Ultimately, we want to try to get more production out of (Volpe),” after explaining that all tweaks, changes in approach and philosophy have failed to move the needle.\n\nVolpe is still 30-40 points below the Yankees’ projections. His periodic home runs — some in the biggest moments — have been swallowed up by monster slumps and careless errors.\n\nSomething has to give. Either Volpe becomes a latter-day prime DJ LeMahieu, powering line drives the other way — or he becomes an airtight asset at short.\n\nEither one of these paths can save Volpe’s career in New York. But he can’t whiff on both. And the audition won’t last much longer. Volpe needs to have a breakthrough in 2026.\n\nPerhaps the Yankees won’t wait even that long. The news of the club’s interest in Seager means one of two things:\n\n1 — Either Cashman called the Rangers out of due diligence and nothing more. General managers routinely send out feelers. Most conversations go nowhere.\n\n2 — Or else Cashman’s support for Volpe isn’t so firm. It’s noteworthy that he initiated the dialogue with Texas, not the other way around.\n\nAnd the fact that he asked about the very player who could solve the Yankees’ problem at shortstop? That’s not a coincidence.\n\nSeager is 31, a borderline elite hitter with formidable power. He blasted 30-plus home runs three years in a row (2022-24) before injuries limited him to 21 last year.\n\nHe’s solid in the field, a notch below the game’s best shortstops.\n\nThere’s a catch, though. Seager is still owed $189 million through 2031 after signing a 10-year, $325 million deal that started in 2022. And then there’s the issue of how to re-arrange the infield to make room for him.\n\nTrading second baseman Jazz Chisholm and moving Volpe to second base is one possibility. Or dealing Ryan McMahon (and undoubtedly pitcher Will Warren, too) and moving Chisholm to third. Volpe replaces Chisholm at second.\n\nThe Yankees would benefit from either one of these swaps. But that’s only if Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner is willing to pay Seager $31.5 million a year.\n\nSo let’s all exhale. None of this will happen if Cody Bellinger returns. Steinbrenner isn’t rich enough to afford Bellinger and Seager in the same off-season.\n\nYankees fans mad about payroll?

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly eyeing a move for a Barcelona midfielder who has played just two times for the Spanish senior team.\n\nThe Blues have been pretty quiet in terms of any big transfer noise for January, but there are certainly a few little rumours bubbling away.\n\nSuffering injury problems in midfield, this is an area where the club are clearly keeping eyes on a number of names to perhaps come in and strengthen that area of the pitch. The club are also dealing with a lot of fatigue at late, and you can even see that players like Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez are playing with injuries. It’s far from idea.\n\nIs Barcelona’s Marc Casado the answer though? He is now being linked with a possible move to Chelsea in 2026.\n\nMarc Casado playing for Barcelona (Photo by Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images)\n\nChelsea are keeping a close eye on the situation of 22-year-old Barcelona midfielder Marc Casadó, according to TEAMtalk, which adds that the Blues have had conversations about signing a handful of Barca players in the last year.\n\nCasado has just two Spanish senior caps to his name after playing for them through the youth ranks. He has 56 apps to his name for Barcelona’s senior team, and 67 in their B-Team.\n\nReece James has conducted a team meeting with the rest of the payers, as Chelsea captain, in order to discuss their recent struggles against the lesser teams and how to control them better.\n\nThis comes off the back of Chelsea losing 2-1 to Atalanta in the Champions League on Tuesday night earlier this week.",

    "title": "Jumbo Package: Kalen DeBoer rumors are an unneeded distraction",
    "description": "Your latest Crimson Tide news and notes.",
    "fullText": "As Brent covered last night, Michigan fired head coach Sherrone Moore after a bizarre and dark episode that could very easily have turned tragic. Kalen DeBoer was immediately named as a top target, despite his assurances to Alabama fans earlier this season that Tuscaloosa is a place that college football coaches just don’t leave.\n\nDennis Franchione would disagree. Look, none of us can know what Kalen is thinking. What we do know is that Michigan is a blue blood program with plenty of money, it’s much closer to Kalen’s South Dakota roots, and Ryan Grubb’s wife is a Michigan alum from Detroit who still works in Michigan. Courtney Morgan is a Michigan alum who curiously left his alma mater in 2022 after one year in the GM role, to join DeBoer at Washington.\n\nYou can bet that Michigan has already been in talks with Jimmy Sexton about DeBoer. He is going to get a handsome offer, and if he stays then Alabama fans know that he truly wants to be here. But, Alabama also may not be willing to match an outrageous offer if the Wolverines are desperate enough to make one.\n\nAnd this is just the kind of distraction that the team doesn’t need.\n\nIn any case, there is a game to be played in eight days. Katie Windham wrote about some areas that need improvement, the offensive line chief among them.\n\nSo many of Alabama’s offensive issues start up front. Alabama has not been able to run the ball well all year and finished with negative rushing yards against Georgia in the SEC title game. Pass protection hasn’t been great either as Alabama is ranked 86th in the country with 25 sacks allowed. It seemed like Simpson was being pressured almost every time he dropped back to pass going up against the Georgia defensive front.\n\nAlabama has been dealing with some issues on the offensive line with center Parker Brailsford not at full health according to DeBoer. Guard Geno VanDeMark has also missed time with injury. Regardless of who is available for the CFP, the play has to be better overall. Of course, there needs to be improvement from Simpson and all of Alabama’s running backs, but help from the line will only make the other units on offense better.\n\nNick Kelly notes that, absent injury, changing quarterbacks at this stage isn’t the answer for this team.\n\nDid Simpson miss some throws in the Georgia game? Yes. Could he have played better? Yes.\n\nBut was he the No. 1 problem for the offense in the Georgia game? No. Not even close.\n\nAlabama’s receivers had their worst game of the season in the SEC Championship Game. They dropped 20.8% of the passes, per Pro Football Focus. That was the highest since the Florida State game, when the Crimson Tide dropped 14.8%. Alabama had six drops in the SEC Championship Game alone after 14 total in prior conference games.\n\nMeanwhile, Simpson faced the most pressure he’s seen in any SEC game. Georgia pressured him 18 times, per PFF. The previous SEC high was 15 times against Missouri.\n\nBefore anyone starts about Tua and Jalen, times were much different then. Alabama was still blowing the doors off of most SEC teams, which gave Tua substantially more experience at this point of the season than either of Alabama’s 2025 backups. Throwing Austin Mack or Keelon Russell to the wolves in the playoffs just doesn’t make any sense.\n\nPaul Myerberg is already firing off predictions, and he believes that Alabama beats Oklahoma before succumbing to Indiana.\n\nNo. 9 Alabama 21, No. 8 Oklahoma 16: Oklahoma won the earlier matchup in Tuscaloosa, sparking the Sooners’ late rebirth as a playoff contender. Look for this one to be a low-scoring, defense-focused affair defined by which team wins the turnover battle. That favors the Tide, but only barely.\n\nEmilee Smarr continues the series celebrating Alabama’s first national title in 1925.\n\nThe starters who carried Alabama football to its first national title in 1925 are celebrated in the program’s history, but the foundation of that legendary squad was laid just as much by the depth of its backups.\n\nThese players – a mix of future stars, versatile workhorses and determined reserve players battling through injury − made sure the Crimson Tide wouldn’t be one-and-done, many going on to take the field in the program’s 1926 national championship. From eventual team captains to track stars, NFL champions and local legends, their contributions stretched beyond the stat sheet and etched the identity of Alabama football.\n\nLast, Notre Dame’s hissy fit is beyond the pale. They initially garnered sympathy thanks to the committee’s rug pull on them, but they have quickly reminded the college football world just how entitled they are.\n\nPerhaps things would have been different if Southern Cal was a little better or Syracuse hadn’t fallen apart or Purdue was further along in its rebuild. But no program, even Notre Dame, can truly position itself to win a national championship in this playoff era with two or three decent games a year, most of them early in the season.\n\nAnd it’s probably going to get worse, especially if Notre Dame can’t come to an agreement with USC to extend their longstanding rivalry. Texas, also smarting from missing the CFP, has made noise about canceling its series with Notre Dame in 2028-29. Athletic directors in other leagues, who learned from Yahoo Sports’ Ross Dellenger on Sunday about the memorandum of understanding that grants Notre Dame preferential playoff access, are threatening to freeze them out of future schedules.\n\nNotre Dame brass has reportedly reached out to both the Big Ten and SEC, but neither is likely to give them the sweetheart deal they got with the ACC. Still, Notre Dame independence may not sustain much longer.\n\nThat’s about it for now. Have a great day.",

    "title": "Why the Detroit Lions present unique challenge to Rams’ offense",
    "description": "The Detroit Lions defensive tendencies make for an fascinating matchup against the 13 personnel-heavy Los Angeles Rams.",
    "fullText": "One of the bigger narratives surrounding the Los Angeles Rams’ explosive offense is their newfound love of 13 personnel—one running back, three tight end sets. The Rams almost never used 13 personnel under head coach Sean McVay—only 84 times during McVay’s first nine seasons. But this year, the Rams lead the NFL in plays with 13 personnel, with a whopping 170 snaps—or 21.4% of the time. The league average 5.25%.\n\nLast week against the Arizona Cardinals, that number jumped to 60%. Why? Well, the Rams’ offense has been trending in that direction more and more as of late. It also loosens the load off of their explosive receiving corps, and with the Rams jumping out to a big lead last Sunday, they wanted to drain the clock with their running game.\n\nBut McVay also noted that with the way the Cardinals were playing the Rams—stubbornly staying in nickel (five defensive backs)—they knew they’d be able to run the ball against Arizona.\n\n“They came out in a lighter grouping and they basically dared you to run it based on what they were doing,” McVay said Tuesday. “And to the guys’ credit, (center) Coleman (Shelton), the offensive line, Matthew (Stafford), and the rest of the tight ends and the receivers on the field, they did a good job of being able to recognize it and get good, efficient runs early on.”\n\nThe Rams finished with 249 rushing yards 6.9 yards per carry, and three rushing touchdowns against the Cardinals. Per SumerSports, the Rams rank top-10 in both passing (0.34 EPA/pass, eighth) and rushing efficiency (0.13 EPA/rush, fourth) out of 13 personnel.\n\nDetroit Lions coach Dan Campbell knows of another benefit to using so much 13 personnel. It helps tip off what the defense is going to do.\n\n“I think there’s predictability in 13, normally you know what you’re going to get,” Campbell said. “Sometimes in 12, you don’t know if you’re going to get nickel or base defense. So, that’s another reason. They know what they’re going to attack. They know probably the defense, the fronts, the coverages, that helps. And they’ve got tight ends. They’ve got some tight ends that are versatile and do a little bit of everything, that’s always going to help.”\n\nIn short, 13 personnel forces more defenses to play in base (four defensive backs), which gives the offense an advantage knowing they’ll be facing heavier personnel—which many opponents may not want to do.\n\nBut the Lions are different. Detroit lives in heavy, base formations more often than any other team—regardless of what offenses are throwing at them. Per Sharp Football, the Lions live in subpackages (like nickel) at the lowest rate in football (35%). They believe they have the personnel to be able to stop the run and defend the pass with three linebackers on the field. And so they don’t view 13 personnel as a particular threat to get them out of their comfort zone.\n\n“When I hear a lot of 13 personnel, that they’re trying to dictate stuff,” Lions linebacker Jack Campbell said on Wednesday. “Because you only have a limited menu (against 13). I can’t speak for other defenses in the NFL, but usually you have a limited menu in 13 personnel, because not a lot of teams run it. You’re going to get base (defense) out there. You’re going to probably get three linebackers out there, which we play a majority of the time. So it’s not really going to matter.”\n\nJack Campbell admitted the Rams operate out of 13 personnel in a very complicated way, often using their players much like they would in 12 or even 11 personnel, because their tight end group is extremely talented and versatile. But, again, he reiterated that the Lions’ defense is uniquely prepared against 13 looks.\n\n“It’s going to be a challenge, but at the same time, it’s not really—in my opinion—going to affect us terribly, just because I feel like we’re used to playing with three linebackers already,” Jack Campbell continued. “We kinda have some calls into that. We can mesh it on in, and the guys who are out there are versatile players.”\n\nOf course, McVay already knows Detroit’s tendency to stay in base. So it wouldn’t be surprising to see the Rams play a little less 13 against the Lions defense. For as much attention as they’re getting in 13 personnel, McVay offenses are more historically defined by their heavy use of 11 personnel (three wide receivers). And despite their recent uptick in 13, the Rams still use 11 personnel at the eighth-highest rate in the NFL this year (66.8%).\n\nBut they aren’t as efficient running the ball out of those sets (0.03 EPA/rush, 17th), meaning the Lions could force them out of their comfort zone on Sunday, as long as they remain a strong run defense in base. And if the Lions can slow the Rams’ rushing attack, it could be the key to pulling off a big road upset.",

    "title": "Champions League review: Liverpool sidestep Salah saga as Chelsea slip up",
    "description": "Manchester City conquer the Bernabéu, Liverpool survive without Mohamed Salah and Atalanta find Chelsea’s flaws",
    "fullText": "• To say that Pep Guardiola and Real Madrid have history is to put it mildly. At Barcelona, Guardiola grew up amid an obsessive enmity on both sides, one deepened by his term as the Catalan club’s coach. They are highly familiar with Manchester City, too. City met Madrid for the fifth season in succession on Wednesday. Despite Madrid’s recent struggles under Xabi Alonso, winning at the Santiago Bernabéu is a huge result, a deserved win where City might have been out of sight by half-time. Rodrygo scored his habitual goal against City but one of Guardiola’s new generation in Nico O’Reilly equalised before a controversial penalty award, converted by Erling Haaland, decided the game. A player linked with a move to Madrid sometime in the distant future celebrated with a smirk; Jude Bellingham’s attempt to distract by trying to yank Haaland’s ponytail did not work. After the selection misstep that led to defeat to Bayer Leverkusen, Guardiola got it right in Madrid to leave a lifelong rival in flux. In acknowledging an opponent wracked by injury and infighting had made for an easier task than usual, high standards came to the fore. “I’ve been here [at the Bernabéu] many times in the last five years and we have played much better than today and not won,” Guardiola said. He talks – and his team plays – like he has his mojo back.\n\n• No Mohamed Salah, taking gym selfies back on Merseyside, but the Champions League continued to be a haven for Liverpool and Arne Slot. If you can’t find it, grind it? Pre-season hopes of a forward line costing over half a billion dollars carving through opposition are set aside in the hustle for results. Beating Inter at San Siro was crucial for resetting the equilibrium imbalanced by Salah’s weekend outburst. “All I could ask for,” said Slot, an inadvertent victor of the Salah saga, maintaining diplomacy by concentrating on those players who travelled to Milan. “Only 14 outfield players available with Premier League or Champions League experience … tonight it should be all about the players that are here.” Slot reserved high praise for Ibrahima Konaté, who starred amid his troubled season. It was Dominik Szoboszlai who converted the decisive, if controversial, penalty. In a season of flux, Szoboszlai’s positive influence has been a happy constant.\n\n• The English response to Atalanta’s defeat of Chelsea was to voice concerns about Enzo Maresca’s team’s wild inconsistencies. The broader, continental view is to appreciate the continued rise of the Serie A club from Bergamo. It was only last month that Ivan Juric was sacked after just five months in charge – marginally longer than the Croat lasted at Southampton – after a seven-game winless run in the league. His successor, Raffaele Palladino, has instigated a revival including successive Champions League wins, beating Chelsea following the defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt. Gianluca Scamacca, formerly of West Ham, cancelled out João Pedro’s opener from Charles De Ketelaere’s cross. While Robert Sánchez’s goalkeeping was suspect for the winner, De Ketelaere’s solo run had carved Chelsea wide open. “An amazing feeling, with the fans behind us, against the champions of the world,” said De Ketelaere, one of the best of Belgium’s new generation. Atalanta continue to be an admired nursery of talent who also deliver results. Even though the talismanic coach Gian Piero Gasperini is now at Roma, the 2024 Europa League winners are well-set for automatic qualification.\n\nJules Koundé, from right-back, notched two headers as Barcelona mounted a comeback to beat Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1, the first assisted by Marcus Rashford, the second by Lamine Yamal; the first time a Barça player has scored two headers in the competition. Other nominees include De Ketelaere, Arsenal’s Noni Madueke for his double in Bruges and Ajax’s Israeli winger Oscar Gloukh, who also scored twice, against Qarabag, for his club’s first win.\n\n“Thanks, Nicky ... shame on you,” read a banner displayed by Club Brugge fans during their 3-0 home defeat to Arsenal. It was a protest after Nicky Hayen, their popular coach, was sacked on Monday. “Not our club,” read a series of handmade signs. The coach who masterminded a league title in 2023-24, and the Belgian club’s fine showings in the Champions League last season, had been linked with the Celtic vacancy. His replacement, Ivan Leko, declaring himself a Hayen admirer, said: “The supporters’ banners? Honestly, I’m proud of them.”\n\nOn beINSports’s broadcast to the Middle East and North Africa, Ruud Gullit leapt to the defence of Jude Bellingham at Real Madrid, dismissing Richard Keys’s trenchant opinions. “He can’t play in the same way he could when [Toni] Kroos was there. When he and [Federico] Valverde are there, they have balance. Now it has to be another guy,” said Gullit, who claimed the Englishman was being sold short by all-star colleagues not tracking back.\n\nKeys responded: “He is an agitator, not a victim. He might be [a great player], but there’s a reason that Thomas Tuchel won’t pick him.”\n\nGullit hit back: “That’s a ridiculous suggestion. He is the best player they have. He just wants to win.”\n\n• Napoli meanwhile, are 23rd in the table, and play Copenhagen in 24th next time out. Antonio Conte’s Champions League record pales into insignificance compared to his domestic titles. “I know how much we have spent both physically and mentally,” he said of his side’s weekend victory against Juventus, in justification for the 2-0 defeat to Benfica in Lisbon.\n\n• Is late-stage José Mourinho performing a miracle? Benfica, inherited winless and pointless in the Champions League, moved to 25th after beating Napoli, and he enjoyed a barb at his old rival Conte. “Saying Benfica were fresher physically feels like an excuse,” said Mourinho. Next up are another familiar foe in Juventus. Following that, Real Madrid. “Character and intelligence, a Benfica mentality,” is how Mourinho envisages his club reaching the knockouts.\n\n• As for Juventus, their timely 2-0 win against Pafos came courtesy of Weston McKennie’s goal and a strike from Canada’s Jonathan David. McKennie’s brilliant effort was the 50th scored by a USMNT player in the Champions League. All eyes on that new year meeting with Benfica.",

    "fullText": "While the Denver Broncos' defense approaches the NFL's single-season sack record, outside linebacker Nik Bonitto is chasing an individual franchise record.\n\nVon Miller -- Bonitto's childhood idol -- holds Denver's individual single-season record with 18.5 sacks (set in 2012). Bonitto, who is the team's first player since Miller to record double-digit sacks in consecutive seasons, hopes to surpass Miller's franchise record.\n\n“It’s within range, but it’s going to be tough,\" Bonitto told the Denver Gazette's Chris Tomasson. \"I’m going to have to have some good ones over the last couple of games. So we’ll see.\"\n\nBonitto has 12.5 sacks through 13 games. If he continues that current pace, he'd end the year with about 16 to 16.5 sacks, just shy of Miller's record. Bonitto would have to average more than 1.5 sacks per game over the final four weeks to break the record.\n\nUp next on Denver's schedule are Jordan Love (18 sacks), Trevor Lawrence (32 sacks), Patrick Mahomes (29 sacks) and Justin Herbert (45 sacks). Combined, those QBs average 2.38 sacks per game. Earlier this season, Bonitto totaled two sacks against Herbert (Week 3) and none against Mahomes (Week 11).\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: Denver Broncos: Nik Bonitto chasing Von Miller's sack record",

    "fullText": "The return of captain Todd Cantwell will see an upturn in results for Blackburn Rovers, says boss Valerien Ismael.\n\nRovers are currently 20th in the Championship table with just one win from their past six matches as they prepare to visit fellow strugglers Portsmouth on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\n\nCantwell, 27, returned from a two-month absence with a knee injury at the start of December and has appeared as a substitute in the draws with Ipswich Town and Oxford United, scoring a penalty against the U's on Tuesday.\n\n\"We've found the way and the shape for this team, and we have the position for Toddy as well, which is really good,\" Ismael told BBC Radio Lancashire.\n\n\"He was on an unbelievable level before his injury. Now he's back we still need to manage him. Every time it's a closed discussion with him - how he feels and how long he thinks he can play.\"\n\nIsmael also believes handing the club captaincy to Cantwell following the departure of Lewis Travis in August has brought a new dimension from the forward.\n\n\"At the beginning of the season when I made the decision, I had a long discussion with him. For almost one hour, we discussed everything,\" Ismael added.\n\n\"I think the responsibility was a big lift for him, he wanted that.\n\n\"He came to a point in his life where he wanted to prove to himself that he's able to do that, to change maybe the image that people have got of him [that he's a] soft player and not consistent with a lot of quality, and I think he's shown that he's a leader.\"\n\nIsmael is hopeful midfielder Sondre Tronstad could return for the trip to Fratton Park while goalkeeper Balazs Toth and midfielder Ryan Hedges could be involved against Millwall on December 20.",

    "fullText": "Quarterback Justin Herbert underwent precautionary postgame X-rays on his fractured left hand after the Chargers' win over the Eagles, which came back \"clean for the most part\".\n\nThe X-rays were taken to ensure that no further damage occurred during the game in which he played with a protective glove. On Wednesday, Herbert stated that his hand is feeling much better this week compared to last, and his focus is on reducing swelling and improving grip strength.\n\nHerbert mentioned the hand was still sore, saying that playing on it, using it, and falling on it during the Monday night game were likely the causes for the soreness.\n\nHerbert finished the game as the team's leading rusher, logging 66 yards on ten carries. He wasn't as prolific as usual in the passing department, completing 12 of 26 passes for 136 yards. But most of the lack of production was due to the Eagles' stifling defense, which locked up the Bolts' receivers and consistently pressured him.\n\n\"I missed a lot of throws and played uncharacteristically. There's a bunch of plays that I'd love to have back,\" Herbert said.\n\nHerbert was a limited participant in Wednesday's practice but is expected to play in this Sunday's game against the Chiefs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: Justin Herbert injury: Chargers QB provides update on hand",

    "fullText": "A violent attack has shaken the lead-up to the Conference League match between Rayo Vallecano and Jagiellonia Białystok in Poland.\n\nAccording to reports from the public television TVP, several Rayo Vallecano fans heading to the match were brutally attacked in the early hours of Thursday. The incident occurred on the S8 route, near Prosienica, when a group of hooded individuals intercepted the buses carrying the supporters.\n\n11.12.2025, Jagiellonia Bialystok🇵🇱 - Rayo Vallecano🇪🇸. Yesterday Night, a bus carrying members of Bukaneros (Rayo Vallecano) from Warsaw to Bialystok was attacked by 50 Jagellonia Hooligans, 10 Spanish fans injured heavy ko, click here for more: https://t.co/oSpZ67Yoa2\n\nAll in… pic.twitter.com/GIpzthgwz8\n\n— Hooligans.cz Official (@hooliganscz1999) December 11, 2025\n\nThe attack was planned and executed by a group of several dozen individuals who blocked the buses with two cars. The attackers were hooded and armed with telescopic batons, wooden clubs, and other weapons, according to local police.\n\nThe swift intervention of a police patrol, alerted by the presence of the masked group, was crucial in preventing the incident from escalating further. Upon the arrival of the officers, the assailants fled in various directions.\n\nThe attackers managed to escape through a cut fence that provided access to the S8 highway. However, the Mazovia police acted quickly, arresting seven people, including a woman, all residents of Białystok.\n\nAs a result of the attack, preliminary reports indicate that ten Rayo Vallecano fans were injured. Three of the affected individuals had to be taken to a hospital for specialized medical attention. The rest of the injured supporters were assisted by paramedics at a gas station near the ambush area.\n\nThis type of violence is not unfamiliar to Polish fans. A few months ago, a similar incident was reported when masked supporters of Jagiellonia Białystok attacked fans of the Belgian Cercle Brugge.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

Look back at the teams’ recent schedule challenges and see if this short week compounds a busy calendar — especially for the road team. Practice and prep time are at a premium during these short weeks... and they will lose a day to travel.\n\nThursday games also leave less time for teams to heal up. Injured players don’t have the same window for recovery and are often ruled out early. Even players nursing bumps and bruises, or playing through pain, can feel the squeeze of the short week, so read up on who’s hurting — but not listed on the injury report.\n\nCoaching can give a big edge on the short week. Give the benefit of the doubt to veteran coaches and experienced staff, who are known for their game prep and have navigated the challenges of TNF before.\n\nThursday night games can also be an advantage for cold weather teams come December and January. Temperatures plummet when the sun goes down and places like Green Bay, Chicago, and Buffalo turn into frozen wastelands. While the sub-zero temps impact both sides, visitors from warmer cities or indoor stadiums may struggle to adapt when the mercury drops.\n\nHome-field advantage can get a bit of a boost on Thursday nights. The home crowd has been tailgating all day, rather than partying for a 1 p.m. or 4 p.m. ET kickoff. That ravenous crowd is then released into the stadium, giving the home hospitality a little extra bite.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Justin Gaethje is set to fight for the UFC interim lightweight title against Paddy Pimblett at UFC 324 on January 24th. It’s a title fight that has a lot of controversy attached to it because it doesn’t include the true No. 1 contender at 155: Arman Tsarukyan. But Gaethje isn’t bothered by all the drama.\n\nIn a new interview with Submission Radio, Gaethje — already a former interim lightweight champion — explained how the belt is just a tool to help him get where he wants to go at the end of his career.\n\n“You know, on paper, this makes you a champion,” he said of the interim title. “They have to pay you as a champion. I think that is spectacular, and I definitely recognize that. Outside that, I understand that it gives me the opportunity to fight Ilia Topuria … So these are the opportunities that I really signed up for this sport for, that I asked for.”\n\n“I’d be a fool to think that this is the beginning of my career,” Gaethje said. “This is definitely towards the end. And what a way to finish: beat Paddy, beat Ilia, and then if there’s another contender, beat them and be done. Ultimately, to [have] failed [to win the undisputed belt] and have the opportunity to come back and achieve gold will be exactly the story that I’ve been trying to write. I’ve been trying to inspire people.”\n\nAt this point the overwhelming emotion being shared online is disdain for the UFC’s booking practice. Even though most of that was leveled at Paddy Pimblett, Gaethje felt it as well.\n\n“I felt just as much hate for me as I did for [Paddy],” he said. “If you’re an Arman fan, you obviously feel slighted, and I understand that. But this is such a crazy game, and timing is everything. I beat Dustin Poirier, and then he ended up fighting for a belt after that. This is just a crazy game.”\n\n\"THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND?\" 🤝👀\n\nArman Tsarukyan has officially offered to help Justin Gaethje prepare for his Interim Title fight against Paddy Pimblett.\n\nThe #1 contender wants to make sure \"The Baddy\" doesn't leave with the belt.\n\nVia: @espnmma pic.twitter.com/xkR5nt0zlP\n\n— Bloody Elbow (@BloodyElbow) November 30, 2025\n\n“And if you ”\n\nAs for Arman Tsarukyan’s offer to train Gaethje for Pimblett, “The Highlight” won’t be accepting.\n\n“Yeah, I saw that,” Gaethje said. “I would say that was more of him trying to go against Paddy rather than help me. I’m not gonna go and start making drastic changes in my training camps when it comes to getting ready for these fights. I trust the team that I have. I will bring in training partners. But I’m not gonna bring in guys that I’m probably and possibly gonna fight in the future.”\n\n“I think he’d be a great training partner, but ultimately, I might have to fight him one day. So I think that’d be not smart.”",

    "fullText": "“We have worked well this week. We need to improve the version from the other day to reach twenty points as soon as possible.”\n\n“To achieve the best version, we have to improve in everything; in attack and defense, be protagonists with the ball, and without the ball, prevent Real from reaching the final third of the field. They are good in this area.”\n\n“We have a squad to achieve good results, and at times we have done so. But we must keep suffering to improve further.”\n\n“The strength of a team lies in the group, and we have a competitive squad. I cannot focus on the absences.”\n\n“To overcome them, we will have to play at two hundred percent.”\n\n“I have talked about it with the players. We have to be a strong team, with and without the ball. Our best version is when the team enjoys being on the field. And that is something I have missed in some matches.”\n\n“When Livakovic arrived here, the first thing I did was talk to him and explain the physical, technical, tactical, and mental sensations I need in a goalkeeper, both in attack and defense. We were already in competition, and I told him that he needed a process. I told him he was a very good goalkeeper but that he needed this process to understand the game, the language, and the way the team plays. For example, when we lost 0-4 against Levante, the alarms went off. And he was not ready to play, in his head yes, but not under the conditions I require.”\n\n“Livakovic is a spectacular person, but he has a timeline with objectives different from Girona's. He needs to play for the World Cup, not for Girona. He told me this himself; he is a sincere person. He told me he didn’t want to be here, that he wanted to play for another team because if he played with Girona, he wouldn’t be able to play for another team. The rules state that, per season, a footballer can only play for two teams, and he had already done so with Fenerbahce.”\n\n“The fact that Livakovic didn’t play the Cup is not a technical decision. He was supposed to play, and he told me he wouldn’t. Gazzaniga played in Ourense with the flu and a fever of thirty-eight degrees. Right now, I only have one goalkeeper available.”\n\n“Gazzaniga’s commitment is beyond any doubt. Until the winter transfer window, I know we have a problem. And I am not defending my position but defending the goalkeeper who has been here for three years, which is Gazzaniga.”\n\n“Although what I am explaining is a private matter, I have to share it because the fans need to know.”",

    "fullText": "Former Georgia Bulldog and college football analyst Aaron Murray released his prediction on the College Football Playoff. He went on his social media account to release the prediction, and he went with his former team, picking the Georgia Bulldogs to win the national championship.\n\nHe pointed out all the winners of each playoff game, so Georgia would defeat the No. 6 Ole Miss Rebels, the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes, and the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers to win the national championship. Another wrinkle in his Georgia pride is he predicts former Georgia quarterback Carson Beck to go far in the playoff, with his Miami Hurricanes beating No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 2 Ohio State on their way to the semifinals. Beck would face his former team in that game if Murray's prediction comes true.\n\nMurray might be showing some bias to his former team, but the Bulldogs should be considered a championship-caliber team. ESPN's Football Power Index structure has the Bulldogs in the second-tier of championship contending teams, behind Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nHowever, Georgia has one of the strongest resumes in the playoff, placing second behind just Indiana in strength of record, a stat that quantifies how good a team is based on if an average Top 25 team would have that team's record or better, given that team's schedule.\n\nBias aside, Aaron Murray's prediction illustrates how easy of a path Georgia has to the national championship. In the Sugar Bowl, the Bulldogs get to play either Ole Miss, a team that they've already beaten, or Tulane, a Group of Five opponent. In the semifinal, they play either Ohio State, who has an 0-2 record vs. Georgia, Texas A&M, who beat just one opponent currently in the top 25 (Notre Dame), or Miami, who has their former quarterback.\n\nGonna be one heck of a playoff but only 1 team can win it all\n\nAnd that team will be THE GEORGIA BULLDAWGS pic.twitter.com/F5YvKyHxxr\n\n— Aaron Murray (@aaronmurray11) December 9, 2025\n\nFollow UGA Wire on Instagram or Threads for more Georgia football coverage!\n\nThis article originally appeared on UGA Wire: Aaron Murray predicts CFP, winner of national championship",

    "description": "BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty takes a look at whether the Liverpool striker's claim is justified.",
    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah's incendiary interview attacking Liverpool head coach Arne Slot and the club after he was left out of the draw at Leeds United contained one memorable soundbite that stuck out above many others.\n\nIt was the 33-year-old's claim he had been \"thrown under the bus\" after a glittering Liverpool career encompassing all major prizes and 250 goals that put him third on their all-time list of scorers.\n\nSalah's outburst came after he was left on the bench for a third successive Premier League game as Slot tried to end a sequence of nine defeats in 12 games.\n\nThe Egyptian did not disguise his belief he had been made a scapegoat, provoking divisive debate when Slot and Liverpool needed unity and calm – but was his claim justified?\n\nSalah says he has been 'thrown under the bus' by Liverpool\n\n'A clear challenge to Slot's authority in Salah's show of rebellion'\n\nSalah has the selfish streak and pride that is the preserve of all the greats – as was seen when then Manchester United manager Erik ten Haag, a Dutch countryman of Slot, dropped Cristiano Ronaldo at the end of his second spell at Old Trafford in November 2022.\n\nRonaldo's response was to give an interview to Piers Morgan on TalkTV in which he complained, as Salah has effectively done now, that he was \"betrayed by the club\".\n\nManchester United and Ronaldo agreed, within days, to cancel his contract.\n\nSalah's contract will not be cancelled.\n\nLiverpool would, if they sold, demand a sizeable fee for a global figure who signed a new two-year contract in May, but such is the Egyptian's strength of feeling, reconciliation looks difficult.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Salah will even get the farewell he hinted at when Liverpool play Brighton on Saturday before he heads off to the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nSo does the evidence support Salah's assertion that \"it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame\" and that \"someone doesn't want me in the club\"?\n\nSalah has been a shadow of his old self this season. For the first time, someone who looked at the peak of his physical and footballing powers last season has started to look his age.\n\nThe contrast in numbers is stark and unflattering.\n\nHe was the inspiration as Liverpool won a 20th title last season, scoring 34 goals in 50 starts in all competitions. This term he has made 16 starts, scoring only five times.\n\nSalah's ability to do defensive dirty work was also called into question, with Chelsea's Marc Cucurella suggesting they targeted Liverpool's right flank in their 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in October because he was \"always ready to attack\".\n\nNot a problem when Salah is providing a regular supply of goals, but brought into sharp relief when they dry up.\n\nSalah, however, feels he is right to flag up he has hardly been Liverpool's only problem this season.\n\nHe, more than anyone, has missed Trent Alexander-Arnold after his move to Real Madrid, the pair forming a magnificent partnership as Liverpool claimed major honours, including two Premier Leagues and the Champions League.\n\nAlexander-Arnold played 147 line-breaking passes for Salah when the title was won last season, the most any player provided for a team-mate in the Premier League.\n\nFormer Liverpool and England defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport: \"Trent leaving has had an impact on Salah. Their partnership, if not exactly unnoticed, was almost taken as read. They are world class individuals, but it was also a partnership.\n\n\"They really complemented each other. Trent could go inside, draw people towards him, which freed up more space for Salah. And when Salah drove at people he had the ability to feed Trent because teams were backing off.\"\n\nSalah can also point elsewhere in Liverpool's team and wonder why others have not received the same treatment.\n\nIbrahima Konate's poor form is irrelevant as he is a central defender and Liverpool lack cover, but Cody Gakpo's contribution on the left flank has been fleeting this season, the Netherlands international too predictable.\n\nFlorian Wirtz has offered little since his £116m move from Bayer Leverkusen while Alexander Isak, a British record signing at £125m from Newcastle United, has scored one Premier League goal.\n\nAnd yet it is Salah who has been sacrificed.\n\nSalah did not name names, but it is understandable a world class player and one of Liverpool's all-time greats would feel he has been singled out\n\nThe argument has merit. Its expression did not.\n\nLiverpool's head coach – whoever it was – would eventually have to handle a transition that would conclude Salah's Anfield career. This task has fallen to Slot.\n\nThe fact it comes so quickly after Salah won last season's Professional Footballers' Association player of the year, the Football Writers' Association Footballer Of The Year, as well as Premier League player of the year and the Golden Boot, makes it even more contentious.\n\nNo player has limitless credit – think Steven Gerrard being nudged towards Anfield's door by Brendan Rodgers in 2015.\n\nDoing nothing was not an option. Dropping Salah was a pragmatic choice to stop Liverpool being so vulnerable and more defensively solid. The champions have conceded 24 goals in 15 league games compared to 41 all last season.\n\nSlot also spent £450m in the summer, the clearest signal Liverpool were moving into a new era.\n\nIn public, Slot has been nothing but respectful to Salah, although the player is convinced their relationship is now broken.\n\nSlot said after Salah was dropped to the bench for the win at West Ham United, the first time in a Premier League game since April 2024: \"No matter if he plays well or if he doesn't play well, if he plays or doesn't play, he will always be that top professional and that's what he was in the last two days.\"\n\nIt should also be noted that Salah had only been on the bench for three games in six days before making a rare, but as always carefully calculated, stop to speak to reporters at Elland Road.\n\nSlot also had to plan for the short and long term, with Salah leaving for Afcon after the Brighton game.\n\nThe Dutchman must deal in reality not sentiment. He needed results quickly and Salah's numbers have not read well.\n\nSalah's legs have not carried the pace of old. His dribble success is down to 23% this season compared to 56% in his first season. Can he still go past players?\n\nSlot places great store in winning duels – and Salah's rate is down to 28% from 38.7% in his first season.\n\nSalah's exclusion has, to an extent, worked, with Liverpool winning twice and drawing twice in his absence, including the vital Champions League win against Inter Milan in the San Siro.\n\nSlot's selection at West Ham provided a clear signpost to life without Salah, as the all-round strength of Dominik Szoboszlai was deployed in his right flank role with Wirtz dropping behind a striker to pull the strings.\n\nHe then used a diamond midfield in Milan, with Wirtz on the bench and Isak and Hugo Ekitike as twin strikers.\n\nThis means Slot can point to the fact Liverpool have not lost since Salah was dropped.\n\nThe argument, however, will rage on.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid against Manchester City has become one of the Champions League's biggest rivalries. A fixture that always delivers on drama - a game that always involves high stakes.\n\nFor some, the stakes could not have been higher on Wednesday evening at the Bernabeu. but the way the 90 minutes played out was poetry in motion for City – akin to Rudyard Kipling's If.\n\nA tale about resilience and virtue, both qualities that were needed to overturn Europe's serial winners.\n\nAs the poem goes: 'If you can keep your head, when all about you are losing theirs' and with one win in five La Liga games, Xabi Alonso was under real pressure to deliver.\n\nIt should be pointed out that while City were facing Los Blancos for the 15th time, this is still a Pep Guardiola side in transition.\n\nYoung players were at the Bernabeu for the first time and stepping into a cauldron of expectation where the home fans are running low on patience.\n\nYet while chaos reigned for Real, the visitors stayed calm, composed and diligent in their defending and came from behind to secure the points.\n\nDespite being decimated in defence and Kylian Mbappe only making the bench, Real still boasted a line-up littered with megastars.\n\nFamiliar protagonist Rodrygo scored his obligatory goal against City and Vinicius Junior huffed and puffed, but it was north Manchester's own Nico O'Reilly who walked away with the player of the match award.\n\nNot only did the 20-year-old score the equaliser, he was involved in vital clearances and was consistent in City's counter-attacking.\n\nCelebrating one of their own is familiar territory for City fans – Stockport's Phil Foden is testament to that. Victory tastes even sweeter when a local lad and academy graduate has been so paramount to the win and so it was a night to toast Moston's O'Reilly.\n\nUnfazed in one of the most overawing stadiums in the world, the midfielder-turned-left-back's controlled performance was vital to City coming away with all three points.\n\nReal Madrid may be directing their own soap opera but O'Reilly lived out one of literature's most timeless poems:\n\n'Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, Nico,\n\nAnd—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son.'\n\nEmily Brobyn is regularly on BBC Radio Manchester - find all their Man City audio here",

    "description": "The Bills are two games behind New England but favored to win.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are tied for the best record in the NFL. And yet, they're not even favored at home this week.\n\nAn oddsmaker's power ranking doesn't always match public perception or a team's record. The Buffalo Bills are very unlikely to win the AFC East but they are still the favorites to win the AFC. The Bills have the shortest odds to win the conference at +375. That belief in the Bills is reflected in this week's point spread.\n\nThe Bills, who lost to the Patriots at home back in Week 5 and are two games behind New England in the standings, are 1-point favorites at BetMGM vs. the Patriots on Sunday. That's an interesting line.\n\nThe Patriots have been slighted a bit for playing the easiest schedule in the NFL so far this season, but winning 10 games in a row is difficult no matter the opposition. And the Patriots do have good road wins at Buffalo and at Tampa Bay. The Bills have Josh Allen, but they haven't been great. They have bad blowout losses to the Falcons and Dolphins. Last week they were in danger of losing to the Bengals at home until Christian Benford had a magical pick-6 and turned the game around. You can pick holes in New England's season if you wish, but the same can be done to the Bills. On top of it all, the Patriots are well rested coming off their bye week.\n\nMaybe Josh Allen plays the superhero role and keeps the Bills' chances at an AFC East title alive (the Patriots clinch the division title with a win on Sunday) but we'll give some respect to the Patriots and make them the pick at +1. It seems like getting proper respect won't be easy for this Pats team.\n\nHere are the rest of the picks for Week 15 in the NFL, with odds from BetMGM:\n\nIt's hard to back either team. The Bucs are coming off a miserable loss to the Saints, and their offense is in a slump. More specifically, Baker Mayfield is in a slump. His rating the last four games is 65.2. On the other side, the Falcons have lost seven of eight, and the last two gams were a loss to the lowly Jets and a 28-point loss to the Seahawks. But, we have to pick one of them.\n\nThe Bengals beat the Ravens 32-14 on Thanksgiving, in Baltimore. Not much has changed since. The Ravens are showing, week after week, they're not very good. So why are they favored here? Theoretically the Ravens could suddenly emerge as the stellar team everyone though they would be this season, but we've been waiting for that for months and it hasn't happened.\n\nIt seemed last week like the Commanders had one good performance left in them this season, and it came two weeks ago in a crushing overtime loss to the Broncos. Last week's effort against the Vikings was startlingly bad. They might already have their luggage packed for the trip to Cancun. The Giants aren't great either but they are rested after a bye.\n\nThere will be a few instances this week of teams in look-ahead spots. It's not all that common in the NFL, but how will the Bears get up to face the Browns when they know the Packers are coming to town six days later? The Browns have a good defense and until the past couple weeks, the theme of the Bears season was having a bunch of close wins, mostly over bad teams.\n\nThe only reason to believe in the Chiefs laying this many points is the argument that they are in must-win mode. But they've been in must-win mode for weeks. It hasn't mattered. The Chiefs aren't as bad as their 6-7 record (they're No. 6 in DVOA, haters) but this line seems a point or two too high. Would it be that surprising to see the Chargers win straight up?\n\nThe Eagles look broken and the Raiders are the NFL's worst team. What fun. Geno Smith is unlikely to start this week for the Raiders, which actually might not be a bad thing. Still, I can't take the Raiders. If there was ever a get-right spot for the Eagles, this is it. If they struggle here, they're really in trouble.\n\nBrady Cook might get the start for the Jets because Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor are hurt. Cook is an undrafted rookie who threw for 11 touchdowns in 12 games last season at Missouri. He'd be operating in an offense that hasn't been good no matter who is playing at quarterback. Anything seems possible in this weird NFL season, but this is a bad spot for the Jets.\n\nThe problem with taking the Cardinals is it's hard to figure out how they score on the NFL's best defense. But it's not like the Texans offense is a scoring bonanza either. Last week we took the Cardinals, based on the fact that a large number of their losses have been close. It didn't work out last week. Let's try again.\n\nThe Broncos certainly aren't without flaws, but a 2.5-point home underdog? That's surprising. Both 11-2 teams are underdogs at home this week, which says a lot about the wide-open nature of the NFL this season. Another factor in backing Denver: The Packers play at Chicago in Week 16 for what practically amounts to the NFC North title game. It shouldn't surprise anyone if they have an eye on that game.\n\nThis one is an even more extreme look-ahead spot. The Rams play at Seattle four days after this game in a meeting that could determine the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The Rams are a veteran team with a great coach, but how could they not be thinking a little bit about that game? Also, the Lions have extra rest after playing on Thursday night, which is usually an edge. Even if the Rams play well, the Lions have a good enough offense to always be in play for a backdoor cover. Be careful if you're taking the Rams here.\n\nThe Panthers have had a really weird season, with multiple quality wins and some miserable losses. One of those losses came to the Saints, and it wasn't all that close with New Orleans thoroughly outplaying Carolina in a 17-7 game. How could we know which Panthers team will show up? We'll hope for the one that is fighting for a division title late in the season.\n\nThe Titans have actually covered the spread in four of their last five games. It's not a good team but one that is still playing hard. The 49ers should blast the Titans. But that's not how the NFL typically works.\n\nThe Colts have eight wins and it wasn't just because of Daniel Jones. It has been a pretty good team this season, despite a recent slide. Yes, it's scary to depend on 44-year-old Philip Rivers or whoever plays quarterback against one of the NFL's best defenses. It could get ugly. But as is said often in this space, double-digit underdogs usually look hopeless, and then they somehow cover.\n\nProof that it would take a court order for the networks to flex a Cowboys game out of prime time. It's time to test whether Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy is turning a corner. He looked good last week, but that came against a really bad Commanders defense. If he can go on the road and have another positive outing against a Cowboys defense that has been better since the Quinnen Williams trade, maybe the narrative surrounding him will start to change. But let's see it happen first.\n\nThis is a strangely interesting game. The Dolphins started 1-6 but have rallied and aren't dead in the playoff race at 6-7. The Steelers can have some awful games, but they lead the AFC North at 7-6. It's a test for that Dolphins hot streak, considering they've been mostly beating bad teams and doing it with Tua Tagovailoa producing very little.",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns are set to take on the Chicago Bears this weekend, and quarterback Shedeur Sanders will have a new starting center. With Ethan Pocic being carted off and diagnosed with a ruptured achilles, third-year player and former Ohio State Buckeye Luke Wypler is now taking over upfront for the Browns.\n\nAnd it sounds like Wypler is ready to roll. At least, according to Sanders. Speaking to the media, Sanders was asked about his new center and how he'll step in for the injured Pocic. Here is what Sanders had to say:\n\n“Luke’s definitely a hungry dawg, so we gotta get that back, connection going... Luke’s definitely ready to step up and do what he’s gotta do. So I’m thankful that we do have a hungry dawg connection that we’re able to get out there and feel back to normal, like we are on the practice field.”\n\n#Browns Shedeur Sanders on losing C Ethan Pocic for the season, and fellow “Hungry Dawg” Luke Wypler replacing him: pic.twitter.com/hH6N7IynTv\n\n— Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) December 10, 2025\n\nThis will serve as a month-long audition for Wypler. As long as Wypler's play isn't a complete liability, there is a strong chance he will be the Browns' starting center in 2026. If he plays at a high level this last month of the season, there is even a chance the Browns try to give Wypler an early, relatively cheap, and ahead of the market contract extension so that he doesn't have to go into the season on the last year of his deal.\n\nIs Wypler up to the task?

    "fullText": "The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has confirmed chief executive Abi Tierney will return to fully resume her leadership position in the new year.\n\nTierney has been undergoing medical treatment following a cancer diagnosis and began a phased return in November.\n\nChair Richard Collier-Keywood and the rest of the WRU's executive leadership team had stepped in on an interim basis but Tierney will be back in charge next month.\n\n\"This is a pivotal time for the game in Wales and, whilst I've been constantly kept informed and am across all developments, I'm looking forward to being able to contribute directly again,\" said Tierney.\n\n\"My treatment is going well and I've received a positive prognosis which allows me to return in the new year.\n\n\"I'd like to thank everyone who has wished me well over my time away and sent positive messages of support.\"\n\nWRU chair Collier-Keywood wants to stay in role\n\nAbject failure becoming the norm - where does Welsh rugby go from here?\n\nWRU Q&A: Why drastic change is needed\n\nTierney will return on a full-time basis at a time where Welsh rugby finds itself in yet more crisis.\n\nSteve Tandy's men's national side have just suffered a record 73-0 home defeat against South Africa, while Wales captains Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake have been linked with a move from Ospreys to Gloucester.\n\nThe WRU announced in October that it planned to reduce the number of professional men's sides in Wales from four to three.\n\nWelsh rugby's governing body confirmed it proposes to grant three licences for men's clubs.\n\nThere will be one in Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west, which is expected to result in a straight survival fight between Ospreys and Scarlets in Llanelli.\n\nAnother option that has now emerged is Ospreys owners, Y11 Sport & Media, taking over WRU-owned Cardiff, which could produce the desired number of three professional sides.\n\n\"Of course, there are significant and major challenges presented to Welsh rugby at this time,\" said Tierney, \"but there is also a huge opportunity for us to forge a way ahead in our professional game which will safeguard its future.\n\n\"There is a lot more hard work ahead, but our strength in Welsh rugby is in our ability to unite and work together towards one collective aim.\n\n\"I am looking forward to contributing to this again.\"\n\nCollier-Keywood will revert back to his responsibilities as chair.\n\n\"I know I speak on behalf of the whole game in Wales when I welcome Abi back into her role,\" said Collier-Keywood.\n\n\"We are making progress in our transformation programme for the professional game in Wales, but Abi's return will add new and positive impetus at this pivotal time.\"",

They have a fantastic coach like Max [Allegri], who can coach in a way that Antonio [Conte] and Cristian [Chivu] can’t because they have many games to play,” Mourinho argued.\n\n“Unfortunately, I think it will be among these three.”\n\nROME, ITALY – NOVEMBER 30: David Neres of Napoli scores his team’s first goal during the Serie A match between AS Roma and SSC Napoli at Stadio Olimpico on November 30, 2025 in Rome, Italy.

    "description": "Jared Goff no longer has any lingering emotions about his trade from Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "Jared Goff's 2021 trade from the Los Angeles Rams to the Detroit Lions came as a shock. Los Angeles wasn't far removed from a Super Bowl appearance and Goff had flourished under Sean McVay after a rocky rookie season.\n\nDespite that, McVay wanted more at the position, and boldly decided to swap Goff for Matthew Stafford. The move didn't just surprise football fans and analysts, it also shocked Goff, who said he was blindsided by the deal at the time.\n\nGoff will square off against his former team and coach in Week 15, as the Lions travel to Los Angeles to play the Rams. But if you think Goff is still harboring any ill will toward the Rams over that trade, that's not the case.\n\nGoff downplayed the contest Wednesday, saying the trade was \"a long time ago\" and that he's spent an equal amount of time in Detroit now. When asked whether he would feel \"an emotional charge\" from playing his former team, Goff said, \"No, not so much anymore.\"\n\nThe Lions quarterback noted that he's played his former team a few times since leaving Los Angeles. The two teams have met twice in the regular season and once in the playoffs. Goff is 1-1 vs. the Rams in the regular season. He did manage to beat the team in the playoffs in 2024.\n\nAs Goff was being asked another question about playing against the Rams, he quipped, \"We're still talking about this? Alright, go ahead.\"\n\nThe Goff-Stafford trade was a win-win for both teams. In his first year with the Rams, Stafford led the team to a Super Bowl win. He's proved to be a great fit for McVay's offense, and is still putting up tremendous numbers in 2025.\n\nGoff has taken a step forward with the Lions, and is a big reason why the team has been a powerhouse in the NFC over the past few years. While Detroit hasn't won the Super Bowl with Goff, the team has put up some eye-popping offensive numbers with him under center.\n\nGoff may not feel any extra motivation against the Rams on Sunday, but there is a lot at stake for Detroit. At 8-5, the team finds itself just outside a playoff spot. The Lions are still very much in the hunt to punch a ticket to the playoffs, and beating the current top seed in the NFC would go a long way toward Detroit securing its third straight postseason appearance under Goff.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets were blown out in Week 14, losing 34-10 to the Miami Dolphins in Week 14.\n\nTheir record stands at 3-10 with four games remaining. The real-time 2026 NFL draft order is becoming clearer every week.\n\nThe Jets are slated to possess two first-round picks in 2026, their own and the one originally belonging to the Indianapolis Colts, as a result of the Sauce Gardner blockbuster trade. New York entered the weekend with their own selection at No. 7 overall and it did not change following Sunday's results.\n\nFive 3-10 teams are currently scheduled to own picks 4-8, and head coach Aaron Glenn's squad has the second-best strength of schedule (.541) among that group.\n\nThe Jets stay at No. 7 in the draft order, per ⁦@tankathon⁩ pic.twitter.com/M3Sl1GqZk7\n\n— Brian Costello (@BrianCoz) December 8, 2025\n\nIn better news, the pick originally belonging to the Colts was slated for 23rd overall entering Week 14. Following the Colts' blowout loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, it has improved to No. 21. Starting quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles injury and Indianapolis fell to third place in the AFC South.\n\nThe Jets still don't own a top-five selection. If quarterbacks Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields aren't able to return following their Week 14 injuries, it's difficult to imagine the Jets winning a game with rookie undrafted QB Brady Cook in the lineup. We'll be monitoring the updated draft order every week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Where are the Jets' Round 1 picks after Week 14 loss?",

The New York Mets saw Edwin Diaz leave for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Pete Alonso sign a big contract with the Baltimore Orioles (which left Mets fans NOT OK). Kyle Schwarber is still a member of the Philadelphia Phillies. Whew! That's a lot of news!\n\nBut there are still some big names left to be signed. So we're rounding them up for you in order of talent. Let's go:\n\nThe jewel of the offseason didn't sign anywhere. Whoever signing him should be prepared to dole out A LOT of money for a player who can do it all.\n\nHe was positively raking before a knee injury prematurely ended his regular season. Anyone looking for a shortstop who can drive in runs would love to sign him.\n\nHe's 32 and spent some time on the injured list this season. But he's still a top infield option for contenders.\n\nWere his numbers inflated thanks to Yankee Stadium? We'll see if that's true, if he signs elsewhere.\n\nThe pitcher who went from bullpen stud to solid starter should get paid.\n\nHe's probably a middle-of-the-rotation guy, but a VERY valuable one if he keeps this up.\n\nHis rough end of season may be a factor, but he's still a top-end starting pitcher still in his prime. That's worth a lot.\n\nThe Japanese slugger has been posted by his team, the Yakult Swallows, and he could be a sneaky good addition.\n\nHe's getting up there in age (34) but he can still hit dingers.\n\nAnother Japanese name who could end up being worth the investment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: MLB rumors: Best remaining free agents after 2025 winter meetings",

    "fullText": "So, I woke up today. Got my coffee, family went to sleep, and I have a free afternoon.\n\nI thought about writing something. I may delete this article, but if you are reading this, it means I went through with it.\n\nRecently, people have been asking me why I’m pausing Boo to work on a programming language. I think it would actually be cool to write down how I feel.\n\nBoo is a code editor I created solely for myself; I never had the intention of making it a mainstream editor. Of course, it would be fun if people used it, but that was never my goal. This year I got it working in a functional state, where I can actually use it for my daily work. It has innovative human-keyboard navigation and replaces the LSP system with something faster and less costly for the OS. So why on earth am I not open-sourcing it? That’s what people keep asking me.\n\nMy mind isn’t really moved by the idea that it would be a success or a failure — the end user of Boo is me. I don’t feel it’s there yet; in fact, I think software should inspire us. Working on Rio Terminal and Boo in my free time — both written in Rust and sharing many similarities — affects my joy, because it starts to become something automatic. Both have similar architecture, language, release process, and etcetera.\n\nSince I was a kid, I liked to build Lego blocks. That’s probably what I did the most besides playing football or video games. The fun thing about Lego is that one day you can build a castle, and the next day you can build a ship. Not necessarily using the same pieces and colors — you can actually add a lot of stuff that’s external to what you have, like a wood stick.\n\nWhen programming becomes repetitive, the odds of you creating something that makes people go “wow” are reduced quite a bit. It isn’t a rule, of course. You need to be inspired to make inspiring software.\n\nI always use the example of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This game is so well crafted that I know people who don’t even like video games but bought a console just to play it — and once they finished, they sold everything. This is what I’m talking about: taking time to build something so that once people try it, they remember it for as long as they live.\n\nBoo isn’t a business. I don’t need or want to make money out of it. I don’t have a deadline, nor do I want to create another VS Code. I don’t feel like forcing it to happen.\n\nIn that case, I don’t necessarily need to stop building Lego blocks, right? I’ll just park it there, and when the inspiration comes back, I’ll pick it up where it was. That being said, I paused Boo, and I am working on my own programming language. Eventually, my idea is to rewrite Boo to use it.\n\n“Wow! That’s a lot of work.” Indeed. But it’s my hobby stuff. I’ve always loved programming languages, and I am having a blast learning more about binaries and compilers. So, I don’t really feel I need to follow people’s cake recipe for success. That’s how my mind works, and I will stick with it.",

    "description": "AI predictions for 2026 and what they mean for DevOps engineers. From agent orchestration to local AI breakthroughs, here's how to prepare your infrastructure.",
    "fullText": "Posted on Thursday, Dec 11, 2025\n\nThe IDE is dying, and so is tool calling. OpenAI is not going to win. And next year, you’re going to be shipping code that you’ve never reviewed before, even as an experienced engineer.\n\nThese are bold claims, but the way we use AI in 2026 for coding and agents is going to look completely different. In this post, I want to cover my predictions and why they matter right now for DevOps engineers. Some of these are definitely hot takes, but that’s what makes this conversation worth having.\n\nTraditional IDEs where the code is the focus of the interface are simply going to become irrelevant. We’re moving toward agent manager interfaces where we can kick off agents in parallel to work on different features in a codebase or even work on different projects at the exact same time.\n\nWe’re already seeing this transition. Google Antigravity combines a familiar AI-powered coding experience with a new agent-first interface. You can deploy agents that autonomously plan, execute, and verify complex tasks across your editor, terminal, and browser. Cursor 2.0 lets you run up to eight agents in parallel on a single prompt, using git worktrees or remote machines to prevent file conflicts. Each agent operates in its own isolated copy of your codebase.\n\nAWS validated this direction at re:Invent 2025 by announcing “frontier agents” including Kiro for autonomous coding, along with dedicated security and DevOps agents. These agents maintain state, log actions, operate with policy guardrails, and integrate directly with CI/CD pipelines.\n\nFor infrastructure specifically, Pulumi Neo represents this same shift. Instead of writing code or running CLI commands for every operation, you describe what you need in natural language and Neo handles the implementation. It works across your entire infrastructure, understanding dependencies and creating execution plans that go through pull requests for review.\n\nFor DevOps engineers, this means your pipelines need to accommodate AI-generated code at scale. Multiple agents working simultaneously need isolated, reproducible environments. More generated code means more artifacts to track, version, and deploy.\n\nA lot of people think that in the future a single large language model is going to have a monopoly and be the best at absolutely everything. But what’s really going to happen is different providers will specialize and focus on being the best at different things.\n\nGoogle is going down the generalist play with Gemini, aiming to be the jack of all trades. Anthropic is focusing on being the best for coding. You can see this in the benchmarks: when Opus 4.5 came out, the first benchmark they highlighted was for software engineering, because that’s what Anthropic is focusing on.\n\nAmazon is carving out its own niche with the Nova model family, announced at re:Invent 2025. The Nova 2 lineup includes specialized models: Pro for complex reasoning, Sonic for real-time voice conversations, and Omni for simultaneous text, audio, and video processing. With Nova Forge, organizations can build custom frontier models by combining their proprietary data with AWS open weight models. The re:Invent message was clear: leveraging your first-party data is now fundamental to going beyond generic AI. We’re talking about 30-40% increases in accuracy when you bring your own data into the equation.\n\nBut here’s the hot take: I don’t think OpenAI is going to come out on top with any kind of specialization. They’ve disappointed time and time again with GPT-5 and GPT-4.5. With 4.5, they seemed to try to be the creative specialist, but it just didn’t work. The GPT-5 launch in August 2025 was described as “barely better than last month’s flavor of the month” and on some metrics it’s actually worse than earlier models.\n\nFor DevOps teams, this specialization means you’ll need infrastructure that’s model-agnostic and supports multiple AI backends. Plan for secrets management across multiple LLM providers and design your systems to swap models based on the task at hand.\n\n2026 is going to be the year of local AI. We didn’t see that much this year besides DeepSeek at the start of 2025, which was a big deal. We had a couple of new models like Qwen 3, but nothing that fundamentally changed the game. Now we’re starting to see new hardware that makes it obvious we’re going to be able to run very large models on smaller devices.\n\nThere’s new AI chips that can run upwards of 120 billion parameter large language models on the edge, which would be a complete game-changer. Right now, hardware requirements are one of the biggest problems when it comes to scaling local AI. If we can solve the hardware problem, we get 100% data privacy and zero-millisecond latency for our agents.\n\nAWS is addressing this with Trainium3 UltraServers, their 3nm AI chips delivering 4.4x more compute than the previous generation. More significantly, AWS AI Factories allow organizations to deploy racks of Trainium chips and NVIDIA GPUs directly into their own data centers, addressing data sovereignty concerns while keeping AI inference close to the data.\n\nFor DevOps, this opens possibilities for zero-latency inference in CI/CD pipelines, complete data privacy for sensitive codebases, and reduced cloud costs for AI-heavy workloads.\n\nWe’re finally going to get to the point where we’re not the coders. We delegate that entirely to our coding agents and we become the system architects. This mirrors the evolution of other engineering disciplines. Civil engineers don’t fabricate the steel beams; they design the structure and verify the integrity.\n\nI think of this as a three-step process:\n\nWe’re still in the loop. We are the final say in whatever is created, but we’re delegating the grunt work to our coding agents.\n\nThis is exactly the model that Pulumi Neo implements for infrastructure. When you give Neo a complex request, it creates a task plan outlining the steps it will take to accomplish your goal. This plan provides transparency into Neo’s approach and gives you the opportunity to adjust the strategy before execution begins. Neo operates in different modes: Review mode where everything requires approval, Balanced mode where only deployments need sign-off, or Auto mode for full autonomy. You define the boundaries, Neo orchestrates the work, and you validate through pull requests and previews.\n\nFor DevOps engineers, this shift means building robust validation infrastructure becomes critical. When AI writes the code, you need automated testing pipelines, security scanning, and verification systems that can operate at the speed of AI-generated changes.\n\nHere’s a key insight that kept coming up at re:Invent: models are no longer the bottleneck. Context is. Our agents are going to change a lot next year because code execution is starting to replace tool calling. The problem with tool calling right now is that all the capabilities you give an agent take up context upfront. When you try to give a lot of different tools to an agent, you completely overwhelm it.\n\nAnthropic’s research on code execution with MCP addresses exactly this problem. Code execution is a massive token reduction, faster, and more flexible. You’re giving the agent the ability to generate its own capabilities at runtime by writing code to interact with APIs. A workflow that previously consumed about 150,000 tokens when tools were passed directly through the model was reimplemented with code execution and used only about 2,000 tokens. That’s a 98.7% reduction.\n\nAWS embraced this pattern with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, which now includes code interpretation capabilities. AgentCore supports any agent framework (CrewAI, LangGraph, OpenAI SDK) and provides memory, browser tools, and observability features that make code execution practical at enterprise scale.\n\nFor DevOps, this means you need sandboxed, secure execution environments for AI-generated code. Running agent-generated code requires appropriate isolation, resource limits, and monitoring.\n\nThe best part about code execution flexibility is it unlocks progressive disclosure. All I mean by that is: you have a lot of capabilities for an agent, but you don’t actually give all of them upfront. Instead, you allow the agent to discover capabilities and then leverage them in a more flexible way.\n\nFor each capability, you just have a bit of metadata or description that loads upfront. When the agent decides to leverage that capability, then you load the full instructions. Now you can practically scale to infinity because all capabilities don’t have to be loaded at runtime.\n\nClaude Skills is a good example of this pattern. Skills are organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load dynamically. At session start, the agent scans available skills and populates the system prompt with just a brief name and description (around 100 tokens). The full skill prompt loads only after Claude selects it, preventing context bloat while maintaining discoverability.\n\nKiro Powers addresses the same problem. Connecting five MCP servers can consume over 50,000 tokens, roughly 40% of an AI model’s context window, before you even type your first request. Powers bundle MCP servers, steering files, and hooks into units that load dynamically based on conversation context. Mention “payment” and the Stripe power activates. Datadog, Figma, and others have powers available.\n\nFor DevOps, this translates to modular infrastructure definitions, on-demand capability loading, and efficient resource utilization. Think about how you can apply this pattern to your own automation.\n\nAgent-to-agent protocols are where AI agents operate in a peer network, discover each other’s capabilities in real time, and interact autonomously. When Google released their A2A protocol earlier this year, there was a ton of buzz. A lot of people thought it was going to be the next big standard, like the next MCP. But then it kind of fell to the wayside.\n\nThe big reason is the chicken-and-egg problem. In order for A2A to be useful, you need a lot of people to adopt it at the same time. Otherwise, if you build an A2A-compatible agent, it has no other agents to talk to. The whole value proposition is lost unless you already have a big network to attach to.\n\nBut that’s finally changing. The Linux Foundation launched the A2A project in June 2025, and adoption is accelerating. Adobe, Microsoft, SAP, ServiceNow, and S&P Global are all implementing A2A. In July 2025, Google released version 0.3 of the A2A protocol with a more stable interface critical to accelerating enterprise adoption.\n\nMy next big prediction is that machines paying machines is going to become a very big thing. Coinbase released the x402 protocol for exactly this: building AI agents that you expose over the internet but require payment whenever someone else interacts with them.\n\nThis goes really well with agent-to-agent protocols. You can create a peer network where you monetize your agents. They all leverage each other but make payments whenever they take advantage of another agent’s capabilities. Cryptocurrency is the perfect solution for this kind of machine-to-machine network because you need a currency where it’s easy to do micropayments quickly and globally.\n\nThe x402 protocol has achieved 156,000 weekly transactions with 492% growth since launching in May 2025. It’s now integrated with Anthropic’s MCP Protocol, Google Gemini, OpenAI Codex, and other platforms. Stablecoins like USDC make it possible to charge per request, per service, or per second of usage with near-zero transaction costs, enabling payments as low as $0.001 per request.\n\nWhen we want to do a rigorous code review traditionally, we look line by line at all the changes. But coding agents are getting to the point where they can prove their code works through artifacts. Instead of reviewing line by line, we can look at browser recordings, full working demos of a backend API, and other artifacts.\n\nGoogle Antigravity is a perfect example. As part of its coding process, it can autonomously spin up your website, visit it, scroll through it, take screenshots, and record everything. Agents generate artifacts, including tangible deliverables like task lists, implementation plans, screenshots, and browser recordings. You can verify the agent’s logic at a glance.\n\nAmazon Nova Act takes this further. It enables AI agents to automate browser-based tasks like form filling, QA testing, and workflow validation with over 90% reliability. The service includes built-in observability through live viewing, CloudTrail logging, and session replay, making it possible to review what an agent actually did rather than parsing through code changes.\n\nFor the last prediction, we’re tying everything together. We’ve talked about reviewing artifacts instead of diffs, creating systems instead of coding, and the new capabilities for agents with code execution.\n\nWe’re going to get to the point very quickly where we’re shipping code that we have never read before. And I’m not talking about people who vibe code. Even experienced engineers are going to trust their systems so much that they have the ability to review the code but they’re not going to. We’re just going to ship to production after reviewing the artifacts.\n\nI presented on this exact topic at the Tel Aviv Pulumi User Group meetup at Qodo HQ back in October, where I demonstrated how Pulumi Neo’s autonomous decision-making capabilities can handle infrastructure tasks that we traditionally managed manually. Qodo is doing fascinating work in this space with their agentic development tools, building systems that let you trust the output without necessarily reviewing every line.\n\nI’m not saying we’re taking the human completely out of the loop. I’m saying we’re going to have a lot of trust in our systems and a validation process that includes us, but that doesn’t necessarily have to be us actually looking at the code. Tools like Pulumi Neo create pull requests with clear documentation of changes, run previews to validate infrastructure modifications, and provide the transparency needed to ship with confidence.\n\nThe predictions I’ve outlined point to a fundamental shift in how software gets built and deployed. For DevOps engineers, this isn’t a threat but an opportunity to become more strategic and less operational. We’re entering the battle of the agentic frameworks, where the winners will be those who can build faster, cheaper agentic applications through their platforms.\n\nThe immediate reality is that your CI/CD pipelines need to accommodate AI-generated code at scale, your secrets management needs to handle multiple LLM providers, and your execution environments need proper sandboxing for agent-generated code. These aren’t future concerns; they’re requirements for working effectively with the AI tools available today.\n\nLooking further out, the engineers who thrive will be those who embrace the system architect role. Define clear objectives and constraints for your AI agents. Build validation frameworks that can verify outcomes without requiring line-by-line code review. Design infrastructure that’s modular enough to load capabilities on demand.\n\nThe technology to make this happen already exists. Agent orchestration platforms are shipping. Code execution is replacing tool calling. Progressive disclosure patterns are proven. The question isn’t whether these changes are coming; it’s whether you’ll be ready when they arrive.\n\nIf you want to experience what this future looks like right now, Pulumi Neo is the place to start. Neo lets you make natural language requests for routine infrastructure tasks, analysis, and management. Instead of writing code for every operation, you describe what you need and Neo handles the implementation, creating task plans, running previews, and opening pull requests for your review.\n\nWhether you’re looking to update outdated resources across your infrastructure, analyze your cloud spend, or automate complex multi-step workflows, Neo provides the agent-first experience that’s defining the next generation of DevOps tooling.\n\nGet started with Pulumi Neo and see how AI-powered infrastructure automation can transform your workflow.",

    "fullText": "After many years of railing against going on X, I’m finally pulling the band-aid and getting on the platform.\n\nHistorically, if you’ve watched my talks, you’ve heard me say that one of the keys to Applied’s success is focus. And I’ve often demonized social media, specifically X, as wasteful and distracting. It encourages superficiality, showmanship, and the wrong values over real substance.\n\nSome of that is still true. But as the company has grown, the balance has changed. The value of having a microphone now outweighs the downsides. So I’m going to try this. If it works, great. If not, I’ll go back to not being on X.\n\nIt’s become clear to me, and to the people around the company, that my role increasingly involves being a spokesperson. But I don’t really have a good way to talk directly to everybody. X gives me that opportunity.\n\nThere’s also a broader point: almost nobody talks about AI in the real world—where it intersects with cars, trucks, tanks, and fighter jets the way we see it at Applied Intuition. The conversation about self driving should be more than Waymo vs Tesla.\n\nOne of the hallmark trends of our generation is the fall of confidence in institutions. From the 1970s until now, people have lost faith in almost every major institution, from government to corporations. Post–World War II, America trusted places like General Motors or The Wall Street Journal as organizations acting in society’s interest, serving as gatekeepers. The world was different. Information was scarce and slow-moving.\n\nThe internet blew all of that up. As information got to end users faster, the narrative became a bit harder to control. But it wasn’t so much that these institutions were blatantly lying – but institutions, like a business, are just groups of people working together. And within every group there is a complex, sometimes conflicting, set of goals and actions. All this results in the average person getting mixed messages and therefore not trusting the institution. You see this in politics too as being the “establishment” candidate is basically a death sentence now.\n\nThe alternative narrative is fundamentally direct-to-consumer. Just like brands that skip traditional distribution, ideas now bypass institutions entirely. Everyone from Alex Karp to Zohran Mamdani to President Trump operates on this wavelength:\n\nI don’t want to hear from your corporation or your party. I want to hear directly from you.\n\nInstitutional filtering is now an anti-signal. How many corporate X accounts are you following and taking seriously?\n\nThe title of this post is lifted from a Kanye song. It’s been interesting to see people I’ve known closely over the last 15+ years in the valley be lauded, become active on X and then be hated. Not disliked but really hated. Sometimes even I can’t believe what this fairly sane person is posting. But I think that’s less about them and more about the medium. Almost everything has nuance. But nuance is not what X is for. And when you include nuance, you come across as a weasel - trying not to be pinned down. So people go the other way - they hold seemingly very strong views without any wiggle room. Better to be a jerk than a weasel.\n\nAnd into this environment I trek. If you know me, I’m all about nuance. I’m also pragmatic. I’m not about to change how people communicate on X. So what I’m saying is, there will be a time when you think “I miss the old Qasar, not the new Qasar”. I haven’t changed, I’ve just been filtered through a medium. And remember better to be a jerk than a weasel.\n\nOld habits die hard. At YC I would give a lot of advice to founders, so it’s hard not to offer a few thoughts for anyone building a venture-backed silicon valley company.\n\nFirst: it is your responsibility to have a direct conversation with your customers, constituents, potential employees—whoever. Even if it’s personally taxing, it’s a requirement. Thinking back, even my own anti-social-media stance wasn’t as pure as it sounded. I’ve always been active on LinkedIn but this will be different, because, well LinkedIn is LinkedIn.\n\nSecond: keep your identity small. My refusal to join X became part of my identity, which is probably one of the biggest reasons I never joined. Instead of using first principles (e.g. does this accomplish a goal?), I held onto a belief almost religiously. In reality, if I’m spending time repeating the same explanation to customers, prospects, or reporters, instead of saying it once on X, I’m being less efficient. Using first principles, X is simply a more efficient communication tool.\n\nThird: reluctantly, I’ve come to accept that I do have a distinct point of view to share. Historically, I’ve believed no one really has special insights. It all comes down to execution and focus. That belief has served me well. But the world is a battle of ideas, and if you don’t participate, the environment moves around you. And not many people run a $15B+ physical AI company with revenue and free cash flow. And by not many, I think literally zero other people.\n\nAnd more philosophically, as a founder, you are trying to change – some might even say influence – the world. X is one channel for that.\n\nThat’s a long way of saying: I was wrong. And I held onto those wrong beliefs for too long. Give up your old ways, for they might be holding you back from bigger things. Conversely, they might actually have been the reason you’ve been successful.\n\nSo, ceremoniously and for the first time ever, follow me on X @qasar.",

    "fullText": "What started as Guillaume Broche’s personal project has been nominated for 12 Game awards, sold more than 2m copies and been praised by Emmanuel Macron as a ‘shining example of French audacity’\n\nThe record-breaking 12 nominations at the Game awards this year was beyond the wildest dreams of Guillaume Broche when he first began inking out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as a personal project while working at Ubisoft.\n\nBefore selling more than 2m copies, the narrative-driven roleplaying game with “a unique world, challenging combat and great writing” was a technical demo called We Lost. It was Broche’s appetite for risk and a few hopeful Reddit posts that would create the game’s world of Lumiere and its struggle against the Paintress.\n\n“I was doing like eight hours per day after work and not sleeping at all for a few years,” Broche says. And while he would be joined by Tom Guillermin on the programming side and Francoise Meurisse as producer, the next few members of the nascent studio – Lorien Testard, lead composer and Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, lead writer – would only come to Clair Obscur by chance, via social media.\n\nTestard, a guitar teacher at the time who had never composed or published any music commerically, was discovered by Broche on SoundCloud. “We liked the same philosophy in games,” says Testard, who had been writing music inspired by his favourite titles. Similarly, Broche found his art director, Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, through personal works he posted on ArtStation. “We are all deeply engaged in our subject areas,” says Svedberg-Yen, who says that was what bonded the team together. “If you listen to Nicolas talk about art or Lorien talk about music, it’s just something that fills our minds and our days.”\n\nSvedberg-Yen, meanwhile, had come from the world of finance. She saw Broche’s Reddit post and auditioned to not only write but also to voice some of the prototype characters of Clair Obscur, namely Maelle and Lune. Despite a deep love for video games, storytelling and a childhood engrossed in novels, Svedberg-Yen had not considered it as a career option. “It never crossed my mind as possible. As the adage goes, for Asian parents [it’s] doctors, lawyers, or finance.”\n\nWith a rudimentary team assembled under the banner of a new studio, Sandfall Interactive, they rebooted We Lost as Clair Obscur. It was there a world took shape and the gained its unmistakeable Belle Époque setting. “There’s a specificity,” Svedberg-Yens says. “I think that vision gets diluted when you’re trying to appeal to too many people.”\n\n“It’s not meant to be French propaganda,” jokes Broche, about the game’s very Gallic aesthetic. The characters yell putain and merde, there are berets and extremely scary mimes not only because it’s fun, he says, but born from a desire to make something “sincere and authentic”.\n\nSame goes for the story. Clair Obscur’s narrative drives the game forward and, as lead writer, Svedberg-Yen says it all has a “grounding and a basis in truth”.\n\n“We are all first-time writer and game developers in this sense … and so we kind of only know instinctively how write to what instinctively comes from within. And for a lot of the characters in those particular situations, to write them [you] have to really delve into the parts of my life that resonate with the situation that they’re in.”\n\nAccording to Svedberg-Yen, a conversation Broche had with his mother became core to the story’s emotional heft. When he asked her what would be the worst thing that could possibly happen, his mother responded saying it would be to lose her children. “The story deals with a lot of trauma,” she says, and that process of writing like that was often a scary process. “If people don’t like it, they don’t like you.” It was this ability to be vulnerable and open a communicative environment that Broche believes contributed to the success of the game.\n\nDespite an anxiety in the industry about the rise of AI in the development of video games, the team at Sandfall isn’t worried – especially Testard, who composed the game’s orchestral score based off the narrative beats of the game and the eponymous concept of clair obscur (or chiaroscuro), AKA the interplay of light and dark. “Music is the language of the soul,” he says. In fact, the evolution of technology like Unreal Engine 4 and the later 5, which the game runs on today, made a lot of the game possible. “More games will be 3D, because we have a lot of tools now,” says Broche, who describes the budget of his game to be on the “lower end of AA.”\n\nThe team at Sandfall have been overwhelmed by their success. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, lauded the game as “shining example of French audacity”. None of them expected the experience of Clair Obscur to resonate so deeply with so many people. “I’ve gotten a lot of very heartfelt messages from players who have experienced loss in some way and who have felt that the story helped them deal with their grief or change their relationship with grief,” Svedberg-Yen says.\n\n“What’s really cool is I’ve gotten tons of messages from creatives, writers, aspiring writers who felt creatively drained or just felt like they wanted to quit, but then the game inspired them to start again and they started creating their own art again, to start writing.”",

    "fullText": "If you've been taking your daily vitamin D supplement whenever it's convenient—maybe with dinner or right before bed—you might want to rethink your routine. It turns out timing matters more than most of us realize. Even more surprising? Taking it at the wrong time of day might be affecting your sleep. We asked doctors to reveal the best time to take vitamin D and exactly how to maximize its powerful benefits for your bones, heart and immune system.\n\nYou know you need a whole list of nutrients to stay healthy, but do you know what vitamin D helps with in particular? “Vitamin D is a prehormone that the body converts into an active hormone,” says Lamees Hamdan, MD, an integrative medical doctor. “So vitamin D has a dual role, both as a nutrient and as a hormone. Your body can produce vitamin D when [your skin is] exposed to sunlight or obtain it from certain foods and supplements. Vitamin D has many functions, such as calcium regulation, supporting immune function, mood regulation and overall cellular health.”\n\nHere, some of the biggest health benefits of vitamin D, especially for older adults:\n\n“[Vitamin D] enhances calcium absorption and reduces the risk of fractures and osteoporosis,” says Dr. Hamdan. (Discover more ways to improve bone density and ward off osteoporosis.)\n\nStudies suggest this key nutrient also supports heart health by helping regulate inflammation. “Optimizing vitamin D intake is associated with improvements in HDL [good] cholesterol and blood pressure,” says Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, author of From Fatigued to Fantastic. “Research suggests that optimizing vitamin D levels could prevent 56,000 excess heart disease deaths yearly while also decreasing stroke risk.”\n\nDr. Teitelbaum and Dr. Hamdan both say vitamin D decreases infection risk. Dr. Teitelbaum adds that it lowers the risk of autoimmune illness and disease as well. Because vitamin D plays such a critical role in our overall health, not getting enough can be harmful.\n\n“Vitamin D deficiency contributes to excess inflammation, autoimmune disease and difficulty fighting cancers and infections,” says Dr. Teitelbaum. “Vitamin D deficiency also contributes to chronic pain, [which is] another reason why we are seeing a pain epidemic, as well as weak bones.”\n\nThe encouraging news? Optimizing your levels—whether through supplements, sunlight or vitamin D-fortified foods such as cereal and orange juice—is simple.\n\nNow that you understand why vitamin D is so important, let's talk about how to make sure you're getting the most from it, starting with the best time to take it.\n\n“Put simply, it is best to take vitamin D in the morning or early afternoon, because this is the time, historically, that we would be getting it from sunshine,” says Dr. Teitelbaum. “Taken too late in the day, it may disrupt melatonin production and make it harder to fall asleep.”\n\nSince vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, Dr. Teitelbaum recommends taking it with food to help your body absorb it. He suggests aiming for 9 to 11 grams of fat with your meal, which he says could look like an egg with a glass of whole milk. It’s a simple pairing that fits naturally into breakfast.\n\nDr. Teitelbaum adds that vitamin D works best alongside other nutrients, so taking it as part of a multivitamin can be helpful. He suggests choosing one that includes zinc, magnesium, boron and vitamins A, B, C and K.\n\nDr. Teitelbaum considers 1,000 IU per day to be the “sweet spot” vitamin D supplement amount for most people. He adds that vitamin D toxicity is considered uncommon at amounts below 25,000 IU per day, unless someone has elevated blood calcium due to certain medical or hormonal conditions. Still, since needs can vary from person to person, checking with your doctor can help you determine the supplement level that’s best for you.\n\nFortunately, supporting your bone health, heart health and immune system doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. A simple morning routine—vitamin D with breakfast—gives your body exactly what it needs to stay strong, energized and resilient.\n\nKeep scrolling for more health stories!\n\nThe 5 Vitamins Doctors Swear By to Help You Live Longer and Feel Amazing at Any Age\n\n3 Natural Supplements for Dizziness That Finally Help Women Feel Steady Again\n\nHot Flashes Left Her Miserable and Exhausted—Until Vitamin E Changed Her Life\n\nThis content is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.

    "fullText": "Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday zeroed in on a bizarre moment in President Donald Trump’s Pennsylvania speech, summing it up with quite the zinger. (Watch the video below.)\n\nThe talk show host played a clip of Trump detouring into a shoutout for his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, whom he jokingly called Susie Trump.\n\n“Do you know Susie Trump? Sometimes referred to as Susie Wiles,” the president said at his rally on Tuesday. “She’s the great chief of staff. They don’t use the word chief of staff anymore because the Indians got extremely upset. But now the Indians actually want their name used, which is true. They never didn’t want it used.”\n\nBuzz: Sharon Osbourne Shares Ozzy's Last Words And, Gosh, It Just Got Dusty In Here\n\n“No, I think by Indians he meant ‘Native Americans,’” Kimmel began. “And another interesting fact: He made all of that up. None of that was true. So thank you, Sitting ********.”\n\nKimmel, arguably Trump’s biggest talk show nemesis, got big laughs.\n\nBut the president’s all-over-the-place tirade, in which he peddled hate about immigrants from “filthy” countries and regurgitated a baseless claim about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and her U.S. citizenship, was seriously racist.\n\nFast-forward to 4:25 for Kimmel’s on-brand nicknaming of Trump:\n\nJimmy Kimmel Roasts Trump With All The Reasons He's Actually An Infant\n\nKimmel Takes Trump’s ‘Talent’ Jab And Turns It Brutally Back Around: 'I Mean, The Man Can...'\n\nMiley Cyrus Tells Jimmy Kimmel Her Most Gag-Worthy Aversion — Then Realizes It's Sitting On His Desk",

    "description": "Here’s how you can adapt your retirement playbook.",
    "fullText": "If you’re one of the few American workers with a traditional pension, your retirement strategy likely looks different from that of your peers.\n\nAs of March, 2025, only 14% of U.S. workers were covered by a defined benefit pension plan, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (1) These plans are far more common among government employees and retirees.\n\nIn fact, nearly 86% of state and local public sector workers have access to such a pension, according to Congress. (2) And in 2024, 56% of retirees reported receiving pension income, according to the Federal Reserve. (3)\n\nDepending on your age and your employer, a defined benefit pension could significantly shape your retirement outlook. The guaranteed monthly income offers stability, but it brings unique considerations for tax strategy and estate planning.\n\nHere’s how you can adapt your retirement playbook.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nUnlike withdrawals from a 401(k) or IRA, pension income is typically fixed and can’t be adjusted. According to the IRS, each pension payment is treated as ordinary taxable income — potentially increasing your tax liability and affecting how much of your Social Security benefits are taxed.\n\nBecause pension income counts toward your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), it can also push you over the threshold for Medicare’s income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) surcharges, resulting in higher premiums.\n\nDepending on where you live, state taxes may apply as well. Only 15 states fully exempt pension income from state taxation, according to the AARP. (4) Review your state’s tax code to see if any exemptions or deductions could reduce your tax burden.\n\nMany employer-sponsored pension plans offer a choice between a one-time lump sum payment or lifetime monthly payments (an annuity). Deciding between the two can be complex.\n\nThe annuity option provides a guaranteed monthly income, offering long-term financial stability. Most private-sector pensions are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which protects payments up to certain limits if the employer becomes insolvent.",

    "fullText": "Another long-standing Mexican restaurant chain has closed nearly all of its locations, bringing to a halt years of family dinners, weekly happy hours, and a loyal customer base. Due to an unexpected event, a more severe crisis has now affected the business: the sudden loss of many employees.\n\nMexican restaurants across the U.S. have been struggling with rising labor and food costs fueled by inflation, higher interest rates on their debt obligations, and more cautious consumer spending. This beloved Arizona chain was no exception.\n\nFounded in 2008 by two brothers as a single restaurant in Tucson, the Mexican restaurant chain is known for its authentic Sonoran- and Tampico-style Mexican cuisine, with a focus on seafood dishes. It has also become a popular hangout spot due to its wide range of Michelada drinks and fun cocktails.\n\nHowever, after 17 years of building a strong community across Arizona and Mexico, its future is now uncertain, not only because of the economic challenges facing the broader industry, but also due to far more serious legal issues.\n\nTaco Giro has confirmed that seven of its restaurants will remain closed until further notice. The sudden closures follow multiple ICE raids across various locations, in which 46 kitchen workers, making up 10% of its staff, were arrested on December 5, as reported by KGUN9.\n\nAfter the raids occurred, Taco Giro closed all nine of its Arizona restaurants while keeping its Mexico location open, all of which are still listed on its website. The chain also took to its social media platforms, posting updates in both English and Spanish to notify customers of the shutdowns.\n\n\"Our restaurant will be temporarily closed while we take a short pause to make a few necessary adjustments so we can continue offering the warm service and unique flavors you love,\" wrote Taco Giro in a social media post. \"We'll be ready to welcome you back very soon with the same love, passion, and flavors that always make you feel at home.\"\n\nSince then, Taco Giro has slowly reopened its locations, with three currently operating. The chain has also revealed that it may close two additional underperforming restaurants, which were already part of its plans before the raids.\n\nBelow are all the current statuses of Taco Giro location, according to Google Maps as of December 10.\n\n8320 N.

    "description": ", Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s repeated mockery of the word “affordability” is worrying Republican strategists, who say the fixation",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s repeated mockery of the word “affordability” is worrying Republican strategists, who say the fixation risks undercutting White House efforts to reassure Americans about the cost of living - a top voter concern heading into next year’s congressional elections.\n\nThose fears were ​underscored during Trump's speech to supporters in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night. The White House billed the speech as the first in a series by the president to address ‌criticism that he is not paying sufficient attention to voters who say they are struggling with high prices.\n\nInstead, the 90-minute speech veered into attacks on the word \"affordability,\" which Trump derided as a \"hoax\" by Democrats to exaggerate the cost ‌of living. While he did acknowledge that prices were high, he insisted the economy was booming and people were taking home more pay.\n\nBut Republican strategists told Reuters the president should stop fixating on the term \"affordability\" and instead focus on presenting a clear plan to lower prices.\n\n“Repeating this claim that affordability is made up ignores what’s happening in our economy,” said Jason Cabel Roe, a Republican consultant. “He absolutely needs to do better.”\n\nGovernment data shows that job growth has slowed during Trump’s second term, unemployment has risen to its highest level in four years and consumer prices remain high. Overall, the economy’s ⁠growth has rebounded somewhat after the economy contracted slightly in the ‌first quarter of the year.\n\nWHITE HOUSE DEFENDS TRUMP ON AFFORDABILITY\n\nA person who speaks regularly with Trump's top aides, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk more freely about messaging, said some of those aides conceded that the president needs to talk more about the domestic economy, ‍especially ahead of the midterm elections next November, with Republicans' control of both houses of Congress at stake.\n\nTwo White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied that Trump's dismissive comments about affordability made him appear out of touch with the struggles of ordinary Americans, although they acknowledged that was a complaint from some Republican lawmakers.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai defended Trump’s focus on the economy, calling the rally “a reminder for ​everyday Americans that the Trump administration continues to prioritize affordability.\"\n\nTrump's approval rating edged up to 41% in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll as he rolled back some tariffs on food imports ‌and spoke more about combating inflation. But the approval rating on his performance on the cost of living was just 31%.\n\nOfficials have said Trump will hit the road in the new year to campaign for Republican candidates and emphasize his economic policy successes. Trump says his tax cuts and tariffs on foreign goods will put more money in the pockets of American families.\n\nSpeaking to reporters and technology executives at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said Democrats keep talking about affordability, but \"they never discuss it. They just say the election's about affordability. Well, it may very well be, I think it's also still about the border.\"\n\nDemocratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro posted on social media that Trump spent his speech \"telling Pennsylvanians not to believe what they can see ⁠with their own two eyes - the skyrocketing cost of living and rising prices at the grocery store.\"\n\nOpinion ​polls show cost of living is voters’ top concern and was seen as contributing to a series of recent ​Democratic electoral victories.\n\nINDEPENDENT, MODERATE VOTERS WILL BE DECISIVE\n\nTrump told the rally, “I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,” while blaming his predecessor, Democratic former President Joe Biden, for high prices.\n\nThat is an important message to send to voters, said John Feehery, a longtime Republican operative, but tone matters.\n\n“It’s very ‍difficult to tell people they’re fine when they’re ⁠not feeling fine,” said Feehery.\n\nCharlie Gerow, a Pennsylvania-based Republican strategist, said Trump’s remarks on Tuesday likely sounded “hollow” to moderates and independents, an influential voting bloc that Trump will need to win over if his party is to keep control of Congress.\n\nRepublicans currently have narrow majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n\n“He needs ⁠to stay laser-focused on the economy,” Gerow said. Meandering into topics like transgender rights and wind turbines, as he did on Tuesday, “doesn’t help,” he added.\n\nTrump has a crucial role to play next year as the party's chief economic ‌messenger, said Representative Richard Hudson, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\n\"He's the most effective messenger we have,\" Hudson told Reuters.",

    "description": "A warehouse worker consumed 8 energy drinks a day to \"stay alert\" at work, which led to a dangerous health condition",
    "fullText": "A “fit and well” man was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke caused by blood pressure that was “sky high”\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to rise again, and upon a follow-up visit, he shared with his doctors that he consumes 8 energy drinks a day\n\nThe man was drinking more than 3 times the recommended amount of caffeine\n\nA “fit and well” man’s habit of downing 8 energy drinks a day caused him to have a stroke — and he’s left with lingering damage.\n\nA 54-year-old warehouse worker arrived to the emergency room with numbness, weakness on his left side, and ataxia (trouble with balance and movement), according to a case report in BMJ Journals. He was “normally fit and well,” the report says —  except for his blood pressure.\n\n“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’d never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom, and senior author of the report, told CNN.\n\nNormal blood pressure for a man his age is less than 120 over less than 80, per the American Heart Association. His numbers are classified as a “hypertensive emergency.”\n\nThe blood pressure had caused “a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi told the outlet. The man, a warehouse worker from the Sherwood district of the English city of Nottingham, was admitted and treated with five different medications to make his blood pressure drop.\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to increase again, leaving doctors baffled — until, as Munshi shares, he told doctors about his energy drink habit.\n\n“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi told CNN. “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says that up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day “seems safe” for most adults; the patient was drinking more than three times that amount.\n\nToo much caffeine can increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, according to a study from the American College of Cardiology.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHe stopped drinking the energy drinks (the specific brand was not identified in the study), and his blood pressure returned to normal. But the lingering impact of his stroke and energy drink habit remain, he told his doctors, per CNN.\n\n“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” he said, explaining he’s “been left with numbness [in my] left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”\n\nAs Munshi explained, there are other ingredients in energy drinks that can contribute to health problems. “Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”",

    "fullText": "Before T-Mobile launched its \"Un-carrier\" initiative back in 2013, everything about the smartphone, then the cellphone, industry put the service providers interests over those of their customers.\n\nAT&T and Verizon dominated the market, and they locked customers into hard-to-break contracts and made it nearly impossible to take your number with you if you actually left. They collected billions in overage charges and extra money from people who paid for plans that had more than they needed just to avoid those charges.\n\nT-Mobile, which was then led by maverick CEO John Legere, put an end to all that with its series of Un-carrier moves.\n\nNow, while it's not using the \"Un-carrier\" branding, new T-Mobile CEO Srinivasan Gopalan has shared how it's fixing something that's still a major, likely even the largest, pain point for wireless customers.\n\nUn‑carrier 1.0: No more annual contracts, device‑subsidy model\n In March 2013, T-Mobile eliminated mandatory service contracts and separated device payments from service plans, allowing customers to pay for phones monthly rather than via large up‑front subsidies, according to a press release.\n\nUn‑carrier 2.0: JUMP! (Upgrade flexibility)\n Launched July 2013, this allowed customers to upgrade their phone more frequently than traditional two‑year cycles, Marketing Scoop reported.\n\nSimple Global/ International roaming perks (Un‑carrier 3.0)\n Around October 2013, T‑Mobile began offering international roaming with favorable terms (e.g. data roaming abroad) to reduce roaming charges for travelers, T-Mobile shared on its website.\n\nUn‑carrier 4.0: “Carrier Freedom”/ETF buy‑out for switching customers\n Introduced in January 2014, T‑Mobile offered to pay off early‑termination fees (ETFs) or outstanding device payments for customers who switched from other carriers l,owering a major switching barrier, Apple Insider reported.\n\n“Data Stash:” Rollover of unused data\n Launched December 2014: users could roll over unused high-speed data from month to month, instead of losing it, a break from “use it or lose it” plans, T-Mobile shared in a press release.\n\n“Binge On”/Data‑friendly streaming and “Music Freedom”\n T-Mobile removed data‑usage penalties for certain music and video streaming services, letting customers stream without using their high-speed data allotment, the company shared.\n\nT-Mobile Tuesdays: Customer loyalty/rewards program\n Introduced as part of later Un‑carrier moves: a weekly rewards/benefits program for customers, T-Mobile shared on its website.\n\n“Un‑carrier for Business:” Simplified pricing and service for business customers\n Announced in March 2015: Simplified, transparent business wireless plans and support, according to a T-Mobile press release.\n\n5G‑era “New T‑Mobile” moves (post‑Sprint merger)\n As part of its 5G build‑out and network expansion, T‑Mobile introduced new initiatives under “Un‑carrier/New T‑Mobile,” aimed at leveraging improved network capacity for broader, more powerful services, according to a T-Mobile annual report.\n\nT-Mobile's latest Un-carrier effort is called \"15 Minutes to Better\" or \"Easy Switch.\"\n\nThe idea is to simplify the process of switching from another carrier to T-Mobile.\n\nGopalan spoke about it during the Dec. 9 UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.\n\nFirst, the new CEO made it clear that he thinks making it easy to switch is important because consumers now have a better opinion of T-Mobile's network.\n\n\"There are at least 70 million Verizon and AT&T customers who chose Verizon and AT&T because they thought they had the best network. That was true way back in the 4G era. That's changed now. And these customers are paying a premium because they thought they were on the best network. That's no longer true. Huge opportunity there,\" he said at the event.\n\nMany of those customers, he noted, want to make the move.\n\n\"As we talked in our earnings call, our perception amongst network seekers is now at an all-time high, and that's driving some real momentum into the business, and our latest move, 'Easy to Switch' or '15 Minutes to Better' is part of kind of taking away that inertia amongst network seekers and bringing them to us,\" he added.\n\nThe CEO believes that T-Mobile is pulling the industry forward.\n\n\"I mean, this industry in many ways, operates like it's in 2002, right? For most things, whether you're an existing customer or a new customer, you've got to go into a store, you've got to call someone. We fundamentally believe that has to change,\" he said.\n\nCostco CFO makes rare pricing promise\n\nHome Depot faces growing consumer boycott calls ahead of holidays\n\nTarget’s efforts to make amends with customers hit a snag\n\nAmazon lawsuit could be a warning to other employers\n\n\"Easy to Switch\" or \"15 Minutes to Better\" is making that happen.\n\n\"You saw our launch of 15 Minutes to Better, which really uses some of the best tech to start smashing one of the biggest pain points customers have, which is the process of switching,\" he added.\n\nSwitch carriers in ~15 minutes, T‑Mobile claims the full process of porting a number and signing up can be completed in about 15 minutes per line via the T‑Life app.(T-Mobile)\n\nAI‑powered plan matching: The Easy Switch tool runs inside the T‑Life app. Users log in with their current AT&T or Verizon credentials, and the tool analyzes their lines/devices/usage to recommend the optimal T‑Mobile plan, according to Yahoo Tech.\n\nOption to keep current phone or get new phone later: Instead of being forced to pick a new device during the switch, customers may port their number now and wait up to 90 days to choose a phone deal, T-Mobile shared.\n\nSame‑day device delivery (in select areas): For those who do choose a new device at sign-up, T‑Mobile offers same-day delivery via DoorDash in certain major U.S. cities, according to Nasdaq.\n\nPromotional deals & potential savings: As part of the switch campaign, T‑Mobile advertises savings vs. competitors, bundle offers, and offers on new devices (sometimes even free or highly discounted phones, per plan terms). T-Mobile shared in a press release\n\nSimplify a historically painful process: “Switching wireless providers is a hassle,” often involving paperwork, store visits, device logistica. T‑Mobile argues its new system makes the process modern, seamless, and fast, according to Yahoo Tech.\n\nRemove barriers to switching for AT&T/Verizon users: By offering a smooth, quick process plus perks, T‑Mobile makes it easier for customers to consider switching from competitors, reported WhistleOut.\n\n“The process of moving three, four or five people from one service to another can be pretty complicated,” Techsponential President Avi Greengart told Fierce Mobile.\n\nChetan Sharma, founder of Chetan Sharma Consulting, Told Fierce Mobile that the porting process itself is relatively easy, but “you still have to go through the manual process of getting the code, inserting the code and sometimes it does require you to go to the store or be on a call,” he said.\n\n“It’s still the back-end systems that are waiting for data to be fed for them to crank out the whole porting process,” he said. “I think they've probably automated all of that functionality in the back end. That's how they're able to do it in 15 minutes.\"\n\nVerizon has taken issue with T-Mobile's latest initiative.\n\n\"Faster isn't better, according to Verizon, which criticizes T-Mobile's '15 Minutes to Better' switching feature. In a new blog post, Verizon argues that T-Mobile's switching process has many pitfalls, which it is careful to avoid,\" Phone Arena reported.\n\nVerizon has accused T-Mobile of undermining the switching experience in its pursuit of speed.\n\n\"The carrier says T-Mobile's entire automatic switching process is flawed, from allowing T-Life to log into the account a customer has with a rival company up to letting AI decide which plan would best suit a switcher,\" according to Phone Arena.\n\nAT&T has sued T-Mobile for unauthorized access to customer data using T-Life's Switching Made Easy (SME) tool. AT&T wants T-Mobile to stop accessing its systems and pay monetary damages, according to another Phone Arena story.\n\nA T-Mobile spokesperson denied those charges.\n\n\"AT&T’s claims are wrong on the facts and the law. Easy Switch simply and safely empowers consumers to seamlessly access and share their own information so that they can make an informed choice about their wireless provider and plan. We remain committed to transparency, simplicity, and ensuring consumers have the freedom to choose, and we will continue to vigorously oppose AT&T's efforts to hamper consumer choice,\" according to the statement shared with Phone Arena.",

    "fullText": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Rain fell for the first time in months in Iran's capital Wednesday, providing a brief respite for the parched Islamic Republic as it suffers through the driest autumn in over a half century.\n\nThe drought gripping Iran has seen its president warn the country it may need to move its government out of Tehran by the end of December if there's not significant rainfall to recharge dams around the capital. Meteorologists have described this fall as the driest in over 50 years across the country — from even before its 1979 Islamic Revolution — further straining a system that expends vast amounts of water inefficiently on agriculture.\n\nThe water crisis has even become a political issue in the country, particularly as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly offered his country's help to Iran, a nation he launched a 12-day war against in June. Water shortages also have sparked localized protests in the past, something Iran has been trying to avoid as its economy struggles under the weight of international sanctions over its nuclear program.\n\n“I am very grateful to my Lord, who opened the door of His mercy upon us, allowing us to witness this blessed, abundant rain,\" said Brian Shad Doust, a Tehran resident. \"Last year, we really suffered from severe water shortages — it was extremely dry, we practically had no water at all. Seeing the rain for the first time this season, we thank God a thousand times.”\n\nDrying reservoirs, light snowpack challenge Iran\n\nThe drought has been a long subject of conversation across Tehran and wider Iran, from government officials openly discussing it with visiting journalists to people purchasing water tanks for their homes. In the capital, government-sponsored billboards call on the public not to use garden hoses outside to avoid waste. Water service reportedly goes out for hours in some neighborhoods of Tehran, home to 10 million people.\n\nSnowpack on the surrounding Alborz Mountains remains low as well, particularly after a summer that saw temperatures rise near 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas of the country, forcing government buildings to shut down.\n\nAhad Vazifeh, an official in the government's Iran Meteorological Organization office, called the drought “unprecedented” in an interview with the Fararu news outlet last week. Precipitation now stands at about 5% of what's considered a normal autumn, he added.\n\n“Even if rain in the winter and spring will be normal, we will have 20% shortage,” Vazifeh warned.\n\nSocial media videos show people standing in some reservoirs, the water lines clearly visible. Satellite pictures analyzed by The Associated Press also show reservoirs noticeably depleted. That includes the Latyan Dam — one of five key reservoirs — which is now under 10% full as Tehran has entered its sixth consecutive year of drought.\n\nThe state-owned Tehran Times newspaper, often following the theocracy's line, was blunt about the scale of the challenge.\n\n“Iran is facing an unprecedented water crisis that threatens not only its agricultural sector but also regional stability and global food markets,\" the newspaper said in a story this past weekend. The faithful have also offered prayers for rain at the country's mosques.\n\nLong-arid Iran faces challenge of climate change\n\nIran, straddling the Mideast and Asia, long has been arid due to its geography. Its Alborz and Zagros mountain ranges cause a so-called “rain shadow” across much of the nation, blocking moisture coming from the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf.\n\nBut the drain on water supplies has been self-inflicted. Agriculture uses an estimated 90% of the country's water supplies. That hasn't been stopped even through these recent drought years. That's in part due to policies stemming from Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and then-Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who pledged water would be free for all. The intervening years of the Iran-Iraq war saw the country push for self-sufficiency above all else, irrigating arid lands to grow water-intensive crops like wheat and rice, and over-drilling wells.\n\nExperts have described Iran as facing “water bankruptcy” over its decisions. In the past, Iranian officials have blamed their neighbors in part for their water shortage, with hard-line former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at one point falsely suggesting that “the enemy destroys the clouds that are headed toward our country and this is a war Iran will win.”\n\nBut that's changed with the severity of the crisis leading to current President Masoud Pezeshkian warning the capital may need to be moved. However, such a decision would cost billions of dollars the country likely doesn't have as it struggles through a major economic crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, climate change likely has accelerated the droughts plaguing Iraq, which has seen the driest year on record since 1933, as well as Syria and Iran, said World Weather Attribution, a group of international scientists who study global warming’s role in extreme weather.\n\nWith the climate warmed by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) due to fossil fuel burning, the severity of drought seen in Iran over the last year can be expected to return every 10 years, the group said. If the temperature hadn't risen by that much, it could be expected between every 50 to 100 years, it added.\n\n“The current acute crisis is part of a longer-term water crisis in Iran and the wider region that results from a range of issues including frequent droughts with increasing evaporation rates, water-intensive agriculture and unsustainable groundwater extraction,” World Weather Attribution said in a recent report.\n\n\"These combined pressures contribute to chronic water stress in major urban centers including Tehran, reportedly at risk of severe water shortages and emergency rationing, while also straining agricultural productivity and heightening competition over scarce resources.\"\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.",

    "description": "The New York Times said it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest attack on the outlet for reporting on his age.",
    "fullText": "The New York Times said on Wednesday that it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest claim that the outlet’s reporting on his age was an attempt to “libel and demean” him.\n\nThe paper said its audience deserved “in-depth reporting and regular updates about the health of the leaders they elect.” The statement came in response to Trump’s Tuesday attack against the paper, apparently over a November article focused on his declining energy, which argued the Times should “cease publication because they are a horrible, biased, and untruthful ‘source’ of information.”\n\n“Mr. Trump welcomed our reporting on the age and fitness of his predecessors; we’re applying the same journalistic scrutiny to his vitality,” spokesperson Nicole Taylor wrote in a statement. “Our reporting is heavily sourced, based on interviews with people clsoe to the president and with medical experts. We won’t be deterred by false and inflammatory language that distorts the role of a free press.”\n\nStill, such an approach to news coverage didn’t seem to resonate with Trump, who claimed again that his cognitive test results were something few people, “including those working at The New York Times,” could do very well.\n\n“Despite all of this, the time and work involved, The New York Times, and some others, like to pretend that I am ‘slowing up,’ am maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health, knowing that it is not true, and knowing that I work very hard, probably harder than I have ever worked before,” Trump wrote. “I will know when I am ‘slowing up,’ but it’s not now! After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean  ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.’ They are true Enemies of the People, and we should do something about it.”\n\nThe Times’ Katie Rogers and Dylan Freedman reported last month that Trump has started his events later in recent months and his public appearances had decreased. They wrote that, while “Trump and the people around him still talk about him as if he is the Energizer Bunny of presidential politics,” “the reality is more complicated.”\n\nTrump lashed out at the paper hours after the story published, calling Rogers “ugly, both inside and out” for writing the story and claimed then that the paper was an “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.”\n\nThe post New York Times Blasts Trump’s ‘False and Inflammatory’ Claim That Reporting on His Health Could Be Libelous appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "title": "Archaeologists Opened an Ancient Tomb—and Found a Story of Royal Tragedy",
    "description": "A crown was left with the deceased, but its position indicated her reign may not have ended the way she would have liked.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA seventh-century B.C.E. burial found in Greece featured an obviously wealthy noblewoman.\n\nThe relatively young woman was buried with an upside-down crown, likely symbolizing the fall of her reign.\n\nIn a nearby tomb, archaeologists found a 4-year-old girl buried in much the same manner, indicating a possible link between the two.\n\nThere’s no telling who the noblewoman recently found buried during the second half of the seventh century B.C.E. was at the time of her death, so for now, she’s known as “The Lady with the Inverted Diadem.”\n\nAccording to a translated statement from the Greek Ministry of Culture, a team of archaeologists found a cemetery in east-central Greece, about 60 miles northwest of Athens, full of tombs dated from about 800 to 320 B.C.E., during the Archaic and Classical periods. The cemetery was developed in clusters with pit tombs, burial mounds, and tiled tombs.\n\nSo far, the team has excavated roughly 40 of the burial sites, many showcasing the elite status of those buried there. Still, none was more impressive—or intriguing—than “The Lady with the Inverted Diadem.”\n\nThe deceased was found within a cluster of three pit tombs, and the bronze grave goods filling the tomb made clear that its occupant was a noblewoman. A preliminary examination of dental remains showed she was an adult woman between 20 and 30 years old. The striking part of the find, though, was a bronze-banded diadem (or crown) ceremoniously placed on her head upside down as a symbol of her superiority or rank. The crown featured a large rosette in the form of a sun in the center of the front and facing pairs of male and female lions on the back. The high craftsmanship needed to create the animals was evident, the archaeologists said. While lions symbolized royal power and authority, when the crown was flipped upside down, the lions were seen lying down.\n\nThat superiority of rank and high class may not have lasted beyond the death of the noblewoman. During that time, a crown worn upside down symbolized the resignation or fall of the monarch and marked the loss of power and office.\n\nThe ministry said that the mid-seventh century B.C.E. marked a particularly tumultuous time for any monarchs in Greece, as the traditional hereditary kingdom regimes and the rise of nobles had started to give way to aristocratic regimes and the movement to Athenian democracy by the early sixth century B.C.E. It’s in that context that the upside-down crown may indicate that the deceased noblewoman was caught up in the changing times.\n\nWhile she may have lost her standing, she likely didn’t lose her wealth. The grave goods buried with the young woman featured plenty of bronze items, including two oversized pins with engraved geometric-style horses, a necklace with a pendant, bone and ivory beads, amber tokens, and bronze earrings. She was buried wearing bracelets and rings.\n\nIn the same cluster of tombs, the team found a young girl, likely around 4 years old, crowned with a similar bronze diadem with inlaid rosettes. The girl had comparable jewelry to the noblewoman, indicating the possible existence of a family bond between them.\n\nOther tomb finds in the area have included a female form the mid-sixth century B.C.E. buried with a shallow bowl with a rooster depiction on it, a wine vessel decorated with mythical creatures and the god Hermes, a copper bottle, and vessels associated with the Akraifia Pottery Workshop. The team plans to continue researching the area.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "\"It was a very cool thing.\"",
    "fullText": "A drone operator in Missouri monitoring deer got a surprise when a seldom-seen large predator skulked into view.\n\nThe Columbia Daily Tribune reported that a mountain lion was spotted during an aerial survey of the deer population in Saline County.\n\nJack Huston of Midwest Deer Surveys posted the footage to social media. He told the tribune that the drone thermal imaging picked up the mountain lion near a herd of deer. \"It had my heart racing. I didn't know if it was going to kill a deer. It's a crazy thing. It's a real predator that can do some damage. It was a very cool thing,\" Huston said.\n\nMountain lions seldom show up in the Show-Me state; there have only been 121 sightings in the last 30 years, but they are increasing. Part of that is due to the large cat's elusive nature, but it's also due to extensive habitat destruction and human encroachment. Mountain lions, also known as cougars, panthers, and pumas, were once widespread across the continental United States but are now primarily found in Western states.\n\nThey perform a key ecological role in controlling prey populations and indirectly sustaining many other species. However, their presence in an unfamiliar locale can cause some anxiety. The odds of being attacked by a mountain lion are exceptionally low, but mountain lion attacks do occur.\n\nAnother potential source of conflict is if these highly versatile hunters go for livestock. Because they are so rare and the Missouri Department of Conservation has no plans to reintroduce them, there's a general lack of knowledge among residents about what to do.\n\nUltimately, it's a matter of raising awareness and dispelling any harmful misinformation about the animals.\n\nThey will generally go out of their way to avoid people. In the rare case that you do encounter one, officials advise keeping your distance and being wary of pets and young children, who are at much greater risk. If a mountain lion keeps moving toward you, stay big, get loud, and never turn your back on it.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Police in Michigan have issued a statement providing some details about why former University of Michigan Head Coach Sherrone Moore was taken into custody on December 10. However, even as Moore's career imploded and he, at least temporarily, lost his freedom, he still stands to potentially earn millions.\n\nWhat was Moore's salary? \"Moore's buyout was listed at $13.89 million. That number is the second-lowest among all listed coaches from the Big Ten,\" CBS News reported. According to USA Today, his total salary was $6.11 million, making him the 40th top-paid college football coach.\n\nIt was a whirlwind of developments, as the university announced it had fired Moore. Then, ESPN reported that he detained by police, a fact that was documented by jail records showing Moore, 39, confined to a Michigan jail. Now, police have finally provided some details about what is going on. Moore was ousted after \"credible evidence\" emerged that he \"engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,\" the university said, according to USA Today.\n\nBecause of the manner in which Moore was ousted (right before he was detained), it's not clear whether he will get the full buyout amount, according to CBS News.\n\n\"Michigan could be off the hook for some (or all) of his buyout, though cases like this have ended in court battles in the past,\" the network wrote.\n\nThe ex-coach stood to make a lot more money if he wasn't fired. \"Moore's contract at Michigan was set to pay $5.5 million in base salary and additional compensation annually through the 2029 season -- with a $500,000 retention bonus each season,\" wrote CBS News.\n\nTwo police departments were involved in taking Moore into custody, both Saline and Pittsfield Township, both in Michigan.\n\nAccording to ESPN, police \"responded at 4:10 p.m. to the 3000 block of Ann Arbor Saline Road.\" What happened? It was \"for the purposes of investigating an alleged assault. ... A suspect in this case was taken into custody. This incident does not appear to be random in nature, and there appears to be no ongoing threat to the community,\" added ESPN.\n\nSaline police had previously told ESPN that they \"assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore. Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.\"\n\nMoore is married with three kids. He has been the head coach of the University of Michigan since 2022.\n\n\"The suspect was lodged at the Washtenaw County Jail pending review of charges by the Washtenaw County Prosecutor,\" the statement continued, according to ESPN. \"At this time, the investigation is ongoing. Given the nature of the allegations, the need to maintain the integrity of the investigation, and its current status at this time, we are prohibited from releasing additional details.\"\n\n\"Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement. \"Following a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and UM maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\"",

    "fullText": "The high seas are increasingly dangerous territory for autocratic petrostates. On Wednesday, US military and law enforcement agents seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast. The ship had reportedly spent at least the past two years ferrying sanctioned crude from Iran and Venezuela, and using transponder tricks to obscure its location.\n\nNabbing the ship marks a drastic escalation in US President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign against Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, one that will be especially painful for Maduro’s deeply oil-reliant budget and that is probably on firmer legal footing than the recent spate of missile strikes on purported drug boats (and that could sting China, the main buyer of Venezuelan oil). The fate of the oil itself is less clear: “We keep it, I guess,” Trump said, which the Venezuelan government called “blatant theft.”\n\nThe bigger picture is that seaborne oil trade is quickly turning into the most exposed Achilles’ heel at the center of major global conflicts. The European Union and G7 are considering aggressive new financial measures against Russia’s “shadow fleet,” which now handles two-thirds of the country’s oil exports. Ukraine is acting more decisively on its own, with a recent string of naval drone attacks that hit five Russian oil vessels in far-flung corners of the globe over 13 days.\n\nIn the past, when Western governments sanctioned an adversary’s oil exports, they were loath to take “kinetic” action against sanction-dodging ships. Shadow vessels could be hard to track; interceptions risk oil spills or violations of international law; and political leaders are always fearful that attempts to squeeze an adversary’s oil revenue can backfire by raising energy prices at home.\n\nBut now, satellite imagery and other open-source data have made it much harder to hide on the high seas. And oil prices are relatively low amidst an oversupplied global market, reducing the risk of significant price blowback. In fact, that market glut is most visible at sea: The total number of barrels currently on ships is 24% higher than the average of the last decade, and the number of sanctioned barrels has leapt 82% in the past year. The seas are awash, in other words, in juicy oil targets.\n\nWould Russia or Venezuela risk a direct engagement with the US Navy in defense of commercial oil vessels? The Pentagon seems to find that unlikely. Still, there’s a lesson here about the security risks faced by both buyers and sellers of seaborne fossil fuels — one that applies to the US as much as its adversaries.",

    "description": "OpenAI is in a far less commanding position than it was following the public release of ChatGPT a few short years ago.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is in a far less commanding position than it was following the public release of ChatGPT a few short years ago.\n\nBack in 2022, the sudden popularity of ChatGPT sent Google into a panic. The company was so worried about the possibility of the upstart chatbot disrupting its Search business, executives sounded a \"code red\" alert inside of the company and called Sergey Brin and Larry Page out of retirement to help it formulate a response to OpenAI. It then rushed out Bard, announcing its first commercial chatbot on February 6, 2023. Google's stock tanked days later when the AI incorrectly answered a question about NASA's James Webb Space Telescope during a public demo.\n\nBut it wasn't just Google that wanted a piece of OpenAI, while the search giant sought to compete with it, others — including Microsoft and Apple — made deals with the company to bring its technology to their products and services, all the promise that AI would eventually revolutionize every facet of the economy.\n\nSince then, OpenAI has seen its lead against Google and much of the AI industry evaporate, culminating in a series of successive blows throughout 2025. On January 20, the same day Altman was busy rubbing shoulders with other tech oligarchs at Donald Trump’s inauguration, China’s DeepSeek quietly released its R1 chain-of-thought model. A week later, the startup's chatbot surpassed ChatGPT as the most-download free app on the US App Store. The overnight success of DeepSeek eliminated $1 trillion worth of stock market value, and almost certainly left OpenAI blindsided.\n\nIn response, the company showed a newfound urgency. In one week, for instance, OpenAI released both o3-mini and Deep Research. It even went so far as to announce the latter on a Sunday evening. But for all its new urgency, OpenAI's biggest, most important release of the year was a miss.\n\nIt's safe to say GPT-5 hasn't lived up to anyone's expectations, including OpenAI's own. The company touted the system as smarter, faster and better than all of its previous models, but after users got their hands on it, they complained of a chatbot that made surprisingly dumb mistakes and didn't have much of a personality. For many, GPT-5 felt like a downgrade compared to the older, simpler GPT-4o. That's a position no AI company wants to be in, let alone one that has taken on as much investment as OpenAI.\n\nAnthropic was quick to take advantage of the weakness, signing a deal with Microsoft to bring its Claude models to Copilot 365. Previously, Microsoft depended exclusively on OpenAI for partner models in Copilot. Before the company announced the integration, reporting from The Informationsaid Microsoft made the decision based on the strength of Anthropic's Sonnet 4.0 model, judging it \"perform[ed] better in subtle but important ways\" relative to OpenAI's offerings.\n\nHowever, what will likely go down as the defining moment occurred a few short weeks after OpenAI announced the conclusion of its restructuring. On November 18, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, and immediately the new model leap-frogged the competition, including GPT-5. As of the writing of this article, Google's new model is at the top of LMArena, the site where humans compare outputs from different AI systems and vote on the best one. GPT-5, by contrast, is currently ranked sixth overall, behind models from Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nAccording to a December 2 report from TheWall Street Journal, Sam Altman sent a companywide memo following the release of Gemini 3 Pro. Echoing the words Google used to describe the situation it found itself against OpenAI in 2023, he called for a \"code red\" effort to improve ChatGPT. Altman reportedly told employees there would be temporary reassignments and that the company would delay some products, all in an effort to catch up to Google and Anthropic.\n\nThe few numbers these companies are willing to share don't paint a promising picture for OpenAI. Each month, about 800 million people use ChatGPT. On paper, that's impressive, but Google is catching up there too. In October, the company said the Gemini app had 650 million users, up from 450 million just a few months earlier in July, thanks to the popularity of its Nano Banana Pro image generator.\n\nMore importantly, OpenAI has an inherent disadvantage against Google. For the search giant, AI may touch everything the company does now, but Gemini is just one product in an extensive portfolio that includes many other popular services. Google can fund its AI advancements with money it makes elsewhere. OpenAI cannot say the same. The company is constantly raising money to stay afloat, and according to a financial roadmap obtained by The Journal, it will need its revenue to grow to about $200 billion annually to become profitable by 2030. In November, Altman said on X the company was on track to hit above $20 billion in annualized revenue this year.\n\nIn an effort to grow revenue, Altman and company have adopted an incredibly risky strategy. In recent months, OpenAI has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition that is already beating it. Many of those agreements can only be described as circular, and I think the fears about a financial bubble are real. In the first half of 2025, investment in data centers accounted for nearly all of US GDP growth. Even if there's not a repeat of the 2008 housing market crisis or the dot-com crash, the AI boom is at the very least poised to make everyday electronics (and utilities) more expensive for regular people in the short term.\n\nSince late October, demand for server-grade computer components, including memory and storage, has sent the price of consumer PC parts skyrocketing as manufacturers devote more of their production capacity and wafers to high-margin customers like OpenAI and Google. Since late October, the cost of most RAM kits has doubled and tripled. In November, the price of some SSDs went up by as much as 60 percent. Next year, the cost of LPDDR5X memory, which is used in both smartphones and NVIDIA servers, is expected to climb as well.\n\n\"Be it carmakers, smartphones or consumer electronics, everyone that uses memory is facing pressure from price hikes and supply constraints in the coming year,\" Zhao Haijun, the co-CEO of memory manufacturer SMIC told analysts, per Bloomberg.\n\nGita Gopinath, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, recently estimated that if the AI bubble were to burst, it would wipe out $20 trillion in wealth held by American households. The Great Recession, considered the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression, reduced US household net worth by $11.5 trillion, and it took years before for American families to rebuild their wealth to pre-recession levels.\n\nThe modern AI bubble may have been started by ChatGPT, but given the crowded field of chatbots and LLMs, it won't necessarily pop should OpenAI go bust. With novelty and technical prowess no longer on its side though, it's now on Altman to prove in short order why his company still deserves such unprecedented levels of investment.",

    "fullText": "Luxe quartz countertops have surged in popularity in recent years, with an 800% rise in imports to the US alone, thanks to their durability, heat resistance and smooth, natural look.\n\nBut that beauty may come at a price to the workers who install them.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued a safety alert on Tuesday regarding silicosis, a progressive and incurable lung disease.\n\nThe state confirmed the first case of silicosis in a Massachusetts employee of the stone countertop fabrication industry.\n\nHistorically associated with mining and construction, the disease has become more prevalent among stone fabricators working with engineered stone, which contains significantly more silica than natural materials like granite or marble.\n\nAbout 2.3 million US workers are exposed to silica in the workplace, according to the American Lung Association.\n\nSilicosis is caused by inhaling crystalline silica dust, which is generated by cutting, polishing or grinding stones, especially high-silica engineered quartz.\n\nSymptoms can include an irritating cough, mucus, shortness of breath, trouble breathing, fatigue, chest pain and leg swelling.\n\nWhile there are treatments to manage symptoms, there’s no cure for silicosis. The disease can worsen as it progresses, potentially leading to lung cancer, tuberculosis and even death.\n\nThe Massachusetts resident had worked for stone countertop fabrication and installation companies for 14 years, the state said. He’s a Hispanic man in his 40s.\n\nThe first US case of silicosis linked to engineered stone was reported in Texas in 2015.\n\nIn a 2023 study, California researchers identified 52 California quartz countertop workers with silicosis.\n\nTwenty of them had advanced silicosis, and 10 died before the study concluded.\n\nWhile the disease is potentially deadly, there hasn’t been an outright ban on quartz in the kitchen.\n\nRather, public health officials and researchers are asking for stricter regulations and safety precautions.\n\n“The confirmation of this case in Massachusetts is a tragic reminder that silicosis is not just a distant threat — it is here, and it is seriously impacting the health of workers in Massachusetts,” Emily H. Sparer-Fine, director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Occupational Health Surveillance Program, said in a statement.\n\n“Beyond the critical role employers play, everyone involved in the supply chain can help reduce the danger by opting for materials that contain less silica and pose fewer health hazards,” she added.\n\nPrecautions such as proper ventilation and a medical surveillance program for workers have been floated as possible solutions.\n\n“Our paper raises the alarm,” said Dr. Sheiphali Gandhi, a UC San Francisco pulmonologist and co-author of the California study. “If we don’t stop it now, we’re going to have hundreds, if not thousands, of more cases. Even if we stopped it now, we’re going to be seeing these cases for the next decade because [silicosis] takes years to develop.”\n\nIn 2016, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued two respirable crystalline silica standards to protect workers.\n\nThese standards require employee exposures to be below the permissible limit of 50 micrograms of respirable crystalline silica per cubic meter of air over an eight-hour workday.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, however, California safety officials found that about 72% of the 808 fabrication shops operating in the state were “likely out of compliance with the existing silica standard,” putting hundreds of workers at risk of silicosis, according to NPR.\n\nSince then, the California Division of OSHA adopted emergency rules for respirable crystalline silica in 2023, which were made permanent in late 2024.",

    "fullText": "This 'as-told-to' essay is based on a conversation with Leslie Snipes, a 34-year-old director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency who lives in Reseda, California. Her words been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started my director of marketing job in January 2024, the expectation was that I'd work from the office at least once a week. But because I was in a director-level role, I felt a bit more obligated to show face.\n\nFor the first few months, I made the 30-mile, 60- to 90-minute commute to our Los Angeles office a couple of days a week. Over time, the commute began to take a toll on me. I was wasting hours a day sitting in LA traffic.\n\nIn April 2024, after weighing my options, I decided to speak with my manager and ask if I could work mostly from home — coming into the office only as needed, along with any travel obligations. My request was approved in less than a day.\n\nI started the conversation with my manager by being transparent about my commute and the challenges it was creating for me. I would often arrive home feeling mentally drained, frustrated, or short-tempered after commuting, which affected my energy and overall well-being in the evenings. Additionally, the wear and tear on my car, along with the gas costs, were becoming outrageously expensive.\n\nI also shared that I believed I'd be a better worker without the strain of the commute, because I could spend more time actually working rather than sitting in traffic. Most of the company's clients were based on the East Coast — rather than LA — so most of my work could be done remotely from my computer and through Zoom calls.\n\nFrom a team camaraderie perspective, some of our strongest bonding happened during travel and off-site projects, rather than in the office, so I noted that working remotely wouldn't take away from that sense of connection.\n\nOverall, I emphasized that working from home would allow me to deliver my best work without compromising collaboration or team culture — and I think that approach was effective.\n\nAfter speaking with my manager and another manager, they were very understanding and accommodating. Since my role involves some travel, the managers said they considered that to be a form of in-office time, as I'm still interacting with colleagues in person.\n\nMore than anything, they recognized that work-from-home flexibility would help me perform at a higher level — and they trusted me to deliver on that.\n\nThe biggest perk of my work-from-home flexibility is that I feel much more efficient with my time — both personally and professionally. It gives me greater autonomy over my schedule, which helps me manage my workload more effectively and leaves me more energized and present when meeting with the team.\n\nI'm also a bit of an introvert, and I find it harder to focus when I'm surrounded by a lot of people. I tend to get more distracted in the office than when I'm working alone. Now, instead of showing up to be \"a body in the room,\" I can focus my energy on strategy, creative work, and client engagement.\n\nWorking from home has also reduced my stress, since I'm no longer spending hours in traffic just trying to get to work on time.\n\nDespite these benefits, I sometimes miss grabbing lunch and coffee with coworkers and talking about non-work-related things. When I'm working from home, I mostly interact on an as-needed basis, and there's less spontaneity with coworkers outside work.\n\nI typically make the commute to the office once or twice a month to connect in person with my colleagues, in addition to whenever circumstances warrant it.\n\nOverall, the shift has been a game changer for me — and it's a setup I wouldn't have if I hadn't asked.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dominick DiBartolomeo, owner of the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I bought the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills, my goal was to honor its legacy while making it feel fresh and relevant.\n\nThe shop has been around since 1967 and already had decades of goodwill, but I wanted to create something familiar and new, so we added sandwiches, salads, cheese boards, and wines by the glass.\n\nI didn't expect the flood of teenagers.\n\nMy daughter is 16, and I like to say her generation arrived armed with Instagram. They started filming everything — and some of those videos went viral.\n\nSuddenly, we had crowds of teens lining up for a place that had historically catered to adults, chefs, and longtime Beverly Hills locals. It completely changed the energy of the shop.\n\nPeople know our products are premium, but they don't see how volatile the economics have become.\n\nWe import directly from Europe, mainly Italy. At the beginning of the year, tariffs were 10%, and we absorbed as much of that as we could. However, the Euro then jumped from around $1.04 to about $1.17 or $1.18 — a 13% swing. As a result, the same products suddenly cost 23% more before they even reach our shores.\n\nThen there are the Chinese tariffs, which people rarely think about, but almost all takeout packaging comes from China. Between packaging tariffs and ingredient tariffs, some costs have risen 50%, 60%, and even 70%. When that happens across your entire supply chain, the math stops making sense.\n\nWe tried everything before raising prices, from asking suppliers to share some of the tariff load to switching products, and eventually accepting lower margins. However, at a certain point, you can't absorb the costs.\n\nOur sales are up this year, but our margins are down because our costs are so much higher. That's the reality for a lot of small specialty food businesses right now.\n\nOur customers are still buying, but the middle is getting squeezed. The under-$25 customer remains rock solid, and diners spending $100 or more are also doing fine. It's the middle that's struggling, and that's where a lot of restaurants and gifting budgets live.\n\nWhen we moved into our new location a couple of years back, I knew I had to take care of the older clientele who built this brand — but I also believed that if the shop didn't evolve, it would die.\n\nAdding sandwiches and salads wasn't just about giving people something to eat while they browsed. It was a way to create a full experience. While customers wait for their sandwiches, they can try different cheeses in line. The whole place feels alive.\n\nThen the influencers started showing up.\n\nI didn't know who most of them were — I had to ask my daughter who people were after they left — but our Instagram following grew from 6,000 to around 280,000 in about a year and a half.\n\nPeople now walk in and say, \"I came here because you showed up on my feed.\" We even had a couple from Australia tell us this was their first stop off the plane for their honeymoon because we popped up on their TikTok feed.\n\nThe most exciting part is that the virality around the sandwiches has turned into virality around the cheese, too. Because of the way our line bends through the store, people waiting for sandwiches are sampling cheeses the whole time — and they film that. Now, young customers come in for a buzzy sandwich, discover a type of cheese they've never tried, and suddenly they're coming back for parties, holidays, or simply because they want something special.\n\nWe even launched a merch line because we noticed how many younger customers wanted something to take home. Seeing a longtime customer who's been coming in for 40 or 50 years standing next to a teenager in a Cheese Store hoodie is one of the coolest things I've ever experienced. It feels like we've made cheese buying cool again.\n\nWhat's happened is that this new generation has completely renewed the life cycle of the business. At the same time, our longtime loyal customers remain the backbone of who we are. Now the two groups stand shoulder to shoulder in the shop. It's a full-circle moment — we've managed to grow without losing our core.\n\nI met my wife at the Cheese Store, where I was working while I couldn't afford a phone and was taking the bus to work. She supported me through everything — from raising money to buying the business and surviving the pandemic. Now we have 40 to 50 employees. All of their families rely on us.\n\nThat responsibility changes you. So does the joy of seeing the store full, watching our products show up in incredible restaurants, and witnessing teens discover a 57-year-old Beverly Hills cheese shop on social media.",

    "description": "\"My bet is often on life sciences, pharma companies,\"  Olivier Godement said.",
    "fullText": "Three industries are going to look very different in the next few years, according to an OpenAI executive.\n\nOn an episode of the \"Unsupervised Learning\" podcast, Olivier Godement, the head of product for business products at the ChatGPT maker, shared why he thinks a trio of jobs — in life sciences, customer service, and computer engineering — is on the cusp of automation.\n\n\"My bet is often on life sciences, pharma companies,\" he said, about his first pick for industries on the brink of change because of AI.\n\nGodement said that the goal of pharmaceutical companies like Amgen, with which he works, is to design new drugs. This has two components: actual research and experimentation, and admin, a time-consuming process that could be automated, he said.\n\n\"The time it takes from once you lock the recipe of a drug to having that drug on the market is months, sometimes years,\" he said. \"Turns out like the models are pretty good at that. They're pretty good at aggregating, consolidating tons of structured, unstructured data, spotting the different changes in documents.\"\n\nGodement joined OpenAI in 2023. He previously worked on products for Stripe for eight years.\n\nOn the podcast, Godement said that while we haven't reached a stage where \"any white collar job\" can be automated in just a day, he is starting to see strong use cases in fields such as coding and customer service.\n\n\"The automation is probably not yet at the level of automating completely the job of a software engineer, but I think we have a line of sight essentially to get there,\" he said.\n\nThe future of software engineering has been one of the most heated tech debates of the year, as AI-assisted coding enters most companies' workflow.\n\nAn Indeed study from October found that software engineers, quality assurance engineers, product managers, and project managers were the four tech jobs that have been axed the most during layoffs and reorgs.\n\nLastly, Godement said that customer-oriented roles like sales and customer experience may be automated soon.\n\n\"I've been working a bunch with the folks at T-Mobile, the telecom company in the US, to essentially provide a better experience to their customers, and we're starting to achieve fairly good results in terms of quality at a meaningful scale,\" he said. \"My sense is we'll probably be surprised in the next year or two on the amount of tasks that can be automated reliably.\"\n\nAcross the board, AI leaders are flagging white-collar jobs that can be easily automated by newer large language models.\n\nIn a June podcast, Geoffrey Hinton, who is recognized as the \"Godfather of AI,\" said that eventually, technology will \"get to be better than us at everything,\" but some fields are safer than others in the interim.\n\n\"I'd say it's going to be a long time before it's as good at physical manipulation,\" Hinton said. \"So a good bet would be to be a plumber.\"\n\n\"For mundane intellectual labor, AI is just going to replace everybody,\" Hinton said.\n\nHe identified paralegals as at risk, and said he'd be \"terrified\" if he worked in a call center.",

    "description": "Sima Sistani on life after WeightWatchers: \"My husband says I'm the busiest unemployed person he knows.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sima Sistani, an entrepreneur, adjunct professor at Duke University, and former CEO of WeightWatchers. Before that, she joined the senior leadership team at Epic Games after selling her startup, Houseparty, to the video game company. She lives in Durham, North Carolina, with her husband and two children. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAfter I parted ways as CEO of WeightWatchers, I called Oprah for advice. She was no longer involved with the company, and she's a friend.\n\nShe told me, \"Give yourself a year to say no to everything. Take this time to be with yourself and your loved ones.\"\n\nIt was really good advice because it would have been easy when the calls started — \"Hey, do you want to think about this role or that role?\" — to move on to the next thing. Then I could answer the question, \"What do you do?\"\n\nOne year later, I'm now an adjunct professor at Duke University, my alma mater, teaching a new course on women's leadership. I sit on the board of Best Buy. I invest in startups and funds.\n\nMy husband likes to say I'm the busiest unemployed person he knows.\n\nWhen I was at WeightWatchers, I got into the habit of using an alarm clock. It's a way for me to set boundaries.\n\nI realized I was chained to my phone. My instinct is to get on top of things. So when my alarm went off, I would look at my phone and get sucked in.\n\nI read a daily affirmation. I'm reading from \"The Book of Awakening\" by Mark Nepo.\n\nOnce I get out of bed, I put on my Beyond Yoga athleisure and Goop under-eye patches and tie my hair into a ponytail. Then I go downstairs and pour the coffee.\n\nI take mine with half-and-half, cinnamon, collagen powder, and a couple of Brazil nuts to mitigate the acidity on an empty stomach.\n\nI wake up my youngest child with a song, usually a pop diva track. Right now it's \"Fate of Ophelia\" by Taylor Swift.\n\nThen it's pandemonium for an hour.\n\nMy parents live four houses down, and so most mornings, my mom short-order cooks for the kids. They'll have French toast, eggs, popovers, or something pretty exciting compared to my Cinnamon Toast Crunch when I was growing up. I know. It's amazing.\n\nMy husband, Alex, takes the kids to school on his way to work.\n\nI drink my coffee and read, usually sitting outside on the patio.\n\nI get The New York Times delivered because that was another mental health hack. I no longer let the algorithms decide what I should be reading.\n\nAt 8:30, I'll either do yoga or attend a class at Orangetheory Fitness.\n\nThis past year, I completed my 200-hour yoga teacher training and certification.\n\nI don't want to be dramatic, but it was a life-changing experience. I didn't grow up in a religious home, and so yoga has given me a spiritual framework.\n\nWhen, suddenly, you no longer have a way of saying what you do for work — \"I'm the CEO\" or \"I'm the founder\" — you have to figure out who you are and what your identity is outside work.\n\nThankfully, I've reached a point of financial security where I can take the time to think about what I want to do — and make sure I do it in a way that is good for me and good for others.\n\nI eat a breakfast of yogurt topped with granola and berries, and tackle some work at my computer in the kitchen.\n\nSome days I have a board call or meetings with founders. I'm incubating some new brand ideas in the consumer packaged goods space, which is a departure from my comfort zone of 0s and 1s.\n\nWednesdays are dedicated to preparing my talking points for class.\n\nLast year, I spoke to a group of students in Duke's Innovation and Entrepreneurship program. I noticed there were a lot of guys.\n\nProfessor Jamie Jones, who runs the program, asked if I would be willing to teach a class. I said yes, if I could teach one that was geared toward women.\n\nI wanted to show students that entrepreneurship can look a lot of different ways and doesn't just mean that you're coding and eating ramen in a studio apartment somewhere.\n\nEntrepreneurship means writing new rules, and we need the next generation of women to write the new rules.\n\nEach week, I bring in a guest speaker. They're peers in my life who I've learned from, who have amazing stories.\n\nKat Cole is the CEO of AG1, but she dropped out of college and rose through the ranks of Hooters. Jeni Britton built an ice cream business, Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams, after being an art major and living out of her car. Hannah Chody was a Goldman Sachs vice president who left to join her family business, then fell into becoming a social media influencer.\n\nAround 2 p.m., I usually meet the guest, or sometimes the person stays with me. It's about a 12-minute drive through the Duke Forest from my house to campus.\n\nI usually give the guest speaker a campus tour. Duke Chapel is a highlight.\n\nThe class meets for two and a half hours every Wednesday. The first half is a discussion of what we learned the week before, and the other half is a Q&A with the guest. Students ask questions, too.\n\nI bring a portable speaker to play the guest walkout music. I was inspired by Jennifer Hudson's \"spirit tunnel.\"\n\nMost of it is the stuff that they won't say on a podcast. It's a moment for them to really engage with these 44 women.\n\nI ask them, \"What do you wish you knew when you were 20?\"\n\nAfter class, I take the guest to dinner, usually Little Bull or M Sushi in Durham.\n\nWhen I get home, I snuggle up with the kids and hear about their day.\n\nI used to escape my day with TV, and then I would stay up late. I'm watching less TV now that I don't work. When you're feeling pretty chill throughout your day, you don't need to wind down.\n\nI'm in my bed by 10:30 p.m. I'll grab my Kindle and escape into a good book.\n\nActually, Jenni and I talked about our enjoyment of romantic fantasy books. I just finished \"A Court of Thorns and Roses\" series and started \"Fourth Wing.\"\n\nIt's too bad that out in the world we call it 'smut,' but when it's \"Game of Thrones,\" it's fine for everybody.",

The company also listed between 1 and 49 creditors.\n\nIt was not clear from the bankruptcy court filings what led to Gold Tree Studios' financial troubles.\n\nRepresentatives for the company, as well as its bankruptcy attorney, did not immediately return requests for comment by Business Insider on Wednesday. Representatives for Malka Group also did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nGold Tree was founded by entrepreneur Tim Chonacas, who also serves as the company's CEO, and late veteran Hollywood executive William Immerman.\n\nThe pair launched the company's film production arm, Gold Tree Films, in 2018 and Gold Tree Studios in 2022, with its flagship location on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. Gold Tree's other subsidiaries include Gold Tree TV and Gold Tree Podcasts.\n\n\"The cutting edge facility set a new standard for post-production services,\" the company's website says about Gold Tree Studios. \"Despite industry strikes, Chonacas kept the studio afloat and expanded to Buffalo, NY, and Vancouver Island, Canada.\"\n\nThe facility provided post-production services for the forthcoming Bernard Rose-directed flick \"Lear Rex,\" an adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"King Lear,\" Deadline previously reported.\n\nIn the film, which does not yet have a release date, Pacino stars as King Lear. The cast also includes Ariana DeBose, Peter Dinklage, Rachel Brosnahan, Stephen Dorff, and Danny Huston.",

    "description": "Amazon plans a new rush pickup service for one-hour in-store orders, strengthening rapid delivery and click-and-collect offering.",
    "fullText": "Amazon wants more shoppers to get orders within an hour. A new kind of in-store pickup could be its next move to make that happen.\n\nAmazon is developing a \"rush\" pickup service that will let shoppers collect their orders at Amazon-owned stores within an hour, according to an internal document and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nShoppers will be able to place a \"unified\" order from both Amazon's online marketplace and items stocked in Amazon-owned stores, the document explained. The company operates several physical retail formats, including Whole Foods, Fresh grocery stores, and Go convenience stores.\n\nThe tech giant plans to pilot-launch the new program in at least one metro area by the first quarter of 2026, according to this document. The initiative is tracked by Amazon's SVPs, the most senior group of leaders at the company, it noted. However, it's uncertain whether that timeline is still in effect, said the person familiar, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe new pickup service would be Amazon's latest attempt to enable ultrafast, sub-one-hour deliveries.\n\nJust last week, the company launched Amazon Now, a new 30-minute delivery service in parts of Seattle and Philadelphia. It has also been testing similarly quick delivery offerings in countries such as the UK, India, and Mexico.\n\nFor those who want to pick up in-store, Amazon currently offers next-day pickup on some US online orders. Grocery subscribers can also collect select items in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIn-store pickup, often referred to as \"click-and-collect,\" is surging in e-commerce. Total US sales from click-and-collect services are expected to hit $112.96 billion this year, up 17% from 2023, and grow to $129.33 billion by 2027, according to eMarketer. The research firm projects roughly 152.9 million Americans, or 68% of digital buyers, will use click-and-collect in 2025.\n\nAmazon leads e-commerce by total sales, but Walmart may have an advantage when it comes to delivery speed. Thanks to its network of more than 4,600 US stores, Walmart can reach roughly 95% of American households within three hours. Walmart is the leader in click-and-collect services with a projected $38.50 billion in sales this year, eMarketer data shows.\n\nAccording to the internal document, Amazon expects the new \"rush\" pickup service to meet \"a key customer need for faster, more convenient access\" to its full product selection, while making better use of its physical store network and logistics infrastructure.\n\n\"By piloting this capability, we can validate customer demand for rapid pickup while learning how to effectively combine our physical and digital offerings,\" the document stated.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "A financial independence advisor shares 3 non-traditional investment strategies the wealthiest people use",
    "description": "Discover why wealthy people favor non-traditional investments such as cash value life insurance, SBLOCs, and real estate for building lasting wealth.",
    "fullText": "When Austin Dean started taking classes to earn his various financial advisor certifications, he didn't fully buy into the curriculum.\n\nIt revolved around more traditional financial wisdom, such as \"let's make sure we're maximizing retirement accounts and deferring taxes in the future,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nDean, who holds ChFC, CLU, CFP, and RICP designations, was interested in achieving financial independence, yet he questioned how he'd get there if most of his money was tied up in retirement accounts, which are inaccessible without penalty until age 59 ½.\n\nIt prompted him to analyze how the wealthiest individuals save and invest their money. What he learned was different from what he was learning in the classroom, and ultimately, would shape the philosophy at Waystone Advisors, the registered investment advisor he founded in 2021.\n\n\"The most wealthy don't get there by maximizing their 401(k)s and making coffee at home,\" said Dean. \"They started businesses, they bought businesses, they invested in real estate, they prioritized cash flow, they became the bank, they had a healthy relationship with using debt as a tool versus a morally good or bad thing, they put money into liquid assets like life insurance and non-retirement investment accounts.\"\n\nOne of the frameworks that Dean teaches his clients is the \"three pillars of wealth design,\" which breaks down assets into three main categories: stable assets, market-based assets, and income-producing assets.\n\nThere are both traditional and non-traditional ways to approach each asset type. Dean explains why the wealthy tend to favor the non-traditional approach.\n\nThink of the stable assets category as short-term money. With these funds, you're typically giving up growth in exchange for security and accessibility. Most people have their stable assets in high-yield savings accounts, money market funds, or CDs.\n\nThe non-traditional route would be saving your money in a cash value life insurance policy — meaning, when you pay your premium, a portion of it goes into a separate cash value account that grows tax-free over time and that you can access during your lifetime. The way it grows depends on the type of policy in place. For example, universal life policies act more like the market, Dean explained, while whole life policies act more like a savings account that grows at a guaranteed, consistent rate.\n\nIf structured properly, a life insurance policy can essentially act as a better version of a bank account, he said: \"Your money's working a lot harder, and that doesn't even factor in the default protection that you have a life insurance that protects your family or your business.\"\n\nHe emphasized that not all insurance companies are created equal and the policy needs to be designed correctly for the individual investor and their goals.\n\n\"Life insurance was originally built and intended for the wealthy to be able to grow and pass on money tax favorably, but any financial tool is going to have a variety of levers that can be pulled to do things really well or do things really poorly,\" said Dean. \"But if you work with somebody who knows what they're doing and how to craft it, it is one of the more accessible and better ways to diversify your plan.\"\n\nThe traditional way of gaining exposure to market-based assets is through retirement plans, such as a 401(k) or IRA. They're excellent savings vehicles with strong tax benefits, but you typically can't access your contributions without incurring a 10% fee until you reach age 59 ½. That's why Dean refers to these accounts as \"money jail.\"\n\nAnother way of investing in the market that gives investors more control and flexibility is through a securities-backed line of credit (SBLOC).\n\nThis is a type of loan in which an investor uses their stock portfolio or other assets as collateral. It allows for quick access to cash without having to sell investments and trigger a capital gains tax — and the investor can then pump that cash into other investments, such as starting a business or purchasing real estate.\n\n\"Now, your money is doing two things at the same time: It's in the market, and it's being used for other wealth-building tools,\" said Dean.\n\nThe main risk is pulling out too much money, and the stock market crashes, he explained: \"We recommend always leaving a buffer between what you are approved for and what is being used. I also recommend having other liquid assets or lines of credit in reserve, in case the market takes an unexpected swing.\"\n\nThe income-producing asset bucket includes Social Security, pensions, and annuities. Like retirement accounts, they don't allow for complete flexibility and control.\n\n\"Social Security, you can't touch it until 62, at least, but typically 67 or later at this point,\" said Dean. \"Pensions tend to be similar because of age restrictions, and annuities tend to have very similar restrictions to retirement accounts in terms of accessibility and penalties.\"\n\nThe wealthy prefer to generate passive, recurring income by investing in real estate.\n\nInvesting in real estate comes in all shapes and sizes. You can buy and offer short-term or long-term rentals and start bringing in rental income; you can invest in real estate syndications, a hands-off strategy that can produce good returns if you work with an experienced syndicator; or you can do private lending, act as the bank for real estate investors, and earn double-digit interest.\n\nDean understands that non-traditional planning isn't for everyone, but wants investors to understand all of their options — and know that wealthy people are doing things differently.\n\nBefore making any changes to your investment strategy, it's essential to outline your financial goals.\n\nAfter all, \"if your goal is to have a bunch of money in retirement accounts at 60 or 65, then keep doing that,\" he said. But, if you're aiming for financial independence or early retirement and don't want to wait until your 60s to access the bulk of your savings, \"we have to look at: What are the assets that allow us not to have to wait?\"",

    "description": "There are plenty of ominous signals out there that suggest we're late in the economic cycle. But Morgan Stanley says the worst is already behind us.",
    "fullText": "There are some ominous signals out there that suggest we're in the late stages of the economic cycle, but Morgan Stanley says investors should tune out the noise and brace for more growth ahead.\n\nADP private payrolls were negative in November. Challenger data shows layoffs at the highest levels in two decades. The unemployment rate is on the rise.\n\nBut as Morgan Stanley's equity research department sees things, the worst is already behind us.\n\nAndrew Pauker, a US equity strategist at the bank, laid out four reasons the economy — and therefore corporate earnings and the stock market — are in an \"early cycle\" environment.\n\nFirst, there has been a significant rebound in earnings revisions.\n\n\"Earnings revisions breadth for the S&P 500 troughed at negative 25% in April, it's now around positive 15%,\" Pauker told Business Insider. \"We typically only see these types of rebounds in early cycle environments. This is a clear sign to us that business confidence is improving.\"\n\nSecond, wage growth has slowed, giving profit margins room to expand. Here's the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker, showing a three-month moving average of wage growth at 4.1% year-over year. That's down from 6.7% in July 2022. Typically, this kind of decline happens during recessionary periods, Pauken said.\n\nThird, Pauker said consumer demand appears poised to accelerate. One signal for this is that companies are starting to exhibit higher pricing power, meaning they can increase prices without significantly impacting demand.\n\nAnd fourth, the Fed is cutting rates, a move intended to stimulate economic activity. After the Fed's December rate cut, Pauker and his team expect two cuts in 2026. He said the labor market will continue to show enough moderate weakness to continue to spur these cuts, but not enough weakness to throw the economy into a recessionary spiral.\n\nThe bank expects the S&P 500 to rise 14% in 2026, to 7,800, and Pauker also listed a few specific areas of the market he expects to outperform.\n\nPauker's highest conviction — and most out of consensus — call is \"overweight\" on consumer discretionary stocks after having rated them \"underweight\" for the last four years. The sector is historically cyclical, performing well during economic recoveries. It includes stocks that benefit from consumers spending on non-necessities — you might think of apparel companies like Nike or hotel firms like Marriott.\n\nSecond, and hand-in-hand with this call, is Pauker's expectations for small-caps to do well. Small-caps tend to be cyclical and benefit from falling interest rates, which they're more sensitive to than larger companies. Their margins should also get a boost from falling wage growth, Pauker said.\n\nHe pointed to rising earnings growth for the median stock in the Russell 2000, an index that tracks small-caps.\n\nThird, Pauker is bullish on the financials sector.\n\n\"The Senior Loan Officer Survey indicates that C&I loan growth is likely to improve next year, so that should benefit the banks,\" Pauker said. \"On top of that, earnings revisions, valuation and positioning are attractive for Financials.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley joins banks like HSBC, Bank of America, and JPMorgan in calling for the outperformance of cyclical stocks.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to these three areas of the market through funds like the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR), the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), and the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF).",

    "title": "Australia is booting kids under 16 off social media. Some senators hope the US is next: 'Our lack of action is inexcusable.'",
    "description": "Australia's new law requires social media companies to bar young teenagers from opening accounts. US Senators are trying to do something similar.",
    "fullText": "A law in Australia banning children under 16 from creating social media accounts took effect this week. It was the latest move in a growing global effort to protect young people from the harmful effects of social media.\n\nA group of American senators is hoping the US will do the same.\n\n\"Australia is stepping up to protect kids from the addictive and harmful content being constantly fed to them on social media. It's now time for Congress to do the same and pass the Kids Off Social Media Act,\" Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a Democrat, said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nAustralia's ban, which was first approved in 2024, requires social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, X, Snapchat, YouTube, and others to find ways to prevent young Australian children and teenagers from opening accounts.\n\n\"The onus will be on social media companies to ensure no child under 16 is on their platforms. If they have not taken reasonable steps to remove them, they will have broken Australian law and be subject to substantial fines,\" Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wrote in an op-ed in a local newspaper on Sunday. \"Social media companies have a social responsibility. That responsibility starts with the protection of Australian children.\"\n\nLawmakers in Norway and Denmark have also proposed laws that would bar social media platforms from offering services to children under 15. In Malaysia, a ban on children under 16 creating social media accounts will take effect in 2026.\n\nThese kinds of preventive measures come on the heels of recent research showing social media can negatively impact a child's mental health, resulting in depression, anxiety, addiction, or other concerning behaviors.\n\nThe World Health Organization surveyed nearly 280,000 young teens across 44 countries in 2024 and reported that 11% of respondents showed \"signs of problematic social media behaviour, struggling to control their use and experiencing negative consequences.\" That same year, former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy compared the addictiveness of social media to cigarettes and argued the apps should come with a warning to combat a mental health \"emergency.\"\n\nAlbanese said the ban in Australia will help parents have conversations with their children about the realities of using social media and combat peer pressure. \"This will be one of the ­biggest social and cultural changes our nation has faced,\" he wrote in the op-ed.\n\nThe US Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee introduced the Kids Off Social Media Act earlier this year. A version of the bill was first introduced in 2024, but it did not advance.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators, would bar social media platforms from allowing children under 13 years old to create or maintain accounts. It would also prohibit companies from using algorithms to target children under 17.\n\nSchatz, along with his Senate colleagues Ted Cruz of Texas, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and Katie Britt of Alabama, authored the bill.\n\n\"Legislation like the Kids Off Social Media Act takes tangible steps to rein in Big Tech and help save children's lives,\" Britt told Business Insider in a statement. \"The grip these companies have on Congress and our lack of action is inexcusable.\"\n\nThe bill will be debated before a vote in the Senate. If it passes, the bill will also have to go through the House of Representatives and ultimately be signed by the president.\n\nIn the meantime, American legislators have also taken legal action against social media companies, including Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. In 2023, 33 US states filed a lawsuit accusing the company of knowingly creating addictive social media features that can be harmful to children.\n\nThis October, New York City filed a lawsuit against Meta, Alphabet, Snap, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, accusing the companies of creating a \"youth mental health crisis.\"\n\n\"Social media use by teens has recently been implicated in alarming increases in dangerous and even deadly off-campus activity in New York City,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nAlmost 20 states have also enacted \"bell-to-bell\" cellphone bans for children in school. And some US states now require age verification and parental consent for teens to open a social media account.\n\nIn his statement to Business Insider, Schatz said there's \"no good reason for an 8- or 9-year-old to be on Instagram or TikTok. And until companies are mandated by law to enforce some basic rules and stop profiting off of children, they will continue padding their bottom lines.\"",

    "description": "Thanks to tech advances, bosses are gaining new ways to track what workers are up to — and sometimes that even extends beyond the office.",
    "fullText": "Your boss has never had more ways to peer over your shoulder.\n\nIt's not new for bosses to watch workers, of course — especially on corporate devices. But technology updates that let employers better monitor whether you're in the office, or view texts on employer-owned devices, are giving employers even more control.\n\nEmployer surveillance has grown because of the rise of remote work, and because of a proliferation of tools that allow for monitoring, a recent report from the US Government Accountability Office found.\n\nNow, not only has tech improved, say workplace observers, so has the power of many employers over their workers.\n\nDiscussions over worker monitoring are \"one of the pieces on the chessboard\" in negotiations between employers and employees, said Ben Zhao, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago.\n\nIt's a reversal of a pandemic-era power shift that briefly favored workers on issues such as more flexible hours or remote work. As the job market cools, bosses monitoring workers' logins more closely, for example, is a way to \"get some of that power back,\" he said.\n\nZhao, who has focused on information security and privacy issues for several decades, said employers also realize that workers have many ways to go outside a company's walls — from unsanctioned AI tools to online chat platforms — to find and share information. That can create security and legal headaches.\n\nSome back-and-forth between workers and employers over what information bosses have access to is normal, he said, but there's a risk when it's not disclosed.\n\nNew technology can give employers more opportunities to monitor employee activities, if they so choose. A recent update at Google, for instance, adds to the capabilities that companies have for archiving text messages on employer-owned Android phones.\n\nAt Microsoft, a coming change to its Teams messaging tool will automatically update your work location when you connect to your employer's WiFi.\n\nWith both features, employers would have to switch on those options.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Business Insider that the Android update is an optional feature for work phones in \"regulated industries\" where employers spell out that they're required to archive communications.\n\n\"This update simply allows organizations to support modern messaging — giving employees messaging benefits like high-quality media sharing and typing indicators — while maintaining the same compliance standards that already apply to SMS messaging,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe forthcoming Microsoft feature, which allows Teams to identify which company building workers are in based on their WiFi connection, is \"intended to help employees coordinate in-person work more smoothly with their teams,\" a spokesperson said in an email to Business Insider.\n\n\"It is not a monitoring tool and we do not support employee surveillance in any way,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\nAccording to the US Government Accountability Office, workers tend to be in favor of monitoring if it's intended to protect their safety, and often are opposed if it's intended to track productivity.\n\nEarlier this year, AT&T reduced the use of an attendance-tracking system that had frustrated some employees due to inaccuracies in tallying when people were in the office.\n\nThe shift highlights tensions that can emerge in the workplace over tracking efforts.\n\n\"Any workplace surveillance should have strict limitations on its use,\" said William Budington, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group advocating for digital rights. That might include not using the technology outside the workplace or beyond work hours, he said.\n\nAnother risk, Budington said, is that workers can easily forget they're carrying a company-issued device. Workers might text a friend, check medical information, or go on social media — even though employers could have full access to communications and location data.\n\nIt's not, Budington said, \"a scary ankle monitor that you are forced to wear.\" Yet it can amount to the same thing if workers carry their company phone with them outside the office, he said.\n\nThe most legally and ethically fraught issue isn't what employers can do with the phones and laptops they hand workers; it's what bosses might extract from personal equipment that workers use for their jobs.\n\nOne benefit of improved technology is that IT departments can often remove work-related information from a worker's personal phone without wiping the entire device as they might have been forced to in the past, said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, VP of HR services and associate general counsel at Engage PEO, which provides HR services.\n\nShe said that while employers often have policies for devices that access their networks, intercepting workers' personal information can cause hassles for employers.\n\n\"A lot of companies want to do the right thing,\" Matsis-McCready said. \"They don't want to know all this information either, because if they have it, then they have to keep it safe.\"\n\nWith company-owned devices, employers have access to any personal information you put into them, she said.\n\nWhere it gets tricky, Matsis-McCready said, is when an employer is tracking a personal device and a worker might be talking with a headhunter, going on a personal trip, or heading to a doctor's appointment.\n\nUltimately, she said, workers who have questions about what their employers might be monitoring should ask.\n\n\"I don't think a person should ever feel powerless,\" Matsis-McCready said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your workplace?

    "description": "A recruiter told Jillian Bowman, 52, that her maturity wasn't a fit for the team she would be working with.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jillian Bowman, a 52-year-old living outside Toronto. Her identity has been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started dyeing my hair when I went gray at the age of 17.\n\nThen the pandemic happened and I did what everybody did: I let my hair go gray. It was a big scary thing, but I was so proud to have done the work — not the hair maintenance work — but the actual self-work to be brave enough to do it.\n\nI thought when I had to go back in public again, I would go to the hairdresser and get it done. But I loved the way it looked, so I just let it go.\n\nOvernight, though, I noticed a change in how I was treated.\n\nAs soon as I started showing up with gray hair, people were kinder to me — like, old-lady kinder. Even when I go out in public or go shopping, people are nicer to me.\n\nBut in an interview, people were dismissive. I don't get asked the questions that someone would ask if they were seriously looking to hire someone. I found myself slowing down in interviews to keep pace because they asked questions about things from 10 years ago, rather than asking about AI architecture and agents.\n\nMy background is eclectic, but it's always followed the same thread of marketing, business growth, and change management. I've been doing contract work since 2014, and I've enjoyed working for myself. However, over the last three years, I've been seeking a more stable, full-time position.\n\nAfter I stopped dyeing my hair, I pretty much gave up trying to get a job from other people. I would love to have a full-time job, but I don't want to dye my hair just to get through the interview process.\n\nAround 2021, I did my first video interview after starting to gray.\n\nIt was for a CMO role, and the initial intake interview was done by a junior recruiter. She didn't ask me anything about marketing, just about the brands on my résumé from 10 years ago. As she was winding down the interview, I asked her, \"Why didn't you ask me any questions about digital marketing or anything that would be relevant to the job?\"\n\nShe said, \"You remind me a lot of my mom, and she can't even use her cellphone. I didn't want to ask you a question that you couldn't answer and embarrass you.\"\n\nUsually someone in a recruiter position isn't going to say that, but I've received a lot of hair color-adjacent comments from friends, like have you considered using a photo on your LinkedIn from a few years ago? I've also faced other feedback from recruiters that carries a similar tone.\n\nI was once told that my maturity wasn't a fit for the team that I would be working with. It was for a CMO role. Maybe there's an assumption that I wouldn't be able to work for someone younger than me, but I have zero problems with that.\n\nRecently, I had an interview where they told me I ticked all of their boxes. Then they said someone on the team wanted to have a quick chat to go over the client I'd be working with. He came on the video and decided he didn't need to go over any of the details, but started talking me out of the opportunity.\n\nThe call was over in five minutes, and I got a message the next day saying they went with another candidate.\n\nI'm not blaming the fact that I don't have a job on ageism, but I am saying that I have been met with ageism a very large percentage of the time that I've thrown my hat in the ring.\n\nI knew that gray hair would be a roadblock. It's why I initially hesitated to change my LinkedIn profile picture. Still, to think that showing up as myself is what's holding me back is a very rude awakening.\n\nA lot of companies need the sort of leadership and mentorship that comes with decades of going through cycles of change, and adapting to digital advancement. As a Gen X, my career started before email. I remember when the fax machine was out.\n\nPeople shouldn't look at Gen X and think that they can't adapt to new tech. Trust me, we can do new tech developments.",

    "description": "Leading tech and AI companies are thinking with their stomachs when it comes to naming their secretive AI advancements.",
    "fullText": "It may sound like a trip through the produce aisle, but leading AI companies have something much more important on their lists.\n\nMeta, OpenAI, and Google have all relied on food-related names for their sometimes secretive plans for future AI models. Thinking with your stomach is nothing new for Silicon Valley, just look at the assortment of desserts Android assembled over the years before Google had its fill.\n\nHere is a look at the mouthwatering and just plain goofy names AI and tech companies are using\n\nMeta has codenamed its future AI frontier model \"avocado,\" per a CNBC report. Guac usually costs extra, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's AI pivot has not come cheap. Meta plans to spend more than $70 billion this year on AI infrastructure, which is on top of $14 billion investment Meta made in Scale AI and to poach its founder, Alexandr Wang.\n\nOpenAI has hit a rough patch, feeling the heat from Google's advances and stumbling with a series of missteps. So perhaps it was time to spice things up. The ChatGPT maker has codenamed its new large language model \"garlic,\" according to The Information. Garlic is separate from another LLM OpenAI is developing, codenamed \"Shallotpeat.\"\n\nGoogle appears to have loved a codename so much that it made it public. Google's AI image generator in Gemini is named Nano Banana Pro, which it released on November 20. Before then, Google had internally called the model nano-banana, though they had not publicly disclosed their zany choice.\n\nThe clearance section offers a wide selection of great names. OpenAI might have one of the best all-time codenames with \"strawberry,\" which it used to refer to its o1 model. The name was likely a play on the viral struggle of AI models to correctly identify the number of Rs in the fruit. Before Strawberry, OpenAI had a secretive project named Q*.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk's xAI had a sweet tooth when it codenamed an early testing version of Grok-3 \"chocolate.\"\n\nMistral AI, the France-based startup, went in a completely opposite direction with \"Jaguar,\" its codename for a testing model.\n\nAnd Anthropic named its family of models Opus, Sonnett, and Hakiu, a trio of three different types of compositions.",

    "description": "The startup's new tech could compete with Big Tech's health AI projects from heavyweights like Alphabet and OpenAI.",
    "fullText": "Included Health is rolling out a new AI tool that could pit it against Big Tech's latest health bets.\n\nThe healthcare startup has launched an AI-powered personal health assistant, Business Insider has learned exclusively. The tech draws on patients' medical claims, benefits information, and other data to offer on-demand answers to health-related questions.\n\nIncluded Health is tapping into a hot area in healthcare AI, where it's competing against other health startups as well as tech heavyweights. Alphabet's Verily released its own AI-powered app in October that allows patients to connect their medical records and ask a chatbot their health-related questions. OpenAI wants to win in consumer health tech, too, and is considering building tools such as its own personal health assistant, Business Insider reported in November.\n\nIncluded Health has been scaling on the premise of personalizing how patients interact with their healthcare for over a decade. The company, which sells tech to about 300 employers and health plans to help patients better navigate their health benefits, tested its AI assistant for about 18 months to ensure its accuracy in smaller pilots before making it available to its entire employer base, CEO Owen Tripp said.\n\n\"This can't be ChatGPT level of probability. It has to be precise,\" he said.\n\nTripp is optimistic about patients receiving general health guidance from LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. Those AI tools can help patients learn more about their conditions and prepare for doctor's visits, he said. But he emphasized that Included's tech takes that guidance a step further.\n\n\"When it gets down to the business of actually taking care of oneself or taking care of somebody else, you're going to need a lot of very secure, specific data and a whole context to go solve problems, including the exact medical history of that patient,\" Tripp said.\n\nPatient-facing healthcare AI sometimes walks a regulatory tightrope, especially if the tech provides personalized advice that effectively replaces the work clinicians are licensed to do. Tripp said he doubts that most large tech companies attempting to delve into medical records aggregation will want to grapple with that complexity.\n\n\"I predict, like many before them, they will pull back. It's just hard, and the juice is often not worth the squeeze for these high-profile companies,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health's personal health assistant, called Dot, has become its members' front door and the foundation for Included's new products, said COO Nupur Srivastava.\n\nIncluded recently put Dot in front of members during open enrollment to help answer their benefits questions, Srivastava said. The AI agent can also help patients prepare for doctor's visits and send the clinician a summary of patients' past visits ahead of time.\n\nIncluded Health still employs plenty of its own clinicians and care advocates that members can talk to if they prefer. Srivastava also noted that if a patient mentions the term 'suicide' in a conversation with Dot, \"within a minute, someone will call you.\"\n\nWhen asked about Big Tech and AI startups' ambitions to build personalized health AI, Tripp said that Included Health is in talks with multiple potential partners to help them achieve those goals. He didn't specify which companies it's talking to, but he suggested some AI companies are focused on acquiring personalized health data that they can anonymize and use to train models.\n\n\"But when it comes to actually delivering patient care, we're pretty confident that companies that are going to succeed will be the ones that have well-trained physicians licensed in all 50 states, delivering on a real-time platform, across mind, body, and wallet,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health was supposed to go public in 2022. The startup had hired banks for an IPO push, but pulled out of its planned investor meetings when the market started to tank, Tripp told Business Insider in January.\n\nTripp declined to share specifics about Included's exit strategy as of November. But Included is profitable, so the company doesn't need to raise money through a public listing, he said. Included hasn't publicly fundraised since it was formed from the 2021 merger of Grand Rounds and Doctor on Demand, and the company hasn't shared its valuation.\n\nThe public markets haven't been forgiving to healthcare startups. Only two digital health companies went public this year, Hinge Health and Omada Health. And while Hinge and Omada have fared far better than most companies that listed during digital health's 2021 IPO wave, healthcare IPO hopefuls still face high standards to going public and significant volatility risks once they begin trading.\n\n\"The last few years in our space haven't been a great commercial for being a public company,\" Tripp said.\n\nWith so many developments in healthcare AI, however, Tripp does recognize that an IPO could create opportunities for Included Health to acquire other companies.\n\n\"I do think this is a time where there are going to be some interesting capabilities and technologies available in the market that allow us to provide even more service to our members,\" he said. \"I do have my eyes very open to how I would use capital to execute on some of those M&A events. That part is more important to me.\"",

    "fullText": "One San Francisco robotaxi arrived at its destination with an unexpected extra passenger on Monday.\n\nA woman in labor gave birth in the back seat of a Waymo robotaxi while traveling to the hospital, the company confirmed in a blog post on Wednesday.\n\n\"Some people just can't wait for their first Waymo ride,\" the company said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Google-backed robotaxi firm told The San Francisco Standard, which first reported the news, that Waymo's remote monitoring team detected \"unusual activity\" in the backseat of the driverless vehicle.\n\nEmployees called 911 once they realised what was happening. But the robotaxi delivered its passengers to the hospital without needing assistance, and was subsequently removed from Waymo's fleet for cleaning.\n\nApparently, it's not the first time someone has given birth in a Waymo, with the company confirming to The San Francisco Standard that a similar incident previously occurred in Phoenix.\n\nWaymo has had a big year, with the company's robotaxis becoming a regular sight on San Francisco's streets, alongside expansions into new markets in Austin and Atlanta.\n\nOn Wednesday, Waymo said it had served over 14 million trips so far this year, and expected to hit 1 million rides a week by the end of 2025.\n\nIt hasn't all been smooth sailing. Last month, Waymo issued a software update to 3,067 robotaxis after reports that its vehicles were driving past stopped school buses, according to a regulatory report filed on Thursday.\n\nWaymo is planning a major expansion next year as it faces competition from Tesla's nascent robotaxi service, which launched in Austin in June.\n\nThe robotaxi company plans to open its driverless ride-hailing service to the public in a host of new cities in 2026, including Miami and Washington, DC.",

    "fullText": "Don't count on a college degree to land your dream job in Silicon Valley.\n\nIncreasingly, founders and tech companies are judging talent by how quickly someone can learn, adapt, and build — not on how long they spent in a lecture hall — reshaping traditional pathways into the workforce.\n\nFei-Fei Li, the Stanford computer science professor widely known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" is one example of this.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" this week, she spoke about the value of a degree when it comes to hiring for her AI startup, World Labs.\n\n\"When we interview a software engineer, I personally feel the degree they have matters less to us now,\" Li said.\n\n\"Now, it's more about what have you learned, what tools do you use, how quickly can you superpower yourself in using these tools — and a lot of these are AI tools,\" she said. \"What's your mindset toward using these tools matter more to me.\"\n\nHer hiring bar has become even clearer: she won't hire software engineers who resist AI.\n\n\"At this point in 2025 — hiring at World Labs — I would not hire any software engineer who does not embrace AI collaborative software tools,\" Li said.\n\nIt's not about automating humans out of the equation, she added — it's about identifying people who can grow as fast as the technology around them.\n\n\"If you're able to use these tools, you're able to learn. You can superpower yourself better,\" she said.\n\nLi's stance is part of a broader shift playing out across Silicon Valley, where more founders and even major tech firms are openly questioning the value of higher education.\n\nPalantir's CEO, Alex Karp, has openly challenged the value of a college education, urging young entrepreneurs to skip the lecture hall and learn by doing instead — a view echoed by LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, who has said that adaptability and AI fluency now matter far more than the \"fanciest degrees.\"\n\n\"AI makes skill sets based on years of education irrelevant,\" Dan Rhoton, CEO of Hopeworks, told Business Insider. Hopeworks is a tech-training nonprofit that prepares underrepresented talent for AI-enabled jobs.\n\nAfter 13 years of preparing unemployed young adults ages 17 to 26 in Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia for tech careers, Rhoton said he has watched firsthand how AI is upending the value of a college degree.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more employers coming to us, saying, 'We used to require a bachelor's degree in this, but we don't understand why.'\"\n\nInstead, he said, employers now want a \"value proposition,\" which he said any job seeker can achieve by showing an AI-generated solution to a company's specific problems.\n\n\"This is the age of: I'm someone who's going to deliver business value,\" Rhoton said. \"Not: I have the right degree.\"",

    "title": "Warren Buffett hired Todd Combs to take over Berkshire's portfolio one day. Here's what close watchers say about his surprise exit.",
    "description": "After praising Todd Combs for years, Warren Buffett gave him a \"rather cool sendoff\" in Monday's press release, one Berkshire watcher said.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett hired Todd Combs in 2010 to help, and ultimately succeed, him and Charlie Munger in managing Berkshire Hathaway's vast investment portfolio.\n\nBut their handpicked heir to the stockpickers' throne has quit to join JPMorgan. The announcement comes just as Buffett is preparing to step down as CEO after six decades in charge.\n\nLawrence Cunningham, the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center and the author of several books about Berkshire, told Business Insider that Combs' exit was \"certainly striking.\"\n\n\"My impression is that this was not an easy decision for anyone concerned,\" Cunningham added.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to longtime Berkshire watchers for their read on Combs' unexpected departure. We also dug through more than 10 years of Berkshire annual letters to see how Buffett's descriptions of Combs have changed over the years.\n\nCombs and Berkshire did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nBuffett has heaped praise on Combs and his other investment manager, Ted Weschler, since hiring the two hedge fund managers around 15 years ago.\n\nCombs and Weschler had \"proved to be smart, models of integrity, helpful to Berkshire in many ways beyond portfolio management, and a perfect cultural fit,\" Buffett wrote in his 2012 shareholder letter, two years after hiring Combs. \"We hit the jackpot with these two.\"\n\n\"Their contributions are just beginning: Both men have Berkshire blood in their veins,\" he wrote the following year.\n\nIn his 2015 letter, Buffett gave a \"personal thank you\" to Combs for bringing Precision Castparts to his attention, paving the way for Berkshire to acquire the manufacturing giant for more than $30 billion.\n\nBuffett also entrusted Combs and Weschler with a bigger piece of Berkshire's portfolio over time. They started off managing about $2 billion of assets each, but were jointly overseeing $34 billion by the end of 2021. Buffett hasn't provided an update on the size of their portfolios since then.\n\nIn 2020, Combs took over as CEO of Berkshire-owned Geico and successfully engineered a turnaround. Buffett shouted him out in this year's letter, saying he had \"reshaped Geico in a major way\" and \"worked tirelessly in getting the job done,\" resulting in a \"spectacular improvement\" last year.\n\nSteven Check, the founder and chief investor of Check Capital Management, told Business Insider that Combs' departure surprised him as he'd been \"handpicked\" by Buffett and had taken on the \"huge responsibility\" of revitalizing Geico and delivered.\n\nBuffett struck a more formal tone in the press release on Monday that broke the news of Combs' departure and other leadership changes.\n\nHe referred to his colleague of 15 years, who he once envisioned becoming Berkshire's chief investor, as \"Todd A. Combs\" — a sharp contrast to his use of \"Marc\" for Berkshire's outgoing finance chief, Marc Hamburg.\n\nBuffett said JPMorgan had \"made a good decision\" in hiring Combs, but he didn't mention his personal traits, investing prowess, or other contributions to Berkshire. Buffett only praised Combs for his \"many great hires at Geico and broadening its horizons.\"\n\n\"The rather cool sendoff in the press release implies Warren wasn't too happy about the departure,\" Check, a longtime Buffett watcher, said.\n\nBefore taking over at Geico, Combs played a key role in setting up Haven, a healthcare joint venture between Berkshire, JPMorgan, and Amazon that was launched in 2018 but ended three years later.\n\nHe represented Berkshire on Haven's board and has sat on JPMorgan's board for the past nine years. He resigned from that post on Sunday ahead of taking up his new role at the bank in January.\n\nChris Bloomstran, the president of Semper Augustus Investments and a Berkshire shareholder for the past 25 years, told Business Insider that Combs' roles at Haven, JPMorgan, and Geico suggested he had a \"diminished role\" in managing Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nBloomstran also pointed out that in May, Buffett said Abel would be responsible for Berkshire's capital allocation, including its stock investments.\n\n\"Todd may have aspired to managing more or all of the portfolio, which wasn't going to happen,\" Bloomstran said.\n\nHe added that Combs didn't seem like a \"realistic candidate\" to succeed Ajit Jain as Berkshire's insurance chief, given his lack of reinsurance experience.\n\nAbel having \"final say\" on how Berkshire invests its cash \"may have been the impetus for Todd Combs to consider other career options,\" John Longo, a finance professor at Rutgers Business School and the author of \"Buffett's Tips,\" told Business Insider.\n\nHe added that he's not concerned about Combs leaving, as Weschler is \"very capable of managing the equity portfolio.\"\n\nDo you work for Berkshire Hathaway and have a story to share?

    "title": "Use the '168-Hour Method' to Track Your Weekly Productivity",
    "description": "There aren't enough hours in the day for everything you need to do—but what about in the week?",
    "fullText": "Many years ago, I saw a tweet go around that said something like, \"You have the same amount of hours in a day as Beyoncé.\" On the one hand, that was annoying, because while it’s true, I don’t have the same amount of resources. Still, yes, everyone has the same amount of hours in a day—point made.\n\nBut as it turns out, what may be more important thing to understand is that we all have the same amount of hours in a week. That’s the basis for the \"168 method,\" so named for the number of hours in a week. This productivity technique calls on you to expand your thinking around how much time you really have to get everything done, and act accordingly.\n\nThis idea comes from Laura Vanderkam, author of 168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think. (Straightforward!) This is one of the few productivity books I recommend, because its premise is actually novel and actionable. The guiding point of the book is that when you think of your time in longer spans, like a week, you realize you have plenty of it and can get things done pretty easily. When you consider an average day, by comparison, you may come to the conclusion you don’t have enough time to do everything you need to do, so you’ll either make excuses or sacrifices, neither of which are helpful in getting it all taken care of.\n\nWhen you start thinking about your time on a bigger scale, you can stop letting the daily grind wear you down and breathe a little easier with the knowledge that you actually have a bunch of hours to work with. You can make a longer-term plan, expanding your timelines ever so slightly without giving yourself too much time to take on a given project (which is also a bad thing that can derail productivity).\n\nYour first task here is to start tracking your time, and I mean militantly. You can use a time tracking software, calendar or scheduling software, a planner, or a regular old spreadsheet, but you have to be diligent and you have to be honest. For at least a week, mark down everything you did and the time it took you to do it, for the full 24 hours of each of the seven days. That includes sleeping, loafing, working, showering, commuting—everything. Be detailed, too. Don’t just mark down “working” from 9 a.m, to 5 p.m. List out the tasks you worked on and for how long, the breaks you took and what you did, and any extra work you did outside of those hours.\n\nAt the end of the week (or two or three weeks, if you’re feeling particularly serious), assess the data by conducting an objective after-action review. Did you need to spend two hours answering emails on Tuesday, or could it have been done in half an hour? What were the distractions that dragged that out? Did you spend as much time on a hobby as you wanted to? If not, when could it have fit in? Maybe Thursday night, when you were scrolling social media? And how did that scrolling make you feel? Was it a necessary moment of unwinding, or would you have felt more accomplished if you’d headed to the gym? (Don't be too quick to write off your downtime, though, as breaks are also integral to productivity.)\n\nYour answers to these questions will be subjective. There’s nothing inherently wrong with chilling out and doing nothing, or sleeping in, or even dragging your feet on a task. But by laying out a clear, visual schedule showing everything you did (and didn’t do), you can see exactly where, within that 168 hours, you could have done something else. You can then use this data to better plan your future to-do lists and activities. If you know you have some extra time on Wednesday nights, maybe that’s when you should practice the piano or clean the kitchen. If you know you’re taking more time than you need to on compiling inventories at work, cut that down and use the extra minutes for another task. The value in this method isn’t in shaming yourself about how you allocate your time, but in broadening your understanding of that time into a full week, where you almost certainly will find you have unaccounted-for hours that can be put toward the things you didn’t think you had time to do.\n\nI’m not saying you’ll emerge from this journey on the same level as Beyoncé, but you’ll be on a better level than you were before, which is a start.",

    "fullText": "Sir Chris Hoy says he is on crutches and \"hobbling about\" after breaking a leg in a cycling crash which he described as the \"worst\" of his life.\n\nSix-time Olympic champion Hoy announced in October 2024 that his cancer is terminal, but the 49-year-old has continued to ride his mountain bike since entering \"a bit of a stability period\" in his treatment.\n\nHowever, in an interview with Sky Sports, the Scotsman said: \"I've smashed my leg up, that's the worst thing that's happened recently. You just don't bounce like you do when you're younger.\n\n\"It was a big one. I'm doing better now, I'm still on crutches, hobbling about.\n\n\"Worse things happen. I've been riding bikes for 43 years and it's the worst crash I've ever had. I'm pretty lucky that's the worst one I've had in all those years of riding.\"\n\nHoy, whose seven Olympic medals also include one silver, is Britain's second-most decorated Olympic athlete behind fellow track cyclist Sir Jason Kenny (seven golds).\n\nHe also claimed 11 World Championship golds and 34 World Cup titles before retiring in 2013.\n\n\"I want to live my life and I want to make the most of it. None of us are here forever so you want to make the most of the time you have and do the things you enjoy,\" said Hoy.\n\n\"I've just had an unfortunate spill and it's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm doing alright now, I wasn't doing so well in the immediate aftermath of it, but looking forward to Christmas.\"\n\nHoy announced in February 2024 that he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.\n\nHe confirmed in October 2024 that his diagnosis was terminal after the primary cancer spread to his bones, with doctors giving him between two and four years to live.\n\nHoy said his terminal cancer diagnosis has improved his life \"in some ways\" because it has changed his outlook.\n\n\"It's changed my life without question, but I think in some ways it's improved my life,\" Hoy told BBC Sport in November.\n\n\"It's changed my outlook on a lot of things. I'm not as bothered by small things. I think I try and focus on the here and the now, enjoying the moment, making the most of today, and trying to find something positive in any situation.\n\n\"I'm doing well. I'm able to keep doing all the things that I enjoy, spend a lot of time with my family, and I hope to be around for a lot longer yet.\"",

    "title": "The UK’s Climate National Emergency Briefing Should Be a Wake-Up Call to Everyone",
    "description": "Mark...",
    "fullText": "The briefing was a rare coordinated effort to make sure the media reflects the science: Humanity’s planetary house is on fire, but we have the tools to put that fire out.\n\n“You must listen to the science.” Chris Packham, the veteran presenter of BBC nature shows, was imploring an audience at London’s Westminster, a stone’s throw from the Houses of Parliament, to face facts. An invitation-only crowd of about a thousand people, including more than 100 members of Parliament, news executives, celebrities, and civil society leaders sat before him, joined by a live-streaming audience. Held November 27, the gathering was billed as a National Emergency Briefing.\n\n“You must listen to the science,” Packham repeated. “Because if you don’t, then things go wrong, and lives are lost.” Quoting from a recent investigation of the UK government’s handling of the Covid pandemic, Packham noted that an additional 23,000 people died during a single week because scientific advice was ignored as social distancing orders were lifted prematurely. “Tragically,” he continued, the threat posed by climate change is “far, far greater…. It’s not thousands, it’s not hundreds of thousands, or millions of lives that are at risk. It’s billions of lives that are at risk.”\n\n“Billions” was no TV star’s rhetorical flourish, a panel of top scientists then explained. A series of 10-minute presentations summarizing the latest research on how rising global temperatures affect food production, public health, economic well-being, and military security offered a fresh take on what thousands of scientists have long warned. Humanity “is hurtling toward climate chaos,” in the words of “The 2025 State of the Climate Report,” “an unfolding emergency…where only bold, coordinated action can prevent catastrophic outcomes.”\n\nIrreversible tipping points, such as the shutdown of the massive ocean current known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), absolutely must be avoided, said Tim Lenton of the University of Exeter. An AMOC shutdown would spread Arctic Ocean ice far southward, give London temperatures of -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) for a full three months of the year, and cut in half the world’s growing regions for wheat and maize, Lenton said, sparking “a global food security crisis.”\n\nPackham also called out his news industry colleagues. The BBC presenter said the public was not “getting access to…the reality of what is happening to our one and only home.” Disinformation spread by the fossil fuel industry and its allies is partly to blame, he said. But beyond that, he added, much of the media “is either far from independent, outwardly biased, or simply failing in its duty to explain to everyone the gravity of our predicament.”\n\nThe briefing concluded with the release of a public letter demanding that government and media leaders do better. Addressed to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the heads of five of Britain’s national broadcasters and their independent regulatory body, the letter was read aloud by Olivia Williams, an actor in the television series The Crown. Declaring that the people of Britain “are not safe,” the letter urged “the Government and all public service broadcasters to hold an urgent televised national emergency briefing for the public, and to run a comprehensive public engagement campaign so that everyone understands the profound risks this crisis poses to themselves and their families.”\n\nAlthough this particular national emergency briefing was focused on Great Britain, it’s a wake-up call that needs to be heard in countries—and newsrooms—around the world. Despite an abundance of strong individual stories and a scattering of news outlets providing high-profile coverage of the climate emergency, the media as a whole is still not reflecting what science is saying: Humanity’s planetary house is on fire, but we have the tools to put that fire out. “Now is the time,” the letter concluded, “to put trust in the public,” which, if properly informed, can take “the action needed.”\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",

    "description": "The Lakers trailed by as much as 24 points in the fourth quarter while losing to the Spurs in an NBA Cup quarterfinal game.",
    "fullText": "Any chance the Lakers had at trying to capture a second NBA Cup championship in the third season of the tournament evaporated for good in the fourth quarter against a young, fast and athletic San Antonio Spurs team missing its best player.\n\nThe Lakers won the inaugural NBA Cup title in 2023 and had designs on winning it again in 2025 and the $500,000 cash that goes to each player on the championship team.\n\nBut it was not to be — not with the Lakers unable to slow down the Spurs during a 132-119 quarterfinal loss Wednesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers got down by as much as 24 points in the fourth and made a run to get to within eight points late in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Lakers got no closer and now will face the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday.\n\nThe Spurs will meet the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in Las Vegas in the semifinals.\n\nLuka Doncic had 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists, Marcus Smart came off the bench to score 26 and LeBron James had 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. But that wasn’t enough against a Spurs team that had seven players score in double figures.\n\nStephon Castle led the Spurs with 30 points and De’Aaron Fox had 20.\n\nWhen the Lakers needed someone to lift them when they got down by 18 points in the second, someone to provide them a spark when there wasn’t one for so much of the quarter, they finally got it from the oldest player on the court, 40-year-old LeBron James.\n\nJames drove down the lane and threw down a thunderous dunk over Spurs 7-1 center Luke Kornet, bringing the Lakers to within eight points and charging up the crowd in the process.\n\nJames growled and yelled in the face of the reeling Kornet. The crowd stood and cheered, now happy that there was a Lakers’ awakening.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t hold on to that momentum, falling behind 70-58 at the half.\n\nAnd then when the third quarter started, the Lakers came out flat, giving up back-to-back threes and two more easy baskets for the Spurs to fall into an 80-60 hole early in the third.\n\nThe Lakers didn’t make it easy on themselves either.\n\nDoncic got a technical foul in the first quarter after no foul was called after Kelly Olynyk smacked him in the face and Lakers coach JJ Redick was called for a technical foul in the second quarter.\n\nWhen the Lakers last faced the Spurs a little over a month ago here, San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama played in a game L.A. won, but speedy point guard De’Aaron Fox did not.\n\nIt was the opposite this time, with Fox playing and Wembanyama out with a left calf strain.\n\nThe 7-5 Wembanyama has been out for almost a month and the super-quick Fox has been back during that time, which has changed the dynamic of the Spurs, which meant the Lakers had to shift how they played defense against San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs are more guard-oriented with Fox, Castle and Dylan Harper.\n\nThe Lakers got a taste of how much faster the Spurs are now in the first quarter, when L.A. gave up 39 points and trailed by nine after the first frame.\n\nThe Spurs show 56% from the field in the first, 50% (six-for-12) from three-point range.\n\nKeldon Johnson came off the bench to score 13 points in the first quarter for the Spurs.\n\n\"Yeah, they're running a lot of pick and rolls with Fox, a lot of pick and rolls with Castle and Harper,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said pregame about the Spurs’ new way of playing. “And all those pick and rolls lead to drives, those pick and rolls lead to kick-outs and catch two threes and then more drives. So, we've got to do a good job of containing the basketball and do a good job of contesting.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "What next after Hamilton's 'nightmare' year?",
    "description": "Lewis Hamilton's first year at Ferrari started with positivity but his and Ferrari's struggles took its toll. Is there reason for optimism in 2026?",
    "fullText": "Lewis Hamilton said after the final race of what has been an annus horribilis for him at Ferrari that he wanted to shut off from the world over the winter.\n\n\"I'm already looking forward just to the break, just to disconnecting, not speaking to anyone,\" the seven-time champion said, after the worst season of his career.\n\n\"No one's going to be able to get hold of me this winter. I won't have my phone with me and I'm looking forward to that. Just completely unplugged from the matrix.\n\n\"I've generally always had it around, but this time it's going in the fricking bin.\"\n\nHis remarks reflect the toll this season, his first in which he has scored not a single podium finish in a grand prix, has had on Hamilton.\n\nIt was a year that started with such positivity, but quickly turned into something Hamilton himself described as a \"nightmare\".\n\nThe 40-year-old Briton joined Ferrari with the ambition of winning that elusive eighth world title, which he - and a good number of others - believes he should already have won in the controversial 2021 title decider.\n\nIt had been a long-time ambition, and the move created a sensation.\n\nThe sport's most famous driver joining its most iconic team, right at a time when Ferrari seemed to be on an upward trajectory after ending 2024 narrowly missing out on the constructors' championship at the final race of the year. It seemed set up perfectly.\n\nBut the script went off course. Ferrari's car was not competitive at the start of the year, while Hamilton struggled to adapt to its characteristics, and had questions about the way the team worked.\n\nAlthough a sprint-race victory for Hamilton at the second race of the season in China was a promising start, reality set in with a bump the following day, when both cars were disqualified from the grand prix.\n\nIn Hamilton's case, the reason for the disqualification was an early indication of a problem that would blight much of Ferrari's season.\n\nHe was disqualified for excessive skid wear. To be vaguely competitive, Ferrari had to run the car so low that it risked wearing out its skid plates. Run it higher, and it was slow.\n\nFerrari fell foul of this issue at least twice \n\nIn Hungary, his team-mate Charles Leclerc qualified on pole and appeared to be competing for the win with the McLarens for the first two-thirds of the race, only to slow significantly in the final stint as he limited his top speed to reduce the load on the car.\n\nIt was in Hungary that the first real signs of the strain on Hamilton showed.\n\nHe could manage only 12th on the grid, and the stark comparison between him and Leclerc resulted in him saying he was \"just useless\", and suggesting the team \"probably need to change driver\".\n\nThe second part of the season was littered with similarly downbeat comments, always uttered in the heat of the moment when the adrenaline was still pumping after a difficult time out on track.\n\nTeam principal Frederic Vasseur has been brushing them aside.\n\n\"I don't pay attention to the reaction in the TV pen,\" he said in Abu Dhabi last weekend. \"Honestly. Or the reaction that sometimes they add on the microphone in the car, on the radio.\n\n\"In the TV pen, they are jumping out of the car five minutes after the session. Sometimes they have bad results for a couple of hundredths (of a second). And you are asking them questions.\n\n\"I can understand that sometimes the guy is a bit emotional and to say, 'OK, yes, no.' All he wants is to go back to the engineering office and to discuss with the engineer to understand why.\"\n\nIn that answer Vasseur touched on another common theme he has used to downplay Hamilton's difficulties.\n\nWhen Hamilton has missed out in qualifying, Vasseur often points out that it's usually by tiny margins. The field is so tight, he says, that any error, whether in driving or tyre preparation or whatever, is punished.\n\nAs Vasseur said after the race in Abu Dhabi: \"We struggled all the season with details, because what we have to keep in mind is that yesterday in Q1, you moved from P6 to P16 for less than 0.1secs.\"\n\nThe margin between sixth and 16th last Saturday was actually 0.216secs, but the fundamental point stands - Hamilton missed out on getting through by 0.009secs.\n\nNevertheless, it overlooks the fact that there are two Ferrari drivers, and Leclerc has not been as badly affected.\n\nHe has out-qualified Hamilton, the sport's all-time pole position record holder, 22 times to seven at an average advantage of 0.15 seconds a lap. Leclerc's average grid position is 5.6, Hamilton's is 9.5.\n\nInevitably, Ferrari's first winless season since 2021, in combination with the added focus on the team created by Hamilton's presence, has stoked tensions.\n\nThat was abundantly clear when Ferrari chairman John Elkann made an intervention after the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.\n\nA day after Hamilton had said his season was \"a nightmare and I've been living it for a while\", Elkann gave a rare interview and said his drivers needed to \"focus on driving and talk less\".\n\nElkann's comments have not had any noticeable effect on Hamilton's desire to express his frustration publicly.\n\nAfter a difficult Las Vegas weekend, he told BBC Sport he was \"not looking forward to\" next season.\n\nAnd in Abu Dhabi, where he ended the season with his third consecutive failure to progress beyond the first qualifying session, he said he was feeling \"an unbearable amount of anger and rage\".\n\nHamilton insists he is still motivated to continue into next season, when the introduction of new rules bolsters his hope that his and Ferrari's form can turn around.\n\n\"It's the love for what you do,\" he says. \"It's the love for racing. I've got amazing support from people around me, my fans. It's that constant keeping an eye on the dream. I still have a dream that I hold hope in my heart and that's what I work towards.\"\n\nThat dream remains to win his eighth world title with Ferrari. Any suggestions he should retire can clearly by ignored.\n\nHow realistic that dream might be remains to be seen. And the exact causes of Hamilton's struggles in 2025 remain a point of conjecture.\n\nNext year, F1 is going through a major upheaval with new rules for cars and engines. Ferrari are not alone in hoping that the inevitable reset of the competitive order that will create will benefit them.\n\nThat partly explains why Ferrari have not shown any significant progress this season. When the car was clearly uncompetitive early on in 2025, the team made a collective decision to focus even more heavily on the 2026 car, even earlier.\n\n\"I was a part of (that), I was one pushing for it,\" Hamilton says. \"You can't fall behind the others in terms of that development for the new car because it's a steep learning curve for all of us.\n\n\"So I supported it 100%. I still do. I think it was the right decision. Particularly where we were already with the car, we weren't fighting for a championship.\n\n\"But it's just meant that it's been harder to maintain the performance, at least some of the performance we had at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nThis season has provided Hamilton with plenty of examples of areas where he thinks the team can improve operationally, and it's clear that Ferrari will be spending some time over the winter looking at where to plug the gaps that Vasseur, too, has repeatedly pointed out.\n\n\"We just need to analyse where we've been, what's been good, areas that we can improve on,\" Hamilton says. \"I know where they all are. It's sitting down with the team at the end of the year.\"\n\nBut even if Ferrari end up competitive next season, there inevitably remain question marks about Hamilton.\n\nWhile he has repeatedly pointed to the need to adapt to Ferrari in a number of different ways, it is an uncomfortable truth that this was the second consecutive season in which he has been out-performed by a younger team-mate. George Russell's record against Hamilton in his 12th and final season at Mercedes in 2024 was remarkably similar to Leclerc's in 2025.\n\nAnd perhaps the most striking aspect of Hamilton's season is that it has been unique in one noteworthy way.\n\nUntil this year, no matter how difficult a season had been, there were always reliably a handful of the sort of moments where Hamilton did something incredible - a qualifying lap that came out of nowhere, a race of consistently searing speed, a stunning overtaking move etc.\n\nAside from his sprint victory from pole in China, it's hard to think of any similar moments in 2025.\n\nHamilton has made no secret of his distaste for the generation of cars that were created by the rules introduced in 2022. \"There's not a single thing I'll miss about these cars,\" he said. \"Simple as that. I've not enjoyed it.\"\n\nThe theory is that they do not mesh with Hamilton's style of late braking and pitching the car into the corner.\n\nYet it remains a mystery how a driver who was long famed for his adaptability, and whose talent and status is unquestioned and unquestionable, has failed to adapt to them.\n\nEqually, while next year's cars return to an aerodynamic philosophy that is much more akin to those in which he had so much success until 2021, teams are already saying that the other changes being brought in for next year will require major levels of adaptation from the drivers - perhaps more than ever before between one year and another.\n\nMany people in F1 wonder whether Hamilton's struggles are more to do with the inevitable creep of age - he will be 41 in January - than anything else. And some have drawn parallels with Michael Schumacher's unconvincing comeback from 2010-12.\n\nHamilton's old rival Fernando Alonso, who is three years older than him, seems to be proving that racing into your fifth decade does not necessarily need to mean a competitive decline.\n\nBut human beings age in different ways and at varying rates.\n\nNone of this is to say that Hamilton can't or won't return to competitiveness. But whether he - and Ferrari - can will be one of the defining narratives of F1 2026.\n\nHamilton's struggles and ranking Verstappen's 2025 - Q&A\n\nNorris keen to 'live a normal few days' and 'forget I drive in F1'",

    "fullText": "Dec. 10 (UPI) -- The University of Michigan on Wednesday fired head football coach Sherrone Moore for \"an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,\" and hours later he was booked into a jail near the college's campus in Ann Arbor.\n\nMoore compiled a 17-8 record for two seasons after serving as offensive coordinator when the Wolverines won the national title in January 2024.\n\nFour hours after the school announced his termination, Moore was taken to the Washtenaw County Jail at 8:30 p.m EST, the Pittsfield Township Police Department told the Detroit Free Press. Police were called to investigate an alleged assault in Pittsfield Township.\n\n\"U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement to the media. \"Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\"\n\nNo details about the relationship have been released, though The Detroit News reported an outside investigation this week was conducted after an internal inquiry didn't reveal evidence of an inappropriate relationship.\n\nMoore, 39, married his wife, Kelli, in 2015, and they have three daughters.\n\nPossible criminal charges are being investigated.\n\nAt 4:10 p.m., the Pittsfield Township Police Department said officers responded to a call for an alleged assault investigation.\n\nThirty-three minutes later, the school announced the firing. The termination has not been posted on the school's website or social media accounts.\n\nPolice in Saline, near the Ann Arbor campus, said in a statement to ESPN that they \"assisted in locating and detaining Moore.\"\n\n\"Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges,\" the authorities said.\n\nMoore, the school's first Black head coach, signed a five-year contract before the 2024 season for at least $5.5 million annually. There is a $13.89 million buyout but his firing could void the amount, CBS Sports reported.\n\nBiff Poggi, 66, was appointed interim head football coach.\n\nMichigan (9-3) is scheduled to play Texas (9-3) in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. Last year, Michigan went 7-5 during the regular season and beat Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa, Fla., on New Year's Eve.\n\nPoggi returned to Michigan as offensive coordinator and also filled in when Moore served a university-imposed suspension for games against Central Michigan and Nebraska in a sign-stealing saga. Moore was to be suspended for the first game of the 2026 season as a continuation of his punishment for the scouting scandal involving former staffer Connor Stalions.\n\nMoore was suspended for one game in the 2023 season as part of a self-imposed penalty for a recruiting violation.\n\nMoore had been on Jim Harbaugh's staff since 2018.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 18 days after Michigan won the national title, Moore replaced Harbaugh, who went to the NFL Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nDuring the championship season, he was the interim coach for the Wolverines for the final three games as Harbaugh served a suspension for his role in the sign-stealing saga.\n\nBefore coming to Michigan, Moore worked on Central Michigan's staff.\n\nUniversity of Michigan Regents in January 2022 fired President Mark Schlissel after an investigation found inappropriate conduct with an employee.\n\nDomenico Grasso became interim president in May after the resignation of Santa Ono, who was announced as the University's Florida president but the state board rejected his candidacy.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea’s players have reportedly held a meeting regarding the recent struggles they have against the lesser sides.\n\nThe latest struggle of course came on Tuesday evening with The Blues failing to beat midtable Serie A side Atalanta in the Champions League. They didn’t only fail to beat the Italian side, they ended up losing the game 2-1 after being ahead in the first half.\n\nAnd that game came almost a week after Chelsea lost 3-1 to Leeds United away from home and at the time of the defeat, Leeds were in the bottom three in the Premier League!\n\nIt’s been clear this season that Chelsea have been able to operate much better against teams they are not expected to win against. They do not like being the underdogs and it appears the pressure of this gets to them when they are.\n\nReece James battles in midfield, (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail this week, Chelsea’s players, led by captain Reece James, have been speaking with each other on their struggles against the lesser sides they should be controlling.\n\nSo, let’s see what effect if any, this has on our next matches going forward.\n\nChelsea’s upcoming fixtures are not looking too favourable. Can you even call Everton a ‘lesser’ team at the moment given the top form they have been in? They have won four of their last five games ahead of facing Chelsea at the weekend.\n\nAfter that, Chelsea face Newcastle United and Aston Villa in the league, two other sides who have found good recent form and will be very tough to beat.\n\nSo this will be a stern test for Enzo Maresca and his players coming up, a test that they really do need to pass now with flying colours.",

However, Basel are dangerous, especially at home.\n\nThe Swiss side has alternated between wins and defeats throughout the League Phase (W2, L3).\n\nIt is worth noting that they have won their last seven Europa League home matches, their longest active streak in the competition.\n\nA late defeat to Genk dropped them to 24th, but they still occupy the final play-off spot with three games remaining.\n\nConfidence is rising after back-to-back domestic wins, including a last-gasp 2–1 victory over Winterthur last weekend.\n\nThis will be the clubs’ first meeting in 23 years, since Villa’s 4–1 aggregate victory in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nThe Villans must be wary as Basel have won five of their last 10 matches against English opposition.\n\nBasel have also been flawless at home in this competition, with seven straight wins at St Jakob-Park.\n\nVilla have struggled on the road in Europe recently, winning just one of their last six UEFA Cup/Europa League away games.\n\nHowever, Villa have scored two or more goals in 10 of their last 15 matches, highlighting their firepower heading into this fixture.\n\nDonyell Malen up top will likely carry Villa’s greatest threat with Ollie Watkins rested. Malen has scored three goals in his last two Europa League outings.\n\nTyrone Mings (thigh) and Ross Barkley (knee) remain out, while Evann Guessand is doubtful after missing the Arsenal win.\n\nUnai Emery may rotate. Emiliano Martinez has started the last three European games but could be rested, with Marco Bizot pushing for minutes.\n\nMatty Cash might also drop out, opening the door for Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof or Andres Garcia at right-back.\n\nIf Lindelof does not play wide, he could partner Pau Torres centrally, with Lucas Digne competing with Ian Maatsen on the left.\n\nIn midfield, Boubacar Kamara and Amadou Onana are expected to continue, while Youri Tielemans or Morgan Rogers may be managed due to fixture congestion.\n\nFurther forward, Buendia is pushing for a start after his last-gasp Arsenal heroics. The 28-year-old could get a shot.\n\nHarvey Elliott will likely not play today. Emery confirmed that the youngster, who is a ‘special player’, could return to parent club Liverpool in January.\n\nJadon Sancho and John McGinn are alternative options. Malen is expected to lead the line, with Emery likely to rest Ollie Watkins again.\n\nMarco Bizot; Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof, Pau Torres, Lucas Digne; Boubacar Kamara, Amadou Onana; John McGinn, Emiliano Buendia, Jadon Sancho; Donyell Malen.",

    "fullText": "New Penn State coach Matt Campbell emphasizes one word for instant 2026 turnaround originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew Penn State football coach Matt Campbell has already started to hit the ground running on establishing a new identity in State College after building and maintaining a foundation of consistency in Ames across the last decade.\n\nIn doing so, he knows a thing or two about team culture, chemistry and what a winning tradition looks like. He sat down with Josh Pate on the \"Pate Speaker Series\" to unveil his vision.\n\n“We’re going to have to prove it,\" Campbell said. \"Words are great, but we’re going to have to prove it.\"\n\nPenn State underachieved massively this past season, as it limped its way to a bowl game at 6-6 after beginning the year as the preseason No. 2 team in the nation before James Franklin was fired midseason after a berth in the College Football Playoff was no longer sustainable.\n\nCampbell intends to ensure a repeat doesn't happen next fall.\n\n“Toughness still wins in this sport. … Mentally and physically tough. We know how to build mental and physical toughness in a football team,\" Campbell said.\n\nToughness remains a key pillar, which is something Campbell wants to have his players master on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\"Our discipline has got us to play and beat the best of the best,” Campbell said. \"Those values still reside in any championship football team and football program. That’s what’s going to have to reside at Penn State.\"\n\nCampbell certainly has his work cut out for him, but if anything, if there's someone who has done a similar turnaround before, it's him. It just happens to be alongside the biggest job he's ever had in his coaching career.\n\nFor now, though it remains to be seen whether he's still ends up being the right man for the job. We will find out next fall.",

A victory would improve their record to 10-4 and keep them locked in to the fifth seed. Additionally, if the Packers beat the Broncos, Los Angeles would only be one game back from owning the top spot in the division.\n\nA loss would drop the Bolts' record to 9-5, their playoff odds to 69% and could have them in the \"in the hunt\" category, should the Texans, Colts, and Bills win their respective games.\n\nThe Week 15 game between L.A. and Kansas City is important because it could be one of the things that knocks the Chiefs out of the playoffs.

    "fullText": "In a crowded field, Poyet’s first derby is right up near the top of my personal list – it’s no Richardson free kick, obviously, but I absolutely loved that game.\n\nI’d have just turned 15 not long before the match, so I was in that sweet spot in life where I had near-endless free time to sink into football, but was just about old enough to really understand the emotional weight of what we were seeing.\n\nThe game itself is a bit strange to look back on, because for the vast majority I remember it looking pretty similar to any other game – no leg-breakers, no refereeing drama, not much to tell you the scale of the occasion other than the deafening volume of the crowd. Certainly it wasn’t marked by controversy like certain other derbies…\n\nSteven Fletcher’s opener was unremarkable as well; a stood-up cross to the back stick and a nod down from a couple of yards. Perfect start to the game, but nothing to etch into folklore. Maybe something to brighten up our awful start to the season, though.\n\nMy overriding memory of their equaliser is knowing I’d be able to hear their f***ing away end singing ‘DE-BU-CHY’ like I was sat right there for weeks – as we’re 12 years on and I can hear it like it was yesterday, I think it’s safe to say I underestimated it! It felt so deflating – hardly a stunner, and we weren’t being hammered, but it just felt like more of the same dross we’d been serving up for months.\n\nSat in the East Stand that day, you could have offered me a million quid to pick a potential game-winning hero and I’d have got nowhere near it. Because of everything that followed, it’s hard to remember quite how little any of us rated Fabio Borini before that day. Did Poyet picture what was coming in his mind when he sent the Italian on? I’d suggest not.\n\nThen came the quick free kick (taken with a rolling ball, by the way). Then came Altidore’s – ehem – lay-off. Then came Borini’s stunner.\n\nI’m not even gonna bother describing it – we all remember. But sat in front of the recording of the game on Sky Sports the next morning, videoing the goal on my phone, it started to dawn on me that we’d just beaten them, in front of my eyes, with a howitzer from range and there was nothing they could ever do to take it away from us.\n\nThat’s a feeling I replicated each and every of the 1000+ times I sat and rewatched that grainy, out-of-focus video on my phone. Cheers Gus and Fabs!\n\nPersonally, the one stand out Derby memory is Defoe’s ridiculous volley at home and the celebrations that spilled over into half time.\n\nAlas, I’m not reflecting on that game. Instead, I get to talk about a game that you won’t often see being referred to. One that certainly doesn’t get posted by the club’s social media pages as we near the 11th anniversary. It was Newcastle United 0 – 1 Sunderland in December 2014.\n\nFor me, the last minute winner is synonymous with an ill judged YouTube upload from a Newcastle fan. In incredibly grainy footage captured on a Nokia 3210, the fan in question aims to immortalise himself by recording a winning Newcastle Corner in the dying minutes.\n\nWhat transpired was quite different.\n\nThe grainy footage, for me, is actually a blessing in disguise, as I’m almost unable to see which player finishes the brilliant breakaway chance… What I do remember, though, are the scenes from that away end and the image of Gus Poyet that is immortalised – arms aloft to the away end up in the gods as we realise that it’s the fourth successive win against our horrible neighbours.\n\nWhat can we take away from it now? It was a bit of a hint to the “Til The End” mantra that encompasses this team. That the game isn’t over until the whistle blows and just how much the result matters to the team, management and fans.\n\nFor me, this was the best and most complete Sunderland derby performance in my lifetime.\n\nNot only did we beat them, but we absolutely mullered them, and in their own back yard to boot.\n\nNot once in that ninety minute performance were Newcastle in control of the game. This was Poyet’s gameplan at its finest, led and orchestrated by the debuting Liam Bridcutt at the base of Sunderland’s midfield.\n\nI imagine for mag supporters this was the most embarrassed that they’ve felt after a derby loss, because there could be no arguing with how the game played out. In truth, they were lucky we didn’t score five or six.\n\nIn my chat today with Gus he beamed with pride about that particular showing from his team – it was outstanding, and at the end of the game when he was left in the stadium he looked up at the Sunderland fans, understood what it meant to them to have played in the way we did, and was so unbelievably proud.",

    "description": "It was a memorable day for Sunderland AFC Striker Dave Halliday who scored four goals against Manchester United",
    "fullText": "Any day you win, score six goals, and beat Manchester United has to be seen as a good day out for a Sunderland AFC team, and this is exactly what they did on this day in 1926.\n\nIn the fantastic book The Absolute Record written by Rob Mason, Mike Gibson, and Barry Jackson, the season was labelled as a ‘Goal Feast’ as Sunderland crushed many sides by huge margins during this season as they went on to finish third.\n\nDespite the attacking exploits that Robert Kyle’s team displayed in this game, newspaper articles were not blown away by his Sunderland side. One report lamented that Sunderland ‘did nothing much of note’ during the entire first half whilst also labelling the game ‘vigorous with too much force used’ throughout the game.\n\nIn addition, another journalist said he was ‘not fooled’ by the Sunderland win in a game where they played ‘little good football’ throughout.\n\nKyle’s team appeared to play an industrious style of football which suited our centre-forward Dave Halliday more than it may have suited our more talented footballers such as Bob Kelly, who was said to be ‘completely unsuited to this type of football’.\n\nIndustrious or not, the team brought a huge second-half performance where the role of Billy Clunas was mentioned as an enormous turning point in the game. Clunas’ forceful efforts put Sunderland on the front foot in the second half, and it wasn’t long before the Manchester United rearguard crumbled under the attacking Sunderland play.\n\nThe first goal came from the aforementioned Halliday who headed home after a good cross from Billy Ellis put it on a plate for the striker. Minutes later, Bobby Gurney scored after a goalmouth scramble whilst Clunas made it three goals in ten minutes after a handball in the United box handed Sunderland a penalty.\n\nFrom this point onwards, reports suggested ‘it was all Sunderland penetrations’, and United seemed to fold rapidly; in a game which was deemed as one with ‘too much force’, it appeared United’s injuries caught up with them as the game progressed.\n\nLate on, Halliday added three more that gave him four goals for the afternoon and a huge win for his Sunderland team in front of a crowd of 15,385 at Roker Park.",

I’m by no means saying the derby will be a walk in the park, as they’re a good team and both the players and fans will be right up for the game.\n\nWe’ve made the Stadium of Light a fortress, one in which no opponent has defeated us so far during this Premier League season. We also have a terrific set of players who understand the importance of both this game and the season as a whole.\n\nAs the newly-promoted team, it would be easy to see us as the underdog against the Champions League-competing side, but I no longer see it that way.\n\nThey have weaknesses which I believe we can exploit and a brilliant atmosphere at the Stadium of Light combined with our aggression, belief and confidence could cause them some serious problems. By starting strongly, getting at them and defending resiliently, we’ll give ourselves a great chance of getting a good result.\n\nAll the abuse we’ve had to put up with from them during the last eight years has been building up. Our double relegation followed by heartbreaking final defeats and their triumph over us in the FA Cup in 2024 has given them enough ammunition to last for a long time, but since that fateful day at Wembley, everything has changed.\n\nThey’re scared. Regardless of how composed or unbothered they appear to be, it’s clear.\n\nOur brilliant start to the season and excellent squad of players has intimidated them, and I can almost guarantee they were hoping to see Noah Sadiki or Granit Xhaka pick up bookings against Manchester City. They’re worried that it’s no longer going to be an “easy six points” and this chance has been eight years in the making, so let’s get after them and take it.\n\nRegardless of the result on Sunday, the club is prospering and the city itself is responding correspondingly.\n\nWe’re in one of the best positions the club has ever been. We’ve had a magnificent season so far and I believe we can build on it this Sunday.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams enter Week 15 as the only NFC team that can clinch a playoff spot. A victory at Sofi Stadium on Sunday over Jared Goff's Detroit Lions will send Los Angeles to the postseason for the third consecutive year.\n\nThe Rams are aware Sunday's game holds serious playoff implications. However, they are approaching everything on a day-to-day basis. Head Coach Sean McVay is simply trying to win a football game.\n\n“We try to do everything in terms of being totally present,\" McVay said. Our focus and concentration are doing everything that we can to try to be able to win this game.”\n\nIf Los Angeles wants to punch their ticket to the postseason this week, it will require execution in all three phrases.\n\nThe Lions are coming off a 44-30 win over the Dallas Cowboys and sit just one game back of the No. 7 seed San Fransisco 49ers with just four weeks remaining. Detroit's No. 1 scoring offense in the NFL has been prolific, scoring 34 or more points in seven of its eight wins this season. Third-year running back Jahmyr Gibbs has backed up his breakout Sophomore season in 2024 with over 1500 total yards and 16 touchdowns in 13 games this season, proving to be one of the most feared playmakers in the NFL.\n\nSean McVay knows the effect Gibbs can have on a game.\n\n“I see as an explosive of a player as there is in this league,” McVay said. “Every single time he touches it, you're like, Oh my gosh, he might score.”\n\nDespite scoring a league-high 30.3 points per game, Detroit's offense hasn't been perfect.\n\nHead Coach Dan Campbell took the play-calling duties away from Offensive Coordinator John Morton after a home loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 9. Since taking over on the headset, Detroit has erupted for 44 points on two separate occasions but also produced its worst offensive output of the season in a 16–9 loss on Sunday Night Football in Philadelphia.\n\nDespite the change of play callers, McVay recognizes the dynamic ability the Detroit offense possesses.\n\n“Still an unbelievable offense, McVay said. \"There's a certain style of play that really comes to life when they're at their best. It's a real credit to their players and coaches.”\n\nMcVay credits his former quarterback Jared Goff on his ability to run the offense and control the game from the pocket.\n\n“You can see they give him a lot of things at the line of scrimmage like Mike point IDs, calling multiple plays and getting in and out of the right looks whether that be in the run game or in the pass game, unbelievable accuracy and anticipation.”\n\nWhile the Rams 3rd-ranked scoring defense will be tasked with limited Goff, Gibbs and company, Detroit will have to try to stop MVP-frontrunner Matthew Stafford.\n\nThe 37-year-old quarterback has been nearly impossible to stop in 2025. Stafford has completed 66.7% of his passes this year to go along with 3,354 yards and a league-high 35 passing touchdowns. Those statistics have him primed to secure his first MVP award in year 17. Stafford is grateful to just be in those discussions.\n\n“Just to be in the conversation is something that's humbling to me, Stafford said.”\n\nHis next step in bringing home the MVP award will be taking down his former team, which he spent the first 12 years of his career with.\n\n\"It's a really good, complete football team, Stafford said. \"It’ll be another challenge for us.”\n\nHis former squad will be without star defensive back Brian Branch, who suffered a season-ending torn Achilles tendon in last week against Dallas. Stafford says his absence will be something Detroit will have to account for.\n\n\"He’s a huge difference maker for them on the back end with his ability to cover receivers, cover tight ends, make plays in the run game and he’s great in zone coverage, Stafford said. \"I know that'll be something they'll have to adjust to and figure out.”\n\nA major contributor to Stafford's success this season has been Devante Adams, who signed a two-year, 46 million contract with Los Angeles in March 2025.\n\nThe two-time First-Team All-Pro wide receiver has been exactly what Stafford and Los Angeles hoped for when they inked him to the multi-year deal. Adams’ 14 receiving touchdowns lead the NFL by a five-touchdown margin, with three receivers behind him tied at nine.\n\nAdams expressed how Los Angeles has been everything he thought it would be.\n\n“It's honestly been exactly what I hoped it'd be, Adams said. \"I was just another piece to the puzzle and it's been fun being a part of a fun operation.”\n\nSunday's matchup will have the feeling of a playoff atmosphere with two teams looking to make a statement as the playoffs inch closer by the week.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James shows off insane athleticism at (almost) 41 years old with poster dunk originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers superstar forward LeBron James will turn 41 before the calendar flips from 2025 to 2026, but his athleticism is still off the charts. That athleticism was on full display during L.A.’s 132-119 loss to the San Antonio Spurs in an NBA Cup quarterfinal contest on Wednesday night.\n\nLate in the second quarter, James brought the ball across half court, beat his primary defender, drove into the paint, rose up and put Luke Kornet on the wrong side of a poster.\n\n\"OHHHH LEBRON JAMES... A FEROCIOUS FLUSH!\"\n\nABSOLUTE POSTER.\n\nAnd the block on the other end... tap to watch on Prime: https://t.co/7Xzi9OenaCpic.twitter.com/irV3nS4lEZ\n\nJames made sure to stare through Kornet's soul after posterizing him.\n\npic.twitter.com/HXWQhJY3vThttps://t.co/U4iUQpNhPn\n\n— Underdog NBA (@UnderdogNBA) December 11, 2025\n\nThat was (obviously) the highlight of the night for James, who finished the game with 19 points, 15 rebounds, 8 assists and 3 blocks in 36 minutes. His production wasn’t enough to lift the Lakers to victory though, so their dreams of becoming the first team ever to win the NBA Cup twice are now dashed.\n\nJames is one of the greatest athletes that the league has ever seen, and it’s nice for him to remind people that he can still get up every once in a while, even though he’s 23 seasons in. Opposing players clearly still have to think twice when it comes to challenging James at the rim.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland on Thursday night looking to extend a magnificent winning run.\n\nThey face FC Basel at St. Jakob-Park in the Europa League. Unai Emery’s side arrive in Basel brimming with confidence after a dramatic 2-1 victory over Premier League leaders Arsenal last weekend. This result extended their winning streak to seven matches across all competitions. The Villans currently sit joint-top of the Europa League standings with 12 points.\n\nThey aim to secure a top-eight finish. However, they face a formidable test against a Basel side that has turned St. Jakob-Park into a fortress. The Swiss outfit have won each of their last seven home Europa League matches. This is the longest current winning home run in the competition.\n\nDate: Thursday, 11 December 2025\n\nHead coach Ludovic Magnin will rely heavily on the experience of captain Xherdan Shaqiri. He has been instrumental this season with 11 goals and 10 assists. The former Liverpool man scored the opener in last weekend’s win over Winterthur and is expected to retain his place in attack. In midfield, Andrej Bacanin is likely to come into the starting XI to replace Marin Soticek. Moritz Broschinski is expected to lead the line. However, there are doubts over the availability of Kaio Eduardo due to injury.\n\nUnai Emery is expected to rotate his squad following the intense victory over Arsenal. Consequently, Matty Cash could be rested after scoring the opener against the Gunners. Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelöf, or the returning Andrés García are contending for the right-back slot. In attack, Donyell Malen is pushing to replace Ollie Watkins. Furthermore, Emiliano Buendía is in contention for a start after scoring the winner against Arsenal. Tyrone Mings and Ross Barkley remain sidelined.\n\nBasel enter this contest knowing their home form is their greatest asset. They are unbeaten in 10 European matches on home soil since 2015. Moreover, they have won five of their last 10 major European games against English opponents. Despite a rocky start to the league phase, they have found domestic rhythm recently. They have won back-to-back games in the Swiss Cup and Super League.\n\nVilla are enjoying a historic year in Europe. They have won eight of their last 10 major European matches. All eight wins came in 2025, which is a club record for a single calendar year. Their style under Emery has been distinct. Indeed, they have played the highest percentage of short passes of any team in the competition. History also favours the visitors as Villa triumphed when these sides met in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nBasel predicted XI: Hitz; Tsunemoto, Adjetey, Daniliuc, Schmid; Metinho, Bacanin; Shaqiri, Leroy, Otele; Broschinski\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Bizot; Bogarde, Lindelof, Torres, Digne; Kamara, Onana; Buendía, Tielemans, Rogers; Malen\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports. Coverage starts at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead- Mainoo preference abroad move over Premier League loan\n\nSee more- Saudi Pro League CEO endorses Mohamed Salah transfer\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

On Wednesday night, Moore was arrested and booked in the Washtenaw County Jail, according to online court records. The former Michigan head coach was initially detained by police in Saline, Michigan, for an investigation into potential charges, as reported by ESPN’s Dan Wetzel and Pete Thamel.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel announced that Moore was terminated, with cause, effective immediately. The shocking statement came after a University investigation that found credible evidence showing Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.\n\nFollowing the arrest, Pittsfield Charter Township released a statement on Wednesday night talking about the incident involving the former Michigan head coach. Moore wasn’t explicitly named due to the ongoing probe; however, the type of incident was revealed to be an “Assault Investigation.”\n\nAs of now, there are no pending charges for Moore, but it could change as the investigation progresses.

    "fullText": "As we head into another round of Premier League matches, attention turns to the players who can make the biggest impact.\n\nCaptaincy remains one of the most important decisions each week, and GW16 brings several exciting options to consider.\n\nPlenty of managers stick with the same trusted choices week after week, but this game week offers room for a wider mix. From the premium stars to reliable mid-priced players and a few bold picks, some options could deliver strong returns.\n\nWith so many possibilities, it’s worth taking a closer look at the leading captain options for GW16 and why they could make a real difference for your team.\n\nBukayo Saka is a strong captain option this week as Arsenal, who lead the Premier League with 33 points, take on a struggling Wolves side sitting at the bottom with just 2 points.\n\nHe has been in good form this season, scoring 4 goals and providing 1 assist. He also has a history of performing well against Wolves, having both scored and assisted in their last league meeting.\n\nWith this favorable fixture and his ability to create and finish chances, Saka looks set to deliver the attacking returns that make him a reliable choice for captaincy.\n\nFor managers looking for a player who can make a real impact, he stands out as one of the top options this game week.\n\nCalvin Bassey has been one of Fulham’s most consistent defenders this season. He has demonstrated strong defensive skills, making key interceptions and contributing to his team’s clean sheets on several occasions.\n\nEven though Fulham have struggled for a while now, they face a Burnley side that has had a difficult season, giving Bassey a good chance to keep another clean sheet.\n\nHis reliability at the back makes him a solid budget-friendly option who can still deliver points for managers.\n\nIgor Thiago has been one of Brentford’s most dangerous attacking players this season, scoring 11 goals, most of which have come from penalties.\n\nThis week, he faces Leeds United, who sit 16th in the Premier League, providing him with a favorable chance to add to his tally.\n\nWith his eye for goal and ability to take responsibility in crucial moments, Thiago could be an exciting option for managers considering the captain armband in GW16.\n\nDespite being blank in Manchester City’s 3‑0 win against Sunderland on Matchday 14, Haaland is still one of the most reliable FPL options and continues to be the captain pick for many managers each week.\n\nHis ability to score goals and make an impact on games makes him a top choice.\n\nThis week, Manchester City face Crystal Palace, who sit 4th in the table and are in good form.\n\nWith another favorable fixture, Haaland looks set to be a leading option for the captain’s armband in GW16, as he is always dangerous in attacking areas and can change a game with a single moment.\n\nOllie Watkins is showing signs of a strong comeback after a slow start to the season.\n\nWest Ham face an in-form Aston Villa, who have been unbeaten in most of their recent matches, and Watkins is likely to have plenty of chances to score or assist.\n\nWith his ability to influence the game in attack, he could also be considered as a captain option for GW16\n\nBryan Mbeumo could be an interesting captain pick this week. Bournemouth have struggled to defend set-pieces and have allowed the fourth-most shots from their left side this season, which gives Mbeumo a good chance to get involved in attack.\n\nWith Matheus Cunha back, Amad can return to the right, where he has a strong connection with Mbeumo. This link-up and the favorable fixture make him a solid option to score or assist in GW16.\n\nWho are you giving your captain armband to this week heading into Game Week 16? Will you go with a popular pick or try a differential option? Share your thoughts and let us know who will wear the armband in your team.",

    "description": "The Buffalo Bills were Super Bowl favourites but must win at the in-form New England Patriots to have a chance of stopping their divisional rivals winning the AFC East.",
    "fullText": "BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:45 GMT). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds of Detroit Lions v Los Angeles Rams on Sunday (from 21:00).\n\nThere are four weeks left in the NFL's regular season and I feel like every year we're saying this, but I don't think the league's ever been this contested.\n\nThere's been so many games where you cannot blink or take anything for granted. Some play-off spots won't be decided until week 18, so for so many teams, that final game will be incredibly meaningful.\n\nThe AFC East title could go down to the wire, but the Buffalo Bills will need to stop the New England Patriots' 10-game win streak when the divisional rivals meet at Foxborough this Sunday.\n\nThe Bills improved their record to 9-4 with a 39-34 win over the Bengals last Sunday, and it was just Josh Allen doing Josh Allen things again, especially in that fourth quarter. He just puts on his cape and make things happen. That's what makes the Bills so dangerous. He was last season's Most Valuable Player and he's a guy who can change the game and rally the troops around him.\n\nBuffalo had a rough spell but have won their past two. At this time of year, you've been able to have a true self-scout, so things are coming together for them, and last Sunday's win was huge. The Bills were on the edge of the AFC play-off rankings and now they've solidified themselves. If they win at the Patriots, who are 11-2, the Bills will be just one win back with three games left.\n\nNew England's schedule looks easier than Buffalo's though. The Patriots finish with Baltimore, the Jets and the Dolphins. The Bills go against the Browns, the Eagles and the Jets.\n\nThere's a high probability Buffalo won't win the AFC East for the first time in six years, and few expected New England to win the division after back-to-back four-win seasons.\n\nIn the past, there was an expectation with the Patriots because they had greatness. They had Tom Brady and had been winning for so long. Now there's straight excitement about current quarterback Drake Maye and what this team can do. They could clinch the AFC East on Sunday, which is huge for them.\n\nSometimes it's better when you're that team with no expectations, but the Patriots have Mike Vrabel as head coach. He won three Super Bowls with them as a player and he's brought in the right people. Josh McDaniels won six Super Bowls on the Patriots' coaching staff but wasn't successful as head coach of the Raiders. Vrabel pairing him as offensive coordinator with Maye has been so good though. McDaniels understands what it takes to win in the AFC East, to win in the cold and how to attack those teams.\n\nNew England had one of the easiest schedules this season, but you still have to win those games. Vrabel's been using the word 'champions' and I think all the guys are starting to believe in that championship mentality. I love how he also says 'no naps', like, you can't sleep on anybody and you've got to keep doing the right things. I think he's a great leader who's learned how to inspire from being in this situation as a player.\n\nThe Patriots were the ones that broke the Bills' undefeated start in week five and when you do that on the road, your team's going to walk away and think 'alright, we actually might have something here'. Then all these wins they've had is building more and more confidence.\n\nThe Patriots aren't outstanding in any one category, offensively or defensively, but Maye has been brilliant, especially as a second-year quarterback. He can run the ball and be a big threat with his legs, and his decision making has gotten so much better. He gets to the top of his drop and he's already kind of made his decision on where he wants to throw the ball, because he's reading the field so quickly.\n\nMaye's got the NFL's best pass completion percentage, only Matthew Stafford has a higher passer rating, and only Dak Prescott has more pass yards. Maye's thrown 23 touchdown passes versus six interceptions. In every game, he's had 200+ pass yards and that goes to show that, for the most part, he's made the right decisions. He's protecting the football, and he's using different weapons to throw to.\n\nEarly in the season, Stefon Diggs was pretty much the star of the show. That gave Maye confidence and now he's using a slew of different receivers. They were kind of identifying their roles and now they're elevating each other. Maye has also been doing it without Will Campbell on the offensive line the past few weeks.\n\nHe is very much in the MVP conversation, but Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has just been phenomenal. It's his 17th year in the league and this is probably his best season. He leads the league with 35 touchdowns, with just four interceptions.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Maye does this week against Buffalo and then Baltimore. There's the irony of playing the past two MVPs - Allen and Lamar Jackson - and some people might say that could determine whether Maye becomes this season's MVP.\n\nAllen's still breaking records and it's hard to watch that game on Sunday and not think 'wow, this guy is so different'. I mean, which other quarterback has a 40-yard touchdown run in the snow? But I don't know if they'd give him a back-to-back MVP. Last year made sense because of how he took care of the ball but this year he hasn't been as perfect.\n\nBuffalo have a rivalry with the Patriots and, after losing to them in October, I think the Bills understand the importance of Sunday's game and what it can mean to go into Foxborough and get the win. But this is going to be a challenge for their defence, for sure.\n\nWith the different offensive weapons the Patriots have through the air, I think the Bills' defence has to step up and force turnovers. You know it's going to be a Stefon Diggs game when his former team Buffalo is involved, so I think that Maye-Diggs connection is where the outcome lies.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

Later, he served as acting head coach during Jim Harbaugh’s suspensions during the 2023 season. Moore was the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach during Michigan’s victory over the Washington Huskies in the 2024 College Football Playoff National Championship in January 2024.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nAhead of the 2025 season, Moore was named head coach after Harbaugh left Michigan to coach the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nIn 2025, Michigan finished with a 9-3 record. Poggi will coach the team for the Dec. 31 Cheez-It Citrus Bowl against the University of Texas Longhorns.",

The win was crucial to Manchester City’s Champions League campaign as Pep Guardiola’s side consolidated their place in the top-eight of of the UEFA Champions League league phase table. There was a host of players for City who put in strong performances against Real Madrid. Perhaps the most impressive performance came from Nico O’Reilly at left-back. Manchester City’s young England international showed he is right at home on the biggest stage with a strong display in a crucial City win.\n\nLike his teammates, Nico O’Reilly wasn’t at his best in the opening half-hour of last night’s match. City dominated possession but they were too open at times as Real Madrid pressed City with a sense of urgency in the game’s opening half-hour. Nico O’Reilly had a difficult time at left-back against Rodrygo who opened the scoring last for Xabi Alonso’s side after 28 minutes. But from that point onwards, Nico O’Reilly and his team grew into the game. Come the final whistle Nico O’Reilly’s contribution to Manchester City’s win was immense on one of the biggest stages in European football.\n\nFirst of all, Nico O’Reilly scored Manchester City’s equaliser in the 35th minute. He reacted quickest to tap in past Thibaut Courtois after the Real Madrid keeper failed to deal with a Josko Gvardiol header from a Rayan Cherki corner. It was Nico O’Reilly’s run and cross into the penalty area that led to Antonio Rudiger’s foul on Erling Haaland which led to a spot kick for City. Erling Haaland converted the penalty to help his team overturn a 1-nil deficit and take a 2-1 lead into the interval. It would be a lead that City would hold onto come the final whistle. Nico O’Reilly was at the heart of Manchester City’s turnaround as he put in a display that showed that he is thriving on the big stage.\n\nWhat stands out in Nico O’Reilly’s game is his ability to remain undaunted by an opponent, a mistake or an occasion. The young England international wasn’t afraid of the challenge in front of him last night. More experienced players than Nico O’Reilly have crumbled under the pressure of facing Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. Nico O’Reilly isn’t a player who will join that list as he showed last night.\n\nSpeaking after his team’s win, Pep Guardiola had high praise for the ability of Nico O’Reilly to play without fear and put his mistakes in a match behind him. Speaking on Nico O’Reilly’s performance, Pep Guardiola said: “Now he is left back for England, for the national team, he has incredible pace and is so intelligent and makes mistakes, but he tries and that is top. Everyone makes mistakes. Sometimes you make a mistake because you are not courageous enough.”\n\nLike his team, Nico O’Reilly put a difficult opening half-hour behind him to help set Manchester City on their way to victory at the Bernabeu overnight. He played a crucial role in Manchester City’s important win as he played a critical role in both of his team’s goals. Just as important as Nico O’Reilly’s goal contributions was his ability to play undaunted by previous events that had unfolded in last night’s match. In the process Nico O’Reilly showed that he is made for the biggest stage as he continues to go from strength to strength as a player.",

The atmosphere in the team is very good every day, \"but it is an unusual situation.\"\n\nIt is now up to the players to change their behavior. \"We support Xabi Alonso 100 percent,\" said Rodrygo, adding: \"It is a difficult time for us and our coach. We stand behind him. So many lies are being spread.\"\n\nHe hugged Alonso after his goal because he knows it is a tough time for him as well. \"I wanted to show that we support our coach,\" said the Brazilian.\n\nAs 'Marca' reported shortly after the final whistle, Xabi Alonso is not to be dismissed.

Last week, it was Tampa Bay Buccaneers punter Riley Dixon who earned NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors for Week 13. For Week 14, it is Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua. He was named the Week 14 NFC Offensive Player of the Week.\n\nNacua had seven receptions for 167 yards and two touchdowns in the Rams' 45-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nHis 167 receiving (and scrimmage) yards in Week 14 led the NFL.\n\nIt was the fifth time in his career he has had at least 160 receiving yards and a touchdown. Sunday's game was his first in the NFL in which he scored two touchdowns.\n\nIt is his second player of the week award this season and third in his career. He earned it earlier this season for his 13 catches for 170 yards and a touchdown in Week 4 in a 27-20 win over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe Cardinals will have to face Nacua again in Week 18.\n\nNacua has a league-leading 93 receptions through 14 weeks with 1,186 receiving yards and six touchdowns.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Three rotations of the clock hands – that's how little time Real's Rodrygo had left before becoming the forward who went the longest without scoring in the entire history of the Royal club. An inglorious record, and he will be glad not to have broken it.\n\nThe Brazilian had been waiting for a goal for 31 (!) games – although this season he was repeatedly benched by his shaky coach Xabi Alonso.\n\nHe ended this negative streak yesterday in the Champions League match against Manchester City, when he scored in the 28th minute with a remarkable shot from a sharp angle after a pass from Jude Bellingham. Thus, he narrowly escaped the negative club record – but was still not the hero of the evening who saved Alonso's job.\n\nCity turned the game around before halftime, and in the end, the Royals lost 1-2 in their own stadium.\n\nWhether this comforts him or not is anyone's guess – after all, Rodrygo received personal praise from Pep Guardiola after the final whistle, who said: “I went up to him and told him how good he is.

Curry is expected to play when the Warriors host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night.\n\n\"It's looking good,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of Curry's return, via ESPN.\n\nCurry has missed Golden State's last five games after suffering the injury in a game against the Houston Rockets on Nov. 26. The Warriors went 3-2 in those games, and they currently sit eighth in the Western Conference standings with a record of 13-12. Credit to the rest of the roster for keeping the team afloat in Curry's absence.\n\nOther NBA news: LeBron James shows off insane athleticism at (almost) 41 years old with poster dunk\n\nCurry's return should help Golden State's hopes of climbing up the standings in the West. The two-time MVP is in the midst of another stellar season for the Warriors. He's averaging 27.9 points, 4.0 assists, 3.7 rebounds and 1.3 steals per performance while shooting 47 percent from the floor and 39 percent from long range.\n\nThe game against the Timberwolves on Friday night will be a rematch of the Western Conference semifinals from last season. Minnesota bested Golden State 4-1 in that series to move on to the conference finals. It will be the first of three meetings between the two teams on the season. They'll meet two more times in late January.  Both of those games will take place in Minnesota.",

    "description": "A bad start, a strong fight-back, and a late slip sees the FC Bayern Frauen drop points in the UWCL.",
    "fullText": "Bayern Munich drew 2-2 on the road against Atlético Madrid on Wednesday in a UEFA Women’s Champions League match that leaves them sixth in the standings after five matchdays, level on points with Juventus and Real Madrid but behind in goal differential.\n\nBarcelona, Lyon, and Chelsea lead the pack; only the first four teams qualify automatically to the quarterfinals.\n\nIn Madrid, Bayern looked the stronger side, but got off to a horrendous start. Glódís Perla Viggósdóttir was called for a penalty for what looked to be fairly incidental contact with her elbow as she jostled with an attacker in the box, and the visitors found themselves in a hole inside of 15 minutes as a result.\n\nThe fight-back was there, though, and though the half ended 1-0 it eventually paid dividends. Klara Bühl connected with Pernille Harder twice, two stars of the game flexing their muscle for FC Bayern. The first saw Harder turn nimbly and fire into the net (off a deflection) with three defenders closing in in front of her. The second was typical Bühl, marauding down the left flank to receive a ball in acres of space somehow, jinking past her marker and fizzing a ball across the face of goal for Harder to latch onto.\n\nThis after Bayern earned their own penalty at the start of the second half, back when the score was still 1-0, and Giulia Gwinn blazed over the bar. The chance to make this more decisive, while Bayern held the upper hand, was there.\n\nGwinn’s penalty miss would prove costly, and so would Bayern’s loosening grip on the game. After Harder’s 78th-minute would-be winner, the Bavarians found themselves pinned back as they tried to secure the win. There were seven players deep in Bayern’s box when Atlético winger Luany cut back to the top of the 18, where Fiamma Benítez arrived, unmarked and un-hassled, to hit a thundering strike that banked in off the inside of the crossbar.\n\nFCBayern.com captured player and coach reactions after the match.\n\nSaid head coach José Barcala: “The early goal against us certainly had an emotional impact, but we reacted well. We were very dominant and pushed the opponent deep into their own half. But Atlético was very compact between the lines and made it very difficult for us. After halftime, we shifted the game more to the flanks and turned the game around. Unfortunately, after taking the lead, we allowed too much space and conceded another goal.”\n\n“Disappointed, but learning from this game,” added midfielder Arianna Caruso.\n\nThe Frauen are back in action on Sunday against Hamburger SV — also their next DFB-Pokal opponents, though this time it is a league match. Then it’s back to the Champions League with a home match against Vålerenga next week, before finishing off the first half of the season at Leverkusen.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

It's a fun, addictive, accessible and easy sport to play,\" she says.\n\n\"When I started playing, I had a back injury, but that didn't even prevent me from playing.\n\n\"It's a great sport for those who aren't entirely mobile.

    "fullText": "Liverpool have been reeling over the last few days due to the fallout of Mo Salah’s stunning interview.\n\nOn Saturday - following the club’s 3-3 draw against Leeds at Elland Road - the Egyptian King ripped into Arne Slot after three consecutive games on the bench.\n\nThe upshot of that interview was that the 33-year-old was dropped from the squad to face Inter in the Champions League on Wednesday. Salah could well be edging closer to the Anfield exit and there is major interest in him once again from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThere remains the possibility that Salah has ALREADY played his final game for Liverpool - which would represent a sad and bitter end to one of the greatest Reds’ careers of modern times.\n\nHe flies to the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt next week and Salah could well find himself working under new employers by the time the Pharaohs campaign concludes in January.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nTalk would then turn towards which players might come into Anfield to replace Salah - and we’ve already seen the likes of Michael Olise and Antoine Semenyo linked.\n\nBut Salah may well miss out this weekend in the Premier League versus Brighton and there are several games to cover before the January window opens.\n\nThat means a player from within the ranks is going to need to step up. Attacking options are at a premium right now - with Federico Chiesa and Cody Gakpo also absent - and Arne Slot has taken to using Dominik Szoboszlai in the right-sided midfield position.\n\nIf the Dutchman decides to end that arrangement this weekend then it paves the way for a return to action for Jeremie Frimpong.\n\nEarmarked as a potential Trent Alexander-Arnold replacement when he signed from Bayer Leverkusen over the summer, the £29.5m man is actually more comfortable on the right side of midfield or even as a winger.\n\nWith Joe Gomez holding his own at right-back and Conor Bradley suspended, the 25-year-old may well be used in a more advanced position following his recovery from injury.\n\nFrimpong hasn’t played since the game against Eintracht Frankfurt in October - with Arne Slot stating that his injury timeline looked similar to Bradley’s.\n\nThe Northern Ireland captain returned to the fray at Elland Road - suggesting that Frimpong won’t be far behind.\n\nLiverpool need to see the best of Frimpong soon - starting this weekend if he is fit - as he will be expected to showcase his credentials as a Salah stand-in while the two-time African footballer of the year is at Afcon.",

The loss snapped a six-game skid for Seattle, while Los Angeles saw its win streak end at two.\n\nVince Dunn delivered the dagger in the extra period, scoring the second straight unanswered goal for Seattle to seal a dramatic comeback.

Three more meetings remain for the two sides this season, with the next two taking place at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nWith the quick two-game road trip in the books, Los Angeles will return home to host the Calgary Flames on Saturday night. Despite an overall slow start to the season (second to last in the Pacific Division), Calgary has won three of its last four to pick up some momentum.\n\nPuck drop is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. PT.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City came from a goal down last night to beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Bernabeu. The performance wasn’t a vintage City display by any stretch. They did suffer at times against Xabi Alonso’s side. But they overcame those moments to leave the Bernabeu with a valuable three points to aid their Champions League campaign. Pep Guardiola’s side displayed another side of their armoury that has formed the backbone of Manchester City’s recent era of dominance. City’s resilience and character stood out at the Bernabeu and it helped City pick up a huge win in Madrid.\n\nIt isn’t a stretch to say that Manchester City were up against it in the opening half-hour of last night’s match. Real Madrid were up for the occasion as were their fans. The atmosphere was hostile and the pressure and atmosphere went up a gear when Rodrygo opened the scoring in the 28th minute for Xabi Alonso’s side. Manchester City know all too well what can happen in the eye of the proverbial storm at the Bernabeu. But City weathered that storm to score two goals before halftime through Nico O’Reilly and Erling Haaland to take a 2-1 lead. Pep Guardiola’s side would hold onto that lead to leave Spain with a crucial win. What stood out was that Manchester City’s character and resilience played a big part in their win.\n\nCity rode out the wave so to speak throughout last night’s match. As Real Madrid pressed for an equaliser in the second half City stood tall as a collective to keep Madrid out. Pep Guardiola’s side were fortunate that an Endrick header hit the bar late on and several other Real Madrid chances came to nothing. Last night’s win won’t be remembered as a vintage City win. But to come away from the Bernabeu with a victory where Manchester City’s resilience and character formed the backbone of their victory could prove to be invaluable as this City team grows together.\n\nAny win over Real Madrid at the Bernabeu doesn’t come easy. Pep Guardiola said as much after last night’s match. Speaking on his team’s win, Guardiola acknowledged that his team still has growing to do as a team. But he acknowledged the importance of winning at the Bernabeu. Speaking on his team’s win over Real Madrid, Guardiola said: “Winning in the Bernabeu is a big big task, really big task, especially in this competition, don’t misunderstand me.”\n\n“But at the same time in February, March we are able to go through the level to arrive in semi-finals, finals, requires a better performance than today. It is not enough to be there.”\n\n“There are many good things, I am so pleased for the players for the effort, soul and heart and how they run but here and Anfield and PSG, Dortmund, Arsenal, Barcelona, knowing the players we will be better. We will improve, that’s for sure.”\n\nErling Haaland believes that last night’s win was an important win for his team. He explained: “This win is really important. It’s difficult to come here. It’s a tough place to come.”\n\n“We could have added another goal but the game was a bit chaotic.”\n\n“It’s a nice place to play. Look at this place it’s incredible. These are the games we want to play. In this format, we get to play more games which is nice. And I like it. In the end, we’re super happy.”\n\nLastly, Nico O’Reilly added that Manchester City’s character helped them come from behind to beat Real Madrid. O’Reilly told the media: “Everyone wanted to get on the ball, everyone wanted to play. I’d say there was a lot of character out there tonight. I think that’s what got us over the line. We knew we could get goals back, so that wasn’t the problem.”\n\n“We just had to stay focused, not be scared by the environment and the counter attacks they were causing. And that was it.”\n\n“We’re all on a high right now. We need to keep pushing and keep going.”\n\nManchester City showed their character and resilience to come from a goal down to beat Real Madrid last night. It isn’t a stretch to say that Manchester City’s win at the Bernabeu was their biggest away result of the season. It takes time for a team to build the character and resilience needed to go to a hostile environment and leave with an important victory. Pep Guardiola’s side is building those aspects of their makeup and their character and resilience could carry them a long way if it continues to grow.",

    "fullText": "Napoli chief Giovanni Manna was pressed on a potential move for Kobbie Mainoo in 2026, and he couldn’t rule it out.\n\nThe reigning Serie A champions have continued to be linked with Manchester United’s young starlet ever since he privately expressed his desire to leave on loan at the end of the summer window.\n\n(Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nNothing materialised from Mainoo’s requests, as United stepped in to block the move and encourage him to stay and fight for his role. He did so, but has continued to be utilised sparingly by Ruben Amorim, and is still awaiting his first Premier League start of 2025/2026.\n\nAmorim has previously suggested the club would not facilitate any mid-season departures to first-team players due to the partially depleted squad he’ll have when the African Cup of Nations gets underway.\n\nHowever, would there really be any justification for keeping Mainoo around if he’s going to spend the majority of the campaign watching on from the sidelines?\n\nIt’s certainly a situation Napoli will take a look at, too.\n\nAntonio Conte is navigating a lengthy absentee list heading into the festive period; he was without Kevin De Bruyne, Billy Gilmour and Stanislav Lobotka – amongst others – for last night’s Champions League clash with Benfica.\n\n(Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nA loan would perhaps suit all parties involved, as it’s thought the 20-year-old, hailed as ‘fantastic’ by ex-teammate Victor Lindelof, is reluctant to fully cut ties with his boyhood club just yet, while Napoli are unlikely to be able to afford him in the winter.\n\n“He is a player who has been linked to Napoli since August, also for his age, his potential, and the transfer opportunity,” said the Naples outfit’s sporting director Manna, as relayed by Football Italia.\n\n“This team is doing well. It is consolidated. We have some important absences right now, but sooner or later, the lads will return, strong and determined.\n\n“We have to make the right evaluations, so we’ll see how things progress along the way.”",

    "title": "Pando (Tree)",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Pando (from Latin pando 'I spread')[1] is the name of a quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone located in Sevier County, Utah, United States, in the Fishlake National Forest. A male clonal organism, Pando has an estimated 47,000 stems (ramets) that appear to be individual trees but are genetical identical parts of a single tree connected by a root system that spans 42.8 ha (106 acres). As a multi-stem tree, Pando is the world's largest tree by measures of weight, landmass and species.[2]\n\nSystems of classification used to define large trees vary considerably, leading to some confusion about Pando's status. Within the United States, the Official Register of Champion Trees defines the largest trees in a species-specific way; in this case, Pando is the largest aspen tree (Populus tremuloides). In forestry, the largest trees are measured by the greatest volume of a single stem, regardless of species. In that case, the General Sherman Tree is the largest unitary (single-stem) tree. While many emphasize that Pando is the largest clonal organism, other large trees, including Redwoods can also reproduce via cloning. Pando being the heaviest tree and the largest tree by landmass, while also being the largest aspen clone, leaves the Pando Tree in a class of its own.\n\nSince the early 2000s, little information has been adequately corroborated about Pando's origins and how its genetic integrity has been sustained over a long period of time, conservatively between 9,000 and 16,000 years old-by the latest (2024) estimate.[3] Researchers have argued that Pando's future is uncertain due to a combination of factors including drought, cattle grazing, and fire suppression.[4][5] In terms of drought, Pando's long-lived nature suggests it has survived droughts that have driven out human societies for centuries at a time. In terms of grazing, a majority of Pando's land mass is fenced for permanent protection and management as a unique tree. Cattle grazing ended in Pando in 2024, but previously, was permitted on a volume basis for 10 days a year in October, weather permitting, in a small edge of Pando's southeastern expanse. Additionally, between 2015 and 2022, the local grazers group, 7-Mile Grazers Association, who rely on Pando's forage and biomass to sustain the landscape, signed off on a long-term protection plan working with Fishlake National Forest and Friends of Pando, and also wrote letters of support for the \"Pando Protection Plan\", a plan to bring nearly 34 hectares (84 acres) of the tree into protective care. In terms of fire suppression, research indicates[6] Pando has survived fires that would have likely leveled the tree many times, after which Pando regenerated itself from the root system. The same research also indicates large-scale fire events are infrequent, which may be owed to the fact that aspen are water-heavy trees and thus, naturally fire resistant, earning them the name \"asbestos forests\" among wildfire scientists.[7] Concerns aside, there is a broad consensus that wildlife controls to protect Pando from overbrowsing by deer and elk are critical to the Pando's Tree's sustainability and care. Protection systems coupled with ongoing monitoring and restoration efforts have been shown to be effective dating back to the late 1980s and early 1990s, with new projects under way.[8]\n\nFriends of Pando[9] and the Fishlake National Forest partners to study and protect the Pando Tree working alongside Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.[10] Notable organizations that also study and advocate to protect Pando's care include Western Aspen Alliance[11] and Grand Canyon Trust.[12]\n\nThe Pando tree was identified in 1976 by Jerry Kemperman and Burton V. Barnes.[13][14] A posthumous biography by Barnes' colleague, Daniel Kashian,[15] details Pando's discovery:\n\nAs a part of his aspen work in the West, Burt began to examine an extremely large trembling aspen clone southwest of Fish Lake, Utah, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Using aerial photography and the same morphological differentiation\ntechniques he developed for aspen at UMBS for his dissertation, Burt concluded that the aspen forest that covered about 106 acres was a single aspen clone, quite possibly the \"world's largest organism.\" Other than a single publication about aspen clone size and another great story to tell his students, Burt's studies on the Fish Lake clone were relatively obscure.\n\n— Daniel M. Kashian, Burton V. Barnes (1930–2014)\n\nWork by Fishlake National Forest to understand and protect the tree began in 1987, according to interviews and articles written by Fishlake Forest as well as accounts gathered by Friends of Pando.[16] Based on Barnes and Kempermans's 1976 paper noting Pando's discovery, Michael Grant, Jeffrey Mitton, and Yan Linhart of the University of Colorado at Boulder re-examined the clone in 1992 and described Pando as a single male aspen clone based on its morphological characteristics such as pollen production, leaves, and root structure. Michael Grant named the tree \"Pando\" which is Latin for \"I spread\" in an editorial which was later published in Discover Magazine.[17] A large-scale genetic sampling and analysis was published in 2008 by Jennifer DeWoody, Karen Mock, Valerie Hipkins, and Carol Rowe.[18] The research team's genetic study confirmed morphological analysis by Barnes and Kemperman as well as Mitton, Grant and Linhart thus, verifying Pando's size and scale of operation.\n\nIn late 1987, Fishlake National Forest began work to remove diseased trees and promote new growth using coppicing (a form of mechanical stimulation),[19] which works by removing diseased stems, that in turn, stimulates a regenerative hormone response which spurs new growth.[20] In 1993, Fishlake National Forest began work on the \"Aspen Regeneration Project\",[16] installing fences to help control deer and elk who threatened to destroy the productive results of work to spur and protect new growth. Today, approximately 84 acres of Pando is protected by 8-foot wildlife controls, which work to control populations of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus canadensis), and to control human uses, such as off-road recreation and formerly permitted grazing by domestic cattle (Bos taurus). Additional fencing protections were added in 2025 bringing approximately 80% of Pando's landmass into protective care while also creating two simplified wildlife management bulwarks to move animals around the tree's landmass.[21]\n\nHistorically, regeneration rates in portions of the \"Aspen Regeneration Project\" which started in the 1990s, showed promise based on photographic evidence and repeated survey plots by land managers, scientists and conservation groups between 1993 and today.[22] Despite this, many have argued more work needs to be done to control wildlife, as the Pando Tree is surrounded by 700 square miles of de facto wildlife preserve managed by people, groups and agencies who do not have Pando's sustainability as a central concern in their land management policies. Paul Rogers and Darren McAvoy of Utah State University completed an assessment of Pando's status in 2018 and stressed the importance of reducing herbivory by mule deer and elk as critical to conserving Pando.[5] In 2019, Rogers and Jan Šebesta surveyed other vegetation within Pando besides aspen, finding additional support for their 2018 conclusions and found that interactions between browsing and management strategy may have had adverse effects on Pando's long-term resilience to change.[23] In 2023, a team of researchers, land managers, wildlife biologists and citizen scientists groups began long-term programs to monitor deer and elk using GPS collars and wildlife cameras to better understand wildlife.[24] In 2022, Executive Order 14702 directed the US Forest Service to inventory old growth and mature forest as part of a plan to protect mature and old growth forest. Data submitted by Fishlake National Forest defined Pando's landmass as \"mature,\" meaning it could be eligible for special care and protections. [25]\n\nBetween 2015 and 2022, Fishlake National Forest, Pando's federal land stewards, developed a plan and gathered public feedback for work to expand wildlife controls and protections of the Pando Tree as part of the Fishlake Basin Recreation Improvement Plan.[26] Work to develop the plan involved gathering formal and informal feedback from community, regional, and state organizations in Land Management, Agriculture, Conservation, and Recreation between 2015 and 2019, followed by a public comment period which ran from March 2021 through March 2022. The plan was approved in June 2022 by Fishlake National Forest Supervisor Michael Elson. In 2023, Friends of Pando worked to gather letters of support for the plan and was invited by Representative Carl Albrecht[27] to give a brief presentation about the plan to the Utah Legislature.(PDF of Presentation)[28] Based on recommendations and community support, Representative Albrecht secured a $250,000 allocation for the Utah Department of Transportation to develop plans and contract work to expand wildlife controls to bring the majority of Pando's landmass into protective care.[29] Between May 2024 and September 2024, Friends of Pando and community organizations worked to organize a series of talks and meetings to finalize the plan.[30] Based on wildlife behavior data gathered by Friends of Pando, Fishlake National Forest and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources[31] the final plan was mapped to maximize wildlife management in and around the tree. Work was completed in September of 2025[32].\n\nMost agree, based on Barnes' work and later work, that Pando encompasses 42.89 hectares (106 acres), weighs an estimated 6,000 metric tons (6,600 short tons) or 13.2 million pounds, and features an estimated 47,000 stems, which die individually and are replaced by genetically identical stems that are sent up from the tree's vast root system, a process known as \"suckering\".[2][33] The root system is estimated to be several thousand years old, with habitat modeling suggesting a maximum age of 14,000 years[34][35] and 16,000 years by the latest (2024) estimate.[3] Individual stems do not typically live more than 100–130 years. Pando's landmass spreads from 2,700 m (8,900 ft) above sea level to approximately 2,773 m (9,098 ft) above sea level along the western side of a steep basin wall.[36]\n\nMitton and Grant summarize the development of stems in aspen clones:[37]\n\n... quaking aspen regularly reproduces via a process called suckering. An individual stem can send out lateral roots that, under the right conditions, send up other erect stems; from all above-ground appearances the new stems look just like individual trees. The process is repeated until a whole stand, of what appear to be individual trees, forms. This collection of multiple stems, called ramets, all form one, single, genetic individual, usually termed a clone.\n\nDue to the progressive replacement of stems and roots, the overall age of an aspen clone cannot be determined from tree rings. Speculations on Pando's age have ranged between 80,000 and 1 million years.[37] Many news sources list Pando's age as 80,000 years, but this claim derives from a now-removed National Park Service web page, which redacted that claim in 2023 and was inconsistent with the Forest Service's post ice-age estimate.[38] Glaciers repeatedly formed on the Fish Lake Plateau[39] over the past several hundred thousand years and the mountains above Pando's landmass were crowned by glaciers as recently as the last glacial maximum.[40] Ages greater than approximately 16,000 years therefore require Pando to have survived climate conditions during the Pinedale glaciation, something that appears unlikely under current estimates of Pando's age and modeling of variations in local climate.[34][35] A 2017 paper by Chen Ding et al. seems to support US Forest Service claims that Pando could not be older than the last Glacial Maximum in the area based on paleo-climate models and genetic traits of aspen sites throughout North America.[41] A 2024 paper indicates the age could be between 16,000 and 80,000 years based on the first somatic mutation model of the tree, but, that research did not complete peer review and also relies on older material and testing methods. Thus, charcoal studies published in 2022 place the lower end of Pando's potential age range at around 9,000 years, while the somatic mutation models' most conservative estimate of 16,000 years of age awaits replication using new material and methods. In addition, any new age claims will need to square their results with climate models to prove conditions were favorable to the Pando seed being able to germinate and establish itself.\n\nEstimates of Pando's age have also been influenced by changes in the understanding of the establishment of aspen clones in western North America. Earlier sources argued that germination and successful establishment of aspen on new sites were rare in the last 10,000 years, and that Pando's root system was therefore likely greater than 10,000 years old.[37] More recent observations, however, have shown seedling establishment of new aspen clones is a regular occurrence and can be abundant on sites exposed by wildfire.[42] These findings are summarized in the U.S. Forest Service's Fire Effects Information System:[43]\n\n(Charles) Kay documented post-fire quaking aspen seedling establishment following 1986 and 1988 fires in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, respectively. He found seedlings were concentrated in kettles and other topographic depressions, seeps, springs, lake margins, and burnt-out riparian zones. A few seedlings were widely scattered throughout the burns. In Grand Teton National Park, establishment was greatest (950–2,700 seedlings/ha) in 1989, a wet year, but hundreds to thousands of seedlings established each year despite drought conditions in 1986–1988 and 1990–1991. Seedlings surviving past one season occurred almost exclusively on severely burned surfaces.",

    "description": "There are roughly three classes of language features: Features that the language is effectively designed around, such that you can't add it after the fact....",
    "fullText": "There are roughly three classes of language features:\n\nMost PLT and language design work is focused around (1) and (2), because those are the most important, but I have a deep fondness for (3)-type features. Because they're so minor, they're the most likely to spread between languages, since the overhead of adding them is so small. Since I spend a lot of time in niche obscure languages, I also encounter a lot of cool QoL features that most people might not have seen before. Here's a few of them!\n\nThere's lot of small things we can do to make working with numbers easier. The first is adding a separator, as lots of languages already do. Instead of writing 10000500, you can write 10_000_500, or 1_00_00_500 if you're Indian. You can also do 1e3 instead of 1000.\n\nFor more interesting number QoLs, we can look at J. In science and math you sometimes get equations with powers and roots of π. J has the standardized number format {x}p{y} for xπ^y. For example, you can write 5*sqrt(π) as 5p0.5. There's also x for powers of e and r for exact rational numbers ((2r3 + 1) = 5r3).\n\nIn Lua you can write raw, multiline strings with [[]]:\n\nMost languages have multiline literals, but what makes the Lua version great is that the beginning and ending marks are different characters. This solves the infuriating \"unnestable quotes\" problem string literals have, and you don't have to escape all your literal \\s. My neovim has the string [[\\\\]] to literally mean the string \\\\. With escaping that'd be \"\\\\\\\\\" or something, ick.\n\nI saw this in Noulith and immediately fell in love:\n\nEver wanted to write x max= y while searching for some maximum value in some complicated loop? You can do that here. You can do it with literally any function.\n\nIn other words, x max= y ⇔ x = max(x, y). It should conceivably be extendible to things like text sub= (regex, replacement), which would cover a lot of small munging and plumbing work I'd need to do.\n\nChapel is a language for high-performance computing, where you need to run really fast algorithms across hundreds or thousands of processors. It's got a ton of (1) and (2)-type features I've never seen anywhere else, and I find the language incredibly interesting. Even not knowing it, there's a few QoL things I found in the docs that I now want in other languages.\n\nFirst, there's the config keyword. If you write config var n=1, the compiler will automatically add a --n flag to the binary. As someone who 1) loves having configurable program, and 2) hates wrangling CLI libraries, a quick-and-dirty way to add single-variable flags seems like an obvious win.\n\nSecond, you can write the sequence 1, 2, … n-1 as 1..<n. It's an elegant extension to the standard .. operator languages like Ruby and TLA+ use.\n\nThird— and this is one is a lot more arguable— you have \"promotion\", a sort of automatic type lifting. The gist of it is that if you have a function of type a -> a, Chapel lets you call it with arrays, too, returning a mapped array. So if f(x) = 2*x, then f([1, 2, 3]) = [2, 4, 6]. This is completely type-safe, too. You can get the same effect in other languages with a lift or a map, but it's a nice QoL to make it native.\n\n(Chapel has an extra flex here: it automatically parallelizes the computation. That's definitely outside of (3) territory, though).\n\nThese are just a few of the cool features in Chapel, and I'm not even touching the really fundamental things. I enthusiastically recommend anybody interested in PLT or scientific computing to check it out.\n\nFrink has special syntax for date values. You can write # 2001-08-12 # to mean the date 2001-08-12, instead of writing something annoying like Date(2001, 8, 12) and having a bug because months (but not days) start at 0.\n\nPowershell functions can have an explicit Param block where you define attributes for each function parameter, like default values, help docs, validation constraints, etc. So instead of writing fun f(str path = \"/\", int x), you can write something like (in pseudocode)\n\nNow this makes a lot more sense for a shell language, where you want lots of optional flags, switches, and aliases, but I can see it being really useful in a compiled language too. For one, it makes adding variable-level contracts easier. Second, what if parameter blocks were abstractable? If you look at something like numpy functions, so many of them share the exact same parameter definitions. What if you could write def log(standard-exp-params) instead of having to write them out every single time?\n\nAs seen in most lisps. Instead of naming things two_words or TwoWords, you can use the name two-words. It's easier to write and easier to read. Of course the reason why nonlisps can't do that is because they have infix minus, and it's ambiguous whether x-y is the expression x minus y or the invocation of the x-y function. Seems like a bad tradeoff, though. How often do you use -, and how often do you write multiword functions? Just say that x-y is always a function, and if you want math you can use spaces like the rest of us.\n\n(Granted this couldn't be added to existing languages without breaking everything, but maybe worth considering if you're making a new language?)\n\nRuby has a special data type called a symbol, written like :this.1 A symbol compares equal to itself and has no other functionality. It replaces single-word strings— instead of writing dict[\"employee_id\"], you write dict[:employee_id].\n\nThe advantage of having symbols is that it makes strings easier to work with. In most languages, strings are used to represent a lot of different things: tokens, text, structured data, code, etc. If you see the string \"book\", it's not clear without context whether it's a dictionary key, or a text field with just \"book\" in it, or a trivial CSV, or what. With symbols, you can at least rule it out the former case, because then it'd instead be :book.\n\nAs seen in D's unit-test blocks on functions and P's monitors. While it makes sense to keep the actual testing as library code, testing is so universal in larger software projects that it sounds nice to give it syntactic support.\n\nAnyway I don't think adding these to arbitrary languages would be easy or have no downstream impacts, but they all at least seem more orthogonal to existing language semantics than type-(2) features, which are often back-added (for lots of good benefits). So they'd more easily to spread across languages. Except kebab-case. We live in a fallen world.\n\nThis was sent as part of an email newsletter; you can Common topics are software history, formal methods, the theory of software engineering, and silly research dives. Updates are every week. I also have a website where I put my polished writing (the newsletter is more for off-the-cuff stuff).\n\nSymbols come from lisps, but I encountered them in Ruby first. ↩",

    "fullText": "Palantir and the US Navy have signed a two-year deal to test whether its Foundry operational software can streamline the nation’s shipbuilding efforts and steer the Secretary of the Navy's top budget priority into port.\n\nThe $448 million contract will bring Palantir’s technology to work on shipbuilders, shipyards, and critical suppliers, said US Secretary of the Navy John Phelan and Palantir CEO Alex Karp during a presentation Tuesday evening in Washington, D.C. The company is calling this particular program \"ShipOS.\"\n\n“Every ship builder who partners with us will have AI power tools that optimize their work in real time. Every supplier in the network will be connected through intelligent logistics,” Phelan said on stage, according to US Naval Institute News. “Every program manager will have unprecedented visibility into schedule, cost and risk. We’re not just building ships faster. We’re rebuilding American maritime industrial capacity for the AI age.”\n\nPhelan listed strengthening US shipbuilding and the Maritime Industrial Base as the top priority of his $292.2 billion budget request for 2026, which called for 19 new battle force ships. The budget also invests $2.5 billion just for submarine builders to increase their \"health and supply chain enterprise.\"\n\nPalantir’s software will initially be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three shipyards, and 100 suppliers, all of which are part of the Maritime Industrial Base (MIB), a Navy program established in 2024 to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair. Palantir previously announced a deal with MIB to use its Warp Speed manufacturing software in July.\n\nThat early work resulted in leaps in efficiency, according to a press release. At General Dynamics Electric Boat – which designs, builds, repairs and modernizes nuclear submarines for the U.S. Navy – submarine schedule planning was reduced from 160 manual hours to under 10 minutes. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard cut material review times from weeks to under one hour.\n\nIn order to win more business, Palantir must deliver “measurable cost savings over time, improved schedules, reduced delays, and increased production efficiency, with productivity gains offsetting the initial investment while establishing a more capable and resilient industrial base,” according to the announcement.\n\nPalantir’s head of defense Mike Gallagher told reporters at Tuesday’s event that it was now up to the software company to deliver the operational gains it has promised, according to Breaking Defense.\n\n“We have to prove the value,” he said. “And then at the end of the two-year program, the companies, if we push ourselves, will take on the sustainment costs.”\n\nOnce it's running, Foundry will aggregate data from enterprise resource planning systems, legacy databases, and operational sources to identify bottlenecks, streamline engineering workflows, and support proactive risk mitigation, the announcement stated.\n\n“This is another watershed deal for Palantir on the Foundry platform,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told El Reg. “Big step forward. We believe Palantir will be able to do this at scale.” ®",

    "fullText": "The familiar life horizon has been outgrown: the old concepts, ideals, and emotional patterns no longer fit; the time for the passing of a threshold is at hand.\n\nApproaching a threshold is akin to stepping through a portal; An opening of a new and previously inaccessible path. It’s more than mere change, thresholds imply that transformation has taken place.\n\nArt is long, life short, judgment difficult, opportunity transient. To act is easy, to think is hard; to act according to our thought is troublesome. Every beginning is cheerful: the threshold is the place of expectation.\n\nSome individuals in this world will arrive at these thresholds. These points, any one person can arrive at, but not all will. Once passed, we can never return. For there is no unchanged point we could ever possibly return to, as we hurtle through time and space perhaps it would be wise to take pause at such thresholds. To truly take stock of the era we are entering and to notice how some boundaries once crossed, will never again be uncrossed. We are at many such thresholds this century.\n\nThere comes a time when the pain of continuing exceeds the pain of stopping. At that moment, a threshold is crossed. What seemed unthinkable becomes thinkable. Slowly, the realization emerges that the choice to continue what you have been doing is the choice to live in discomfort, and the choice to stop what you have been doing is the choice to breathe deeply and freely again. Once that realization has emerged, you can either honor it or ignore it, but you cannot forget it. What has become known can not become unknown again.",

    "fullText": "Ecologically important Diadema africanum almost eliminated by unknown disease in Canary Islands\n\nA marine pandemic is bringing some species of sea urchin to the brink of extinction, and some populations have disappeared altogether, a study has found.\n\nSince 2021, Diadema africanum urchins in the Canary Island archipelago have almost entirely been killed by an unknown disease. There has been a 99.7% population decrease in Tenerife, and a 90% decrease off the islands of the Madeira archipelago.\n\nIn the same period, mass deaths have been detected in species from the Red Sea, Mediterranean, Caribbean and western Indian Ocean.\n\nIván Cano, a researcher at the University of La Laguna and author of the study, said: “What we have seen since 2021 is really, really concerning. We are talking about the disappearance of several species in a really short time.”\n\nSea urchins are remarkable creatures. A relative of the starfish, they breathe through their feet, and while their spikes are a formidable defence against predators, they also provide refuge for smaller marine creatures.\n\nThey are known as “ecosystem engineers”, and affect their surroundings by grazing on algae, breaking down food for other animals, and acting as food for predators.\n\n“What fascinated me in the first place about this species is that they change their environment. Like humans, when they are present, they modify their habitat,” said Cano. “We don’t know the cascading effect that this could have in other species.”\n\nThe scientists do not know exactly what has caused this pandemic, but Cano said humans were “probably involved” in the distribution of the disease. Current theories about its transmission include shipping, changes to currents and abnormal wave activity.\n\nCano came to the Canary Islands to study the early life of urchins. He quickly found, to his dismay, that there were not enough young urchins to study. As a result, he changed his doctoral subject to study the rapid decline in their populations.\n\nThe Diadema genus, which populates tropical waters around the world, are the most widespread and ecologically important family of urchin.\n\nThere are only a few pockets of water where Diadema have not been affected by this outbreak of disease.\n\n“We aren’t yet sure how this pandemic will evolve,” Cano said. “So far, it seems not to have spread to other populations in Southeast Asia and Australia, which is good news – but we cannot rule out the possibility that the disease will reappear and potentially spread further.”",

    "description": "Archaeologists have found the earliest evidence yet of fire technology — and it was created by Neanderthals in England more than 400,000 years ago.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNeanderthals were the world's first innovators of fire technology, tiny specks of evidence in England suggest. Flecks of pyrite found at a more than 400,000-year-old archaeological site in Suffolk, in eastern England, push back archaeologists' evidence for controlled fire-making and suggest that key human brain developments began far earlier than previously thought.\n\n\"We're a species who've used fire to really shape the world around us,\" study co-author Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said in a news conference on Tuesday (Dec. 9). \"The ability to make fire would have been critically important\" in human evolution, Davis said, \"accelerating evolutionary trends\" such as developing larger brains, maintaining larger social groups, and increasing language skills.\n\nSince 2013, Davis and colleagues have been excavating an archaeological site in England called Barnham, which yielded stone tools, burnt sediment and charcoal from 400,000 years ago. In a study published Wednesday (Dec. 10) in the journal Nature, the researchers revealed that the site contained the world's earliest direct evidence of fire-making — and that this fire technology was likely pioneered by Neanderthals.\n\nBarnham was first recognized as a Paleolithic human site in the early 1900s due to the presence of stone tools. But recent excavations uncovered evidence of ancient human groups occupying the area more than 415,000 years ago, when Barnham was a small, seasonal watering hole in a woodland depression.\n\nIn one corner of the site, archaeologists found a concentration of heat-shattered hand axes as well as a zone of reddened clay. Through a series of scientific analyses, the researchers discovered that the reddened clay had been subjected to repeated, localized burning, which suggested the area may have been an ancient hearth.\n\n\"The big turning point came with the discovery of iron pyrite,\" study co-author Nick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, said in the news conference.\n\nPyrite, also known as fool's gold, is a naturally occurring mineral that can produce sparks when struck against flint. While pyrite is found in many locations around the world, it is extremely rare in the Barnham area, meaning someone specifically brought pyrite to the site, probably with the aim of making fire, the researchers said in the study.\n\nBecause of the importance of controlled fire, paleoanthropologists have long debated the timing of this invention.\n\n\"There are so many obvious advantages to fire, from cooking to protection from predators to its technological use in creating new types of artifacts to its ability to bring people together,\" April Nowell, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the University of Victoria in Canada who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"We only have to think of our own childhoods gathering around a campfire to understand its emotional resonance.\"\n\nResearchers believe that early humans first used wildfires for cooking food. This was a crucial step in human evolution because cooking widened the range of food available and made it more digestible, which in turn provided more nutrients needed to grow a larger brain, Davis said.\n\nBut there is limited evidence for deliberate early fire technology, and that evidence is often ambiguous, the researchers noted in the study.\n\nFor example, scientists unearthed reddened sediment at Koobi Fora in Kenya that dated to about 1.5 million years ago. Researchers suggested it could hint at early fire use because the key hominin at the site — Homo erectus — had a fairly large brain. And at two sites in Israel dated to about 800,000 years ago, burnt animal bones and stone tools suggest possible control of fire by the human ancestors who lived there.\n\nFire technology then exploded around 400,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found evidence of burning at cave sites in France, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and the U.K., and then more widespread use of fire in Europe, Africa and the Levant (the region around the east Mediterranean) by 200,000 years ago.\n\nBut these previous examples do not show the same kind of conclusive geochemical evidence of fire making that was found at Barnham, Ashton argued. He called the team's careful analysis of the Barnham sediment and identification of pyrite \"the most exciting discovery in my 40-year career.\"\n\nHowever, any bones at Barnham have since disintegrated, so the \"smoking gun\" of butchered and burned animal bones that could prove the site was used for cooking has not been found.\n\nThis also means there are no skeletal remains of the fire producers themselves at Barnham — but study co-author Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the National History Museum in London, has a guess about their identity.\n\n\"We assume that the fires at Barnham were being made by early Neanderthals,\" Stringer said in the news conference, based on a nearby site called Swanscombe, where Neanderthal skull bones were discovered that dated to the same time period as Barnham.\n\nWhile experts have known for about a decade that some Neanderthals could make fire, that evidence goes back only 50,000 years. The Barnham finds push that date 350,000 years further back, suggesting Neanderthals were much smarter than most people give them credit for.\n\nNeanderthals \"are fully human,\" Stringer said. \"They have complex behavior, they're adapting to new environments, and their brains are as large as ours. They're very evolved humans.\"\n\nNowell said that the study's results add fuel to a larger debate about Neanderthals' control of fire and their social and cultural use of it.\n\n\"There is a lot of discussion right now about whether all Neanderthals made fire or if it is only some Neanderthals at some times and places that made fire,\" Nowell said. The new study \"is another important data point in our understanding of Neanderthal pyrotechnical capabilities with all that implies cognitively, socially and technologically.\"\n\nIf the researchers are correct that Neanderthals made fire from flint and pyrite more than 400,000 years ago in England, this raises additional questions, Nowell said.\n\n—Neanderthals could be brought back within 20 years — but is it a good idea?\n\n—Neanderthals cannibalized 'outsider' women and children 45,000 years ago at cave in Belgium\n\n—'Perfectly preserved' Neanderthal skull bones suggest their noses didn't evolve to warm air\n\n\"Despite its obvious advantages, questions remain about the nature of early fire use: When did fire use become a regular part of the human behavioral repertoire? Were early humans dependent on the opportunistic use of wildfires and lightning strikes? Was fire rediscovered multiple times?\" Nowell said.\n\nThe ancestors of Homo sapiens were living in Africa 400,000 years ago and not likely interacting with early Neanderthals half a world away.\n\n\"We don't know if Homo sapiens at that date had the ability to make fire,\" Stringer said, because to date there is no clear evidence for control of fire any earlier than Barnham.\n\nThis means that Neanderthals may have invented ways to make and control fire somewhere in continental Europe, which then enabled our human cousins to move further north into England, heating and lighting their way with fire.\n\n\"It's plausible that fire became more controlled in Europe and spread to Africa,\" Ashton said. \"We have to keep an open mind.\"",

    "fullText": "US stock futures fell Wednesday night as investors evaluated the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut, which helped fuel a late-day rally on Wall Street.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) edged down roughly 0.4%. While S&P 500 (ES=F) and Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) plunged 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively.\n\nIn extended trading, Oracle plunged more than 10% after the software giant reported quarterly revenue that fell short of expectations, raising fresh concerns about cloud-infrastructure demand and dealing a slight blow to the bullish mood that had gripped Wall Street earlier.\n\nThe broader market finished higher Wednesday after a split Fed voted to cut interest rates for the third time this year, lowering the federal funds target range to 3.5%–3.75%. Policymakers also signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell also hinted that a rate hike would be off the table while broadly talking up the US economy's strength.\n\nPowell said officials are \"well positioned to wait and see\" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures.\n\nEarnings reports continue this week with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST) and Lululemon (LULU) all releasing on Thursday, rounding out an unpredictable season for AI and retail traders.

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor many Americans, retirement isn’t just about getting by — it’s about living comfortably and maintaining a middle-class lifestyle.\n\nEarning $12,000 a month ($144,000 a year) in passive income, for instance, could make that possible, covering everyday expenses while still allowing for travel, dining out and other luxuries.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nBut reaching that level of income in retirement requires more than just a large nest egg. Your savings must also be resilient enough to handle inflation, market swings and the risk of outliving your money.\n\nThe financial bar for this kind of retirement is likely higher than most people expect. Here’s why.\n\nRetiring on $144,000 isn’t typical. In 2025, the “magic number” for retirement savings is $1.26 million, according to a Northwestern Mutual study (1). Using the standard 4% rule, that equates to about $50,400 per year — or $4,200 per month in retirement income.\n\nThat figure aligns closely with the median retirement income of $54,710 for Americans over 65, based on 2023 U.S. Census Bureau data (2).\n\nThat’s already a steep target, but it only scratches the surface. Once you factor in inflation and longevity risk, the bar climbs even higher.\n\nIf you’re hoping to achieve three times the average retirement income, you may benefit from working with an advisor. People who work with financial advisors see a 3% increase in net returns, according to a report from Vanguard.\n\nThe advisors at Range offer white-glove financial services to high-income households.\n\nOnce your equity enters this ballpark, one of the most significant financial pain points can be asset under management (AUM) fees. These fees mean that portfolio managers take a percentage of the value, typically between 0.5% and 2%, of your managed assets — so as your wealth grows, so do their fees.",

    "fullText": "Extremely cold air has been building in northern Canada this week and is poised to roll southeastward into large parts of the central and eastern United States in the days ahead. However, AccuWeather meteorologists say some changes in the pattern will begin to unfold next week, which will root out the coldest air from the U.S. before Christmas.\n\n\"There is a massive area of air in northwestern Canada where temperatures are 20 to 30 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it is on its way southeastward into the U.S.,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said. \"This is the mother lode of cold air and is a term I don't use lightly.\"\n\nThe frigid air will be uncomfortable and potentially dangerous for people across the northern Plains to the Midwest, although temperatures may not be quite as extreme as they are farther north in Canada.\n\n\"The coldest air of the season so far is on the way for portions of the Midwest, Tennessee Valley and much of the Appalachians,\" AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok said.\n\nHave the app? Unlock AccuWeather Alerts™ with Premium+\n\nIn Minneapolis, actual temperatures may fail to climb above zero and will be surrounded by lows between 10 and 20 degrees below zero on Friday night and Saturday night. AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperatures can drop 10-20 degrees or more below the actual temperature. \"Exposure or those without shelter in these conditions, especially with blustery winds, can lead to hypothermia or frostbite in less than 30 minutes,\" Pastelok said.\n\nTemperatures may barely reach the single digits in Chicago on Saturday then drop well below zero Saturday night. \"The RealFeel Temperature in Chicago is forecast to remain below zero all weekend,\" Pastelok said.\n\nThe upcoming Arctic outbreak and most cold blasts in recent weeks have been driven by a displacement or weakening of the polar vortex.\n\nThe dense Arctic air will hover in the lowest part of the atmosphere and may struggle to climb over the Appalachians. However, even in the areas east of the mountains from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, temperatures will approach or exceed the low mark reached during the middle of this week. Should a storm deliver the first accumulating snow of the season to these areas later this weekend, the stage could be set for temperatures to plummet east of the Appalachians as well.\n\n\"The frigid pattern triggered by the recent disruption of the polar vortex will hold its grip over much of the central and eastern U.S. into next week,\" Pastelok said. \"Millions of families will likely struggle with high heating bills, with furnaces, baseboards and heat pumps running frequently to keep homes warm in the harsh cold.\" In unheated areas, there will be a risk of pipes freezing and bursting.\n\nFrigid conditions to ease before Christmas\n\nThe weather pattern is expected to shift next week, adopting a more west-to-east orientation in the U.S. However, it may take some time for the coldest air to leave, and there will still be some bursts of cold air in the central and eastern states, although not as extreme as the mid-December Arctic outbreak.\n\n\"While it may feel like Christmastime already with the cold and snow, the bitterly cold pattern is not expected to last through the holidays,\" Pastelok said.\n\nThe vast snow cover still being added to by the clipper storm pattern through this weekend is likely to be eroded by higher temperatures before Christmas.\n\n\"Don't assume because it is cold and snowy now that it will be so on Christmas Day,\" Pastelok said. \"Skiers and snowboarders should take advantage of the cold air and fresh powder at the slopes that are open in the Appalachians. Ski and boarding conditions could deteriorate over Christmas week at some resorts as warmer air moves in.\"\n\nIn the meantime, those wanting warmth or at least warm thoughts through this weekend can look to the Florida Peninsula and most areas west of the Rockies, except for foggy areas in California's Central Valley or flooded zones in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

Keep in mind that unlike other platforms in the new PS Plus library, you can only stream PlayStation 3 titles; you can't download them onto your console. That means you need a stable Wi-Fi connection or a hardwired ethernet connection (recommended) to play them.\n\nYou'll notice that our list includes several remakes and remasters from older PlayStation platforms that were added to the PS3 library.

For a full look at the new PS Plus service, take a look at our roundup of every game available in the PS Plus library.\n\nAlthough it’s been somewhat overshadowed by the games that came after it, Fallout 3 was a major turning point for the franchise. This was the first 3D Fallout game, and many of the gameplay mechanics have been celebrated in its successors. Bethesda also attracted some top-notch voice talent for this one, including Liam Neeson, who voices the father of the player’s character.\n\nAfter emerging from a Vault, players get to explore the Washington D.C. area and follow the primary and side missions to enjoy up to 100 hours or \n\nNinja Theory’s Heavenly Sword felt like it was meant to be the beginning of the next great franchise. Instead, it was a one-and-done with fantastic graphics and gameplay that put players in the role of Nariko, a woman who dares to take up the Heavenly Sword to protect her family and clan even though it will slowly overtake her body and destroy her.\n\nThe combat is fluid and a hell of a lot of fun when using the sword to take a large number of enemies on-screen. There are also a few times when players control Nariko’s closest friend, Kai, who has projectile weapons that you can aim and glide towards an enemy with the turn of a controller. This game doesn’t just deserve a modern remaster, it needs a sequel.\n\nRead our Heavenly Sword review.\n\nKonami has left the Castlevania franchise on the shelf for over a decade, and the only way to revisit the reboot, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, is by diving into it on PS Plus Premium. Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima was one of the producers for this title, which reimagined the entire Castlevania mythos and gave the gameplay the 3D makeover it needed.\n\nIn this version of the story, players take control of Gabriel Belmont, a holy warrior for the Brotherhood of Light. Gabriel’s wife, Marie, has been murdered by one of the supernatural creatures he was born to fight. But because Marie’s soul is trapped, she serves as Gabriel’s guide as he takes up a quest to not only save the world, but restore his wife to life. This is a wildly underrated title, and we need more Castlevania games like this.\n\nRead our Castlevania: Lords of Shadow review.\n\nGamers of a certain age should remember Sly Cooper, the anthropomorphic raccoon and master thief who was the main character of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus on PlayStation 2. That game and its first two sequels--Sly 2: Band of Thieves and Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves--were remastered for PlayStation 3 as part of The Sly Collection, and they have withstood the test of time.\n\nThe original versions of the trilogy were developed by Sucker Punch before the studio went on to release Infamous and Ghost of Tsushima. You’ll recognize the DNA of those games by the way Sly moves on rooftops and the way he utilizes stealth to remain undetected. Now, someone just needs to pull off a heist so Sly can get the comeback he deserves.\n\nWhile Arkham Origins game may not have been helmed by Rocksteady Games, developer Warner Bros. Montreal still did an admirable job with this prequel. Featuring all the combat, stealth, and detective work you'd expect from a Batman game, this Arkham title hit all three bat-nails on the bat-heads.\n\nRead our Batman Arkham Origins review.\n\nDecades after they were first released, the Devil May Cry games--yes, even the controversial second one--still stand tall as excellent action romps. Demonic hordes, stylish combat, and a protagonist with a devil-may-care attitude are just some of the reasons why Capcom's classic trilogy deserves a revisit. We recommend playing them in order, but if time is an issue, Devil May Cry 3 holds up better than its predecessors.\n\nRead our Devil May Cry HD Collection review.\n\nA cult-classic Japanese tactics series, you can grab several Disgaea games on PS Plus and feel what it's like to deliver ridiculous numbers of damage, forge relationships, and master exotic weapons within the fantasy frame of these titles. Just the Disgaea games alone offer hundreds of hours of compelling PS3 streaming content.\n\nA technical achievement at the time, The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion's open-world design was nothing short of stunning when it first released in 2006. 16 years later, the game is still a treat, with its in-your-face swords and sorcery action, excellent voice-acting, and dark fantasy tale centered around a Daedra invasion.\n\nRead our The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion review.\n\nBefore it was developing an underrated Devil May Cry reboot or the Senua's Saga series, developer Ninja Theory was making a name for itself with Enslaved. A new take on the classic tale, Enslaved pivots from ancient China to the far future for a thrilling tale of action in a robot post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nRead our Enslaved: Odyssey to the West review.\n\nFallout 3 brought the Bethesda series into a new dimension, but Obsidian Entertainment's spin-off is arguably the most well-remembered entry in the series. The gameplay was largely the same, but the extra improvements, incredible characters, and a fascinating new region made this Fallout the gold standard of the post-apocalyptic franchise. Fallout 3 is also on PS Plus Premium, and it's still worth playing, too.\n\nRead our Fallout New Vegas review.\n\nLiving up to its name, FEAR was part first-person shooter and part psychological horror that combined to create an effective package of high-caliber thrills. Everything from the sound design to the atmospheric levels was a showcase of how to give your audience multiple heart attacks, and even with several sequels, the first FEAR is still the cold standard for terror.\n\nThe original Greek adventures that set a new benchmark for games with brutal combat and quick-time events, the first two God of War games are fascinating throwbacks to the past that introduced the world to Kratos and his undying rage. The HD versions of these PS2 classics are still a treat to play in 2022.\n\nWhile there certainly wasn't a shortage of official PGA games during the PS3 era, but Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational was easily the best arcade golf game on the console. Originally released on the PS Vita, this port spruced up the product and made it feel even better with PS Move features that put you right in the game. Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds is also available to stream on PS Plus, so if you get bored of the courses in World Invitational, there's plenty more golfing fun to be had in Out of Bounds.\n\nRead our Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational review.\n\nIn an era where the PS2 was home to a regular influx of hit games, Ico stood out from the pack with its more tranquil puzzle gameplay and novel storytelling methods. Fast-forward a few years into the future, and an HD remaster brought all of that magic back in a new light.\n\nBefore it was developing an incredible samurai sandbox in Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch was known as the Infamous studio for good reason. An absolute power fantasy trip with fascinating consequences depending on your morality, the Infamous games still make for electrifying entertainment.\n\nReleased at a time when Mega Man had been absent from home consoles for years, the ninth and tenth installments in the series showed that the Blue Bomber hadn't lost his charm during his hiatus. Challenging and colorful, these Mega Man games were some of the best that the franchise had to offer. They captured the nostalgia of early Mega Man games by replicating the pixelated visuals while taking advantage of modern advancements in technology.\n\nThe fourth time was the charm for the Motorstorm series, as Apocalypse upped the ante with its rich selection of vehicles, well-designed tracks, and destructible environments that made each race a nail-biting sprint across hostile terrain.\n\nRead our Motorstorm: Apocalypse review.\n\nShinobi style cranked up to the maximum, Ryu Hayabusa's PS3 adventures were nothing short of effortlessly cool action mixed with devastating difficult gameplay. The Sigma games are harder than a freshly forged kunai, but they're still rewarding to play.\n\nRead our Ninja Gaiden Sigma review.\n\nVisually striking, PixelJunk Eden's Encore edition is a strange but fascinating game of platforming mixed with gardening. Sometimes serene, sometimes intense when the timer starts counting down; the lush visuals, distinct score, and surreal maneuverability makes for an unforgettable game.\n\nRead our PixelJunk Eden Encore review.\n\nPuppeteering might be the creepiest form of entertainment ever devised, but in the hands of SCE Japan, it's a medium that packs charm and imagination into a package of pure charm. Throw in some wonderful platforming, epic boss battles, and a killer soundtrack, and you've got a winner right here.\n\nA great Ratchet and Clank game is pure digital comfort food, and these two titles were simply delicious to dig into. Charming, witty, and full of great level design, PS Plus has a one-two punch of nostalgic fun waiting to be experienced in this pair of games. There are a couple other Ratchet games available to stream, but this pair keeps the traditional Ratchet & Clank gameplay.\n\nRead our Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus review.\n\nTaking a detour from the Grand Theft Auto series into wild west territory, Red Dead Redemption will amaze you with its cowboy sandbox and break your heart with its story. The standalone expansion, Undead Nightmare, is also plenty of fun as it adds a zombie mode that turns the entire game upside down.\n\nRead our Red Dead Redemption review.\n\nBefore the remake arrives, dive into Resident Evil 4 and marvel at how the series underwent a massive shift in tone and style. The controls might take some getting used to, but the rest of the game puts a terrific action spin on Resident Evil's trademark undead horror.\n\nRead our Resident Evil 4 review.\n\nThe final chapter in the Resistance saga is all action, alien devastation, and peak FPS fun from its era. Toss in some stomach-churning terror and a story that constantly increases in tension, and you'll be on the edge of your seat from the main menu through to the end credits.\n\nWhen Sam and Max made their return, it was nothing short of triumphant at the time. Reborn with a fancy new 3D aesthetic and 4D humor, these collections are perfect examples of hilarious storytelling and ingenious puzzles.\n\nRead our Sam and Max: Beyond Time and Space review.\n\nIf you ever wondered what would happen if Michael Bay decided to make a racing game, then Split/Second is your answer to that question. A solid arcade-style racing game, the real attention-grabber here was a selection of tracks that featured explosive turns and plenty of mayhem in every single race.\n\nThe tale of Darth Vader's secret apprentice may have been expunged from Star Wars continuity, but back then, these games were massively ambitious entries that sought to flesh out the years between the prequel and original trilogies. Living up to its name, the Force truly was unleashed in Starkiller's adventures across a galaxy far, far away.\n\nRead our Star Wars: The Force Unleashed review.\n\nStill revered as one of the most influential fighting games of all time, Street Fighter II also set a standard with several enhanced versions of the game that would be released over the years. Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is that legendary game at its best, packed with a great roster of characters, well-oiled fighting mechanics, and plenty of modern touches.\n\nRead our Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nFor a change of pace, grab a quick stream of the delightful puzzle-punching Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix. It's cute, captivating, and still plays like a dream.\n\nRead our Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nIn the mood for a dual-stick spaceship game that lets you see wonderfully colorful worlds as you turn enemy vessels into an explosive collection of pixels? Super Stardust HD has you covered with this stylish blast from the past.\n\nRead our Super Stardust HD review.\n\nPlatforming action starring a small blob might not sound too enticing, but this little gelatinous fellow combined magnetic traversal with relaxing puzzles and comfortable levels to explore. Two games, two adventures that can easily be enjoyed over a weekend.\n\nRead our Tales from Space: About a Blob review.\n\nEasily the weirdest title on this list, Tokyo Jungle is an examination of what life would be like for our beloved pets if humanity decided to just vanish off the face of the planet one day. It's a flawed gem, but one that sparkles with its absurd ideas and lively world.\n\nRevived for a new generation, Firaxis' XCOM was a welcome sight for anyone who felt that The Bureau had derailed the XCOM name. Pure tactical action and layered squad-building, this XCOM modernized the series for a new audience while keeping veterans engaged with its strategic content.\n\nRead our XCOM Enemy Within review.",

Kojima has kept most details on OD under wraps, allowing the brief reveal trailer to do the talking for him and get fans of his work speculating on what he's cooking up right now. A few other details on the game have been revealed since it was first announced during the 2023 edition of The Game Awards. Here's a closer look at everything we know about OD so far.",

    "description": "Paramount's CEO urged shareholders to tender their shares and slammed WBD for an \"opaque sales process\" that gave Netflix preferential treatment.",
    "fullText": "The media war between Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, and Paramount is raging on.\n\nParamount Skydance's CEO, David Ellison, sent a letter to WBD shareholders on Wednesday, urging them to tender their shares in support of Paramount's bid for WBD.\n\n\"It is not too late to realize the benefits of Paramount's proposal if you choose to act now and tender your shares,\" Ellison said in the letter.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix announced that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion, after WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid for WBD, for $30 per share.\n\nIn the letter, Ellison also slammed WBD's advisors for not giving equal weight to Paramount's offer, compared to Netflix's, and described the sales process as being \"opaque.\"\n\n\"To suggest that we are not 'good for the money' (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd,\" he said.\n\nHe said that WBD advisors \"never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers.\"\n\nEllison added that WBD did not grant Paramount a \"single 'real time' negotiating session,\" and had \"sprinted towards a deal with Netflix.\" He said WDB ignored texts from him and his advisors in which they said their $30-per-share offer was not their best and final one.\n\nRepresentatives for WBD did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about Ellison's accusations in the letter.\n\nAfter Paramount launched the hostile bid, Ellison pitched the deal to his own staff in an internal memo on Monday, as seen by Business Insider. He told his staff that the combination of Paramount and WBD would be a \"powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Ellison said at a Tuesday UBS event that he knew why WBD could not accept his latest offer.\n\n\"If they accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty, so I don't think they can just take that,\" Ellison said.\n\nThe bid is partially financed by the wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe media war has not escaped the notice of President Donald Trump, who said he would be involved in the deal. He said on Sunday that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian brigade has released footage of one of its uncrewed ground vehicles opening fire on a Russian armored personnel carrier, offering a rare glimpse at the emerging technology in action.\n\nThe 5th Separate Assault Brigade said on Wednesday that it deployed a Droid TW 12.7 — a remotely operated tracked system developed by a Ukrainian defense tech company — on a road deemed likely to be a route for advancing Russian troops.\n\nThe brigade said that the ground-based drone later encountered a Russian MT-LB, a lightly armored fighting vehicle often used to transport infantry.\n\nThermal footage filmed at night from the uncrewed ground vehicle, or UGV, shows it opening fire on the vehicle, its operator swerving a targeting reticle across the MT-LB's front.\n\nBusiness Insider could neither independently verify when nor where the footage was filmed.\n\nThe Droid TW 12.7 is equipped with an M2 Browning machine gun that fires .50 caliber rounds, which would typically pierce an MT-LB's armor.\n\nThe 5th Brigade said it used armor-piercing incendiary rounds for the mission.\n\nSparks fly from the armored vehicle's chassis as it slows to a crawl and drifts in front of the UGV, which continues firing point-blank.\n\n\"The 12.7 mm bullets punch through the MT-LB's side, striking the crew and onboard systems,\" a narrator said in the 5th Brigade's video, referring to the metric measurement for .50 caliber bullets.\n\nThe MT-LB appears to be aimlessly crawling past the drone, indicating that its driver is incapacitated or its controls are damaged.\n\nThe UGV then pivots and begins firing on the rear of the MT-LB, \"killing the infantry in the troop compartment,\" the narrator said.\n\nThe 5th Brigade said that it found in the morning that the MT-LB crew and their passengers were \"completely wiped out,\" publishing short clips of the aftermath shot by a first-person-view aerial drone.\n\nWednesday's published footage provides insight into how UGVs are increasingly used on the battlefield in Ukraine, where troops on both sides are experimenting with ground drones to perform missions that human soldiers must otherwise conduct.\n\nWhile official statistics show that uncrewed aerial vehicles still dominated the drone warfare space last month, the spread of UGVs offers a possible future where Kyiv can rely on remotely operated systems for ground operations instead of risking its troops.\n\nThis year, Ukraine said that it aims to manufacture and deploy at least 15,000 UGVs across the battlefield.\n\nUkrainian and Russian teams have developed hundreds of such systems, ranging from buggies that can ferry provisions near the front lines to trucks outfitted with remotely operated machine guns.\n\nThe 5th brigade and DevDroid, the company that makes the Droid TW 12.7, did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.",

    "description": "Even with an $8 billion valuation, Harvey's CEO says no company will dominate the $1 trillion legal market.",
    "fullText": "The legal tech market is only just beginning, and it's huge, says Harvey's CEO.\n\nWinston Weinberg said during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Wednesday that the opportunity ahead for the legal tech industry is so massive that no single company — including his — could own it.\n\n\"I don't think a single player is going to capture all of the pretty enormous amount of value that will be created in the next 10 years in this space,\" said the CEO of the $8 billion legal tech startup.\n\nHarvey announced last week that it raised $160 million in a round led by a16z, pushing the startup's valuation to $8 billion.\n\nDespite being one of the most closely watched startups in the sector, Weinberg said Harvey is barely scratching the surface of who AI tools can reach.\n\n\"There are around 10 million global legal professionals, and Harvey serves just single-digit percentage points of them,\" he said.\n\nHe also said the legal tech sector represents only a tiny slice of the overall legal economy. The global legal market is worth an estimated $1 trillion, but only about $30 billion of that is spent on technology today, Weinberg said.\n\n\"Long term, it seems clear that technology penetration in the legal market will grow significantly,\" he said.\n\n\"If we build a great product, we hopefully capture some of that very large upside,\" Weinberg said, adding that there is \"clearly\" room for other legal AI startups.\n\nWeinberg said the startup needs to \"earn that valuation every day.\"\n\nThe share of monthly users who return daily is up 81% since the company launched in 2023, and lawyers using multiple features show engagement patterns \"similar to Slack or email,\" said Weinberg.\n\n\"We have a long way to go with building out a full platform of use cases for lawyers,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said many legal tasks will be absorbed by technology.\n\n\"That doesn't mean the entire job of a lawyer gets consumed; it'll evolve,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg told Business Insider in September that AI is already reshaping the industry, creating new practice areas while reducing the size of some in-house teams.\n\nSome law firms are rethinking their staffing models entirely, flattening their traditional pyramid structures by relying more on associates and fewer partners, he said in an interview on the sidelines of TechLaw Fest in Singapore.\n\nYounger lawyers who grew up using AI tools may gain an edge over senior partners when it comes to fluency, speed, and adaptability, he added.\n\nAI has become an unavoidable part of lawyers' work. Five of the 10 largest US law firms by revenue told Business Insider in July they were already embedding AI into their workflows — including document review, legal research, and spotting compliance risks.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm has also surged alongside the transformation. Legal-tech funding reached $3.2 billion this year, according to Business Insider's December analysis of Crunchbase data and recent deals.",

But it's just the nature of the beast where you get into the frenzy of the winter times. 'Anything at all cost, doesn't matter,' but in reality, it does matter,” Cashman said.\n\n“Everything adds up. Everything counts,” he added.\n\nNonetheless, the Yankees will do what they can to try and load up for a deep playoff run in 2026, after a disappointing ending to their 2025 campaign.\n\nWinter Meetings may force Yankees to choose which young star to trade\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nCody Bellinger's free agency update is bad news for Yankees",

    "fullText": "Flipping and spinning on a studio floor, 17-year-old Royal is a star in China's breakdancing scene and aiming for gold at the World Championships in Japan this week.\n\nRoyal, real name Guo Pu, shot to fame when she won both the youth and adult Asian Championships in June.\n\nShe is part of a growing Chinese force in breakdancing, which combines acrobatic floor moves, footwork and rhythmic expression to hip-hop or funk and was included as an Olympic sport for the first time at Paris 2024.\n\n\"At first my grandmother would not let me dance breaking because back then, breaking's reputation truly was not very good,\" Royal told AFP at the studio where she trains in her hometown of Pingyi, in the eastern province of Shandong.\n\n\"But after I achieved some results, she stopped saying anything,\" she smiled.\n\nHaving already won the youth world title in August, Royal will compete alongside other \"B-girls\" and \"B-boys\" at the adult World Championships taking place Friday and Saturday in Fukuoka, Japan, the country which has long dominated the sport.\n\n\"I want to win that gold medal for China and show the world that Chinese breaking is getting cooler and cooler,\" she said.\n\nAs a youngster, \"my mother signed me up for all kinds of extracurricular classes, such as playing instruments, then Chinese dance\", Royal said.\n\n\"I also participated in a local children's artistic show for the Chinese New Year. That's when coach Mike saw me.\"\n\nMike, whose real name is Li Shilong, told AFP \"she immediately impressed me\".\n\n\"During her performance I saw a light in her eyes... It was a kind of light that shows a real passion, a real drive for dance and for art.\n\n\"I felt that this girl might have been born for breaking.\"\n\nRoyal has now put school on hold to dedicate her time entirely to dancing.\n\nLike other top athletes in China, she will benefit from easier access to university thanks to her sporting achievements.\n\nRoyal describes herself as \"not very talkative\" and still \"pretty nervous before competitions\", but says she is able to \"open up\" on stage.\n\nIn addition to her Asian and world titles, Royal won gold at this year's World Games -- a top competition for non-Olympic sports.\n\nShe has developed a healthy rivalry with fellow Chinese breakdancer Liu Qingyi, known as \"671\", who won bronze at the Paris Games.\n\nThe country's next generation of breakdancers looks promising, with China winning five out of six medals at the youth World Championships in August.\n\n\"In four years, China has gone from being unknown in the world of breakdancing to ranking among the world's top three and is now seen as the future of breaking,\" Mounir Biba, a 13-time world champion and head coach of the Chinese team, told AFP.\n\n\"There is talent, there is a lot of potential. There are a lot of young dancers in China,\" he said, adding that financial support from the government was helping the sport grow.\n\nHaving breakdancing in the Olympics has encouraged the surge of interest in China, according to coach Mike.\n\n\"Once a discipline is officially recognised as a sport in China it's developed very intensively,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities see an opportunity to win international honours while parents, reassured by breakdancing's new respectability, are more willing to let their children practise it.\n\nThe Chinese DanceSport Federation now organises numerous competitions, Mike said, while funds are allocated to training facilities.\n\nThe only downside, according to the coach, is that some Chinese dancers do not necessarily fully understand the culture of breakdancing, which originated in New York in the 1970s.\n\n\"The (skill) difficulty level in China is exceptionally high. However, the understanding of dance and the depth of exploration into dance artistry remains insufficient,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"This is an area where we need to learn from Western nations,\" Mike said.\n\n\"Breakdancing, and other street dance styles... their essence is innovation. I believe that by understanding the core of this culture, Chinese children will become more creative.\"\n\nRoyal is keen to push the sport's creativity.\n\n\"I really want to inspire the next generation of B-girls,\" she said.\n\n\"By passing on the history and the culture of breaking, and developing a style of breaking that's unique to girls.\"",

    "fullText": "The Mets are looking for a right-handed bat in the wake of Pete Alonso departing for Baltimore, and they've reportedly talked to one National League team about potentially doing just that.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, the Mets and Cardinals have had discussions involving a trade for Willson Contreras.\n\nThe Cardinals are looking to move their veteran pieces like Nolan Arenado, Brendan Donovan and Contreras, but president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom has yet to make a deal. MLB.com's John Denton reports that the Cardinals have fielded several calls already for Donovan and LHP JoJo Romero, with the Mets showing interest in Contreras.\n\nDenton added that Contreras is expected to waive his no-trade clause to play in New York.\n\nContreras, who is entering his age-34 season, has two guaranteed years left worth $36.5 million, according to Spotrac. There is also a club option for the 2028 season, which is worth $17.5 million.\n\nThe three-time All-Star is coming off his third season in St. Louis, where he slashed .257/.344/.447 with an OPS of .791 to go along with 20 home runs and 80 RBI in 135 games.\n\nHe also offers versatility in the field. Contreras played 120 games at first base with the Cardinals last year, but has been the Cardinals' catcher in past seasons, as recent as starting behind the plate 50 times in 2024. He also has 39 games of experience in the outfield in his career, his last being during the 2021 season, but that's not expected to be a part of any plan involving Contreras.",

    "fullText": "Head football coach for the University of Michigan, Sherrone Moore, has been detained just hours after being fired for having an “inappropriate relationship.”\n\nMoore, 39, was detained by police in Saline, Michigan, on Wednesday. He was later turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for an “investigation into potential charges,” the Saline Police Department said in a statement to ESPN.\n\nIt’s unclear what the investigation is in relation to.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Moore was fired “with cause” after a University of Michigan probe found “credible evidence” that the coach “engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,” the school said in a statement shared by multiple outlets.\n\n“This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,” the University of Michigan said.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the Pittsfield Township Police Department and the University of Michigan for comment.\n\nThis was just Moore’s second season as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines. He was given the title in January 2024 after six years as a member of the offensive staff. He was the University of Michigan’s first African American head coach.\n\nMoore has a wife, to whom he’s been married since 2015, and three daughters.\n\nAssociate coach Biff Poggi has been named as the University of Michigan’s interim head football coach.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines finished the regular season at 9-3 and have a game against the Texas Longhorns at the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl on December 31.\n\nDave Portnoy, the founder of sports and pop culture media company Barstool Sports, commended the University of Michigan’s decision to fire Moore.\n\n“On a serious note there have been a lot of schools over the years who have looked the other way with scandals. I’d just like to say I’m proud that Michigan refused to do the same,” Portnoy wrote on X Wednesday.\n\n“Sherrone broke the moral code and it cost him his job. It’s a hard lesson but it’s the Michigan Man Way. Leaders and best for a reason. Proud to be a Michigan Wolverine tonight.”\n\nMoore was also part of a sign-stealing scandal, which resulted in record fines expected to exceed $20 million imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association on the University of Michigan.\n\nSign-stealing is when a sports team decodes an opponent’s hand signals. The NCAA bans schools from sending scouts to future opponents’ games and using electronic equipment to record signals.\n\nMoore was given a three-game suspension for his role in the scheme, which he was expected to complete next year. Reports of the NCAA’s investigation surfaced early in the 2023 season, when Moore was working under Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines came out on top in the 2023 season, winning the College Football Playoff national championship in a game against the Washington Huskies.\n\nPoggi successfully led the Michigan Wolverines for two games this year while Moore was suspended.",

    "title": "The Normalization of Deviance in AI",
    "description": "The gradual and systemic over-reliance on LLM outputs, especially with agentic systems, leads to a normalization of deviance.",
    "fullText": "The AI industry risks repeating the same cultural failures that contributed to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster: Quietly normalizing warning signs while progress marches forward.\n\nThe original term Normalization of Deviance comes from the American sociologist Diane Vaughan, who describes it as the process in which deviance from correct or proper behavior or rule becomes culturally normalized.\n\nI use the term Normalization of Deviance in AI to describe the gradual and systemic over-reliance on LLM outputs, especially in agentic systems.\n\nAt its core, large language models (LLMs) are unreliable (and untrusted) actors in system design.\n\nThis means that security controls (access checks, proper encoding, and sanitization, etc.) must be applied downstream of LLM output.\n\nA constant stream of indirect prompt injection exploit demonstrations indicates that system designers and developers are either unaware of this or are simply accepting the deviance. It is particularly dangerous when vendors make insecure decisions for their userbase by default.\n\nI first learned about this concept in the context of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where systemic normalization of warnings led to tragedy.\n\nDespite data showing erosion in colder temperatures, the deviation from safety standards was repeatedly rationalized because previous flights had succeeded. The absence of disaster was mistaken for the presence of safety.\n\nIn the world of AI, we observe companies treating probabilistic, non-deterministic, and sometimes adversarial model outputs as if they were reliable, predictable, and safe.\n\nVendors are normalizing trusting LLM output, but current understanding violates the assumption of reliability.\n\nThe model will not consistently follow instructions, stay aligned, or maintain context integrity. This is especially true if there is an attacker in the loop (e.g indirect prompt injection).\n\nHowever, we see more and more systems allowing untrusted output to take consequential actions. Most of the time it goes well, and over time vendors and organizations lower their guard or skip human oversight entirely, because “it worked last time.”\n\nThis dangerous bias is the fuel for normalization: organizations confuse the absence of a successful attack with the presence of robust security.\n\nTwo ways this can impact systems are:\n\nAnd we already see agents make mistakes in day to day usage, like formatting hard drives, creating random GitHub issues, or wiping a production database.\n\nSo, the signs are there. And it is inherently dangerous, not only because of attacks like indirect prompt injection, but also because these systems are trained on enormous, untrustworthy data sets from the Internet. Anthropic research recently showed that it takes only a small amount of documents to successfully add a backdoor to a model.\n\nConsider a scenario where the Normalization of Deviance has drastic consequences: an attacker trains a backdoor into a model that triggers on certain days to invoke tools, like compromising a user via code execution. Since we have a pretty centralized ecosystem, where attacks often are transferable, and natural language is universally understood by LLMs, this can have consequences across many systems and vendors.\n\nSuch a drift does not happen through a single reckless decision. It happens through a series of “temporary” shortcuts that quietly become the new baseline. Because systems continue to work, teams stop questioning the shortcuts, and the deviation becomes invisible and the new norm.\n\nEspecially under competitive pressure for automation, cost savings, a drive to be first, and the overall hype, this dangerous drift is evident. The incentives for speed and winning outweigh the incentives for foundational security. Over time, organizations forget why the guardrails existed in the first place.\n\nLet me share some examples of how this is reflected in real-world agentic AI systems.\n\nWe are all aware that chatbots have those “AI can make mistakes”, “Double check responses” and so forth disclaimers, and we can observe the drift of normalization occurring in real-time.\n\nThree years after ChatGPT shipped, vendors push agentic AI to users, but at the same time vendors are highlighting that your system might get compromised by that same AI - that drift, that normalization, is what I call “The Normalization of Deviance in AI”.\n\nThis continuous drift is a long-term danger:\n\nWhile some vendors acknowledge the risks, others appear to overlook or downplay them, potentially due to competitive pressure and focus on product and customer acquisition.\n\nIn many cases, we probably collectively hope that “someone” will solve these security and safety challenges.\n\nCompanies like Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and other institutions and organizations perform extensive research in this area, including publishing evals and mitigation ideas. However, the rush to be the first is evident from a product perspective.\n\nNevertheless, before we drift off into a utopian future with agentic AI, I believe the best and safest outcome is to stay realistic around capabilities and control mechanisms, and for AI to remain human-led, particularly in high-stake contexts, to ensure the best outcome overall.\n\nNo, of course not. There is a lot of potential and many low stakes workflows can be implemented already today. Even high-risk workflows can be done with proper threat modeling, mitigations and oversight.\n\nHowever, it requires investment and resources to design and set up systems accordingly and apply security controls (sandbox, hermetic environments, least privilege, temporary credentials, etc.).\n\nMany are hoping the “model will just do the right thing”, but Assume Breach teaches us, that at one point, it will certainly not do that.",

    "description": "If NASA is serious about exploring Mars, it’s past time to send new missions.",
    "fullText": "NASA has lost contact with one its three spacecraft orbiting Mars, the agency announced Tuesday. Meanwhile, a second Mars orbiter is perilously close to running out of fuel, and the third mission is running well past its warranty.\n\nGround teams last heard from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or MAVEN, spacecraft on Saturday, December 6. “Telemetry from MAVEN had showed all subsystems working normally before it orbited behind the red planet,” NASA said in a short statement. “After the spacecraft emerged from behind Mars, NASA’s Deep Space Network did not observe a signal.”\n\nNASA said mission controllers are “investigating the anomaly to address the situation. More information will be shared once it becomes available.”\n\nMAVEN is the newest of NASA’s three operational Mars orbiters. The robotic mission arrived at the red planet in September 2014 after a 10-month cruise from Earth, then settled into an elliptical orbit to begin studying interactions between the Sun and the Martian atmosphere.\n\nEarlier in its mission, MAVEN discovered how the solar wind erodes the Martian atmosphere. Over billions of years, the erosion transformed Mars from a warm, wet, habitable world into the cold, inhospitable planet seen today. MAVEN’s science instruments measured the densities of light and heavy isotopes of argon to show how a process known as “sputtering” removed the majority of the air and water from the atmosphere. The spacecraft also made detailed in-situ plasma observations to help scientists understand Mars’ auroras.\n\nBuilt by Lockheed Martin, MAVEN has far outlived its original design life. More recently, MAVEN became an important node in NASA’s Mars relay network, passing signals between rovers on the Martian surface and controllers on Earth. If NASA is unable to revive the MAVEN spacecraft, the agency has two other orbiters that can pick up the slack.\n\nBut NASA’s two other Mars orbiters have been in space for more than 20 years. The older of the two, named Mars Odyssey, has been at Mars since 2001 and will soon run out of fuel, probably some time in the next couple of years. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched in 2005, is healthy for its age, with enough fuel to last into the 2030s. MRO is also important to NASA because it has the best camera at Mars, with the ability to map landing sites for future missions.\n\nTwo European spacecraft, Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, have radios to relay data between mission controllers and NASA’s landers on the Martian surface. Mars Express, now 22 years old, suffers from the same aging concerns as Mars Odyssey and MRO. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is newer, having arrived at Mars in 2016, but is also operating beyond its original lifetime.\n\nChina and the United Arab Emirates also have orbiters circling Mars, but neither spacecraft is equipped to serve as a communications relay.\n\nNASA’s Curiosity and Perseverance rovers have the capability for direct-to-Earth communications, but the orbiting relay network can support vastly higher data throughput. Without overhead satellites, much of the science data and many of the spectacular images collected by NASA’s rovers might never make it off the planet.\n\nMAVEN’s unique orbit, stretching as far as 2,800 miles (4,500 kilometers) above Mars, has some advantages for data relay. In that orbit, MAVEN could relay science data from rovers on the surface for up to 30 minutes at a time, longer than the relay periods available through NASA’s lower-altitude orbiters. Because of this, MAVEN could support the largest data volumes of any of the other relay options.\n\nBefore the loss of communications last weekend, NASA said MAVEN had sufficient fuel reserves to operate until at least the late 2030s.\n\nMAVEN was one of 19 operating missions targeted for cancellation in President Donald Trump’s proposed NASA budget for fiscal year 2026. Congress largely rejected the Trump’s administration’s proposed budget cuts at NASA.\n\nMars is clearly a second priority at NASA amid a race between the United States and China to land astronauts on the Moon. But the recent trouble with MAVEN will likely rekindle long-running concerns about NASA’s aging spacecraft at Mars, especially the risk of losing capacity for communications relay and high-resolution mapping to support NASA’s active rovers, along with future robotic or human expeditions.\n\nThe space agency has investigated using commercial relay services to replace the government-owned network currently in place at Mars. NASA awarded study contracts to Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and SpaceX in 2024 to examine possible data relay architectures.\n\nNASA was in the early stages of planning for a dedicated Mars Telecommunications Orbiter more than 20 years ago, with plans to put it into an orbit similar to the one occupied by MAVEN. The agency canceled the project in 2005. Since then, NASA has tacked on relay radios to science orbiters sent to Mars, giving them the ability to provide communications support as a secondary mission.\n\nThe Mars Telecommunications Orbiter name appeared again in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress earlier this year. Lawmakers included $700 million for a “high-performance” telecom relay station in Mars orbit to be developed through a fixed-price contract. Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are among the companies that have publicized their concepts for a Mars telecom orbiter in recent months. NASA officials have not said when they will release a request for bids for such a mission.",

    "title": "Linux 6.18: All About the New Long-Term Support Linux Kernel",
    "description": "The newest version of the Linux kernel offers two years of long-term support, plus upgrades to the slab memory allocator, security hardening and more.",
    "fullText": "Linus Torvalds wasn’t thrilled with how the final days leading up to the 6.18 release of the Linux kernel went. “I’d have been happier with slightly less bugfixing noise in this last week of the release,” the Linux kernel creator wrote Nov. 30 on the Linux kernel mailing list.\n\nNevertheless, he added, “While there’s a few more fixes than I would hope for, there was nothing that made me feel like this needs more time to cook. So 6.18 is tagged and pushed out.”\n\nNow that version 6.18 is fully cooked, what are the ingredients? And what, exactly, does “long-term support” mean when it comes to the Linux kernel?\n\nOnce upon a time, long-term support versions of the Linux kernel got six years of long-term support (LTS). That’s no longer the case. In 2023, the kernel developers cut LTS to two years.\n\nWhy? Because Linux code maintainers have been burning out. It’s a hard job. And, as Josef Bacik, Linux kernel file system developer and maintainer, said in a presentation at the 2022 Linux Storage | Filesystem | MM & BPF Summit, “Maintainers are burning out [because] maintainers don’t scale.” Adding insult to injury, they are also rarely paid for maintenance work.\n\nSo it is that we only get two years of “official” LTS — and the clock on the latest release, 6.18, began ticking on Dec. 3, when stable Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced it was officially the newest LTS version. This release also sees the LTS Linux 5.4 falling out of support.\n\nWait? What’s that you say? You need a heck of a lot longer support time than two years for you and your customers? Well, depending on which distribution you use for production, you’re in luck. Many of the top enterprise Linux distributors offer far longer-term support horizons for their paying customers.\n\nRed Hat maintains its own Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) kernels for the distro’s life cycle of 10-plus years. Red Hat does this by backporting security fixes and selected features to a constant kernel version, even when upstream has dropped that branch. RHEL also offers Extended Life Cycle/Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) add‑ons for older releases, which include kernel security updates beyond standard maintenance.\n\nRHEL‑compatible distributions such as AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux track RHEL’s LTS kernels through their own rebuilds, effectively extending kernel maintenance for users on the same timelines as the corresponding RHEL releases.\n\nOpenELA, the RHEL-compatible Linux distribution backed by Oracle, SUSE and CIQ/Rocky Linux, also supports older kernels via the RHEL code tree. In addition, OpenELA explicitly stepped in to maintain the former LTS Linux 4.14 until December 2024. Nevertheless, OpenELA was still releasing Linux 4.14 code in 2025.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) was also supporting 4.14 on Amazon Linux 2.0  through the end of October 2025, and the also otherwise obsolete 5.10 kernel through June 20, 2026.\n\nSUSE maintains SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) kernels with long life cycles, similar to Red Hat, and offers extended support options. Starting with SLES 16 and its Linux 6.12 kernel, SUSE now offers 16 years of support.\n\nFinally, Canonical maintains Ubuntu LTS kernels for up to 15 years with add‑on support packages. Canonical also offers LTS for the 4.14 and otherwise out-of-date kernels. For example, the company still supports the 11-and-a-half-year-old Ubuntu 14.04 distro.\n\nWhy should you use either the official LTS kernel or its commercially supported twins? It’s simple. As Kroah-Hartman said in a 2020 “Ask the Expert” interview at Open Source Summit Europe, they provide developers with a stable application binary interface (ABI). It also provides, he’s said, a continuous stream of security patches. This is far safer than freezing on an old non‑LTS kernel or trying to cherry‑pick fixes yourself.\n\nAt the core of 6.18 is a significant upgrade to the slab memory allocator in the form of “sheaves.” This is a per‑CPU cache mechanism that reduces contention and speeds up memory allocation and freeing operations. The release also includes improved swapping behavior and other virtual machine (VM) tweaks to improve performance under memory pressure, particularly on busy servers and desktops.\n\nOne of the most visible and controversial changes is the removal of the experimental Bcachefs file system from the mainline kernel. Bcachefs is a general-purpose Linux filesystem. It’s designed for systems that need strong data integrity and advanced storage features. In practice, it targets many of the same roles as Btrfs or ZFS: ample local storage, multidisk arrays and setups that combine SSDs and HDDs for performance and capacity.\n\nBcachefs was booted out of the kernel largely because its maintainer, Kent Overstreet, clashed with kernel maintainers, including Torvalds, over patch timing, review practices and public communications. Behind the personal arguments was a technical one: The Bcachefas code fixes often came in late, kernel maintainers said, which clashed with the kernel’s preference for stabilizing during release candidate phases.\n\nTorvalds and other maintainers argued that code that routinely needs that sort of late churn does not yet belong upstream, especially for something as critical as a filesystem. Bcachefx is now shipped as a Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) module, which is maintained outside the kernel tree. Distributions that wish to support Bcachefs must build and ship that external module.\n\nOn the networking side, Linux 6.18 adds support for Accurate Explicit Congestion Notification (AccECN) in TCP. This enables finer‑grained congestion feedback and potentially better throughput under load. The kernel also introduces PSP‑encrypted TCP connections, an approach that offers hardware‑friendly offload characteristics as an alternative to traditional IPsec or TLS in some environments.\n\nSecurity hardening continues with support for cryptographically signed BPF programs. This enables runtime-verified Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) payloads, as well as refinements across the security subsystem and multi‑LSM configurations.\n\nA notable infrastructure change is the ability to manage process namespaces using file‑handle‑like objects, similar in spirit to pidfds. This should make container runtimes and low‑level tooling more robust and race‑resistant.\n\nAdditionally, the gradual integration of Rust into the kernel continues, including support for a Rust Binder driver. This is a Google-driven rewrite of the Android Binder driver in Rust. This vital inter-process communication (IPC) system enables two processes on an Android-powered device to communicate with one another.\n\nAs with most kernel releases, 6.18 carries a large batch of new and updated drivers across architectures, including x86_64, ARM, RISC‑V, and others. It also — surprise! — improves support for recent GPUs, SoCs and storage controllers. It also comes with fixes and enhancements for popular handheld gaming PCs such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go 2, as well as better power management and device‑tree coverage for laptops and embedded boards.\n\nFor end users, that translates into better out‑of‑the‑box hardware support on upcoming distributions that track the new LTS line.\n\nFor Linux desktop users — Jack Wallen and I wave — the main benefits of Linux 6.18 will be faster, more scalable memory allocation, improved network efficiency and broader hardware enablement, especially on modern GPUs and newer ARM‑based systems.\n\nServer operators and cloud providers are likely to focus on dm‑pcache for hybrid storage, the new TCP capabilities, and signed BPF infrastructure as they evaluate 6.18 as a long‑term platform. With support stretching to 2027 and no single “killer” feature, Linux 6.18 positions itself as a conservative but foundational release that many distributions will standardize on for the next few years.",

    "description": "Elon Musk has amassed a $491 billion fortune through his work at Tesla, SpaceX, and more. Here's the tech CEO's daily routine.",
    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "description": "At 74, Laurence Gerowitz and his wife upsized to a larger condo in New York City. The grandkids love the space and his son's visits are less of a chore.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 75-year-old Laurence Gerowitz, a real estate litigator, about his move into a larger condo in New York City. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI lived on the Upper East Side for most of my adult life: about 48 years, starting in the late 1970s. My wife and I bought into a co-op on 85th Street in 1999 for $265,000 and lived on the third floor of the five-story walk-up.\n\nOur apartment was 1,200 square feet and had a very nice layout, as well as a working fireplace. The building had no amenities whatsoever, but we were still very happy to be there. We lived there for 25 years and essentially raised our son in that apartment.\n\nIn 2008, he moved to Villanova, Pennsylvania — near Philadelphia — for college, and over the years it became clear he was never moving back to New York. He's now married and they live there with their two young children.\n\nNew York suits me just fine, but not so much for my son — between the impossible parking and our three-story walk-up, he wasn't interested.\n\nI understand why. When he used to visit, I'd have to go downstairs to help him haul everything up. We did have two bedrooms, which is a luxury in Manhattan, but there still wasn't a comfortable place for him and his family to sleep, and I'd end up on a blow-up mattress.\n\nIt was just untenable; they didn't enjoy visiting.\n\nAbout two years ago, my wife noticed that a new complex was being built around the corner from us called the Harper. She's a painter and interior decorator, so she wanted to take a look.\n\nWe toured a two-bedroom apartment, which we thought was very nice, but it was also small. Still, we thought the building's amenities were fantastic. They have a gym, music room, game room, playroom, and creative studio — which we thought would be great for our grandkids.\n\nWe sat with the idea for a while. A couple of months later, we went back to see a larger unit — a model of about 1,853 square feet with an 80-square-foot terrace and three bedrooms, one of which could be used as an office.\n\nAfter that tour, it didn't take us long to decide to move to the Harper. In the end, it took a couple of months to stage our old co-op, and then a few more months to sell.\n\nThe best things I've ever done in my life are being a good father and grandfather. My son texts or calls me at least once a day, and that's my proudest accomplishment — even more than being admitted to the bar at 48 after going to night school for four years while supporting a family.\n\nA big reason we decided to upsize and buy the condo was that my wife and I love being around my son and his family, and we really wanted to create a place where the kids would want to come visit.\n\nWe moved into the Harper in March 2024. It's just around the corner from our old place. It wasn't a far move, but we've spent decades living on the Upper East Side for a reason — we love the neighborhood.\n\nOur new condo has a really well-thought-out layout. We have three bedrooms, including a home office, and two-and-a-half bathrooms. When you walk in, you can turn left into one wing, down that hall are the primary closet, the primary bedroom and bathroom, and the terrace.\n\nIf you go to the right instead, a quick left takes you into the kitchen and great room. Further to the right are the guest bedroom and bathroom, a third bedroom that I use as my office, and a small laundry area.\n\nBesides having a larger apartment and living in a building that actually has an elevator, we're especially happy about the amenities. It's such a contrast to our old place, where the only extra space was the boiler room.\n\nOur grandkids especially love the building's music room. They can bang on the drums, sing into the microphone, and strum a guitar. There's also a playroom with a ball pit.\n\nIn the beginning, whenever the grandkids would come over, they would go down to the ball pit three times a day. In the mornings, I'd have to plead with them to finish their breakfast before heading down to play.\n\nIt's obvious they love visiting our new home. The grandkids talk about it all the time, and it's cute to see them arrive, dragging their little suitcases, already excited to play.\n\nI have very fond memories of our old place — it was the first home I ever bought. But over time, living there became stressful.\n\nI was on the board, constantly worrying about the building — especially whether the boiler would work. It was an older property with no central air, just radiators, so there were always issues with the heat.\n\nHere at the Harper, it's a completely different experience. Everything works, we have three separate HVAC zones that you can set to the exact degree, and the staff is great. My biggest dilemma now is whether to go to my gym on 91st Street or just head downstairs.\n\nI think upsizing later in life is a good thing if you're in a position where it makes sense for you.\n\nIf it's within your means to make that choice, do it. You're not just gaining more physical space; you're also giving yourself and your family more options.\n\nWhen my son and his family visit, they have their own rooms and are well taken care of. I think they genuinely enjoy coming now; it no longer feels like an obligation.",

    "description": "The Navy is investing almost half a billion dollars in Palantir artificial intelligence software that promises to speed up shipbuilding processes.",
    "fullText": "The Navy is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into an artificial intelligence system that it says has sped up key shipbuilding processes.\n\nIn one case, the AI cut painstaking processes of submarine schedule planning — mapping out how the many pieces of construction fit together and making sure people, parts, and yard space are available at the right time — from many hours to only minutes.\n\nThe Navy is launching the new Shipbuilding Operating System, or Ship OS, as it tries to break out of decades-old shipbuilding problems rooted in outdated technologies and work practices. The service announced a $448 million investment Thursday, saying it will accelerate the adoption of AI and autonomy across the industrial base.\n\nThe Ship OS technology is powered by Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform and began in pilot programs at submarine shipyards.\n\nAt General Dynamics Electric Boat, a long-time submarine yard located in Connecticut, submarine schedule planning saw a dramatic reduction from 160 manual hours down to under 10 minutes. And at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine, material review times for submarines went from taking weeks to under an hour.\n\nThe $448 million investment will go toward the submarine industrial base and then expand. It'll be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three public yards, and 100 suppliers, Palantir said in a press release.\n\n\"This investment provides the resources our shipbuilders, shipyards, and suppliers need to modernize their operations and succeed in meeting our nation's defense requirements,\" said Navy Secretary John Phelan in a statement.\n\n\"By enabling industry to adopt AI and autonomy tools at scale, we're helping the shipbuilding industry improve schedules, increase capacity, and reduce costs,\" he added, explaining \"this is about doing business smarter and building the industrial capability our Navy and nation require.\"\n\nMaritime Industrial Base Program, a Navy initiative to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair capabilities, and Naval Sea Systems Command are overseeing the implementation of Ship OS. Both are gathering data from multiple sources to identify where the hiccups are in submarine shipbuilding, how the processes, including engineering, can be sped up, and what specific risks can be mitigated through technology.\n\nProblems in the Navy’s submarine industrial base — from shipbuilders to the repair yards — have been building for decades. Submarines are central to any Pacific fight and a top Pentagon priority, yet major programs like the upgraded Virginia-class submarines and new Columbia-class ballistic missile subs have repeatedly run into delays and cost overruns.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, has documented long-standing problems in the Navy's plans for purchasing and constructing submarines, as well as shipyard deficiencies such as worker inexperience, aging facilities and equipment, and inadequate construction space.\n\nThe introduction of the new Ship OS capability aims to address some of these problems facing US submarine shipbuilding. And once the technology has been used for the submarine programs, the Navy said, it'll apply lessons and adapt them to surface ship programs.",

    "description": "The Fed cut interest rates at its December meeting. Here's how it affects your money — from mortgages and auto loans to credit cards and savings.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve made its final decision of 2025, cutting interest rates for the third meeting in a row — and it set the tone for where interest rates will go in the new year.\n\nThe call will have ripple effects across consumer prices, the job market, and Corporate America through 2026 and beyond. Here's how the decision will affect you.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions.\n\nA quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Lower rates would also make home equity lines and small business loans more accessible to Americans.\n\nElizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told Business Insider the cut could be a positive sign for people applying to roles in the sluggish labor market: If job seekers \"hear that the Fed is responding to an unfavorable labor market, that's going to feel good to them; they may feel like relief is on the horizon,\" she said.\n\nThe labor market has shown signs of weakness in recent months. Job seekers of all ages have told Business Insider that they've been through grueling application cycles without an offer, while recruiters are drowning in resumés. Over the summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of available jobs and labor force participation has been trending downward. The unemployment rate, however, is still relatively low, hovering a little above 4% for most of this year.\n\nSustained rate cuts would bolster the job market by making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest money. This would free up more funds for companies to hire and pay employees, which could lead to higher consumer spending — all factors needed for a healthy economy.\n\nAnd lower interest rates are historically good news for the stock market. When it's cheaper to borrow money and approve loans, both companies and individuals are more likely to invest. With more funds in the market, Wall Street could see a boost in 2026.\n\nMadison Hoff contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Walk, don't run: The latest workout trend combines the great outdoors with low-stakes socializing",
    "description": "Data from Strava and AllTrails show a surge in new hiking clubs, while National Parks continue to be top travel destinations.",
    "fullText": "The run clubs that took off in the past few years were outpaced by hiking.\n\nThat's according to new data from Strava, a fitness tracking app, and AllTrails, a hiking navigation app.\n\nStrava's end-of-year report, analyzing data from over 180 million users and surveying over 30,000 users and non-users, found that hiking clubs grew sixfold in 2025 — nearly double the pace of run clubs. In 2025, AllTrails saw a 20% increase in users (i.e., people who created an account on the app) to 90 million.\n\nOnline, you can find hiking clubs for seemingly every preference, whether you're a creative in LA looking for a morning workout, a woman who doesn't want to hike alone in North Carolina, or a \"hot girl\" on the hunt for new travel companions.\n\nWhile run clubs are still popular, hiking and walking have an advantage: simplicity. They offer similar health benefits and social perks — without requiring the same stamina or potentially pricey gear.\n\nCOVID lockdowns famously drew people to the outdoors, whether they joined run clubs or sought out nearby hikes.\n\nAnd then there were National Parks, which experienced a surge of visitors since 2020 during the pandemic — and don't seem to be losing their allure. According to the National Parks visitation data, 2024 broke the record for the highest number of visitors of all time at over 331 million, a 28% increase since 2020.\n\nFive years after the pandemic, National Parks continue to be popular destinations. \"When you start looking at that number as feet on the trail, bodies in the visitor's center, cars on the road, you see that the parks have exploded,\" Jason Frye, a hiking writer who most recently published a National Parks guidebook, told Business Insider. Strava reported that hiking was the second most popular reason for traveling, behind winter sports.\n\nCarly Smith, chief marketing officer for AllTrails, said its data shows many hikers search for locations over 200 miles from their home. \"So we know that people are using us for planning travel and then for navigating and exploring National Parks and other destinations,\" she said.\n\nSmith believes part of the reason hiking and National Parks continue to be hot is that, for many, life still hasn't changed all that much since the peak-remote work pandemic years. \"There are more people working remotely than there were in the past,\" she said. \"Hiking clubs in particular can give people a good sense of community in ways that maybe they aren't finding in other parts of their life.\"\n\nRunning isn't the cardio workout for everyone. It's also not the only — or best — way to burn fat.\n\nWhile sprinting at a very fast pace (zone 4 or zone 5) is great for your heart health, it consumes more carbs than fat compared to a brisk walk or light jog.\n\nHiking long distances with a heavy backpack can help hit two goals: shedding fat while building muscle.\n\nThat's partly why rucking, or walking with weights, became a buzzy fitness trend last year. We saw a boom in networking events where people chat shop while breaking a sweat.\n\nPrice-wise, hiking, rucking, and walking also more financially accessible than joining a luxury gym. Weighted vests, the walking accessories du jour, cost about $30-$40 on Amazon — though a backpack from GoRuck, one of the biggest players in this space, starts at $115.\n\nPlus, in many cases, hiking and walking can be interchangeable: not all hikes have to be strenuous to count, making them less physically and financially daunting.\n\nFrye, who lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, near Great Smoky Mountains National Park, said there are many hiking trails nearby that are \"really walks in the woods more than true hikes.\"\n\n\"You can hop out of the car and do it in your flip flops from most of them,\" he said — no high-tech gear needed.\n\nAccording to Strava's report, walking was the second-most tracked activity in 2025, after running. Along with hiking, both activities can feel like a more low-stakes group activity than a seven-mile run.\n\nJonathan Jacobs, who started a men's walking group in LA this year, previously told Business Insider that the accessibility of walking made newcomers more likely to show up.\n\n\"Men who come to the walks repeatedly tell me that the low barrier to entry — no need to sign up or pay a fee to join — makes it easier for them to commit,\" he said.\n\nCity dwellers who partook in walking Manhattan from \"tip to tip\" — another popular TikTok trend of the year — also cited it as a memorable (but still low-key) experience with their friends.\n\nFrye believes the hiking hype is all part of the same phenomenon behind the renewed interest in dumb phones and old-school activities like pickling and crocheting.\n\n\"There seems to be this cultural shift, away from the digital and more toward the analog,\" he said. \"We're looking at these ways to return to easier things, and it doesn't get much easier than hiking.\"\n\nDecember 10, 2025: A previous version of this story stated that the Strava report data came from 30,000 Strava users. It came from 180 million users, as well as an additional survey of 30,000 users and non-users.",

They added that the attack was carried out in cooperation with the Ukrainian navy and shared footage captured by the Sea Baby drones showing multiple hits on the ship.\n\nSeveral Western countries and the European Union have sanctioned the $30 million tanker, which has been used for Russian oil exports and is known to sail with its transponder switched off, Ukraine's HUR military intelligence agency said.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the extent of the damage. Russia's defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe attack on Wednesday appears to mark the third time in the last two weeks that Ukraine has disabled a tanker belonging to the \"shadow fleet.\" In late November, the SBU used naval drones to strike and damage two vessels before they loaded at Novorossiysk.\n\nThe \"shadow fleet\" is a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports, a major source of revenue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged Kyiv's international partners to do more to prevent the ships from operating.\n\n\"The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the receipt of petrodollars to the budget of the Russian Federation,\" the security source said on Wednesday, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nUkraine has been stepping up its attacks against the Russian energy sector, the revenue from which fuels its war efforts, in recent months. Kyiv has used long-range drones to strike oil refineries and other facilities and infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe three tanker attacks appear to reflect a new shift for Ukraine — one that now increasingly attacks ships at sea rather than just land targets.",

    "fullText": "The Hollywood bidding war between Paramount Skydance and Netflix has created a meme frenzy.\n\nThe two media giants are in an all-out battle for Warner Bros. Discovery after it accepted Netflix's offer to acquire its studio and streaming businesses for an equity value of $72 billion. David Ellison's Paramount launched a hostile $30-per-share bid for all of WBD on Monday.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery owns the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, the HBO Max streaming service, and TV networks such as CNN, TNT, and TruTV. It confirmed receipt of Paramount's unsolicited offer on Monday.\n\nBoth entities have made their cases on why they'd be the best owner for WBD. Although internet comedians don't have a say in where the deals land, it hasn't stopped them from weighing in with viral jokes about the dueling companies and their quest to acquire WBD.\n\nSome social media users are poking fun at the back-and-forth with memes about how far each company is willing to go to gain WBD's favor. One post compared the battle for the best offer to a scene from the HBO business drama \"Succession,\" a title Netflix would own if the deal goes through.\n\nA post shared by Karl Smith, CFA (L1 Candidate) (@wallstreetintern)\n\nThe Instagram meme account Litquidity used parody images that appeared to be AI-created of two business leaders speaking at the DealBook Summit to mock how each company is trying to prove its offer is better.\n\nNetflix and Paramount trying to show off why their Warner Bros acquisition offers are better pic.twitter.com/mjpP7sjAnA\n\nSome people seem to be using humor to cope with the idea of more consolidation in Hollywood.

It could lead to job cuts in the entertainment industry as the giants consolidate their power. The trends of streaming services getting pricier and fewer movies hitting theaters could also continue, as companies release less content, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEither way — as with many serious big business deals — consumers and industry insiders are finding ways to laugh through it.",

    "fullText": "The Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, and the meeting held some key takeaways for how the central bank is thinking about the economy heading into 2026.\n\nFrom the labor market to inflation to stocks, here's everything to know about the latest Fed decision.\n\nFed leaders anticipate more economic growth in 2026 and stable unemployment levels, but are somewhat concerned about slowing labor demand and participation. Lower rates could help juice hiring, Powell said.\n\nIn terms of AI, the Fed chair said chatbots are not yet replacing jobs — even as Corporate America sees shrinking while collar roles. \"It's part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet,\" he said. And, though some Big Tech firms and major retailers, have had high-profile cuts in 2025, Powell added that overall layoff rates are still relatively low.\n\nThe figure remains slightly above the Fed's 2% goal, though data is limited due to the government shutdown. With lower rates, there's a risk consumer prices will rise too. At the same time, Powell said consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of inflation right now is tariff policy, not broad economic weakness.\n\nIt was a hawkish rate cut overall, but markets rallied sharply anyway.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged up to a near-record close and the Dow jump almost 500 points, adding to gains as Powell's press conference got going. A few things came out of the meeting that boosted investors' bullishness.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to name a successor in January.\n\n\"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place.\"\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee showed significant division on Wednesday, with three members dissenting to the cut call. It's the biggest split seen at a Fed meeting since 2019 and signals ongoing tension between the Fed's dual mandate and how each member weighs employment and inflation risks.\n\nPowell, however, said there's no bad blood.\n\n\"The discussions we have are as good as any we've had in my 14 years at the Fed,\" he said. \"They're very thoughtful and respectful and people have strong views",

    "description": "Paramount's David Ellison wants to buy all of Warner, including its cable networks. How much they're worth is a big part of his fight vs. Netflix.",
    "fullText": "The fight between Paramount and Netflix over Warner Bros. Discovery is ultimately about who gets to control HBO and the Warner movie studio.\n\nBut the way that fight gets settled is going to involve an unusual side quest: CNN, TNT, the Food Network, and a bunch of other cable networks WBD wants to get rid of. Specifically: What are all of those shrinking cable networks worth?\n\nWhich leads us to a pretty weird place: Paramount CEO David Ellison, who wants to buy all of WBD — including its cable networks — is arguing that those cable networks aren't worth very much at all. And Netflix, which doesn't want to buy those cable networks, is implicitly arguing that they're worth much more.\n\nThat's because in the Netflix scenario, current WBD shareholders would go through two transactions: First, WBD would spin out its cable networks into a new company, and WBD investors would be given shares in that new company. Then Netflix would buy the remainder of WBD — HBO and the studio — for cash and stock.\n\nWhich means Netflix, and WBD executives who have blessed the Netflix offer, will want investors to think the cable networks are valuable. Ellison wants them to think the opposite.\n\n\"The lower you value the cable assets, the greater advantage Paramount's bid has. If shareholders believe the cable operations are more highly valued, then Netflix's bid, which assumes they will be spun off, means investors get an overall bigger sum of money.\"\n\nAnd here's the actual gap: Ellison says the spin-off is worth about $1 per WBD share — or roughly $2.5 billion, based on WBD's current valuation. Independent analysts think it might be closer to $4 per share — or roughly $10 billion. Paramount and Netflix reps declined to comment; WBD hasn't responded to my request.\n\nSo one side is describing a rounding error, especially when it's part of a deal that could be worth $108 billion. The other is describing, more or less, a midsize media company.\n\nAnd yes, this is equity value, not enterprise value — this already assumes the spin-off gets saddled with billions of WBD's debt under the Netflix plan. But we're going to focus this conversation on the shares that ultimately end up in a WBD investor's brokerage account.\n\nAnd if you believe David Ellison and Co., those investors aren't getting much. Because CNN, Turner, and all of the networks formerly owned by Discovery aren't worth much at all.\n\nAnd yes, the cable network industry is a falling knife, which is why many big media companies that own cable networks are trying to ditch them. But are things really that bad?\n\nMaybe. Maybe, using Ellison's math, all of CNN plus a pile of other cable networks — which still generate cash, mind you — are worth about 16 Bari Weisses, based on the reported $150 million he paid for her Free Press site.\n\nOr maybe all of that is worth $10 billion — which means it's still less than 1% of Google. Which feels like a metaphor for the entire media industry in 2025: Even a roomful of famous brands barely registers in a world run by giant software companies.\n\nSomewhere in that $2.5 billion to $10 billion range is the real answer. But the headline is clear: The networks that once held the entire cable bundle together are now garage sale leftovers. Worth something to someone — but a whole lot less than they used to be.",

    "fullText": "\"Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story,\" Expedition 33 creative director Guillaume Broche told GameSpot.\n\n on December 10, 2025 at 10:53AM PST\n\nThe Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees--and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive.\n\nEarlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.\n\nNow, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.\n\nBroche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were \"a lot of arguments\" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.\n\nGameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the game's tremendous success?\n\nBroche: I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, \"Is this real?\" or, \"Can you believe that?\" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a \"less is more\" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.\n\nWe always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain \"less is more\" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more \"real\" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.\n\nFor the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.\n\nI've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or \"good\" ending to the game?\n\nThat’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the \"good\" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.\n\nMany sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?\n\nActually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.\n\nOne major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!\n\nWhether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. The Game Awards airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "description": "You can do a lot more with your Chromebook.",
    "fullText": "If you've chosen a Chromebook as a laptop, then you know the main benefits that it brings: namely, speed, ease of use, and affordability. Despite the simplicity of ChromeOS, however, there's more that you can do with it than you might realize. You can use it offline, and you can sync files to and from local storage, for example. The operating system is a lot more powerful and versatile than it often gets credit for.\n\nThese hacks are for power users who want to level up their Chromebook capabilities, and get extra value out of their laptop, beyond the standard use cases that everyone knows about. No matter how you use ChromeOS, there should be something here to help.\n\nChromebooks are often criticized for being useless without wifi, but that's not actually the case: All of the Docs, Sheets, and Slides tools can be used offline, with changes syncing back when your internet connection is restored: From Google Drive, click the gear icon (top right), then choose Settings > General and check the option under the Offline heading.\n\nYou can use Gmail offline, too. You can't send or receive emails, obviously, but you can read through and organize your inbox, and draft emails ready to go once you get your internet back. From Gmail, click on the gear icon (top right), then pick See all settings > Offline. Check the Enable offline mail box and choose how much of your email you want to sync.\n\nThis offline functionality extends to third-party streaming apps too, as ChromeOS supports Android apps. With apps such as Netflix and Spotify, you can sync content to your Chromebook to watch when you don't have a reliable internet connection—when you're on a long flight, for example, or traveling between countries.\n\nTyping is all well and good, but sometimes talking is faster. Launch Settings, then choose Accessibility > Keyboard and text input > Dictation to enable the feature. You can then press the Launcher (G) button and D to start dictating in any app—whether you're composing emails or writing essays.\n\nOne of the pros of using a Chromebook is that everything is synced online pretty much instantly, if you're using one of Google's own online apps or something similar. However, there may be local files that accumulate on the laptop, including screenshots and downloads, and sometimes you'll want to get those synced to the cloud as well.\n\nYou can see these files via the Files app that comes built into ChromeOS, and upload them manually via the Google Drive web interface. There's an easier way to get them into Google Drive, though: From the Files app, select all the local files you want to upload in the pane on the right, then drag them into My Drive under Google Drive in the left-hand menu bar.\n\nChromebooks don't always have the biggest or highest-resolution screens, but you can give yourself more room by managing multiple virtual desktops (which ChromeOS calls \"desks\"). Press the \"show windows\" key (it's the one with little rectangles on it, usually also labeled F3) to view open desks, switch between them, and create new ones.\n\nAs ChromeOS is so tightly tied to your Google account, you don't necessarily want other people borrowing your laptop and being able to get into your Google apps. The solution is guest mode: Restart your Chromebook or sign out of your current user account, then click Browse as Guest to launch a Chrome window without any Google account attached.\n\nChromeOS can sometimes feel limiting in that you can't quickly drag files to the desktop or to a temporary folder in the same way that you can on Windows or macOS. You might also see that as a benefit—it means less junk will be cluttering your system—but there could well be times that you just need to store something temporarily for transfer.\n\nThat's where the ChromeOS clipboard comes in: It actually stores five items rather than one, so it's a useful (if rather hidden) way of moving images, text, and links between websites and apps. Use the usual Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, and Ctrl+V shortcuts to copy, cut, and paste, then hold down the Launcher (G) button and V to see all the clipboard items.\n\nThe ChromeOS Task Manager is useful for everything from shutting down crashed apps to seeing exactly where all your RAM is going, and it can be a key tool in the power user's belt. Open it by pressing the Launcher (G) key and Esc: You'll see you can browse between individual tabs and system processes, or search for something specific on ChromeOS.\n\nChromeOS isn't just for Chromebooks: You can give an older, struggling laptop a new lease of life by installing ChromeOS Flex on it (even old laptops can usually handle Chrome). Google has full instructions for what you need to do to get this working, and will guide you through the process of creating a bootable USB drive with the ChromeOS software on.\n\nAs with a lot of software, there are beta and dev channels of ChromeOS available as well as the stable one. If you want to get the newest Chromebook features before everyone else, and don't mind a few bugs along the way, then you can make the switch. It doesn't take long, and you can always switch back again, though a system reset is sometimes required.\n\nTo change between ChromeOS channels, click on the time panel (bottom right), then click the gear icon to get to the main Settings page. Choose About ChromeOS > Additional details > Change channel, then choose whichever one you want to use. You'll keep getting over-the-air updates for your selected channel until you switch to a different one.",

    "title": "Colorado's Once-Thriving Mountain Town Between Grand Junction And Denver Is Now Abandoned",
    "description": "This Colorado ghost town is an eerie reminder of mining's negative effects and can be seen from Highway 24, not far from the capital of the Mile High State.",
    "fullText": "The story of Gilman, Colorado, reads like a horror movie. The setting: a small Rocky Mountain town in 1984. The characters: the residents of a centuries-old mining community. The plot: the soil is contaminated with deadly toxins, and authorities flood the town, urging people to evacuate. Locals leave with whatever they can, and as they drive away, look longingly at the rows of ranch homes they've left behind. Silent roads are stippled with empty buildings. Above them, at the top of a dirt hill, looms a massive processing plant, a grim symbol of the district's environmental collapse.\n\nLike St. Elmo, one of the American West's best-preserved ghost towns, this place casts a haunting spell. The real history of Gilman was a bit less dramatic, but it ended the same way. The town was founded in 1886, and workers moved to the area to mine zinc, copper, silver, and gold. Over the next century, they would extract 10 million tons of material. Production started to decline in the 1960s, and by the time the Environmental Protection Agency arrived in the mid-80s, mine runoff had tarnished Gilman's groundwater. The landscape was so deadly that residents were ordered to leave, and the town's collapse has since served as a cautionary tale about unregulated industry.\n\nThe remains of Gilman still hug the steep slopes of Battle Mountain. Its ruins now stand on private property, which is off-limits to visitors. But you can still stop and see Gilman from the shoulder of Highway 24, which runs parallel to the site. There's a broad gravel area to park on, which overlooks a building-studded valley. Stopping there is free, and it's the only legal way to see Gilman's remains. Bring binoculars, or better yet, a telephoto lens.\n\nGilman is hardly alone when it comes to abandoned Colorado towns. Seven hundred ghost towns were scattered across the state as of 2018, representing a wide range of industries and eras. Intrepid explorers have made their way into Gilman, photographing and filming the town's crumbling remains. What's so unsettling about these images is how contemporary they all look. The buildings aren't frontier shacks, but split-level homes you could find in modern-day suburbs.\n\nYoung trespassers have left patches of graffiti on the old walls. Many of these roads are still paved in modern asphalt, although their surfaces are cracked after countless winters without maintenance, with mature evergreens growing through their cracks. At its peak, nearly 9,000 people lived on this ridge, overlooking the confluence of Rock Creek and the Eagle River. Today, even that modest population is hard to imagine. A few rows of gutted houses are still visible on the grassy terraces, but they offer only a vague impression of what life there was once like.\n\nGilman feels more remote than it is. Highway 24 weaves its way through the mountains and connects with Interstate 70, the main motorway between Denver and the major western Colorado town of Grand Junction. If you're already seeking the ultimate destinations to visit on a trip through Colorado, this site is surprisingly close to some of the state's major landmarks. Just 20 minutes from Gilman is the world-famous ski town of Vail, which draws 2.8 million visitors every year.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?",

    "title": "Instagram Is Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Some Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—we can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we can control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, Instagram is now experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the clickbait treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Google told Maiberg the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI reached out to Meta for comment, and this story originally published before they responded. However, a Meta spokesperson has since confirmed to me that Instagram has recently started generating these titles using AI. The goal, according to the spokesperson, is to make it easier to know what a post is about before you click the link. They also noted that these headlines might not be totally correct, as with all AI products. In addition, the spokesperson explained that search engine optimization indexing is not necessarily new. The company has been doing this for years in the U.S. to increase visibility for posts from professional accounts.\n\nThat last point is all fine and good, of course. No one is surprised that Instagram is indexing posts for search engines: Most social media platforms do that. Otherwise, you'd never find any of their posts on platforms like Google. The issue is generating fake headlines with AI without letting anyone know about it. Just because Meta AI is capable of generating headlines doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts, a risk the Meta spokesperson readily admits to. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"\n\nWhile Meta has yet to add a dedicated on/off switch for these headlines, one thing you can do to ensure your posts don't get an AI clickbait makeover is to opt out of indexing as a whole. If you run an account that relies on discoverability, this might not be worth it, since you'll be impacting how users find your posts outside of Instagram. However, if you don't care about that, or you don't need the SEO at all, you can stop Instagram from making your posts available on search engines—and putting an end to the AI-generated headlines, at that.\n\nThere are three ways to accomplish this, according to Instagram:\n\nMake your account private: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. Here, tap the Private account toggle.\n\nSwitch your account from professional to private: Open Instagram's in-app settings, scroll down and tap Account type and tools. Here, choose \"Switch to personal account.\"\n\nManually opt out of indexing: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. You should see an option to stop your public photos and videos from appearing in search engines.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Android User Should Know",
    "description": "Identify battery-hungry apps, force dark mode system wide, and block ads and trackers.",
    "fullText": "Android remains one of the most customizable mobile operating systems out there, despite Google's recent efforts to rein it in. You don't necessarily have to root your Android device to get it to do something off script, either. The fix you need might be hidden behind a system menu or Developer Options. You can personalize Android to address common frustrations with speed, battery life, privacy, and the interface as a whole. I've compiled ten helpful Android hacks that require no third-party apps, no ADB commands, and no rooting. All you need is the patience to dig through the operating system and tap as required.\n\nPlease note that many of these hacks require you to enable Developer Options, Android's hidden menu of settings. To do so, head to the Settings menu, scroll to About phone, then tap Build number. Tap it seven times to unlock developer mode. (You'll see a countdown pop-up if you did it correctly.)\n\nHave you ever looked at your battery usage stats and wondered what to do about a specific app that's draining your battery? Android needs apps to run in the background, sync with the cloud, and check for updates by default. As it does this, it wakes the device and consumes battery in the background.\n\nAndroid introduced a battery optimization feature in version 6.0 that's supposed to help with apps that drain too much battery. While it's helped shut down unused apps, it can be either too aggressive or not aggressive enough at identifying bad apps. And while you can force-close an app to kill it when you notice it's causing issues, it will likely start up again the next time you reboot your device.\n\nYou can manually set an app's background privileges to the most restrictive setting without deleting or disabling it. In Settings, under Apps, scroll down and tap to view all your apps in a list. Then, tap App battery usage. Here, you will find details about the last time the app was accessed. Tap on the app to adjust its background usage. You can choose to have it optimized by the Android system or unrestricted—something you might use on a wearable to ensure it works properly, for instance. If you want it restricted completely, use the master switch to toggle off background usage. On Samsung devices, this same option is called \"sleeping apps\" or \"deep sleeping apps.\"\n\nOptionally, you can turn to Developer Options to get more robust control over background processes. Head back to Developer Options, then scroll or search for Background process limit, and from here, you can decide how many background apps fire off at a time.\n\nEven with an ad blocker, background apps can still track your phone use, where you shop, and which ads to show you. You could easily circumvent this by installing a VPN app to route traffic, but that relies on a third party app, and slows down performance. You are better off configuring your phone's Private DNS settings to filter web traffic through a service of your choosing.\n\nPrivate DNS seals the request your device makes to look up a website's IP address, so your carrier can't see the website you're visiting. Since that browser data stays hidden, third parties don't have the data they need to track your habits and, subsequently, target you with ads.\n\nNavigate back to the Settings panel and select Network & Internet > Private DNS. Change the setting to Private DNS provider hostname. You will need to find the URL of a filtering service to link here. Options include Ad Guard, Control D, and Mullvad, which is what I use to block ads in Chrome.\n\nOnce you save, this will redirect all DNS requests from every app and browser on your Android device through this specific block list. It should help cut down on ads and tracking servers watching you without cutting down on performance or battery life. This is also a great hack if you're a parent and your kid has access to an Android device. Use Private DNS to route them away from unsafe sites and adult content.\n\nSometimes, we accidentally dismiss a notification on Android. If you're always snoozing and missing out on important pings, you can turn on notification history.\n\nIn Settings, under Notifications, tap to turn on Notification history. Now, when you swipe to dismiss your alerts, you can peek in here to see what you forgot or accidentally swiped away. This feature is also helpful for tracking any apps that might be quietly running in the background.\n\nI don't know what it is about these latest versions of Android, but the text feels either too small or too big when adjusted with the built-in display size settings. You could go into the Accessibility settings to make the text smaller or larger, though it doesn't affect the rest of the interface much. Or you could deploy Android's display density (DPI) scaling hack.\n\nThis is where the developer options come in handy again. You can use the Smallest Width setting to control the DPI precisely, which scales every interface element up and down. Change the value to a higher number if you want fonts and images to shrink down within the resolution—if it starts in the 400s, for instance, try 500 and work backwards until you like what you see. To make fonts and graphics even larger, start around 300.\n\nWhen you plug an Android phone into a PC, it defaults to charging the device rather than turning on file transfer. You can change the option from the notification shade, though it adds a few extra steps to something that should be straightforward. Fortunately, you can tweak the USB default behavior to prioritize file transfers when the device is plugged in via USB-C.\n\nIn the Developer Options, look for Default USB configuration. Change the setting to File Transfer/Android Auto. Test it by plugging a USB-C cable into a PC to ensure it defaults to file transfer mode.\n\nWhen you stream music or podcasts through headphones or another external source, the audio isn't at its best. And while you could adjust the equalizer settings in the app that's streaming media, it won't fix much. Your phone and the audio device default to standard codecs rather than high-fidelity ones, which is why it doesn't sound as crisp and loud as it could.\n\nYou can force Android to use the highest-quality codecs whenever the audio device connects in Developer Options. Search for a Bluetooth audio codec and select the highest-quality option supported by your wireless device. Note that you must be connected to the device when you look for this option, or it will appear grayed out. While you're in the Developer Options, look for Bluetooth Audio Sample Rate and Bits Per Sample. You can adjust these to higher sampling rates if your hardware supports it.\n\nEven on the latest Android flagships, the interface can feel sluggish as you're moving between screens. That's because Android deliberately animates between every swipe and flick. But you can eliminate or shorten these animations to make the interface feel more fluid.\n\nIn Developer Options, look for Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. You can adjust their defaults; the lower the number, the faster the animation. You can also choose to turn the animation off completely if it's just too much.\n\nI suffer from migraines, and the brightest background can trigger the pain. I figured out how to force every Android app into dark mode, regardless of whether the developer coded it in.\n\nFirst, ensure \"Dark Theme\" is on in your main display settings. Then, navigate to Developer Options and search for Override force-dark. Toggle it on to save your eyes. This feature is also super helpful if you prefer to stare at the screen at night to read. Note that it may cause some apps not to display text properly, in which case, you might want to reserve this ability for when it's most necessary.\n\nSometimes you need the display to stay on without timing out. Most Android devices tap out at 30 minutes. But in the developer settings, there is an option to keep the screen \"awake\" as long as the device is plugged into a power source. I've had this feature enabled since I started covering Android phones. It's the best way to run benchmarks without being affected by random variables.\n\nIn Developer Options, search for Stay awake, then switch it on. Note that you will need to turn off the screen when charging the device overnight. Your phone could get hot from being connected and having the screen on for too long.\n\nThis has happened to me so many times: my phone rings, I answer it, but the call is routed to my smartwatch instead of my buds. While you could manually go into the phone and select the appropriate Bluetooth device, make it easier on yourself by eliminating the devices that you never want to answer the phone.\n\nIn the Settings panel, under Bluetooth, select the offending device. The easiest way to keep it from rearing its ugly head is to find the switch that completely disables phone calls. You should see an option for it at the bottom of the device's Bluetooth settings. I've disabled the Pixel Watch 4 from answering any calls because there's no instance I'd ever want to take a call from my watch. It's too public!",

    "description": "Wasn't this a thing already?",
    "fullText": "Forgetting where you parked your car isn't just a sitcom trope—though it does make for classic TV. Even in the age of the smartphone, it's all too easy to walk away from your car and retain zero memory of where you left it. As it happens, Google Maps has a solution—provided you have an iPhone.\n\nSo long as you're running the app on an Apple device, Google Maps can automatically remember where you parked and display that information on the map. There's no need to mark the location yourself, tell the app to save your spot, or take a picture of the cross streets in case you forget: You can simply glance at the screen to find a \"You parked here\" label.\n\nThe thing is, while some are reporting this feature is relatively new to them, others suggest it's been out for a while. What gives?\n\nThis feature works if you connect your iPhone to your car, whether via Bluetooth, CarPlay, or a USB cable. When you disconnect your iPhone from your car, Google Maps will assume you've parked, and will automatically mark that location on the map. The feature will also work if you give Google Maps permission to access your Motion & Fitness data, which allows the app to tell when you've started and stopped driving. (You can check on this setting from Google Maps' in-app settings: Head to Navigation, then, under \"Automatically save parking,\" tap Let maps use your motion to save your parking.)\n\nYou can also choose to set Google Maps' location permissions to \"Always,\" which gives the app persistent access to your location data, and also lets it figure out when you've stopped your car. You can change this option on your iPhone by navigating t0 Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Google Maps.\n\nThis feature is genuinely great, and I'm happy Google Maps supports it—even if Android users are inexplicably being excluded for now. But you might also be wondering to yourself, wasn't this already a feature? It doesn't sound all that new. Yet you might have even seen a flurry articles like this one today, all reporting on this \"new\" Google Maps parking feature.\n\nAs it turns out, the answer is a bit complicated. The coverage today all references this announcement on LinkedIn from Google Maps senior product manager Rio Akasaka—only that post is, according to LinkedIn, a month old. Some of the comments are more recent, but others appear to be from the original posting date.\n\nPotentially adding to the confusion, other navigation apps, like Apple Maps, already support automatically saving your parking spot, and while Google Maps has also had an option to save your parking spot for some time, it previously wasn't automatic. If you wanted the app to remember where you stopped, you needed to tap your blue dot on the map and choose \"Save your parking.\" That's how it still is on Android, since the automatic feature only works on iOS.\n\nLooking through the comment sections on articles from outlets like The Verge or MacRumors, some users insist they've had this feature for some time—well before that month-old LinkedIn announcement. This commenter says they've had the feature for years, while this one claims they've had it for \"ages.\" So what gives? Have at least some iPhone users have had this feature for years? It is possible Google has been testing out the feature with smaller subsets of users and only recently rolled it out en masse, but whether or not that actually happened is unclear at this time.\n\nI've reached out to Google for clarification about the timeline of this feature's implementation, and I will update this article if I get an answer. Until then, I can only hope Google is actively working on rolling out the feature to Android, as that really would be something new.",

    "fullText": "One of the best lessons I've learned across years of DIY projects is the fact that, whether powered by hand or by electricity, your tools can can serve more than the purpose for which you purchased them—provided you get creative with how you put them to use. Often, you can use two tools together to improve their performance, make them more versatile, make them easier to use, or even to to replace a tool you’re missing.\n\nHere are 10 unexpected ways to combine your hand tools and power tools to make DIY work a little easier.\n\nEye hooks serve a wide range of uses, but if you’ve ever had to drive a bunch of them into wood, you know how frustrating they can be. The usual move is to either slip a screwdriver through the hook and twist, which is slow and awkward, or to clamp a wrench or pair of pliers on top and twist, which is...also slow and awkward.\n\nThis works better: Place an Allen wrench in your power drill’s chuck, slide the end of the wrench into the eyehook, and let the drill do the work. It's faster, it saves your elbows and wrists the strain, and you’ll wonder why you never thought of it before.\n\nWood glue can be a lifesaver when you have a damaged piece of lumber—but only if you can actually get the glue inside the crack. If you’ve ever tried, you know that you wind up with glue smeared everywhere, but only a small amount seeps into the crack, leading to a pretty quick failure.\n\nDrywall knives and putty knives can develop a thick, lumpy buildup of drywall mud, paint, and anything else they’re used to scrape. Eventually, they’re almost useless because their flat surface has developed its own topography.\n\nYou can try cleaning them, but water will rust them and it’s often a laborious process, especially if they’re covered in cement or thinset. If you’ve got an orbital sander, however, cleaning your putty knives and drywall knives is pretty easy. Using a moderate grit (120 works well) pad, just sand down your blade with gentle pressure—don’t overdo it; just let the sandpaper do its work. You’ll have shiny, clean blades in no time.\n\nGetting things level is surprisingly challenging—at least for me. I can measure things five times and still somehow wind up slightly off. That makes a spirit level an essential part of my toolbox for any project (and even then, I am level-challenged, somehow).\n\nIf I forget my level, I’m in trouble—unless I happen to have a carpenter’s square and a chalk line. Place the bottom of the square on the surface you’re checking, and loop your chalk line over the top at the 90° mark so it dangles down. Then adjust until the line is directly over the 45° mark on the bottom. That’s means it's level.\n\nTrying to remove a stuck nail can be an entire project in itself. Your progress freezes while you sweat and strain, and eventually you start to damage the surface as your attempts to pull that nail get wilder and more violent.\n\nTo protect a surface you don’t want to damage and give yourself a little extra leverage on the nail, place a screwdriver under your hammer. This will give your pull a little more oomph while stopping your hammer from gouging the surface beneath.\n\nGot a stubborn nail and don’t have your hammer or prybar? Or dealing with a nail that’s lost its head? You can get it free with the help of a vise grip and a putty knife. Lock the vise grip onto the nail and slide a putty knife onto the surface behind the nail. Rotate the vise grips like a lever, and the nail will slowly pull free, while the putty knife blade protects the surface underneath from damage.\n\nWhen dealing with a screw that seems to be frozen in place, your hand screwdriver often can’t deliver enough torque, and using a power drill with a screwdriver bit is often overkill, stripping the screw in no time. To increase the torque your screwdriver can provide, combine it with a wrench or pair of adjustable pliers. Lock the pliers onto the screwdriver at a 90° angle, push down, and turn with the plier handles. Even the most stubborn screws will work themselves free.\n\nAnother way to tackle a nail that just won’t work itself free (or that’s lost its head) is to combine a vise grip and a flat prybar. Lock the grips onto the top of the nail to act as the head, then angle the prybar underneath and apply pressure. You can also slide a putty knife under the prybar blade if you want to protect the surface you’re extracting the nail from.\n\nWhen I used to rent, I was always infuriated by the “landlord special” repairs that covered screw heads with multiple layers of paint, often to the extent that I couldn’t get a screwdriver or bit to bite. That meant a lot of slow effort scraping paint out of the grooves until I got them clean enough to extract.\n\nInstead of doing that, combine a hammer and a screwdriver bit: position the bit on the screw head and give it some solid taps with the hammer. The crusted paint will fall right out, and you can get on with your work.\n\nHow much time do you think you’ve wasted trying to eyeball a drill bit when driving bolts? You estimate the bit size, you drill the hole—nope, too small. So you grab the next-largest bit and do it again. Or, worse, you estimate the drill bit and the hole is too big, and now you’ve got a problem.\n\nIf you’ve got an adjustable wrench, spare yourself the drama. Tighten the jaws of the wrench onto the bolt, then see which drill bit matches the wrench’s opening. You’ll never have to drill three times for one bolt ever again.",

While Season 1 did include a small celebration of the holidays, it wasn't until Season 7 that Fortnite held a major event with holiday-themed gameplay changes, daily challenges, and lots of free cosmetics.\n\nSeason 7 was an eventful one from the very start, as the Battle Royale island expanded with the addition of a new snow biome in the southwest corner of the map after a massive iceberg crashed into the island. It also introduced airplanes, added possibly the most infamous weapon in Fortnite history, and held one of Fortnite's most memorable live events. Scroll on to see everything you can expect from Fortnite OG Season 7.\n\nThe Season 7 OG pass includes new versions of three skins from the original Season 7 battle pass: Sgt. Winter, Lynx, and Onesie. Onesie seems to be particularly interesting, since the teaser image we have for it shows the new version with a pattern that uses one of Fortnite's emoticons. The new Onesie may be customizable with any emoticon you have.\n\nIt's interesting that the pass did not include a new version of the Ice King, despite the fact that he's the season's main character. Because of that, he's a great candidate to receive a new skin in the item shop.\n\nThe OG pass also includes style options for each skin, along with back blings, pickaxes, wraps, and emotes for each of them. The pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and it's included with Fortnite Crew.\n\nWhen the original Season 7 began, several items were removed from the loot pool, but nothing was added. Over the course of the season, though, a number of new guns and other weapons and items were added, and some existing guns were unvaulted. And one of the most notorious weapons in Fortnite history, the Infinity Blade, was added a week after launch. But more on that a bit further down.\n\nHere are the weapons that will make up the Fortnite OG loot pool in Season 7:\n\nThis weapon, which comes from Epic's mobile game of the same name, is an utterly unique weapon that takes up your entire inventory and gives bonus health and shields when you pick it up, gives siphon on kills, and makes you move faster. The Infinity Blade was so absurdly overpowered that it was vaulted after three days and never returned. Until now.\n\nThe two biggest things added to Battle Royale when Season 7 began were airplanes and ziplines. The Fortnite airplane is the X-4 Stormwing, an old-style biplane with a machine gun on the front. The X-4 only has one seat, but passengers can ride on the wings. Be warned that you will take fall damage if you fall out of one of these.\n\nFortnite had one major live event midway through Season 7, and then was rocked by a series of earthquakes during the final stretch of the season--a trick Epic has used many other times since then.\n\nThe mid-season Ice Storm event, which went down on January 19, 2019, was relatively short but extremely memorable, as it involved the spirit of the Ice King standing over the island and conjuring a blizzard that covered the entire island with snow. When the match began only one corner of the island had snow, and when it ended the snow was everywhere. And it stayed that way for weeks.\n\nThe southwestern corner of the island got a dramatic makeover and expansion for the start of Season 7 with the addition of a large iceberg and a layer of snow cover. The iceberg destroyed the beloved Greasy Grove and Flush Factory, but it added three new named locations with Polar Peak, Frosty Flights, and Happy Hamlet. Season 7 also saw the introduction of The Block in the northwest corner of the island later in the season.\n\nThe Block was a big empty space where Epic would showcase places created using Fortnite Creative tools, which were introduced for the first time at the beginning of Season 7--these user-created spots would rotate regularly. We don't know what, if anything, Epic will do with The Block in Fortnite OG",

    "title": "How (and Why) I Use My Garmin Running Watch to Track Rests During Strength Workouts",
    "description": "Garmin has the most useful rest timer of any wearable I've tried.",
    "fullText": "The strength training mode in Garmin watches like the Forerunner 570 is a little confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly useful in the gym. Garmin handles rest timers better than any other wearable I've tried, and when combined with a third-party app called LiftTrack, you can even track your volume and PRs. I'll lead you through how I use this workout mode, and how it's helped me do more work in less time in the gym.\n\nI’ll get into how to create workouts in a minute, but first I just want to let you know that there are some strength workouts already available for download, if you’d like to just select one and start doing it right now. Go to either your Garmin Connect app or to Garmin Connect on the web, tap Training & Planning, then Workouts, then Find a Workout.\n\nYou’ll be able to choose workouts from a library, and you can search by type (including weights, yoga, and bodyweight cardio). Most of the workouts are short, simple, and don’t use much equipment. If you’re experienced at strength training, you’ll probably want to create your own workouts or use the coach feature, but these will get you started in the meantime.\n\nAs for that coach feature, it works much like the adaptive running coach plans. You can read more here from Garmin, but basically you set it up by selecting Garmin Coach and telling it your goals and schedule. Workouts will then appear for you each day. The image above shows a Push/Pull/Legs workout programmed by Garmin Coach. It let me choose which workout happens on which day, had me set my max lifts as benchmarks (this program uses percentages), and even let me edit the workouts to swap exercises before finally putting them on my calendar.\n\nI’m going to walk you through this step-by-step, because I was so confused the first time I tried to build a workout. Again, you can do this either on your phone or on the web. I usually end up creating my workouts on the phone, and it’s not hard once you get the hang of it. One tip, though: you can skip this whole process if you're willing to install a third-party app. LiftTrack takes care of workout planning and syncs to your Garmin account, and you can read more about how to use that app here.\n\nGo to the “More” menu on your phone (or the sidebar on web) and select Training & Planning, then Workouts, and then Create a Workout. From here, select Strength, and you’ll be given a skeleton of a workout with a warmup, cooldown, and one slot for an exercise.\n\nTo start adding exercises, tap Add Round, which will give you a workout card and a recovery card, both in a little box that says “2 Rounds” at the top. Here’s what you do to turn this into a traditional sets-and-reps format (in this example, we want to do four sets of five deadlifts at 200 pounds):\n\nTap the card that says workout.\n\nSelect an exercise (deadlift), a weight (200 pounds), and a target type. In this case, the target type will be Reps (five). Hit the arrow on the top left of the screen to return to the main workout editing page.\n\nFor the recovery card, you’ll want to change that to Rest rather than Recovery. For that one, the target type should be Time. Let’s set it to three minutes. Return to the main workout screen again.\n\nNow, tap the dropdown at the top of the round and set it to the number of sets you want to do (four). If your watch supports it, you can select Skip Last Recovery to avoid the final rest period.\n\nBefore you add another set, go to the bottom of the screen and tap Add Step. Change this new step to Rest (it will be outside of the repeat) and set the target to Lap Button Press.\n\nNow you have a repeat that will give you four sets of five deadlifts with a three-minute rest timer in between. After you finish that, there will be a rest period that lasts until you press the lap button. This is to give you as much time as you need to find your equipment and set up for the next exercise. Continue adding repeats and steps as desired, and make sure to save the workout when you’re done.\n\nAfter creating a workout, it doesn’t automatically show up on your watch. You need to tap the “send to watch” icon that you’ll see on the top right of your screen when you’re looking at the workout.\n\nYou can also schedule a workout (which will automatically send it to your watch for the scheduled day) by using the three dots menu to add it to your calendar.\n\nThere are a few ways to access the strength workouts, but here’s the easiest: When it’s gym time, hit the button that starts an activity, and rather than selecting Strength, scroll down until you find Workouts. Tap the one you want to do.\n\nPay attention here: You’ll need to select the workout, tell it you want to do the workout, and start the workout. (Just keep pressing the select button until the workout actually begins.)\n\nThe exact details of which buttons do what will vary from watch to watch, but on a Forerunner, your top right button starts and stops the workout, and your bottom right button is a lap button. (During a timed rest, you can press the lap button to skip to the end of that rest and start the next set.) From the top right button, you can also skip a group of sets (say, if the squat rack was busy, you can skip squats) and then use the same menu later to View Skipped and add it back in.\n\nI love using the strength workout feature for one main reason: the customizable timed rests. Rest is important in the gym because you'll be able to lift more if you dial in the perfect rest time for each exercise. It’s easy to sit around scrolling on your phone between sets and realize too late that it’s been 10 minutes since you did your last deadlift. But when I program the workout as above, all I have to do is hit the lap button after my set. Three minutes later, my watch will buzz to let me know it’s time to do the next set.\n\nPro tip: Set your rest timer for the longest time you might want to rest between sets. If you’re aiming for three to five minutes, set it for five minutes. If you’re ready to go after three, just hit the lap button to skip the remainder of that rest.\n\nYou can also program exercises in other ways besides the traditional sets and reps. For example, set the Target Type to Time to do a five-minute density set. Or do EMOMs (every-minute-on-the-minute intervals) by putting just one card inside a repeat, and setting that card to a one-minute target time. You’ll get a beep at the top of each minute.\n\nI don’t worry too much about the weights or reps in the app, to be honest. By default, the watch will ask you after each set how many reps you did and how heavy the weight was. I’ve turned that feature off, and I don’t even bother to set rep or weight targets in the app. I use the workouts for timing, not to log the details of my workout. (I have a notebook for that.)\n\nI also haven’t found the automatic set detection or rep counting to be very useful. The watch is impressively good sometimes—how did it know I was doing pullups?!—but it’s just not good enough to be generally useful. It also doesn’t recognize a lot of the Olympic weightlifting exercises I do. And the rep counting? Sometimes OK, but more often useless. Again, I’d rather jot down my reps in that notebook than fiddle with selecting a number on my watch screen after each set.",

    "description": "The mysterious algorithm is now (somewhat) customizable.",
    "fullText": "After years of suffering from a crippling TikTok addiction, I decided enough was enough: I quit the app cold turkey and deleted it from my phone. Then, I discovered Instagram Reels, and my attention span hasn't been the same since.\n\nTikTok's algorithm is infamous, but we don't give Instagram's enough credit. This platform is addicting. I hardly use the app to keep up with friends and family anymore: Reels grabs my attention and doesn't let go, and before I know it, it's midnight, and I've done nothing with my evening. How many videos did I watch? What did I even watch? Whatever Meta has going on in that algorithm is dangerous stuff.\n\nYou can influence the algorithm, of course: The decisions you make in the app—likes, comments, watch time, sharing—tell the algorithm which videos you like, which you don't, and inform its fraction-of-a-second decisions about what to show you next. But until now, you haven't been able to see what's driving those decisions. You're kind of flying blind—you can try to steer the algorithm in a new direction, but you'll never know exactly what direction you're really going in.\n\nThat's now changing. As reported by Wired, Meta is rolling out a new tab for Reels viewers that will let us see why the algorithm is delivering us these particular videos. This tab, called, appropriately, \"Your Algorithm,\" is now rolling out, first in the U.S., but soon to the rest of the world—at least, only to English speakers. It seems reminiscent of TikTok's \"Manage Topics\" feed, which lets you adjust the content types that appear in your For You feed.\n\nWhen \"Your Algorithm\" hits your phone, you'll find it in the top right corner of the Reels feed: two lines with heart icons placed on each. (I had to update the app and force quit it a couple times to get it to appear.) Once you open this tab, you'll see a short summary of the type of content the algorithm says you've liked recently. In Meta's example, it says, \"Lately you've been into creativity, sports hype, fitness motivation, [and] skateboarding.\" Mine says, \"Lately you've been into classic video games, laughing at comedy clubs, and making beats in the studio.\"\n\nBeneath this summary, you'll find the \"What you want to see more of\" section. Here, you can choose specific content categories you'd like to appear in your feed more often. Instagram will populate some choices here based on your past interests—Meta's example from above shows things like \"Sports,\" \"GRWM,\" \"Thrifting,\" and \"Horror movies\"—but you can tap an \"Add\" button to contribute your own requests. You can tap any of these content types to find the option to watch Reels in that category, in case you want to test drive any before locking in your choices.\n\nBeneath this, you'll find \"What you want to see less of.\" This is the same concept, but the reverse: You can choose any content types you don't want in your feed anymore. If you're sick of seeing hiking videos, but Instagram continues to show them to you, here's your chance to directly tell the algorithm to cut it out.\n\nIf you tap the three dots in the top right, you'll find some shortcuts to existing content controls, too, like whether to suggest political content on your feed, \"sensitive\" content controls, and specific words and phrase filters, to name a few. You can also tap the share button to share your algorithm summary to your story. I'm not sure who would want to do that, but I guess I shared my summary here, so who am I to judge.\n\nWired highlights how these changes come as the European Commission is pushing Meta to present more data controls to EU users: These users have so far been able to pay to not see ads, but since the European Commission didn't think that was enough, Meta will allow users to choose whether to allow all their data to be used for personalized ads, or only a small percentage.\n\nThat's not happening here in the U.S., but that doesn't mean Meta is staying the same, either. \"Your Algorithm\" is launching as Meta is facing criticism over how it handles younger users on its platforms. Reports suggest Meta understands how addictive its apps are, especially to teens, and the company's internal policies for chatbot interactions with minors was, frankly, appalling. The company has rolled out Teen Accounts across apps like Instagram and Facebook, which offer limits on communications and interactions, and new AI parental controls are also on their way. \"Your Algorithm\" seems to be the latest in a string of efforts to make it easier for users to control the experience on Meta platforms. Theoretically, you could even use these controls to make your Reels experience less addicting.\n\nThose are all good developments as far as I'm concerned, but I fear there's still quite a lot of work to do to make Meta's products—as well as many other social media products—less addictive, and, overall, better for us. Case in point: I opened the app to test out \"Your Algorithm,\" and not only did I not find it at first, I ended up losing five minutes of my life watching the first video that appeared in my feed. I need to delete Instagram from my phone.",

    "title": "Does Russian Feminism Have a Future?",
    "description": "Nadezhda...",
    "fullText": "A Russian feminist reflects on Julia Ioffe’s history of modern Russia.\n\nMOSCOW—Julia Ioffe’s new book, Motherland: A Feminist History of Modern Russia, from Revolution to Autocracy (Ecco), immediately brings to mind Soviet Women: Walking the Tightrope (1989) by Francine du Plessix Gray. It was one of the first popular books about Soviet women, published as the Iron Curtain was coming down. The characters of Gray’s book were successful and professional women who talked a lot about their burdensome living conditions, the horrible conditions of Soviet maternity hospitals, about their “emancipation fatigue.” They dreamed of hiding behind a reliable and strong man, whom they often missed from their lives. As a matter of fact, this was indeed the yearning of many women in the Perestroika years. They had become fed up with Soviet hypocrisy and were longing for that “American dream” they had glimpsed in the first films about the West that reached the USSR.\n\nThis illusion evaporated in the1990s—the early days of “Wild Capitalism.” As Katrina vanden Heuvel noted in her review in the Nation, du Plessix Gray failed to discern quite a few of the perestroika realities Nevertheless, the book sparked interest and prompted many researchers and scholars to begin working together with colleagues from the former Soviet Union—and this collaboration proved to be successful. Over the past thirty years, Russian women became the subject of dozens of books and hundreds of articles on both sides of the Atlantic, of newly created university centers, and of dozens of scholarly events and conferences. Unfortunately, most of them are known only to a narrow circle of specialists. At present, academic contacts with Russia are virtually frozen, and dialogue is barely maintained, even though not completely extinguished.\n\nAgainst this background, Ioffe’s book presents itself “as reopening the subject,” almost as if from scratch. It reminds American readers that a vast country of 145 million people has other residents beside Vladimir Putin. This is unquestionably important.\n\nThe author left the USSR with her parents in 1990 as a child. She tells her family story of four generations of women who were educated professionals, while accurately noting that this was commonplace in the Soviet Union. From my standpoint, her family saga is the most interesting part of her book; she alternates the chapters of this story with brief notes on historical figures, including the wives of Soviet leaders, and on many important events of the Soviet era. In the preface, Ioffe defines her task: to understand how “the country of [Alexandra] Kollontai and women fighter pilots become a country of women who wanted nothing more than to become housewives.”\n\nIn essence, she repeats the claim of du Plessix Gray, which is perplexing, and not just for a Russian reader.\n\nIoffe has clearly done a lot of research and surveyed important publications of the period; she reminds readers of the names of historical figures, most of them unfamiliar to Americans, and she does so in an engrossing, at times even cinematic manner. The chapters of the book resemble fragments of a TV series script—with attention paid to the requirements of the genre (and to audience expectations), with the requisite eroticism, glamour and a touch of horror.\n\nAt the same time, those readers who are somewhat familiar with the subject will notice significant gaps in the narrative, arbitrary emphases, a mixture of hearsay and facts, allegiance to the stereotypes transmitted via mass media, and other shortcomings. Undoubtedly, the author of a journalistic book is not a historian and is entitled to her own interpretation. Yet it is regrettable that Ioffe’s version of the history of Russia’s women tells us so little about Russian feminism as such, which emerged long before Kollontai and continues to this day.\n\n“Three projects for the emancipation of women in Russia—pre-revolutionary, Soviet, and post-Soviet feminism—were cut short due to historical factors,” says Russian sociologist Olga Zdravomyslova. “Yet each of them was important for the life and self-perception of the country.” And the Soviet experience of women’s active participation in the economy and society, even though under total control, enabled women to join forces in the 1990s, with the rise of the “wild market,” in efforts to solve their most pressing problems, such as how to put bread on their families’ table, how to maintain sanity, how to “find themselves” in the new, often rough conditions.\n\nIn the years when Ioffe was learning the basics of English grammar in the US, millions of Russian women had lost their jobs (for reasons that included the popular neoliberal myth that women are bad workers and jobs should be given to men), were deprived of government support, kindergartens, and other benefits, they began to learn the basics of entrepreneurship . Those who only the day before were still engineers were now baking pies and trading in the market, importing cheap clothes from China and Poland, and were setting up clubs and coteries while sharing their experience.\n\nI was writing about these women in the mid-to-late 1980s into the 1990s, for glasnost- era publications Ogonyok and Nezavisimaya Gazeta, marveling at their courage and talent, and realizing that they were the ones saving the country, as has often been the case in Soviet history. The independent women’s movement of the 1990s largely emerged as a result of Gorbachev’s democratic perestroika (Gorbachev, incidentally, wanted to involve women more actively in its processes) and quickly gained momentum.\n\nAccording to the results of a study commissioned by the Russian government in 2000, one in five Russians, that is, 30 million people per year, were the recipients of assistance from Russian civic organizations—and most of it was the work of women. NGOs employed two million people. And quite a few of these organizations were not dependent on Western grant money, as businesses and individual citizens started to contribute to them. Women’s organizations existed in every city and village, seeking to solve practical problems. There were academic initiatives, feminist centers, crisis support centers, gender departments in universities, self-help groups, soldiers’ mothers, political clubs, and for a short period, a women’s caucus in parliament. Not all of these efforts were mutually supportive, yet despite this, the results of their work turned out to be impressive.\n\nJust as the six years of perestroika changed the country beyond recognition, so did a decade and a half of active development of the independent women’s movement deeply impact and, most importantly, women’s self-awareness. The 1993 Constitution of the Russian Federation had Article 19, establishing equal rights and opportunities, while the Labor Code and Family Code now included provisions on social and economic protections for mothers.\n\nThere were short-term programs on reproductive health and sex education; even though they were subsequently curtailed, they were kept alive by NGOs. As a result of this, Russia is now on a par with Europe with regards to the number of abortions, while before that it had, along with Romania, the largest number of them among the countries of the world. According to prominent population studies expert Anatoly Vishnevsky, this came about precisely because of all this work, as the new generation internalized new rules of behavior.  believed that this was the result of such work, with a new generation learning new rules of behavior. The rhetoric of patriarchy and its propaganda have not significantly impacted the new rules of behavior.\n\nAs of this year, women make up 45 percent of all entrepreneurs, are included in the Forbes list of billionaires, and hold high level positions not only in the service sector, but also in finance and the oil industry. Most importantly, people’s mindsets have changed.\n\nThese days, a woman in a position of leadership is not perceived as an oddity. The overwhelming majority of Russians consider domestic violence to be a crime, regardless the absence of a corresponding law, and despite the propaganda of patriarchy, and pressure on NGOs. Hotlines and shelters operate in Russia, and the Consortium of Women’s NGOs handles hundreds of cases each year, often winning in court. Mari Davtyan, a lawyer and the head of the Consortium, as well as journalist Eva Merkachova are important voices in the Russian media landscape. Under the new restrictions, many groups operate informally, helping prisoners and refugees from war zones. This huge layer of everyday life in a country spanning nine time zones is not reflected in either the Russian or international media. Women’s activism and feminist thought, awakened by perestroika, continue to develop in cities with millions of inhabitants and modest regional centers. Working in spite of censorship and pressure from the authorities is a long-standing Russian tradition: a wealth of experience has been accumulated, and it is very much in demand today.\n\nOne of the most vivid chapters in Ioffe’s book is called “The Hunt.” It is about women hunting for millionaires and about their coaching school, the Moscow Life Academy. Even though it describes the events of 2012 when Ioffe came to Moscow as a reporter, they also recall, unwittingly, the TV programs from the 1990s.\n\nIoffe believes that the “fairy-tale country” was submerged under authoritarianism waves. The feminist project failed because of men in power.\n\nIs this really so? And is it true that young Russian women dream exclusively of marrying a millionaire?\n\nI remember in the 1990s, some female students really did want to find a sugar daddy so they could live a glamorous life and write for fashion magazines.  In the 2000s, they thought about the benefits of having a rich husband to support their own creative projects.  Meanwhile, in recent years, many stopped thinking of marrying at altogether; instead, they are obsessed with their own projects and would like to pick a like-minded partner in the future. Their life strategy is completely at odds with the propaganda that actively promotes the patriarchal model of the family and the place of women in society.\n\nBut in Russia, propaganda and reality have long been moving apart from each other. A recent study on women in entrepreneurial life by Elena Rozhdestvenskaya, a professor at the Higher School of Economics, yielded unexpected results: a new group of women has emerged, consisting of executives and top managers, often the daughters and granddaughters of influential men. They have no need for rich husbands; they are ambitious and super professional, picking men who are convenient for them. They are transforming the traditional family structure, yet at the same time almost all of them have families and children. They do not express open solidarity with feminist ideas, yet they defend a feminine style of leadership and set up their own private clubs. This is a new type of modern Russian elite.\n\n“As for the future of feminism in Russia,” says Olga Zdravomyslova, “it is hard to say what it will be like. Perhaps young feminists will start all over again, disregarding the past. But it could be different.”\n\nIn the final chapters of the book, Ioffe bitterly concurs with her father’s words that “our homeland is a country without a future.” And yet her book does not leave an unequivocal impression on the reader. Precisely because of its unevenness, its incompleteness, its subjectivity, it is more likely (I would like to think) to encourage us to learn more about the lives of people living in a vast territory spanning nine time zones, and to hear their vibrant and very dissimilar, voices—just like the book by Francine de Plessix Gray did in its own time. At the meetings of the gender caucus of the Yabloko Party in Moscow, in university lecture halls, at artistic events in various cities, I encounter young women who speak passionately about the future of Russia, and the things that can already to be done today to achieve this vision, or what they have already been doing, here and now. Some of them are studying the history of feminism. And while listening to them, I believe in their success.\n\nTranslated by Antonina W.

    "description": "Vance appeared to joke when replying to a user sharing the rumored image: \"I always wear an undershirt in public to fight with my wife.\"",
    "fullText": "A photo shared online in December 2025 authentically showed U.S. Vice President JD Vance arguing with his wife, Usha Vance, in a restaurant.\n\nIn December 2025, an image circulated on social media purportedly showing U.S. Vice President JD Vance arguing with his wife, Usha Vance, in a restaurant.\n\nThe image appeared to show JD Vance wearing a white T-shirt and a stern expression while sitting across from Usha Vance. One Facebook user who shared it (archived) wrote:\n\nLooks like things are not so good in Republicanistan. Usha is a liberal. Always has been. Apparently they were having and [sic] argument loud enough to quiet the restaurant. Why is he wearing a tee shirt?\n\nThe image circulated elsewhere on Facebook and X (archived here and here). In short, it was fake.\n\nAfter Snopes initially published its story, YouTuber Keith Edwards reached out to confirm the image was a thumbnail he created for an October 2025 video, describing it as \"fake.\" Edwards told us he used the artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT to create the image.\n\nThe thumbnail matched the image circulating on social media. In both, the man wore the same facial expression and the woman was positioned the same way. A reverse image search did not lead us to any earlier version of the fabricated image.\n\nJD Vance himself appeared to support the conclusion that the image was fake in a Dec. 9 X post (archived), replying to a user who shared the image with a comment that seemed to poke fun at the rumor: \"I always wear an undershirt when I go out in public to have a fight loudly with my wife.\"\n\nI always wear an undershirt when I go out in public to have a fight loudly with my wife. https://t.co/LUivOsVv2u\n\n— JD Vance (@JDVance) December 9, 2025\n\nWe also ran the image through three AI-detection platforms: Hive, Sightengine and Image Whisperer. Sightengine estimated a 97% probability that the image was AI-generated, while Image Whisperer concluded with \"high confidence\" it was AI-generated.\n\nHive, however, flagged the image as \"not likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content.\" It's worth noting that these tools are not always accurate and their results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nPrior to Edwards' confirmation, the team at GetReal Security, which specializes in authenticating digital media, also analyzed the image for Snopes.\n\nHany Farid, co-founder of GetReal and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told us that the image's low quality made forensic analysis difficult. However, the team found \"biometric anomalies\" suggesting the image \"may be AI-generated or is simply a photo of someone that resembles [JD] Vance.\"\n\n\"In particular, the facial features in the image do not match contemporaneous images of Vance,\" Farid added. Contemporaneous images are photos taken around the same time that are used to verify another image's authenticity.\n\nMatthew Stamm, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Drexel University, told Snopes that he and his doctoral student analyzed the image to determine whether it was AI-generated, using a specialized forensic tool that detects subtle \"fingerprints\" left by generative AI. Stamm said the tool \"determined with roughly 95% confidence that it was unable to detect traces left by generative AI.\"\n\nHowever, he cautioned that this does not prove the image is real and cannot definitively rule out AI generation. Factors such as its size, low resolution and repeated sharing on social media made the analysis difficult, changing \"the quality of the forensic traces that we analyze, similar to how fingerprints at a crime scene might be smudged,\" Stamm explained.\n\nThe fabricated image spread online amid rumors of a rift in the Vances' marriage, which began to spread in October 2025. Photos of Usha Vance without her wedding ring taken the following month further fueled speculation.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson told USA Today in a Nov. 21 statement that Usha Vance \"is a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.\" Other publicly available Getty Images from November showed Usha Vance wearing her wedding ring.\n\nIn a Dec. 4 interview with NBC News, JD Vance said the couple's marriage is \"as strong as it's ever been.\"\n\nX (Formerly Twitter), 9 Dec. 2025, x.com/JDVance/status/1998459532977099256.

    "description": "Scientists used X-rays and CT scans to explore a mummified crocodile, uncovering incredible details about its last meal, and ancient Egyptian rituals.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAncient Egyptians regularly mummified crocodiles in elaborate ceremonies in dedication to their crocodile god Sobek.\n\nA study of one of these crocodiles reveals details about the animal’s death and the methods through which Ancient Egyptians captured these fearsome predators.\n\nUsing x-ray and CT-scanning technologies, archaeozoologists can now explore the insides of these animals, which, unlike human mummification, have their organs intact.\n\nTo uncover the mysteries of the past, scientists employ a wide variety of techniques to get at the truth. Climate scientists drill two-mile-long ice cores to glimpse Earth’s past climatic conditions. Paleontologists analyze sediment layers to visualize the physical timeline of past epochs. And while Egyptologists similarly deploy lots of state of the art archeological techniques, sometimes it’s best to just use a mummified crocodile stomach.\n\nThat’s exactly what researchers at the University of Manchester did with a 3,000-year-old, 7.2-foot-long crocodile corpse, kept at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and known simply as 2005.335. Although Ancient Egyptians typically removed organs when mummifying humans, crocodiles sacrificed to the crocodile god Sobek kept their innards intact, and this small deviation from tradition allows scientists in the 21st century to analyze the organs to unlock mysteries of this strange sacrificial ritual.\n\nTo preserve the specimen for future display, the research team deployed non-invasive techniques, such as x-rays and CT scanning, to catalog the contents of the crocodile’s stomach. Among the ancient gastronomic detritus, scientists found some usual suspects called gastroliths, which are small stones crocodiles regularly swallow to aid digestion.\n\nHowever, the scientists also found intact fish baited to a bronze hook. Because the time frame between the croc’s last meal and its death was so short—the gastroliths hadn’t reached the stomach yet—the crocodile was likely intentionally caught by Ancient Egyptians to be part of a sacrificial ceremony to Sobek.\n\n“Whereas earlier studies favored invasive techniques such as unwrapping and autopsy, 3D radiography provides the ability to see inside without damaging these important and fascinating artifacts,” University of Manchester archaeozoologist Lidija McKnight, co-author of a study published in the journal Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage, said in a press statement.\n\nWhile keeping the long-dead crocodilian intact, McKnight and her team also “virtually” recreated the bronze hook lodged in the specimen’s stomach for future museum displays. McKnight says that in the past Ancient Egyptians likely used hardened clay to create a mold and then poured molten metal over a charcoal fire to create the hook.\n\n“Despite the passing of several millennia between the production of the ancient fish hook and the modern replica, the casting process remains remarkably similar,” McKnight said in the press statement.\n\nAlthough 2005.335 met a grisly fate, crocodiles were actually revered in Ancient Egyptian society for their strength but also their displays of gentleness (especially with their young)—but perhaps they were too revered. Archeologists believe that this Nile-based culture, in which the crocodile was the top predator (besides humans, of course), likely bred the animals specifically for sacrificial purposes by “crocodile cults.” In the Egyptian town of Fayoum, which was the center of worship for Sobek, experts have uncovered thousands of mummified crocodiles, many of them babies.\n\nBut thanks to these long-ago sacrifices, the story behind these ancient mummified crocodiles is finally spilling its guts.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "On Air Force One, Donald Trump was surprised when a door flung open to smack the 79-year-old on his backside.\n\nThis happened on Tuesday night while the President was talking to reporters. Donald was on his way to Monroe County, Pennsylvania, at the time to deliver a speech. While the awkward moment was captured on tape, the President seemed to take it all with a grain of salt, having fun with it all.\n\n.@POTUS: \"You're going to have to take it easy with that thing. It's a government plane, but I like to take care of it.\"\n\nALWAYS WATCHING OUT FOR THE TAXPAYER! pic.twitter.com/i31QMF62XL\n\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 9, 2025\n\nWhat began as friendly banter with the press became a rather bizarre moment on the Presidential plane on Tuesday. Donald happened to be near the bathroom at the time before realizing someone was inside. The door happened to hit the President in the back.\n\nMembers of the media seemed to have a good chuckle over that, including the President, who told the person inside to “come on out.” The nameless person proceeded to close the door, perhaps out of fear of embarrassment or being identified.\n\nTuesday’s moment, while awkward, was one of the more light-hearted ones that we have seen involving Donald and the media. The President doesn’t seem to have a particularly healthy relationship with the press and has notably had very harsh responses to female reporters. He recently attacked Rachel Scott for her question about whether or not they’d release video of alleged airstrikes on Venezuela.\n\nDonald has also verbally attacked female reporters while aboard his plane. Catherine Lucy previously asked him about the Jeffrey Epstein files, prompting Donald to reply, “Quiet Piggy” to her. The Commander-in-Chief looked her dead in the eye and reportedly pointed at her when making the remark, according to reports.\n\nThe President playfully chastised somebody with a large boom mic during the Air Force One moment after they supposedly lost their balance.\n\nTELL US – DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HOW AGGRESSIVE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WHEN ANSWERING THE MEDIA’S QUESTIONS?\n\nThe post Donald Trump Hit During Live Press Conference appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United were given a demonstration of what it takes to be Europe's best on Wednesday night - but manager Marc Skinner hopes his side will learn from it.\n\nLyon, the record eight-time Women's Champions League winners, were far superior in their 3-0 win at Leigh Sports Village.\n\nNo shots on target, and a single touch in the opposition box in a difficult first half, it was a humbling night for United, who are competing in their first European main draw.\n\nBut Skinner, whose side had already secured a play-off spot for the knockout stage, said: \"I am proud of the players. There was a lot of learning. Every one of our biggest defeats, we will always come back better.\n\n\"These players are maxing. You don't want to lose a game but you have to learn from it. It feels horrible but you have to live within the performance parameters.\n\n\"We have already qualified. That was a goal of ours, it must be a goal of ours at Manchester United to go through.\"",

    "fullText": "Noni Madueke might reflect on the Champions League win at Club Brugge as a landmark night in his Arsenal career.\n\nThe 23-year-old scored two goals in Wednesday's 3-0 victory, including a stunning effort from 20 yards, with his all-action performance again showing he can be more than a rotation option for manager Mikel Arteta.\n\n\"An unbelievable goal,\" Arteta said. \"When you talk about individual quality and magic moments, that's it.\"\n\nMadueke has a tough task dislodging Arsenal's key player Bukayo Saka on the right wing, but against Club Brugge he offered a reminder of his talents as one of five players brought into the side after Saturday's defeat at Aston Villa.\n\nIn the summer, his £48.5m signing from Chelsea was questioned by some supporters but the England international won them round with some impressive performances before picking up a knee injury in September that kept him out for about a month.\n\nHe returned at the end of November and scored his first goal for Arsenal in the win over Bayern Munich in the Gunners' last Champions League match.\n\nWhen given the opportunity, he has demonstrated that his versatility and ability to beat a defender can be a key part of Arsenal's season.\n\n\"I think the bare minimum I need to give to my team is threat,\" Madueke told TNT Sports after the win in Bruges. \"Obviously trying to score and be as decisive as possible, that's the next level I need to get to in terms of being consistently decisive for club and country. I think I can reach that level.\n\n\"The first goal was really nice, second a tap-in but the first one was sweet. Delighted with the result.\n\n\"We're fighting on all fronts. I feel like we can win this competition and win the league - that has to be the aim. We're in a good place at the moment.\"",
