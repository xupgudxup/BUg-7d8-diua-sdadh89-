There are plenty of stars on the market such as Cody Bellinger and Kyle Tucker, but so far the Yankees haven’t budged.\n\nNotoriously one of the most prominent spenders every winter, the Yankees are taking a backseat so far.\n\nGary Phillips of the New York Daily News recently asked Yankees GM Brian Cashman about fans wanting the team to spend recklessly in the offseason.\n\n“Fans don't really care about those details. They want what they want. Ultimately, what we both want is to have a team that's going to rack up the win totals to push themselves into the postseason and win it all. But it's just the nature of the beast where you get into the frenzy of the winter times. 'Anything at all cost, doesn't matter,' but in reality, it does matter,” Cashman said.\n\n“Everything adds up. Everything counts,” he added.\n\nNonetheless, the Yankees will do what they can to try and load up for a deep playoff run in 2026, after a disappointing ending to their 2025 campaign.\n\nWinter Meetings may force Yankees to choose which young star to trade\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nCody Bellinger's free agency update is bad news for Yankees",

    "fullText": "Flipping and spinning on a studio floor, 17-year-old Royal is a star in China's breakdancing scene and aiming for gold at the World Championships in Japan this week.\n\nRoyal, real name Guo Pu, shot to fame when she won both the youth and adult Asian Championships in June.\n\nShe is part of a growing Chinese force in breakdancing, which combines acrobatic floor moves, footwork and rhythmic expression to hip-hop or funk and was included as an Olympic sport for the first time at Paris 2024.\n\n\"At first my grandmother would not let me dance breaking because back then, breaking's reputation truly was not very good,\" Royal told AFP at the studio where she trains in her hometown of Pingyi, in the eastern province of Shandong.\n\n\"But after I achieved some results, she stopped saying anything,\" she smiled.\n\nHaving already won the youth world title in August, Royal will compete alongside other \"B-girls\" and \"B-boys\" at the adult World Championships taking place Friday and Saturday in Fukuoka, Japan, the country which has long dominated the sport.\n\n\"I want to win that gold medal for China and show the world that Chinese breaking is getting cooler and cooler,\" she said.\n\nAs a youngster, \"my mother signed me up for all kinds of extracurricular classes, such as playing instruments, then Chinese dance\", Royal said.\n\n\"I also participated in a local children's artistic show for the Chinese New Year. That's when coach Mike saw me.\"\n\nMike, whose real name is Li Shilong, told AFP \"she immediately impressed me\".\n\n\"During her performance I saw a light in her eyes... It was a kind of light that shows a real passion, a real drive for dance and for art.\n\n\"I felt that this girl might have been born for breaking.\"\n\nRoyal has now put school on hold to dedicate her time entirely to dancing.\n\nLike other top athletes in China, she will benefit from easier access to university thanks to her sporting achievements.\n\nRoyal describes herself as \"not very talkative\" and still \"pretty nervous before competitions\", but says she is able to \"open up\" on stage.\n\nIn addition to her Asian and world titles, Royal won gold at this year's World Games -- a top competition for non-Olympic sports.\n\nShe has developed a healthy rivalry with fellow Chinese breakdancer Liu Qingyi, known as \"671\", who won bronze at the Paris Games.\n\nThe country's next generation of breakdancers looks promising, with China winning five out of six medals at the youth World Championships in August.\n\n\"In four years, China has gone from being unknown in the world of breakdancing to ranking among the world's top three and is now seen as the future of breaking,\" Mounir Biba, a 13-time world champion and head coach of the Chinese team, told AFP.\n\n\"There is talent, there is a lot of potential. There are a lot of young dancers in China,\" he said, adding that financial support from the government was helping the sport grow.\n\nHaving breakdancing in the Olympics has encouraged the surge of interest in China, according to coach Mike.\n\n\"Once a discipline is officially recognised as a sport in China it's developed very intensively,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities see an opportunity to win international honours while parents, reassured by breakdancing's new respectability, are more willing to let their children practise it.\n\nThe Chinese DanceSport Federation now organises numerous competitions, Mike said, while funds are allocated to training facilities.\n\nThe only downside, according to the coach, is that some Chinese dancers do not necessarily fully understand the culture of breakdancing, which originated in New York in the 1970s.\n\n\"The (skill) difficulty level in China is exceptionally high. However, the understanding of dance and the depth of exploration into dance artistry remains insufficient,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"This is an area where we need to learn from Western nations,\" Mike said.\n\n\"Breakdancing, and other street dance styles... their essence is innovation. I believe that by understanding the core of this culture, Chinese children will become more creative.\"\n\nRoyal is keen to push the sport's creativity.\n\n\"I really want to inspire the next generation of B-girls,\" she said.\n\n\"By passing on the history and the culture of breaking, and developing a style of breaking that's unique to girls.\"",

    "fullText": "The Mets are looking for a right-handed bat in the wake of Pete Alonso departing for Baltimore, and they've reportedly talked to one National League team about potentially doing just that.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, the Mets and Cardinals have had discussions involving a trade for Willson Contreras.\n\nThe Cardinals are looking to move their veteran pieces like Nolan Arenado, Brendan Donovan and Contreras, but president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom has yet to make a deal. MLB.com's John Denton reports that the Cardinals have fielded several calls already for Donovan and LHP JoJo Romero, with the Mets showing interest in Contreras.\n\nDenton added that Contreras is expected to waive his no-trade clause to play in New York.\n\nContreras, who is entering his age-34 season, has two guaranteed years left worth $36.5 million, according to Spotrac. There is also a club option for the 2028 season, which is worth $17.5 million.\n\nThe three-time All-Star is coming off his third season in St. Louis, where he slashed .257/.344/.447 with an OPS of .791 to go along with 20 home runs and 80 RBI in 135 games.\n\nHe also offers versatility in the field. Contreras played 120 games at first base with the Cardinals last year, but has been the Cardinals' catcher in past seasons, as recent as starting behind the plate 50 times in 2024. He also has 39 games of experience in the outfield in his career, his last being during the 2021 season, but that's not expected to be a part of any plan involving Contreras.",

    "description": "Sherrone Moore, 39, was the head football coach for the University of Michigan before the school says it found ‘credible evidence’ of an ‘inappropriate relationship’",
    "fullText": "Head football coach for the University of Michigan, Sherrone Moore, has been detained just hours after being fired for having an “inappropriate relationship.”\n\nMoore, 39, was detained by police in Saline, Michigan, on Wednesday. He was later turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for an “investigation into potential charges,” the Saline Police Department said in a statement to ESPN.\n\nIt’s unclear what the investigation is in relation to.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Moore was fired “with cause” after a University of Michigan probe found “credible evidence” that the coach “engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,” the school said in a statement shared by multiple outlets.\n\n“This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,” the University of Michigan said.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the Pittsfield Township Police Department and the University of Michigan for comment.\n\nThis was just Moore’s second season as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines. He was given the title in January 2024 after six years as a member of the offensive staff. He was the University of Michigan’s first African American head coach.\n\nMoore has a wife, to whom he’s been married since 2015, and three daughters.\n\nAssociate coach Biff Poggi has been named as the University of Michigan’s interim head football coach.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines finished the regular season at 9-3 and have a game against the Texas Longhorns at the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl on December 31.\n\nDave Portnoy, the founder of sports and pop culture media company Barstool Sports, commended the University of Michigan’s decision to fire Moore.\n\n“On a serious note there have been a lot of schools over the years who have looked the other way with scandals. I’d just like to say I’m proud that Michigan refused to do the same,” Portnoy wrote on X Wednesday.\n\n“Sherrone broke the moral code and it cost him his job. It’s a hard lesson but it’s the Michigan Man Way. Leaders and best for a reason. Proud to be a Michigan Wolverine tonight.”\n\nMoore was also part of a sign-stealing scandal, which resulted in record fines expected to exceed $20 million imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association on the University of Michigan.\n\nSign-stealing is when a sports team decodes an opponent’s hand signals. The NCAA bans schools from sending scouts to future opponents’ games and using electronic equipment to record signals.\n\nMoore was given a three-game suspension for his role in the scheme, which he was expected to complete next year. Reports of the NCAA’s investigation surfaced early in the 2023 season, when Moore was working under Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines came out on top in the 2023 season, winning the College Football Playoff national championship in a game against the Washington Huskies.\n\nPoggi successfully led the Michigan Wolverines for two games this year while Moore was suspended.",

Today we look at:Good morning, this is Ashutosh Joshi, an equities reporter in Mumbai. The Fed’s 25-basis-point cut has taken one big global worry off the table, and regional markets are cheering the move. Whether that’s enough to steady Indian equities is unclear after Wednesday’s late slide pulled the market to a near month-low. Mid- and small-cap stocks may get some relief from the regulator allowing pension funds to invest in the Nifty 250 and BSE 250 indices. But with the outlook on a trade deal with Washington still murky and bond yields climbing to three-month highs — pressuring the rupee — investors are watching how long India can hold out against the global “lower for longer” narrative. Also in focus will be monthly mutual fund inflows numbers amid chatter that retail investors are running out of patience.",

    "description": "The gradual and systemic over-reliance on LLM outputs, especially with agentic systems, leads to a normalization of deviance.",
    "fullText": "The AI industry risks repeating the same cultural failures that contributed to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster: Quietly normalizing warning signs while progress marches forward.\n\nThe original term Normalization of Deviance comes from the American sociologist Diane Vaughan, who describes it as the process in which deviance from correct or proper behavior or rule becomes culturally normalized.\n\nI use the term Normalization of Deviance in AI to describe the gradual and systemic over-reliance on LLM outputs, especially in agentic systems.\n\nAt its core, large language models (LLMs) are unreliable (and untrusted) actors in system design.\n\nThis means that security controls (access checks, proper encoding, and sanitization, etc.) must be applied downstream of LLM output.\n\nA constant stream of indirect prompt injection exploit demonstrations indicates that system designers and developers are either unaware of this or are simply accepting the deviance. It is particularly dangerous when vendors make insecure decisions for their userbase by default.\n\nI first learned about this concept in the context of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where systemic normalization of warnings led to tragedy.\n\nDespite data showing erosion in colder temperatures, the deviation from safety standards was repeatedly rationalized because previous flights had succeeded. The absence of disaster was mistaken for the presence of safety.\n\nIn the world of AI, we observe companies treating probabilistic, non-deterministic, and sometimes adversarial model outputs as if they were reliable, predictable, and safe.\n\nVendors are normalizing trusting LLM output, but current understanding violates the assumption of reliability.\n\nThe model will not consistently follow instructions, stay aligned, or maintain context integrity. This is especially true if there is an attacker in the loop (e.g indirect prompt injection).\n\nHowever, we see more and more systems allowing untrusted output to take consequential actions. Most of the time it goes well, and over time vendors and organizations lower their guard or skip human oversight entirely, because “it worked last time.”\n\nThis dangerous bias is the fuel for normalization: organizations confuse the absence of a successful attack with the presence of robust security.\n\nTwo ways this can impact systems are:\n\nAnd we already see agents make mistakes in day to day usage, like formatting hard drives, creating random GitHub issues, or wiping a production database.\n\nSo, the signs are there. And it is inherently dangerous, not only because of attacks like indirect prompt injection, but also because these systems are trained on enormous, untrustworthy data sets from the Internet. Anthropic research recently showed that it takes only a small amount of documents to successfully add a backdoor to a model.\n\nConsider a scenario where the Normalization of Deviance has drastic consequences: an attacker trains a backdoor into a model that triggers on certain days to invoke tools, like compromising a user via code execution. Since we have a pretty centralized ecosystem, where attacks often are transferable, and natural language is universally understood by LLMs, this can have consequences across many systems and vendors.\n\nSuch a drift does not happen through a single reckless decision. It happens through a series of “temporary” shortcuts that quietly become the new baseline. Because systems continue to work, teams stop questioning the shortcuts, and the deviation becomes invisible and the new norm.\n\nEspecially under competitive pressure for automation, cost savings, a drive to be first, and the overall hype, this dangerous drift is evident. The incentives for speed and winning outweigh the incentives for foundational security. Over time, organizations forget why the guardrails existed in the first place.\n\nLet me share some examples of how this is reflected in real-world agentic AI systems.\n\nWe are all aware that chatbots have those “AI can make mistakes”, “Double check responses” and so forth disclaimers, and we can observe the drift of normalization occurring in real-time.\n\nThree years after ChatGPT shipped, vendors push agentic AI to users, but at the same time vendors are highlighting that your system might get compromised by that same AI - that drift, that normalization, is what I call “The Normalization of Deviance in AI”.\n\nThis continuous drift is a long-term danger:\n\nWhile some vendors acknowledge the risks, others appear to overlook or downplay them, potentially due to competitive pressure and focus on product and customer acquisition.\n\nIn many cases, we probably collectively hope that “someone” will solve these security and safety challenges.\n\nCompanies like Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and other institutions and organizations perform extensive research in this area, including publishing evals and mitigation ideas. However, the rush to be the first is evident from a product perspective.\n\nNevertheless, before we drift off into a utopian future with agentic AI, I believe the best and safest outcome is to stay realistic around capabilities and control mechanisms, and for AI to remain human-led, particularly in high-stake contexts, to ensure the best outcome overall.\n\nNo, of course not. There is a lot of potential and many low stakes workflows can be implemented already today. Even high-risk workflows can be done with proper threat modeling, mitigations and oversight.\n\nHowever, it requires investment and resources to design and set up systems accordingly and apply security controls (sandbox, hermetic environments, least privilege, temporary credentials, etc.).\n\nMany are hoping the “model will just do the right thing”, but Assume Breach teaches us, that at one point, it will certainly not do that.",

    "title": "NASA just lost contact with a Mars orbiter, and will soon lose another one",
    "description": "If NASA is serious about exploring Mars, it’s past time to send new missions.",
    "fullText": "NASA has lost contact with one its three spacecraft orbiting Mars, the agency announced Tuesday. Meanwhile, a second Mars orbiter is perilously close to running out of fuel, and the third mission is running well past its warranty.\n\nGround teams last heard from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or MAVEN, spacecraft on Saturday, December 6. “Telemetry from MAVEN had showed all subsystems working normally before it orbited behind the red planet,” NASA said in a short statement. “After the spacecraft emerged from behind Mars, NASA’s Deep Space Network did not observe a signal.”\n\nNASA said mission controllers are “investigating the anomaly to address the situation. More information will be shared once it becomes available.”\n\nMAVEN is the newest of NASA’s three operational Mars orbiters. The robotic mission arrived at the red planet in September 2014 after a 10-month cruise from Earth, then settled into an elliptical orbit to begin studying interactions between the Sun and the Martian atmosphere.\n\nEarlier in its mission, MAVEN discovered how the solar wind erodes the Martian atmosphere. Over billions of years, the erosion transformed Mars from a warm, wet, habitable world into the cold, inhospitable planet seen today. MAVEN’s science instruments measured the densities of light and heavy isotopes of argon to show how a process known as “sputtering” removed the majority of the air and water from the atmosphere. The spacecraft also made detailed in-situ plasma observations to help scientists understand Mars’ auroras.\n\nBuilt by Lockheed Martin, MAVEN has far outlived its original design life. More recently, MAVEN became an important node in NASA’s Mars relay network, passing signals between rovers on the Martian surface and controllers on Earth. If NASA is unable to revive the MAVEN spacecraft, the agency has two other orbiters that can pick up the slack.\n\nBut NASA’s two other Mars orbiters have been in space for more than 20 years. The older of the two, named Mars Odyssey, has been at Mars since 2001 and will soon run out of fuel, probably some time in the next couple of years. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched in 2005, is healthy for its age, with enough fuel to last into the 2030s. MRO is also important to NASA because it has the best camera at Mars, with the ability to map landing sites for future missions.\n\nTwo European spacecraft, Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, have radios to relay data between mission controllers and NASA’s landers on the Martian surface. Mars Express, now 22 years old, suffers from the same aging concerns as Mars Odyssey and MRO. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is newer, having arrived at Mars in 2016, but is also operating beyond its original lifetime.\n\nChina and the United Arab Emirates also have orbiters circling Mars, but neither spacecraft is equipped to serve as a communications relay.\n\nNASA’s Curiosity and Perseverance rovers have the capability for direct-to-Earth communications, but the orbiting relay network can support vastly higher data throughput. Without overhead satellites, much of the science data and many of the spectacular images collected by NASA’s rovers might never make it off the planet.\n\nMAVEN’s unique orbit, stretching as far as 2,800 miles (4,500 kilometers) above Mars, has some advantages for data relay. In that orbit, MAVEN could relay science data from rovers on the surface for up to 30 minutes at a time, longer than the relay periods available through NASA’s lower-altitude orbiters. Because of this, MAVEN could support the largest data volumes of any of the other relay options.\n\nBefore the loss of communications last weekend, NASA said MAVEN had sufficient fuel reserves to operate until at least the late 2030s.\n\nMAVEN was one of 19 operating missions targeted for cancellation in President Donald Trump’s proposed NASA budget for fiscal year 2026. Congress largely rejected the Trump’s administration’s proposed budget cuts at NASA.\n\nMars is clearly a second priority at NASA amid a race between the United States and China to land astronauts on the Moon. But the recent trouble with MAVEN will likely rekindle long-running concerns about NASA’s aging spacecraft at Mars, especially the risk of losing capacity for communications relay and high-resolution mapping to support NASA’s active rovers, along with future robotic or human expeditions.\n\nThe space agency has investigated using commercial relay services to replace the government-owned network currently in place at Mars. NASA awarded study contracts to Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and SpaceX in 2024 to examine possible data relay architectures.\n\nNASA was in the early stages of planning for a dedicated Mars Telecommunications Orbiter more than 20 years ago, with plans to put it into an orbit similar to the one occupied by MAVEN. The agency canceled the project in 2005. Since then, NASA has tacked on relay radios to science orbiters sent to Mars, giving them the ability to provide communications support as a secondary mission.\n\nThe Mars Telecommunications Orbiter name appeared again in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress earlier this year. Lawmakers included $700 million for a “high-performance” telecom relay station in Mars orbit to be developed through a fixed-price contract. Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are among the companies that have publicized their concepts for a Mars telecom orbiter in recent months. NASA officials have not said when they will release a request for bids for such a mission.",

    "title": "Linux 6.18: All About the New Long-Term Support Linux Kernel",
    "description": "The newest version of the Linux kernel offers two years of long-term support, plus upgrades to the slab memory allocator, security hardening and more.",
    "fullText": "Linus Torvalds wasn’t thrilled with how the final days leading up to the 6.18 release of the Linux kernel went. “I’d have been happier with slightly less bugfixing noise in this last week of the release,” the Linux kernel creator wrote Nov. 30 on the Linux kernel mailing list.\n\nNevertheless, he added, “While there’s a few more fixes than I would hope for, there was nothing that made me feel like this needs more time to cook. So 6.18 is tagged and pushed out.”\n\nNow that version 6.18 is fully cooked, what are the ingredients? And what, exactly, does “long-term support” mean when it comes to the Linux kernel?\n\nOnce upon a time, long-term support versions of the Linux kernel got six years of long-term support (LTS). That’s no longer the case. In 2023, the kernel developers cut LTS to two years.\n\nWhy? Because Linux code maintainers have been burning out. It’s a hard job. And, as Josef Bacik, Linux kernel file system developer and maintainer, said in a presentation at the 2022 Linux Storage | Filesystem | MM & BPF Summit, “Maintainers are burning out [because] maintainers don’t scale.” Adding insult to injury, they are also rarely paid for maintenance work.\n\nSo it is that we only get two years of “official” LTS — and the clock on the latest release, 6.18, began ticking on Dec. 3, when stable Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced it was officially the newest LTS version. This release also sees the LTS Linux 5.4 falling out of support.\n\nWait? What’s that you say? You need a heck of a lot longer support time than two years for you and your customers? Well, depending on which distribution you use for production, you’re in luck. Many of the top enterprise Linux distributors offer far longer-term support horizons for their paying customers.\n\nRed Hat maintains its own Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) kernels for the distro’s life cycle of 10-plus years. Red Hat does this by backporting security fixes and selected features to a constant kernel version, even when upstream has dropped that branch. RHEL also offers Extended Life Cycle/Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) add‑ons for older releases, which include kernel security updates beyond standard maintenance.\n\nRHEL‑compatible distributions such as AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux track RHEL’s LTS kernels through their own rebuilds, effectively extending kernel maintenance for users on the same timelines as the corresponding RHEL releases.\n\nOpenELA, the RHEL-compatible Linux distribution backed by Oracle, SUSE and CIQ/Rocky Linux, also supports older kernels via the RHEL code tree. In addition, OpenELA explicitly stepped in to maintain the former LTS Linux 4.14 until December 2024. Nevertheless, OpenELA was still releasing Linux 4.14 code in 2025.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) was also supporting 4.14 on Amazon Linux 2.0  through the end of October 2025, and the also otherwise obsolete 5.10 kernel through June 20, 2026.\n\nSUSE maintains SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) kernels with long life cycles, similar to Red Hat, and offers extended support options. Starting with SLES 16 and its Linux 6.12 kernel, SUSE now offers 16 years of support.\n\nFinally, Canonical maintains Ubuntu LTS kernels for up to 15 years with add‑on support packages. Canonical also offers LTS for the 4.14 and otherwise out-of-date kernels. For example, the company still supports the 11-and-a-half-year-old Ubuntu 14.04 distro.\n\nWhy should you use either the official LTS kernel or its commercially supported twins? It’s simple. As Kroah-Hartman said in a 2020 “Ask the Expert” interview at Open Source Summit Europe, they provide developers with a stable application binary interface (ABI). It also provides, he’s said, a continuous stream of security patches. This is far safer than freezing on an old non‑LTS kernel or trying to cherry‑pick fixes yourself.\n\nAt the core of 6.18 is a significant upgrade to the slab memory allocator in the form of “sheaves.” This is a per‑CPU cache mechanism that reduces contention and speeds up memory allocation and freeing operations. The release also includes improved swapping behavior and other virtual machine (VM) tweaks to improve performance under memory pressure, particularly on busy servers and desktops.\n\nOne of the most visible and controversial changes is the removal of the experimental Bcachefs file system from the mainline kernel. Bcachefs is a general-purpose Linux filesystem. It’s designed for systems that need strong data integrity and advanced storage features. In practice, it targets many of the same roles as Btrfs or ZFS: ample local storage, multidisk arrays and setups that combine SSDs and HDDs for performance and capacity.\n\nBcachefs was booted out of the kernel largely because its maintainer, Kent Overstreet, clashed with kernel maintainers, including Torvalds, over patch timing, review practices and public communications. Behind the personal arguments was a technical one: The Bcachefas code fixes often came in late, kernel maintainers said, which clashed with the kernel’s preference for stabilizing during release candidate phases.\n\nTorvalds and other maintainers argued that code that routinely needs that sort of late churn does not yet belong upstream, especially for something as critical as a filesystem. Bcachefx is now shipped as a Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) module, which is maintained outside the kernel tree. Distributions that wish to support Bcachefs must build and ship that external module.\n\nOn the networking side, Linux 6.18 adds support for Accurate Explicit Congestion Notification (AccECN) in TCP. This enables finer‑grained congestion feedback and potentially better throughput under load. The kernel also introduces PSP‑encrypted TCP connections, an approach that offers hardware‑friendly offload characteristics as an alternative to traditional IPsec or TLS in some environments.\n\nSecurity hardening continues with support for cryptographically signed BPF programs. This enables runtime-verified Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) payloads, as well as refinements across the security subsystem and multi‑LSM configurations.\n\nA notable infrastructure change is the ability to manage process namespaces using file‑handle‑like objects, similar in spirit to pidfds. This should make container runtimes and low‑level tooling more robust and race‑resistant.\n\nAdditionally, the gradual integration of Rust into the kernel continues, including support for a Rust Binder driver. This is a Google-driven rewrite of the Android Binder driver in Rust. This vital inter-process communication (IPC) system enables two processes on an Android-powered device to communicate with one another.\n\nAs with most kernel releases, 6.18 carries a large batch of new and updated drivers across architectures, including x86_64, ARM, RISC‑V, and others. It also — surprise! — improves support for recent GPUs, SoCs and storage controllers. It also comes with fixes and enhancements for popular handheld gaming PCs such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go 2, as well as better power management and device‑tree coverage for laptops and embedded boards.\n\nFor end users, that translates into better out‑of‑the‑box hardware support on upcoming distributions that track the new LTS line.\n\nFor Linux desktop users — Jack Wallen and I wave — the main benefits of Linux 6.18 will be faster, more scalable memory allocation, improved network efficiency and broader hardware enablement, especially on modern GPUs and newer ARM‑based systems.\n\nServer operators and cloud providers are likely to focus on dm‑pcache for hybrid storage, the new TCP capabilities, and signed BPF infrastructure as they evaluate 6.18 as a long‑term platform. With support stretching to 2027 and no single “killer” feature, Linux 6.18 positions itself as a conservative but foundational release that many distributions will standardize on for the next few years.",

    "description": "Elon Musk has amassed a $491 billion fortune through his work at Tesla, SpaceX, and more. Here's the tech CEO's daily routine.",
    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "title": "Instead of downsizing, I moved into a bigger home at 74. My grandkids love the extra space, and family visits are finally fun.",
    "description": "At 74, Laurence Gerowitz and his wife upsized to a larger condo in New York City. The grandkids love the space and his son's visits are less of a chore.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 75-year-old Laurence Gerowitz, a real estate litigator, about his move into a larger condo in New York City. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI lived on the Upper East Side for most of my adult life: about 48 years, starting in the late 1970s. My wife and I bought into a co-op on 85th Street in 1999 for $265,000 and lived on the third floor of the five-story walk-up.\n\nOur apartment was 1,200 square feet and had a very nice layout, as well as a working fireplace. The building had no amenities whatsoever, but we were still very happy to be there. We lived there for 25 years and essentially raised our son in that apartment.\n\nIn 2008, he moved to Villanova, Pennsylvania — near Philadelphia — for college, and over the years it became clear he was never moving back to New York. He's now married and they live there with their two young children.\n\nNew York suits me just fine, but not so much for my son — between the impossible parking and our three-story walk-up, he wasn't interested.\n\nI understand why. When he used to visit, I'd have to go downstairs to help him haul everything up. We did have two bedrooms, which is a luxury in Manhattan, but there still wasn't a comfortable place for him and his family to sleep, and I'd end up on a blow-up mattress.\n\nIt was just untenable; they didn't enjoy visiting.\n\nAbout two years ago, my wife noticed that a new complex was being built around the corner from us called the Harper. She's a painter and interior decorator, so she wanted to take a look.\n\nWe toured a two-bedroom apartment, which we thought was very nice, but it was also small. Still, we thought the building's amenities were fantastic. They have a gym, music room, game room, playroom, and creative studio — which we thought would be great for our grandkids.\n\nWe sat with the idea for a while. A couple of months later, we went back to see a larger unit — a model of about 1,853 square feet with an 80-square-foot terrace and three bedrooms, one of which could be used as an office.\n\nAfter that tour, it didn't take us long to decide to move to the Harper. In the end, it took a couple of months to stage our old co-op, and then a few more months to sell.\n\nThe best things I've ever done in my life are being a good father and grandfather. My son texts or calls me at least once a day, and that's my proudest accomplishment — even more than being admitted to the bar at 48 after going to night school for four years while supporting a family.\n\nA big reason we decided to upsize and buy the condo was that my wife and I love being around my son and his family, and we really wanted to create a place where the kids would want to come visit.\n\nWe moved into the Harper in March 2024. It's just around the corner from our old place. It wasn't a far move, but we've spent decades living on the Upper East Side for a reason — we love the neighborhood.\n\nOur new condo has a really well-thought-out layout. We have three bedrooms, including a home office, and two-and-a-half bathrooms. When you walk in, you can turn left into one wing, down that hall are the primary closet, the primary bedroom and bathroom, and the terrace.\n\nIf you go to the right instead, a quick left takes you into the kitchen and great room. Further to the right are the guest bedroom and bathroom, a third bedroom that I use as my office, and a small laundry area.\n\nBesides having a larger apartment and living in a building that actually has an elevator, we're especially happy about the amenities. It's such a contrast to our old place, where the only extra space was the boiler room.\n\nOur grandkids especially love the building's music room. They can bang on the drums, sing into the microphone, and strum a guitar. There's also a playroom with a ball pit.\n\nIn the beginning, whenever the grandkids would come over, they would go down to the ball pit three times a day. In the mornings, I'd have to plead with them to finish their breakfast before heading down to play.\n\nIt's obvious they love visiting our new home. The grandkids talk about it all the time, and it's cute to see them arrive, dragging their little suitcases, already excited to play.\n\nI have very fond memories of our old place — it was the first home I ever bought. But over time, living there became stressful.\n\nI was on the board, constantly worrying about the building — especially whether the boiler would work. It was an older property with no central air, just radiators, so there were always issues with the heat.\n\nHere at the Harper, it's a completely different experience. Everything works, we have three separate HVAC zones that you can set to the exact degree, and the staff is great. My biggest dilemma now is whether to go to my gym on 91st Street or just head downstairs.\n\nI think upsizing later in life is a good thing if you're in a position where it makes sense for you.\n\nIf it's within your means to make that choice, do it. You're not just gaining more physical space; you're also giving yourself and your family more options.\n\nWhen my son and his family visit, they have their own rooms and are well taken care of. I think they genuinely enjoy coming now; it no longer feels like an obligation.",

    "description": "The Navy is investing almost half a billion dollars in Palantir artificial intelligence software that promises to speed up shipbuilding processes.",
    "fullText": "The Navy is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into an artificial intelligence system that it says has sped up key shipbuilding processes.\n\nIn one case, the AI cut painstaking processes of submarine schedule planning — mapping out how the many pieces of construction fit together and making sure people, parts, and yard space are available at the right time — from many hours to only minutes.\n\nThe Navy is launching the new Shipbuilding Operating System, or Ship OS, as it tries to break out of decades-old shipbuilding problems rooted in outdated technologies and work practices. The service announced a $448 million investment Thursday, saying it will accelerate the adoption of AI and autonomy across the industrial base.\n\nThe Ship OS technology is powered by Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform and began in pilot programs at submarine shipyards.\n\nAt General Dynamics Electric Boat, a long-time submarine yard located in Connecticut, submarine schedule planning saw a dramatic reduction from 160 manual hours down to under 10 minutes. And at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine, material review times for submarines went from taking weeks to under an hour.\n\nThe $448 million investment will go toward the submarine industrial base and then expand. It'll be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three public yards, and 100 suppliers, Palantir said in a press release.\n\n\"This investment provides the resources our shipbuilders, shipyards, and suppliers need to modernize their operations and succeed in meeting our nation's defense requirements,\" said Navy Secretary John Phelan in a statement.\n\n\"By enabling industry to adopt AI and autonomy tools at scale, we're helping the shipbuilding industry improve schedules, increase capacity, and reduce costs,\" he added, explaining \"this is about doing business smarter and building the industrial capability our Navy and nation require.\"\n\nMaritime Industrial Base Program, a Navy initiative to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair capabilities, and Naval Sea Systems Command are overseeing the implementation of Ship OS. Both are gathering data from multiple sources to identify where the hiccups are in submarine shipbuilding, how the processes, including engineering, can be sped up, and what specific risks can be mitigated through technology.\n\nProblems in the Navy’s submarine industrial base — from shipbuilders to the repair yards — have been building for decades. Submarines are central to any Pacific fight and a top Pentagon priority, yet major programs like the upgraded Virginia-class submarines and new Columbia-class ballistic missile subs have repeatedly run into delays and cost overruns.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, has documented long-standing problems in the Navy's plans for purchasing and constructing submarines, as well as shipyard deficiencies such as worker inexperience, aging facilities and equipment, and inadequate construction space.\n\nThe introduction of the new Ship OS capability aims to address some of these problems facing US submarine shipbuilding. And once the technology has been used for the submarine programs, the Navy said, it'll apply lessons and adapt them to surface ship programs.",

    "description": "The Fed cut interest rates at its December meeting. Here's how it affects your money — from mortgages and auto loans to credit cards and savings.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve made its final decision of 2025, cutting interest rates for the third meeting in a row — and it set the tone for where interest rates will go in the new year.\n\nThe call will have ripple effects across consumer prices, the job market, and Corporate America through 2026 and beyond. Here's how the decision will affect you.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions.\n\nA quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Lower rates would also make home equity lines and small business loans more accessible to Americans.\n\nElizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told Business Insider the cut could be a positive sign for people applying to roles in the sluggish labor market: If job seekers \"hear that the Fed is responding to an unfavorable labor market, that's going to feel good to them; they may feel like relief is on the horizon,\" she said.\n\nThe labor market has shown signs of weakness in recent months. Job seekers of all ages have told Business Insider that they've been through grueling application cycles without an offer, while recruiters are drowning in resumés. Over the summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of available jobs and labor force participation has been trending downward. The unemployment rate, however, is still relatively low, hovering a little above 4% for most of this year.\n\nSustained rate cuts would bolster the job market by making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest money. This would free up more funds for companies to hire and pay employees, which could lead to higher consumer spending — all factors needed for a healthy economy.\n\nAnd lower interest rates are historically good news for the stock market. When it's cheaper to borrow money and approve loans, both companies and individuals are more likely to invest. With more funds in the market, Wall Street could see a boost in 2026.\n\nMadison Hoff contributed reporting.",

    "description": "Data from Strava and AllTrails show a surge in new hiking clubs, while National Parks continue to be top travel destinations.",
    "fullText": "The run clubs that took off in the past few years were outpaced by hiking.\n\nThat's according to new data from Strava, a fitness tracking app, and AllTrails, a hiking navigation app.\n\nStrava's end-of-year report, analyzing data from over 180 million users and surveying over 30,000 users and non-users, found that hiking clubs grew sixfold in 2025 — nearly double the pace of run clubs. In 2025, AllTrails saw a 20% increase in users (i.e., people who created an account on the app) to 90 million.\n\nOnline, you can find hiking clubs for seemingly every preference, whether you're a creative in LA looking for a morning workout, a woman who doesn't want to hike alone in North Carolina, or a \"hot girl\" on the hunt for new travel companions.\n\nWhile run clubs are still popular, hiking and walking have an advantage: simplicity. They offer similar health benefits and social perks — without requiring the same stamina or potentially pricey gear.\n\nCOVID lockdowns famously drew people to the outdoors, whether they joined run clubs or sought out nearby hikes.\n\nAnd then there were National Parks, which experienced a surge of visitors since 2020 during the pandemic — and don't seem to be losing their allure. According to the National Parks visitation data, 2024 broke the record for the highest number of visitors of all time at over 331 million, a 28% increase since 2020.\n\nFive years after the pandemic, National Parks continue to be popular destinations. \"When you start looking at that number as feet on the trail, bodies in the visitor's center, cars on the road, you see that the parks have exploded,\" Jason Frye, a hiking writer who most recently published a National Parks guidebook, told Business Insider. Strava reported that hiking was the second most popular reason for traveling, behind winter sports.\n\nCarly Smith, chief marketing officer for AllTrails, said its data shows many hikers search for locations over 200 miles from their home. \"So we know that people are using us for planning travel and then for navigating and exploring National Parks and other destinations,\" she said.\n\nSmith believes part of the reason hiking and National Parks continue to be hot is that, for many, life still hasn't changed all that much since the peak-remote work pandemic years. \"There are more people working remotely than there were in the past,\" she said. \"Hiking clubs in particular can give people a good sense of community in ways that maybe they aren't finding in other parts of their life.\"\n\nRunning isn't the cardio workout for everyone. It's also not the only — or best — way to burn fat.\n\nWhile sprinting at a very fast pace (zone 4 or zone 5) is great for your heart health, it consumes more carbs than fat compared to a brisk walk or light jog.\n\nHiking long distances with a heavy backpack can help hit two goals: shedding fat while building muscle.\n\nThat's partly why rucking, or walking with weights, became a buzzy fitness trend last year. We saw a boom in networking events where people chat shop while breaking a sweat.\n\nPrice-wise, hiking, rucking, and walking also more financially accessible than joining a luxury gym. Weighted vests, the walking accessories du jour, cost about $30-$40 on Amazon — though a backpack from GoRuck, one of the biggest players in this space, starts at $115.\n\nPlus, in many cases, hiking and walking can be interchangeable: not all hikes have to be strenuous to count, making them less physically and financially daunting.\n\nFrye, who lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, near Great Smoky Mountains National Park, said there are many hiking trails nearby that are \"really walks in the woods more than true hikes.\"\n\n\"You can hop out of the car and do it in your flip flops from most of them,\" he said — no high-tech gear needed.\n\nAccording to Strava's report, walking was the second-most tracked activity in 2025, after running. Along with hiking, both activities can feel like a more low-stakes group activity than a seven-mile run.\n\nJonathan Jacobs, who started a men's walking group in LA this year, previously told Business Insider that the accessibility of walking made newcomers more likely to show up.\n\n\"Men who come to the walks repeatedly tell me that the low barrier to entry — no need to sign up or pay a fee to join — makes it easier for them to commit,\" he said.\n\nCity dwellers who partook in walking Manhattan from \"tip to tip\" — another popular TikTok trend of the year — also cited it as a memorable (but still low-key) experience with their friends.\n\nFrye believes the hiking hype is all part of the same phenomenon behind the renewed interest in dumb phones and old-school activities like pickling and crocheting.\n\n\"There seems to be this cultural shift, away from the digital and more toward the analog,\" he said. \"We're looking at these ways to return to easier things, and it doesn't get much easier than hiking.\"\n\nDecember 10, 2025: A previous version of this story stated that the Strava report data came from 30,000 Strava users. It came from 180 million users, as well as an additional survey of 30,000 users and non-users.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used naval drones packed with explosives to attack an oil tanker identified as part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Black Sea on Wednesday, a security source told Business Insider.\n\nThe naval drone strike on the tanker, Dashan, marks the third such attack in less than two weeks as Ukraine ramps up its long-range strike campaign against Russia's energy sector, increasingly gunning for ships at sea in addition to land-based oil facilities.\n\nSea Baby naval drones hit the tanker and caused \"critical damage\" to the vessel, with early indications indicating that the strike completely disabled the vessel, the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the country's main internal security agency, revealed on Wednesday.\n\nThe SBU source, only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments, said the Dashan was flying the Comoros flag and moving through Ukraine's exclusive economic zone in the direction of Novorossiysk, a Russian port city and major oil terminal.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data last showed the Dashan in the middle of the Black Sea.\n\nThe tanker was sailing at maximum speed with its transponder turned off, the security source said. They added that the attack was carried out in cooperation with the Ukrainian navy and shared footage captured by the Sea Baby drones showing multiple hits on the ship.\n\nSeveral Western countries and the European Union have sanctioned the $30 million tanker, which has been used for Russian oil exports and is known to sail with its transponder switched off, Ukraine's HUR military intelligence agency said.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the extent of the damage. Russia's defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe attack on Wednesday appears to mark the third time in the last two weeks that Ukraine has disabled a tanker belonging to the \"shadow fleet.\" In late November, the SBU used naval drones to strike and damage two vessels before they loaded at Novorossiysk.\n\nThe \"shadow fleet\" is a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports, a major source of revenue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged Kyiv's international partners to do more to prevent the ships from operating.\n\n\"The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the receipt of petrodollars to the budget of the Russian Federation,\" the security source said on Wednesday, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nUkraine has been stepping up its attacks against the Russian energy sector, the revenue from which fuels its war efforts, in recent months. Kyiv has used long-range drones to strike oil refineries and other facilities and infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe three tanker attacks appear to reflect a new shift for Ukraine — one that now increasingly attacks ships at sea rather than just land targets.",

    "fullText": "The Hollywood bidding war between Paramount Skydance and Netflix has created a meme frenzy.\n\nThe two media giants are in an all-out battle for Warner Bros. Discovery after it accepted Netflix's offer to acquire its studio and streaming businesses for an equity value of $72 billion. David Ellison's Paramount launched a hostile $30-per-share bid for all of WBD on Monday.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery owns the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, the HBO Max streaming service, and TV networks such as CNN, TNT, and TruTV. It confirmed receipt of Paramount's unsolicited offer on Monday.\n\nBoth entities have made their cases on why they'd be the best owner for WBD. Although internet comedians don't have a say in where the deals land, it hasn't stopped them from weighing in with viral jokes about the dueling companies and their quest to acquire WBD.\n\nSome social media users are poking fun at the back-and-forth with memes about how far each company is willing to go to gain WBD's favor. One post compared the battle for the best offer to a scene from the HBO business drama \"Succession,\" a title Netflix would own if the deal goes through.\n\nA post shared by Karl Smith, CFA (L1 Candidate) (@wallstreetintern)\n\nThe Instagram meme account Litquidity used parody images that appeared to be AI-created of two business leaders speaking at the DealBook Summit to mock how each company is trying to prove its offer is better.\n\nNetflix and Paramount trying to show off why their Warner Bros acquisition offers are better pic.twitter.com/mjpP7sjAnA\n\nSome people seem to be using humor to cope with the idea of more consolidation in Hollywood. They are pushing back on both offers with memes about stopping the looming acquisition completely.\n\nChristopher Nolan, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg on their way to stop Netflix from buying Warner Bros: pic.twitter.com/pnCAU4kclM\n\n\"I'm putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger,\" one X user captioned a compilation video of various actors and famous filmmakers.\n\nI’m putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger: pic.twitter.com/wl26YfGCjg\n\nOthers speculated on what the movie-watching experience could be like under Warner Bros. Discovery's new ownership. One TikTok video showed a man sitting down to watch a movie, only for the intros to include a confusing mix of studios, backers such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and even a DJ, being played before the movie began.\n\nevery company is every company #business#news #netflix\n\nIn the midst of all the jokes, Netflix argues that its offer would be better for consumers and creators, while Ellison says Paramount is more likely to win regulatory approval and offers Hollywood more certainty.\n\nWhat all of this means in the long run is unclear so far. It could lead to job cuts in the entertainment industry as the giants consolidate their power. The trends of streaming services getting pricier and fewer movies hitting theaters could also continue, as companies release less content, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEither way — as with many serious big business deals — consumers and industry insiders are finding ways to laugh through it.",

    "fullText": "The Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, and the meeting held some key takeaways for how the central bank is thinking about the economy heading into 2026.\n\nFrom the labor market to inflation to stocks, here's everything to know about the latest Fed decision.\n\nFed leaders anticipate more economic growth in 2026 and stable unemployment levels, but are somewhat concerned about slowing labor demand and participation. Lower rates could help juice hiring, Powell said.\n\nIn terms of AI, the Fed chair said chatbots are not yet replacing jobs — even as Corporate America sees shrinking while collar roles. \"It's part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet,\" he said. And, though some Big Tech firms and major retailers, have had high-profile cuts in 2025, Powell added that overall layoff rates are still relatively low.\n\nThe figure remains slightly above the Fed's 2% goal, though data is limited due to the government shutdown. With lower rates, there's a risk consumer prices will rise too. At the same time, Powell said consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of inflation right now is tariff policy, not broad economic weakness.\n\nIt was a hawkish rate cut overall, but markets rallied sharply anyway.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged up to a near-record close and the Dow jump almost 500 points, adding to gains as Powell's press conference got going. A few things came out of the meeting that boosted investors' bullishness.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to name a successor in January.\n\n\"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place.\"\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee showed significant division on Wednesday, with three members dissenting to the cut call. It's the biggest split seen at a Fed meeting since 2019 and signals ongoing tension between the Fed's dual mandate and how each member weighs employment and inflation risks.\n\nPowell, however, said there's no bad blood.\n\n\"The discussions we have are as good as any we've had in my 14 years at the Fed,\" he said. \"They're very thoughtful and respectful and people have strong views",

    "description": "Paramount's David Ellison wants to buy all of Warner, including its cable networks. How much they're worth is a big part of his fight vs. Netflix.",
    "fullText": "The fight between Paramount and Netflix over Warner Bros. Discovery is ultimately about who gets to control HBO and the Warner movie studio.\n\nBut the way that fight gets settled is going to involve an unusual side quest: CNN, TNT, the Food Network, and a bunch of other cable networks WBD wants to get rid of. Specifically: What are all of those shrinking cable networks worth?\n\nWhich leads us to a pretty weird place: Paramount CEO David Ellison, who wants to buy all of WBD — including its cable networks — is arguing that those cable networks aren't worth very much at all. And Netflix, which doesn't want to buy those cable networks, is implicitly arguing that they're worth much more.\n\nThat's because in the Netflix scenario, current WBD shareholders would go through two transactions: First, WBD would spin out its cable networks into a new company, and WBD investors would be given shares in that new company. Then Netflix would buy the remainder of WBD — HBO and the studio — for cash and stock.\n\nWhich means Netflix, and WBD executives who have blessed the Netflix offer, will want investors to think the cable networks are valuable. Ellison wants them to think the opposite.\n\n\"The lower you value the cable assets, the greater advantage Paramount's bid has. If shareholders believe the cable operations are more highly valued, then Netflix's bid, which assumes they will be spun off, means investors get an overall bigger sum of money.\"\n\nAnd here's the actual gap: Ellison says the spin-off is worth about $1 per WBD share — or roughly $2.5 billion, based on WBD's current valuation. Independent analysts think it might be closer to $4 per share — or roughly $10 billion. Paramount and Netflix reps declined to comment; WBD hasn't responded to my request.\n\nSo one side is describing a rounding error, especially when it's part of a deal that could be worth $108 billion. The other is describing, more or less, a midsize media company.\n\nAnd yes, this is equity value, not enterprise value — this already assumes the spin-off gets saddled with billions of WBD's debt under the Netflix plan. But we're going to focus this conversation on the shares that ultimately end up in a WBD investor's brokerage account.\n\nAnd if you believe David Ellison and Co., those investors aren't getting much. Because CNN, Turner, and all of the networks formerly owned by Discovery aren't worth much at all.\n\nAnd yes, the cable network industry is a falling knife, which is why many big media companies that own cable networks are trying to ditch them. But are things really that bad?\n\nMaybe. Maybe, using Ellison's math, all of CNN plus a pile of other cable networks — which still generate cash, mind you — are worth about 16 Bari Weisses, based on the reported $150 million he paid for her Free Press site.\n\nOr maybe all of that is worth $10 billion — which means it's still less than 1% of Google. Which feels like a metaphor for the entire media industry in 2025: Even a roomful of famous brands barely registers in a world run by giant software companies.\n\nSomewhere in that $2.5 billion to $10 billion range is the real answer. But the headline is clear: The networks that once held the entire cable bundle together are now garage sale leftovers. Worth something to someone — but a whole lot less than they used to be.",

    "fullText": "\"Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story,\" Expedition 33 creative director Guillaume Broche told GameSpot.\n\n on December 10, 2025 at 10:53AM PST\n\nThe Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees--and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive.\n\nEarlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.\n\nNow, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.\n\nBroche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were \"a lot of arguments\" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.\n\nGameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the game's tremendous success?\n\nBroche: I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, \"Is this real?\" or, \"Can you believe that?\" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a \"less is more\" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.\n\nWe always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain \"less is more\" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more \"real\" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.\n\nFor the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.\n\nI've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or \"good\" ending to the game?\n\nThat’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the \"good\" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.\n\nMany sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?\n\nActually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.\n\nOne major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!\n\nWhether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. The Game Awards airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The patch notes for the December 10 update detail various bug fixes and improvements across all modes, but some of the changes are a disappointment for Zombies players.\nA few bugs are squashed for Season 1's new Astra Malorum Zombies map. The patch notes address an issue where Oscar could become stuck in the starting area, and it also fixes the map's new LGM-1 Wonder Weapon, which could sometimes fire with unintended behavior when paired with certain GobbleGums and the Frenzied Fire augment. Unfortunately, this also affects a strategy players were using to help make the Wonder Weapon more powerful during the tough boss fight for Astra Malorum.",

    "fullText": "Amid a larger number of high-profile bankruptcies occurring within weeks of each other this fall, companies that sell holiday packages and tours also struggled at a time when many consumers are holding off on discretionary travel spending.\n\nBritish tour operators Great Little Escapes and Jetline both shut down operations within weeks of each other in the summer of 2025, while Reykjavik-based Tango Travel could not withstand the shutdown of Play Airlines at the end of September. Since the majority of its tour packages included flights on the now-defunct airline, the holiday company, in a domino effect, closed down operations a month later.\n\nIn November, British tour company New Era Travel also had to tell customers that it was closing down and going into liquidation.\n\nThe latest travel agency shutdown is being reported in the Swiss city of Geneva.\n\nAccording to local outlet Study Travel Magazine, AILS Sejours Linguistiques has stopped trading and filed for bankruptcy at the First Instance Court of the Canton of Geneva back in November.\n\nThe travel company with offices in Switzerland and France organized student exchange and language-learning tours to countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, among others.\n\nA managing partner from Australia anonymously told Study Travel Magazine that a number of students with booked trips in the coming months were desperately trying to obtain information about the state of the company.\n\nBoth individual students and schools had used the company to book tours to foreign countries that are part of their educational program back home.\n\n\"We are dealing with a number of very distressed students who have discovered, through a drip feed of information, that it appears the agency AILS has closed,\" the managing director said to the outlet. \"They have closed owing a very substantial amount of money to schools.\"\n\nGreat Little Escapes: The British travel company filed for bankruptcy after running up losses of £77,000 ($103,000 USD).\n\nUnitravel Kft: The Budapest-based tour operator blamed \"new, foreign companies enter[ing] Hungary with huge financial resources\" for a financial breakdown that led to it having to suddenly cancel trips that in some cases were already halfway through.\n\nMixxTravel: The Malmö-based travel company was forced to cancel trips and wind down operations after being declared bankrupt by a judge in August 2025.\n\nTango Travel: The Icelandic tour operator went bust in November 2025 after major partner Play Airlines filed for bankruptcy and stopped operations a month earlier.\n\nNew Era Travel: Ceased operations in November 2025.

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Chromebook Power User Should Know",
    "description": "You can do a lot more with your Chromebook.",
    "fullText": "If you've chosen a Chromebook as a laptop, then you know the main benefits that it brings: namely, speed, ease of use, and affordability. Despite the simplicity of ChromeOS, however, there's more that you can do with it than you might realize. You can use it offline, and you can sync files to and from local storage, for example. The operating system is a lot more powerful and versatile than it often gets credit for.\n\nThese hacks are for power users who want to level up their Chromebook capabilities, and get extra value out of their laptop, beyond the standard use cases that everyone knows about. No matter how you use ChromeOS, there should be something here to help.\n\nChromebooks are often criticized for being useless without wifi, but that's not actually the case: All of the Docs, Sheets, and Slides tools can be used offline, with changes syncing back when your internet connection is restored: From Google Drive, click the gear icon (top right), then choose Settings > General and check the option under the Offline heading.\n\nYou can use Gmail offline, too. You can't send or receive emails, obviously, but you can read through and organize your inbox, and draft emails ready to go once you get your internet back. From Gmail, click on the gear icon (top right), then pick See all settings > Offline. Check the Enable offline mail box and choose how much of your email you want to sync.\n\nThis offline functionality extends to third-party streaming apps too, as ChromeOS supports Android apps. With apps such as Netflix and Spotify, you can sync content to your Chromebook to watch when you don't have a reliable internet connection—when you're on a long flight, for example, or traveling between countries.\n\nTyping is all well and good, but sometimes talking is faster. Launch Settings, then choose Accessibility > Keyboard and text input > Dictation to enable the feature. You can then press the Launcher (G) button and D to start dictating in any app—whether you're composing emails or writing essays.\n\nOne of the pros of using a Chromebook is that everything is synced online pretty much instantly, if you're using one of Google's own online apps or something similar. However, there may be local files that accumulate on the laptop, including screenshots and downloads, and sometimes you'll want to get those synced to the cloud as well.\n\nYou can see these files via the Files app that comes built into ChromeOS, and upload them manually via the Google Drive web interface. There's an easier way to get them into Google Drive, though: From the Files app, select all the local files you want to upload in the pane on the right, then drag them into My Drive under Google Drive in the left-hand menu bar.\n\nChromebooks don't always have the biggest or highest-resolution screens, but you can give yourself more room by managing multiple virtual desktops (which ChromeOS calls \"desks\"). Press the \"show windows\" key (it's the one with little rectangles on it, usually also labeled F3) to view open desks, switch between them, and create new ones.\n\nAs ChromeOS is so tightly tied to your Google account, you don't necessarily want other people borrowing your laptop and being able to get into your Google apps. The solution is guest mode: Restart your Chromebook or sign out of your current user account, then click Browse as Guest to launch a Chrome window without any Google account attached.\n\nChromeOS can sometimes feel limiting in that you can't quickly drag files to the desktop or to a temporary folder in the same way that you can on Windows or macOS. You might also see that as a benefit—it means less junk will be cluttering your system—but there could well be times that you just need to store something temporarily for transfer.\n\nThat's where the ChromeOS clipboard comes in: It actually stores five items rather than one, so it's a useful (if rather hidden) way of moving images, text, and links between websites and apps. Use the usual Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, and Ctrl+V shortcuts to copy, cut, and paste, then hold down the Launcher (G) button and V to see all the clipboard items.\n\nThe ChromeOS Task Manager is useful for everything from shutting down crashed apps to seeing exactly where all your RAM is going, and it can be a key tool in the power user's belt. Open it by pressing the Launcher (G) key and Esc: You'll see you can browse between individual tabs and system processes, or search for something specific on ChromeOS.\n\nChromeOS isn't just for Chromebooks: You can give an older, struggling laptop a new lease of life by installing ChromeOS Flex on it (even old laptops can usually handle Chrome). Google has full instructions for what you need to do to get this working, and will guide you through the process of creating a bootable USB drive with the ChromeOS software on.\n\nAs with a lot of software, there are beta and dev channels of ChromeOS available as well as the stable one. If you want to get the newest Chromebook features before everyone else, and don't mind a few bugs along the way, then you can make the switch. It doesn't take long, and you can always switch back again, though a system reset is sometimes required.\n\nTo change between ChromeOS channels, click on the time panel (bottom right), then click the gear icon to get to the main Settings page. Choose About ChromeOS > Additional details > Change channel, then choose whichever one you want to use. You'll keep getting over-the-air updates for your selected channel until you switch to a different one.",

    "title": "Colorado's Once-Thriving Mountain Town Between Grand Junction And Denver Is Now Abandoned",
    "description": "This Colorado ghost town is an eerie reminder of mining's negative effects and can be seen from Highway 24, not far from the capital of the Mile High State.",
    "fullText": "The story of Gilman, Colorado, reads like a horror movie. The setting: a small Rocky Mountain town in 1984. The characters: the residents of a centuries-old mining community. The plot: the soil is contaminated with deadly toxins, and authorities flood the town, urging people to evacuate. Locals leave with whatever they can, and as they drive away, look longingly at the rows of ranch homes they've left behind. Silent roads are stippled with empty buildings. Above them, at the top of a dirt hill, looms a massive processing plant, a grim symbol of the district's environmental collapse.\n\nLike St. Elmo, one of the American West's best-preserved ghost towns, this place casts a haunting spell. The real history of Gilman was a bit less dramatic, but it ended the same way. The town was founded in 1886, and workers moved to the area to mine zinc, copper, silver, and gold. Over the next century, they would extract 10 million tons of material. Production started to decline in the 1960s, and by the time the Environmental Protection Agency arrived in the mid-80s, mine runoff had tarnished Gilman's groundwater. The landscape was so deadly that residents were ordered to leave, and the town's collapse has since served as a cautionary tale about unregulated industry.\n\nThe remains of Gilman still hug the steep slopes of Battle Mountain. Its ruins now stand on private property, which is off-limits to visitors. But you can still stop and see Gilman from the shoulder of Highway 24, which runs parallel to the site. There's a broad gravel area to park on, which overlooks a building-studded valley. Stopping there is free, and it's the only legal way to see Gilman's remains. Bring binoculars, or better yet, a telephoto lens.\n\nGilman is hardly alone when it comes to abandoned Colorado towns. Seven hundred ghost towns were scattered across the state as of 2018, representing a wide range of industries and eras. Intrepid explorers have made their way into Gilman, photographing and filming the town's crumbling remains. What's so unsettling about these images is how contemporary they all look. The buildings aren't frontier shacks, but split-level homes you could find in modern-day suburbs.\n\nYoung trespassers have left patches of graffiti on the old walls. Many of these roads are still paved in modern asphalt, although their surfaces are cracked after countless winters without maintenance, with mature evergreens growing through their cracks. At its peak, nearly 9,000 people lived on this ridge, overlooking the confluence of Rock Creek and the Eagle River. Today, even that modest population is hard to imagine. A few rows of gutted houses are still visible on the grassy terraces, but they offer only a vague impression of what life there was once like.\n\nGilman feels more remote than it is. Highway 24 weaves its way through the mountains and connects with Interstate 70, the main motorway between Denver and the major western Colorado town of Grand Junction. If you're already seeking the ultimate destinations to visit on a trip through Colorado, this site is surprisingly close to some of the state's major landmarks. Just 20 minutes from Gilman is the world-famous ski town of Vail, which draws 2.8 million visitors every year.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?",

    "title": "Instagram Is Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Some Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—we can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we can control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, Instagram is now experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the clickbait treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Google told Maiberg the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI reached out to Meta for comment, and this story originally published before they responded. However, a Meta spokesperson has since confirmed to me that Instagram has recently started generating these titles using AI. The goal, according to the spokesperson, is to make it easier to know what a post is about before you click the link. They also noted that these headlines might not be totally correct, as with all AI products. In addition, the spokesperson explained that search engine optimization indexing is not necessarily new. The company has been doing this for years in the U.S. to increase visibility for posts from professional accounts.\n\nThat last point is all fine and good, of course. No one is surprised that Instagram is indexing posts for search engines: Most social media platforms do that. Otherwise, you'd never find any of their posts on platforms like Google. The issue is generating fake headlines with AI without letting anyone know about it. Just because Meta AI is capable of generating headlines doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts, a risk the Meta spokesperson readily admits to. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"\n\nWhile Meta has yet to add a dedicated on/off switch for these headlines, one thing you can do to ensure your posts don't get an AI clickbait makeover is to opt out of indexing as a whole. If you run an account that relies on discoverability, this might not be worth it, since you'll be impacting how users find your posts outside of Instagram. However, if you don't care about that, or you don't need the SEO at all, you can stop Instagram from making your posts available on search engines—and putting an end to the AI-generated headlines, at that.\n\nThere are three ways to accomplish this, according to Instagram:\n\nMake your account private: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. Here, tap the Private account toggle.\n\nSwitch your account from professional to private: Open Instagram's in-app settings, scroll down and tap Account type and tools. Here, choose \"Switch to personal account.\"\n\nManually opt out of indexing: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. You should see an option to stop your public photos and videos from appearing in search engines.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Android User Should Know",
    "description": "Identify battery-hungry apps, force dark mode system wide, and block ads and trackers.",
    "fullText": "Android remains one of the most customizable mobile operating systems out there, despite Google's recent efforts to rein it in. You don't necessarily have to root your Android device to get it to do something off script, either. The fix you need might be hidden behind a system menu or Developer Options. You can personalize Android to address common frustrations with speed, battery life, privacy, and the interface as a whole. I've compiled ten helpful Android hacks that require no third-party apps, no ADB commands, and no rooting. All you need is the patience to dig through the operating system and tap as required.\n\nPlease note that many of these hacks require you to enable Developer Options, Android's hidden menu of settings. To do so, head to the Settings menu, scroll to About phone, then tap Build number. Tap it seven times to unlock developer mode. (You'll see a countdown pop-up if you did it correctly.)\n\nHave you ever looked at your battery usage stats and wondered what to do about a specific app that's draining your battery? Android needs apps to run in the background, sync with the cloud, and check for updates by default. As it does this, it wakes the device and consumes battery in the background.\n\nAndroid introduced a battery optimization feature in version 6.0 that's supposed to help with apps that drain too much battery. While it's helped shut down unused apps, it can be either too aggressive or not aggressive enough at identifying bad apps. And while you can force-close an app to kill it when you notice it's causing issues, it will likely start up again the next time you reboot your device.\n\nYou can manually set an app's background privileges to the most restrictive setting without deleting or disabling it. In Settings, under Apps, scroll down and tap to view all your apps in a list. Then, tap App battery usage. Here, you will find details about the last time the app was accessed. Tap on the app to adjust its background usage. You can choose to have it optimized by the Android system or unrestricted—something you might use on a wearable to ensure it works properly, for instance. If you want it restricted completely, use the master switch to toggle off background usage. On Samsung devices, this same option is called \"sleeping apps\" or \"deep sleeping apps.\"\n\nOptionally, you can turn to Developer Options to get more robust control over background processes. Head back to Developer Options, then scroll or search for Background process limit, and from here, you can decide how many background apps fire off at a time.\n\nEven with an ad blocker, background apps can still track your phone use, where you shop, and which ads to show you. You could easily circumvent this by installing a VPN app to route traffic, but that relies on a third party app, and slows down performance. You are better off configuring your phone's Private DNS settings to filter web traffic through a service of your choosing.\n\nPrivate DNS seals the request your device makes to look up a website's IP address, so your carrier can't see the website you're visiting. Since that browser data stays hidden, third parties don't have the data they need to track your habits and, subsequently, target you with ads.\n\nNavigate back to the Settings panel and select Network & Internet > Private DNS. Change the setting to Private DNS provider hostname. You will need to find the URL of a filtering service to link here. Options include Ad Guard, Control D, and Mullvad, which is what I use to block ads in Chrome.\n\nOnce you save, this will redirect all DNS requests from every app and browser on your Android device through this specific block list. It should help cut down on ads and tracking servers watching you without cutting down on performance or battery life. This is also a great hack if you're a parent and your kid has access to an Android device. Use Private DNS to route them away from unsafe sites and adult content.\n\nSometimes, we accidentally dismiss a notification on Android. If you're always snoozing and missing out on important pings, you can turn on notification history.\n\nIn Settings, under Notifications, tap to turn on Notification history. Now, when you swipe to dismiss your alerts, you can peek in here to see what you forgot or accidentally swiped away. This feature is also helpful for tracking any apps that might be quietly running in the background.\n\nI don't know what it is about these latest versions of Android, but the text feels either too small or too big when adjusted with the built-in display size settings. You could go into the Accessibility settings to make the text smaller or larger, though it doesn't affect the rest of the interface much. Or you could deploy Android's display density (DPI) scaling hack.\n\nThis is where the developer options come in handy again. You can use the Smallest Width setting to control the DPI precisely, which scales every interface element up and down. Change the value to a higher number if you want fonts and images to shrink down within the resolution—if it starts in the 400s, for instance, try 500 and work backwards until you like what you see. To make fonts and graphics even larger, start around 300.\n\nWhen you plug an Android phone into a PC, it defaults to charging the device rather than turning on file transfer. You can change the option from the notification shade, though it adds a few extra steps to something that should be straightforward. Fortunately, you can tweak the USB default behavior to prioritize file transfers when the device is plugged in via USB-C.\n\nIn the Developer Options, look for Default USB configuration. Change the setting to File Transfer/Android Auto. Test it by plugging a USB-C cable into a PC to ensure it defaults to file transfer mode.\n\nWhen you stream music or podcasts through headphones or another external source, the audio isn't at its best. And while you could adjust the equalizer settings in the app that's streaming media, it won't fix much. Your phone and the audio device default to standard codecs rather than high-fidelity ones, which is why it doesn't sound as crisp and loud as it could.\n\nYou can force Android to use the highest-quality codecs whenever the audio device connects in Developer Options. Search for a Bluetooth audio codec and select the highest-quality option supported by your wireless device. Note that you must be connected to the device when you look for this option, or it will appear grayed out. While you're in the Developer Options, look for Bluetooth Audio Sample Rate and Bits Per Sample. You can adjust these to higher sampling rates if your hardware supports it.\n\nEven on the latest Android flagships, the interface can feel sluggish as you're moving between screens. That's because Android deliberately animates between every swipe and flick. But you can eliminate or shorten these animations to make the interface feel more fluid.\n\nIn Developer Options, look for Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. You can adjust their defaults; the lower the number, the faster the animation. You can also choose to turn the animation off completely if it's just too much.\n\nI suffer from migraines, and the brightest background can trigger the pain. I figured out how to force every Android app into dark mode, regardless of whether the developer coded it in.\n\nFirst, ensure \"Dark Theme\" is on in your main display settings. Then, navigate to Developer Options and search for Override force-dark. Toggle it on to save your eyes. This feature is also super helpful if you prefer to stare at the screen at night to read. Note that it may cause some apps not to display text properly, in which case, you might want to reserve this ability for when it's most necessary.\n\nSometimes you need the display to stay on without timing out. Most Android devices tap out at 30 minutes. But in the developer settings, there is an option to keep the screen \"awake\" as long as the device is plugged into a power source. I've had this feature enabled since I started covering Android phones. It's the best way to run benchmarks without being affected by random variables.\n\nIn Developer Options, search for Stay awake, then switch it on. Note that you will need to turn off the screen when charging the device overnight. Your phone could get hot from being connected and having the screen on for too long.\n\nThis has happened to me so many times: my phone rings, I answer it, but the call is routed to my smartwatch instead of my buds. While you could manually go into the phone and select the appropriate Bluetooth device, make it easier on yourself by eliminating the devices that you never want to answer the phone.\n\nIn the Settings panel, under Bluetooth, select the offending device. The easiest way to keep it from rearing its ugly head is to find the switch that completely disables phone calls. You should see an option for it at the bottom of the device's Bluetooth settings. I've disabled the Pixel Watch 4 from answering any calls because there's no instance I'd ever want to take a call from my watch. It's too public!",

    "description": "Wasn't this a thing already?",
    "fullText": "Forgetting where you parked your car isn't just a sitcom trope—though it does make for classic TV. Even in the age of the smartphone, it's all too easy to walk away from your car and retain zero memory of where you left it. As it happens, Google Maps has a solution—provided you have an iPhone.\n\nSo long as you're running the app on an Apple device, Google Maps can automatically remember where you parked and display that information on the map. There's no need to mark the location yourself, tell the app to save your spot, or take a picture of the cross streets in case you forget: You can simply glance at the screen to find a \"You parked here\" label.\n\nThe thing is, while some are reporting this feature is relatively new to them, others suggest it's been out for a while. What gives?\n\nThis feature works if you connect your iPhone to your car, whether via Bluetooth, CarPlay, or a USB cable. When you disconnect your iPhone from your car, Google Maps will assume you've parked, and will automatically mark that location on the map. The feature will also work if you give Google Maps permission to access your Motion & Fitness data, which allows the app to tell when you've started and stopped driving. (You can check on this setting from Google Maps' in-app settings: Head to Navigation, then, under \"Automatically save parking,\" tap Let maps use your motion to save your parking.)\n\nYou can also choose to set Google Maps' location permissions to \"Always,\" which gives the app persistent access to your location data, and also lets it figure out when you've stopped your car. You can change this option on your iPhone by navigating t0 Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Google Maps.\n\nThis feature is genuinely great, and I'm happy Google Maps supports it—even if Android users are inexplicably being excluded for now. But you might also be wondering to yourself, wasn't this already a feature? It doesn't sound all that new. Yet you might have even seen a flurry articles like this one today, all reporting on this \"new\" Google Maps parking feature.\n\nAs it turns out, the answer is a bit complicated. The coverage today all references this announcement on LinkedIn from Google Maps senior product manager Rio Akasaka—only that post is, according to LinkedIn, a month old. Some of the comments are more recent, but others appear to be from the original posting date.\n\nPotentially adding to the confusion, other navigation apps, like Apple Maps, already support automatically saving your parking spot, and while Google Maps has also had an option to save your parking spot for some time, it previously wasn't automatic. If you wanted the app to remember where you stopped, you needed to tap your blue dot on the map and choose \"Save your parking.\" That's how it still is on Android, since the automatic feature only works on iOS.\n\nLooking through the comment sections on articles from outlets like The Verge or MacRumors, some users insist they've had this feature for some time—well before that month-old LinkedIn announcement. This commenter says they've had the feature for years, while this one claims they've had it for \"ages.\" So what gives? Have at least some iPhone users have had this feature for years? It is possible Google has been testing out the feature with smaller subsets of users and only recently rolled it out en masse, but whether or not that actually happened is unclear at this time.\n\nI've reached out to Google for clarification about the timeline of this feature's implementation, and I will update this article if I get an answer. Until then, I can only hope Google is actively working on rolling out the feature to Android, as that really would be something new.",

    "title": "10 Ways to Use Your Hand Tools and Power Tools Together to Do More",
    "description": "For your next DIY project, get creative.",
    "fullText": "One of the best lessons I've learned across years of DIY projects is the fact that, whether powered by hand or by electricity, your tools can can serve more than the purpose for which you purchased them—provided you get creative with how you put them to use. Often, you can use two tools together to improve their performance, make them more versatile, make them easier to use, or even to to replace a tool you’re missing.\n\nHere are 10 unexpected ways to combine your hand tools and power tools to make DIY work a little easier.\n\nEye hooks serve a wide range of uses, but if you’ve ever had to drive a bunch of them into wood, you know how frustrating they can be. The usual move is to either slip a screwdriver through the hook and twist, which is slow and awkward, or to clamp a wrench or pair of pliers on top and twist, which is...also slow and awkward.\n\nThis works better: Place an Allen wrench in your power drill’s chuck, slide the end of the wrench into the eyehook, and let the drill do the work. It's faster, it saves your elbows and wrists the strain, and you’ll wonder why you never thought of it before.\n\nWood glue can be a lifesaver when you have a damaged piece of lumber—but only if you can actually get the glue inside the crack. If you’ve ever tried, you know that you wind up with glue smeared everywhere, but only a small amount seeps into the crack, leading to a pretty quick failure.\n\nDrywall knives and putty knives can develop a thick, lumpy buildup of drywall mud, paint, and anything else they’re used to scrape. Eventually, they’re almost useless because their flat surface has developed its own topography.\n\nYou can try cleaning them, but water will rust them and it’s often a laborious process, especially if they’re covered in cement or thinset. If you’ve got an orbital sander, however, cleaning your putty knives and drywall knives is pretty easy. Using a moderate grit (120 works well) pad, just sand down your blade with gentle pressure—don’t overdo it; just let the sandpaper do its work. You’ll have shiny, clean blades in no time.\n\nGetting things level is surprisingly challenging—at least for me. I can measure things five times and still somehow wind up slightly off. That makes a spirit level an essential part of my toolbox for any project (and even then, I am level-challenged, somehow).\n\nIf I forget my level, I’m in trouble—unless I happen to have a carpenter’s square and a chalk line. Place the bottom of the square on the surface you’re checking, and loop your chalk line over the top at the 90° mark so it dangles down. Then adjust until the line is directly over the 45° mark on the bottom. That’s means it's level.\n\nTrying to remove a stuck nail can be an entire project in itself. Your progress freezes while you sweat and strain, and eventually you start to damage the surface as your attempts to pull that nail get wilder and more violent.\n\nTo protect a surface you don’t want to damage and give yourself a little extra leverage on the nail, place a screwdriver under your hammer. This will give your pull a little more oomph while stopping your hammer from gouging the surface beneath.\n\nGot a stubborn nail and don’t have your hammer or prybar? Or dealing with a nail that’s lost its head? You can get it free with the help of a vise grip and a putty knife. Lock the vise grip onto the nail and slide a putty knife onto the surface behind the nail. Rotate the vise grips like a lever, and the nail will slowly pull free, while the putty knife blade protects the surface underneath from damage.\n\nWhen dealing with a screw that seems to be frozen in place, your hand screwdriver often can’t deliver enough torque, and using a power drill with a screwdriver bit is often overkill, stripping the screw in no time. To increase the torque your screwdriver can provide, combine it with a wrench or pair of adjustable pliers. Lock the pliers onto the screwdriver at a 90° angle, push down, and turn with the plier handles. Even the most stubborn screws will work themselves free.\n\nAnother way to tackle a nail that just won’t work itself free (or that’s lost its head) is to combine a vise grip and a flat prybar. Lock the grips onto the top of the nail to act as the head, then angle the prybar underneath and apply pressure. You can also slide a putty knife under the prybar blade if you want to protect the surface you’re extracting the nail from.\n\nWhen I used to rent, I was always infuriated by the “landlord special” repairs that covered screw heads with multiple layers of paint, often to the extent that I couldn’t get a screwdriver or bit to bite. That meant a lot of slow effort scraping paint out of the grooves until I got them clean enough to extract.\n\nInstead of doing that, combine a hammer and a screwdriver bit: position the bit on the screw head and give it some solid taps with the hammer. The crusted paint will fall right out, and you can get on with your work.\n\nHow much time do you think you’ve wasted trying to eyeball a drill bit when driving bolts? You estimate the bit size, you drill the hole—nope, too small. So you grab the next-largest bit and do it again. Or, worse, you estimate the drill bit and the hole is too big, and now you’ve got a problem.\n\nIf you’ve got an adjustable wrench, spare yourself the drama. Tighten the jaws of the wrench onto the bolt, then see which drill bit matches the wrench’s opening. You’ll never have to drill three times for one bolt ever again.",

While Season 1 did include a small celebration of the holidays, it wasn't until Season 7 that Fortnite held a major event with holiday-themed gameplay changes, daily challenges, and lots of free cosmetics.\n\nSeason 7 was an eventful one from the very start, as the Battle Royale island expanded with the addition of a new snow biome in the southwest corner of the map after a massive iceberg crashed into the island. It also introduced airplanes, added possibly the most infamous weapon in Fortnite history, and held one of Fortnite's most memorable live events. Scroll on to see everything you can expect from Fortnite OG Season 7.\n\nThe Season 7 OG pass includes new versions of three skins from the original Season 7 battle pass: Sgt. Winter, Lynx, and Onesie. Onesie seems to be particularly interesting, since the teaser image we have for it shows the new version with a pattern that uses one of Fortnite's emoticons. The new Onesie may be customizable with any emoticon you have.\n\nIt's interesting that the pass did not include a new version of the Ice King, despite the fact that he's the season's main character. Because of that, he's a great candidate to receive a new skin in the item shop.\n\nThe OG pass also includes style options for each skin, along with back blings, pickaxes, wraps, and emotes for each of them. The pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and it's included with Fortnite Crew.\n\nWhen the original Season 7 began, several items were removed from the loot pool, but nothing was added. Over the course of the season, though, a number of new guns and other weapons and items were added, and some existing guns were unvaulted. And one of the most notorious weapons in Fortnite history, the Infinity Blade, was added a week after launch. But more on that a bit further down.\n\nHere are the weapons that will make up the Fortnite OG loot pool in Season 7:\n\nThis weapon, which comes from Epic's mobile game of the same name, is an utterly unique weapon that takes up your entire inventory and gives bonus health and shields when you pick it up, gives siphon on kills, and makes you move faster. The Infinity Blade was so absurdly overpowered that it was vaulted after three days and never returned. Until now.\n\nThe two biggest things added to Battle Royale when Season 7 began were airplanes and ziplines. The Fortnite airplane is the X-4 Stormwing, an old-style biplane with a machine gun on the front. The X-4 only has one seat, but passengers can ride on the wings. Be warned that you will take fall damage if you fall out of one of these.\n\nFortnite had one major live event midway through Season 7, and then was rocked by a series of earthquakes during the final stretch of the season--a trick Epic has used many other times since then.\n\nThe mid-season Ice Storm event, which went down on January 19, 2019, was relatively short but extremely memorable, as it involved the spirit of the Ice King standing over the island and conjuring a blizzard that covered the entire island with snow. When the match began only one corner of the island had snow, and when it ended the snow was everywhere. And it stayed that way for weeks.\n\nThe southwestern corner of the island got a dramatic makeover and expansion for the start of Season 7 with the addition of a large iceberg and a layer of snow cover. The iceberg destroyed the beloved Greasy Grove and Flush Factory, but it added three new named locations with Polar Peak, Frosty Flights, and Happy Hamlet. Season 7 also saw the introduction of The Block in the northwest corner of the island later in the season.\n\nThe Block was a big empty space where Epic would showcase places created using Fortnite Creative tools, which were introduced for the first time at the beginning of Season 7--these user-created spots would rotate regularly. We don't know what, if anything, Epic will do with The Block in Fortnite OG",

    "title": "How (and Why) I Use My Garmin Running Watch to Track Rests During Strength Workouts",
    "description": "Garmin has the most useful rest timer of any wearable I've tried.",
    "fullText": "The strength training mode in Garmin watches like the Forerunner 570 is a little confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly useful in the gym. Garmin handles rest timers better than any other wearable I've tried, and when combined with a third-party app called LiftTrack, you can even track your volume and PRs. I'll lead you through how I use this workout mode, and how it's helped me do more work in less time in the gym.\n\nI’ll get into how to create workouts in a minute, but first I just want to let you know that there are some strength workouts already available for download, if you’d like to just select one and start doing it right now. Go to either your Garmin Connect app or to Garmin Connect on the web, tap Training & Planning, then Workouts, then Find a Workout.\n\nYou’ll be able to choose workouts from a library, and you can search by type (including weights, yoga, and bodyweight cardio). Most of the workouts are short, simple, and don’t use much equipment. If you’re experienced at strength training, you’ll probably want to create your own workouts or use the coach feature, but these will get you started in the meantime.\n\nAs for that coach feature, it works much like the adaptive running coach plans. You can read more here from Garmin, but basically you set it up by selecting Garmin Coach and telling it your goals and schedule. Workouts will then appear for you each day. The image above shows a Push/Pull/Legs workout programmed by Garmin Coach. It let me choose which workout happens on which day, had me set my max lifts as benchmarks (this program uses percentages), and even let me edit the workouts to swap exercises before finally putting them on my calendar.\n\nI’m going to walk you through this step-by-step, because I was so confused the first time I tried to build a workout. Again, you can do this either on your phone or on the web. I usually end up creating my workouts on the phone, and it’s not hard once you get the hang of it. One tip, though: you can skip this whole process if you're willing to install a third-party app. LiftTrack takes care of workout planning and syncs to your Garmin account, and you can read more about how to use that app here.\n\nGo to the “More” menu on your phone (or the sidebar on web) and select Training & Planning, then Workouts, and then Create a Workout. From here, select Strength, and you’ll be given a skeleton of a workout with a warmup, cooldown, and one slot for an exercise.\n\nTo start adding exercises, tap Add Round, which will give you a workout card and a recovery card, both in a little box that says “2 Rounds” at the top. Here’s what you do to turn this into a traditional sets-and-reps format (in this example, we want to do four sets of five deadlifts at 200 pounds):\n\nTap the card that says workout.\n\nSelect an exercise (deadlift), a weight (200 pounds), and a target type. In this case, the target type will be Reps (five). Hit the arrow on the top left of the screen to return to the main workout editing page.\n\nFor the recovery card, you’ll want to change that to Rest rather than Recovery. For that one, the target type should be Time. Let’s set it to three minutes. Return to the main workout screen again.\n\nNow, tap the dropdown at the top of the round and set it to the number of sets you want to do (four). If your watch supports it, you can select Skip Last Recovery to avoid the final rest period.\n\nBefore you add another set, go to the bottom of the screen and tap Add Step. Change this new step to Rest (it will be outside of the repeat) and set the target to Lap Button Press.\n\nNow you have a repeat that will give you four sets of five deadlifts with a three-minute rest timer in between. After you finish that, there will be a rest period that lasts until you press the lap button. This is to give you as much time as you need to find your equipment and set up for the next exercise. Continue adding repeats and steps as desired, and make sure to save the workout when you’re done.\n\nAfter creating a workout, it doesn’t automatically show up on your watch. You need to tap the “send to watch” icon that you’ll see on the top right of your screen when you’re looking at the workout.\n\nYou can also schedule a workout (which will automatically send it to your watch for the scheduled day) by using the three dots menu to add it to your calendar.\n\nThere are a few ways to access the strength workouts, but here’s the easiest: When it’s gym time, hit the button that starts an activity, and rather than selecting Strength, scroll down until you find Workouts. Tap the one you want to do.\n\nPay attention here: You’ll need to select the workout, tell it you want to do the workout, and start the workout. (Just keep pressing the select button until the workout actually begins.)\n\nThe exact details of which buttons do what will vary from watch to watch, but on a Forerunner, your top right button starts and stops the workout, and your bottom right button is a lap button. (During a timed rest, you can press the lap button to skip to the end of that rest and start the next set.) From the top right button, you can also skip a group of sets (say, if the squat rack was busy, you can skip squats) and then use the same menu later to View Skipped and add it back in.\n\nI love using the strength workout feature for one main reason: the customizable timed rests. Rest is important in the gym because you'll be able to lift more if you dial in the perfect rest time for each exercise. It’s easy to sit around scrolling on your phone between sets and realize too late that it’s been 10 minutes since you did your last deadlift. But when I program the workout as above, all I have to do is hit the lap button after my set. Three minutes later, my watch will buzz to let me know it’s time to do the next set.\n\nPro tip: Set your rest timer for the longest time you might want to rest between sets. If you’re aiming for three to five minutes, set it for five minutes. If you’re ready to go after three, just hit the lap button to skip the remainder of that rest.\n\nYou can also program exercises in other ways besides the traditional sets and reps. For example, set the Target Type to Time to do a five-minute density set. Or do EMOMs (every-minute-on-the-minute intervals) by putting just one card inside a repeat, and setting that card to a one-minute target time. You’ll get a beep at the top of each minute.\n\nI don’t worry too much about the weights or reps in the app, to be honest. By default, the watch will ask you after each set how many reps you did and how heavy the weight was. I’ve turned that feature off, and I don’t even bother to set rep or weight targets in the app. I use the workouts for timing, not to log the details of my workout. (I have a notebook for that.)\n\nI also haven’t found the automatic set detection or rep counting to be very useful. The watch is impressively good sometimes—how did it know I was doing pullups?!—but it’s just not good enough to be generally useful. It also doesn’t recognize a lot of the Olympic weightlifting exercises I do. And the rep counting? Sometimes OK, but more often useless. Again, I’d rather jot down my reps in that notebook than fiddle with selecting a number on my watch screen after each set.",

    "description": "The mysterious algorithm is now (somewhat) customizable.",
    "fullText": "After years of suffering from a crippling TikTok addiction, I decided enough was enough: I quit the app cold turkey and deleted it from my phone. Then, I discovered Instagram Reels, and my attention span hasn't been the same since.\n\nTikTok's algorithm is infamous, but we don't give Instagram's enough credit. This platform is addicting. I hardly use the app to keep up with friends and family anymore: Reels grabs my attention and doesn't let go, and before I know it, it's midnight, and I've done nothing with my evening. How many videos did I watch? What did I even watch? Whatever Meta has going on in that algorithm is dangerous stuff.\n\nYou can influence the algorithm, of course: The decisions you make in the app—likes, comments, watch time, sharing—tell the algorithm which videos you like, which you don't, and inform its fraction-of-a-second decisions about what to show you next. But until now, you haven't been able to see what's driving those decisions. You're kind of flying blind—you can try to steer the algorithm in a new direction, but you'll never know exactly what direction you're really going in.\n\nThat's now changing. As reported by Wired, Meta is rolling out a new tab for Reels viewers that will let us see why the algorithm is delivering us these particular videos. This tab, called, appropriately, \"Your Algorithm,\" is now rolling out, first in the U.S., but soon to the rest of the world—at least, only to English speakers. It seems reminiscent of TikTok's \"Manage Topics\" feed, which lets you adjust the content types that appear in your For You feed.\n\nWhen \"Your Algorithm\" hits your phone, you'll find it in the top right corner of the Reels feed: two lines with heart icons placed on each. (I had to update the app and force quit it a couple times to get it to appear.) Once you open this tab, you'll see a short summary of the type of content the algorithm says you've liked recently. In Meta's example, it says, \"Lately you've been into creativity, sports hype, fitness motivation, [and] skateboarding.\" Mine says, \"Lately you've been into classic video games, laughing at comedy clubs, and making beats in the studio.\"\n\nBeneath this summary, you'll find the \"What you want to see more of\" section. Here, you can choose specific content categories you'd like to appear in your feed more often. Instagram will populate some choices here based on your past interests—Meta's example from above shows things like \"Sports,\" \"GRWM,\" \"Thrifting,\" and \"Horror movies\"—but you can tap an \"Add\" button to contribute your own requests. You can tap any of these content types to find the option to watch Reels in that category, in case you want to test drive any before locking in your choices.\n\nBeneath this, you'll find \"What you want to see less of.\" This is the same concept, but the reverse: You can choose any content types you don't want in your feed anymore. If you're sick of seeing hiking videos, but Instagram continues to show them to you, here's your chance to directly tell the algorithm to cut it out.\n\nIf you tap the three dots in the top right, you'll find some shortcuts to existing content controls, too, like whether to suggest political content on your feed, \"sensitive\" content controls, and specific words and phrase filters, to name a few. You can also tap the share button to share your algorithm summary to your story. I'm not sure who would want to do that, but I guess I shared my summary here, so who am I to judge.\n\nWired highlights how these changes come as the European Commission is pushing Meta to present more data controls to EU users: These users have so far been able to pay to not see ads, but since the European Commission didn't think that was enough, Meta will allow users to choose whether to allow all their data to be used for personalized ads, or only a small percentage.\n\nThat's not happening here in the U.S., but that doesn't mean Meta is staying the same, either. \"Your Algorithm\" is launching as Meta is facing criticism over how it handles younger users on its platforms. Reports suggest Meta understands how addictive its apps are, especially to teens, and the company's internal policies for chatbot interactions with minors was, frankly, appalling. The company has rolled out Teen Accounts across apps like Instagram and Facebook, which offer limits on communications and interactions, and new AI parental controls are also on their way. \"Your Algorithm\" seems to be the latest in a string of efforts to make it easier for users to control the experience on Meta platforms. Theoretically, you could even use these controls to make your Reels experience less addicting.\n\nThose are all good developments as far as I'm concerned, but I fear there's still quite a lot of work to do to make Meta's products—as well as many other social media products—less addictive, and, overall, better for us. Case in point: I opened the app to test out \"Your Algorithm,\" and not only did I not find it at first, I ended up losing five minutes of my life watching the first video that appeared in my feed. I need to delete Instagram from my phone.",

    "fullText": "A Russian feminist reflects on Julia Ioffe’s history of modern Russia.\n\nMOSCOW—Julia Ioffe’s new book, Motherland: A Feminist History of Modern Russia, from Revolution to Autocracy (Ecco), immediately brings to mind Soviet Women: Walking the Tightrope (1989) by Francine du Plessix Gray. It was one of the first popular books about Soviet women, published as the Iron Curtain was coming down. The characters of Gray’s book were successful and professional women who talked a lot about their burdensome living conditions, the horrible conditions of Soviet maternity hospitals, about their “emancipation fatigue.” They dreamed of hiding behind a reliable and strong man, whom they often missed from their lives. As a matter of fact, this was indeed the yearning of many women in the Perestroika years. They had become fed up with Soviet hypocrisy and were longing for that “American dream” they had glimpsed in the first films about the West that reached the USSR.\n\nThis illusion evaporated in the1990s—the early days of “Wild Capitalism.” As Katrina vanden Heuvel noted in her review in the Nation, du Plessix Gray failed to discern quite a few of the perestroika realities Nevertheless, the book sparked interest and prompted many researchers and scholars to begin working together with colleagues from the former Soviet Union—and this collaboration proved to be successful. Over the past thirty years, Russian women became the subject of dozens of books and hundreds of articles on both sides of the Atlantic, of newly created university centers, and of dozens of scholarly events and conferences. Unfortunately, most of them are known only to a narrow circle of specialists. At present, academic contacts with Russia are virtually frozen, and dialogue is barely maintained, even though not completely extinguished.\n\nAgainst this background, Ioffe’s book presents itself “as reopening the subject,” almost as if from scratch. It reminds American readers that a vast country of 145 million people has other residents beside Vladimir Putin. This is unquestionably important.\n\nThe author left the USSR with her parents in 1990 as a child. She tells her family story of four generations of women who were educated professionals, while accurately noting that this was commonplace in the Soviet Union. From my standpoint, her family saga is the most interesting part of her book; she alternates the chapters of this story with brief notes on historical figures, including the wives of Soviet leaders, and on many important events of the Soviet era. In the preface, Ioffe defines her task: to understand how “the country of [Alexandra] Kollontai and women fighter pilots become a country of women who wanted nothing more than to become housewives.”\n\nIn essence, she repeats the claim of du Plessix Gray, which is perplexing, and not just for a Russian reader.\n\nIoffe has clearly done a lot of research and surveyed important publications of the period; she reminds readers of the names of historical figures, most of them unfamiliar to Americans, and she does so in an engrossing, at times even cinematic manner. The chapters of the book resemble fragments of a TV series script—with attention paid to the requirements of the genre (and to audience expectations), with the requisite eroticism, glamour and a touch of horror.\n\nAt the same time, those readers who are somewhat familiar with the subject will notice significant gaps in the narrative, arbitrary emphases, a mixture of hearsay and facts, allegiance to the stereotypes transmitted via mass media, and other shortcomings. Undoubtedly, the author of a journalistic book is not a historian and is entitled to her own interpretation. Yet it is regrettable that Ioffe’s version of the history of Russia’s women tells us so little about Russian feminism as such, which emerged long before Kollontai and continues to this day.\n\n“Three projects for the emancipation of women in Russia—pre-revolutionary, Soviet, and post-Soviet feminism—were cut short due to historical factors,” says Russian sociologist Olga Zdravomyslova. “Yet each of them was important for the life and self-perception of the country.” And the Soviet experience of women’s active participation in the economy and society, even though under total control, enabled women to join forces in the 1990s, with the rise of the “wild market,” in efforts to solve their most pressing problems, such as how to put bread on their families’ table, how to maintain sanity, how to “find themselves” in the new, often rough conditions.\n\nIn the years when Ioffe was learning the basics of English grammar in the US, millions of Russian women had lost their jobs (for reasons that included the popular neoliberal myth that women are bad workers and jobs should be given to men), were deprived of government support, kindergartens, and other benefits, they began to learn the basics of entrepreneurship . Those who only the day before were still engineers were now baking pies and trading in the market, importing cheap clothes from China and Poland, and were setting up clubs and coteries while sharing their experience.\n\nI was writing about these women in the mid-to-late 1980s into the 1990s, for glasnost- era publications Ogonyok and Nezavisimaya Gazeta, marveling at their courage and talent, and realizing that they were the ones saving the country, as has often been the case in Soviet history. The independent women’s movement of the 1990s largely emerged as a result of Gorbachev’s democratic perestroika (Gorbachev, incidentally, wanted to involve women more actively in its processes) and quickly gained momentum.\n\nAccording to the results of a study commissioned by the Russian government in 2000, one in five Russians, that is, 30 million people per year, were the recipients of assistance from Russian civic organizations—and most of it was the work of women. NGOs employed two million people. And quite a few of these organizations were not dependent on Western grant money, as businesses and individual citizens started to contribute to them. Women’s organizations existed in every city and village, seeking to solve practical problems. There were academic initiatives, feminist centers, crisis support centers, gender departments in universities, self-help groups, soldiers’ mothers, political clubs, and for a short period, a women’s caucus in parliament. Not all of these efforts were mutually supportive, yet despite this, the results of their work turned out to be impressive.\n\nJust as the six years of perestroika changed the country beyond recognition, so did a decade and a half of active development of the independent women’s movement deeply impact and, most importantly, women’s self-awareness. The 1993 Constitution of the Russian Federation had Article 19, establishing equal rights and opportunities, while the Labor Code and Family Code now included provisions on social and economic protections for mothers.\n\nThere were short-term programs on reproductive health and sex education; even though they were subsequently curtailed, they were kept alive by NGOs. As a result of this, Russia is now on a par with Europe with regards to the number of abortions, while before that it had, along with Romania, the largest number of them among the countries of the world. According to prominent population studies expert Anatoly Vishnevsky, this came about precisely because of all this work, as the new generation internalized new rules of behavior.  believed that this was the result of such work, with a new generation learning new rules of behavior. The rhetoric of patriarchy and its propaganda have not significantly impacted the new rules of behavior.\n\nAs of this year, women make up 45 percent of all entrepreneurs, are included in the Forbes list of billionaires, and hold high level positions not only in the service sector, but also in finance and the oil industry. Most importantly, people’s mindsets have changed.\n\nThese days, a woman in a position of leadership is not perceived as an oddity. The overwhelming majority of Russians consider domestic violence to be a crime, regardless the absence of a corresponding law, and despite the propaganda of patriarchy, and pressure on NGOs. Hotlines and shelters operate in Russia, and the Consortium of Women’s NGOs handles hundreds of cases each year, often winning in court. Mari Davtyan, a lawyer and the head of the Consortium, as well as journalist Eva Merkachova are important voices in the Russian media landscape. Under the new restrictions, many groups operate informally, helping prisoners and refugees from war zones. This huge layer of everyday life in a country spanning nine time zones is not reflected in either the Russian or international media. Women’s activism and feminist thought, awakened by perestroika, continue to develop in cities with millions of inhabitants and modest regional centers. Working in spite of censorship and pressure from the authorities is a long-standing Russian tradition: a wealth of experience has been accumulated, and it is very much in demand today.\n\nOne of the most vivid chapters in Ioffe’s book is called “The Hunt.” It is about women hunting for millionaires and about their coaching school, the Moscow Life Academy. Even though it describes the events of 2012 when Ioffe came to Moscow as a reporter, they also recall, unwittingly, the TV programs from the 1990s.\n\nIoffe believes that the “fairy-tale country” was submerged under authoritarianism waves. The feminist project failed because of men in power.\n\nIs this really so? And is it true that young Russian women dream exclusively of marrying a millionaire?\n\nI remember in the 1990s, some female students really did want to find a sugar daddy so they could live a glamorous life and write for fashion magazines.  In the 2000s, they thought about the benefits of having a rich husband to support their own creative projects.  Meanwhile, in recent years, many stopped thinking of marrying at altogether; instead, they are obsessed with their own projects and would like to pick a like-minded partner in the future. Their life strategy is completely at odds with the propaganda that actively promotes the patriarchal model of the family and the place of women in society.\n\nBut in Russia, propaganda and reality have long been moving apart from each other. A recent study on women in entrepreneurial life by Elena Rozhdestvenskaya, a professor at the Higher School of Economics, yielded unexpected results: a new group of women has emerged, consisting of executives and top managers, often the daughters and granddaughters of influential men. They have no need for rich husbands; they are ambitious and super professional, picking men who are convenient for them. They are transforming the traditional family structure, yet at the same time almost all of them have families and children. They do not express open solidarity with feminist ideas, yet they defend a feminine style of leadership and set up their own private clubs. This is a new type of modern Russian elite.\n\n“As for the future of feminism in Russia,” says Olga Zdravomyslova, “it is hard to say what it will be like. Perhaps young feminists will start all over again, disregarding the past. But it could be different.”\n\nIn the final chapters of the book, Ioffe bitterly concurs with her father’s words that “our homeland is a country without a future.” And yet her book does not leave an unequivocal impression on the reader. Precisely because of its unevenness, its incompleteness, its subjectivity, it is more likely (I would like to think) to encourage us to learn more about the lives of people living in a vast territory spanning nine time zones, and to hear their vibrant and very dissimilar, voices—just like the book by Francine de Plessix Gray did in its own time. At the meetings of the gender caucus of the Yabloko Party in Moscow, in university lecture halls, at artistic events in various cities, I encounter young women who speak passionately about the future of Russia, and the things that can already to be done today to achieve this vision, or what they have already been doing, here and now. Some of them are studying the history of feminism. And while listening to them, I believe in their success.\n\nTranslated by Antonina W.

    "fullText": "If you picked up your iPhone to round out your Apple Music Replay for the year, or turned on your TV to watch a show like Pluribus, you might have noticed something odd: Neither service is working. It's not just you: Apple Music, Apple TV, and Game Center are currently down.\n\nThat's directly from Apple's \"System Status\" website, which tracks all of Apple's web-based services and identifies which ones may be experiencing problems. While most of Apple's services, like the App Store, Find My, and iMessage, are all \"Available,\" four of these services are experiencing an outage: Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple TV Channels, and Game Center.\n\nIf you click on each, you can see the service's full status report:\n\nUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.\n\nUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.\n\nUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.\n\nGame Center - 1 Outage, 1 Resolved Issue\n\nOutage: Today, 2:53 PM - ongoing\n\nUsers may be experiencing a problem with this service.\n\nResolved Issue: Today, 8:43 AM - 9:14 AM\n\nUsers may have experienced a problem with this service.\n\nIt's not clear what is causing the outages, though they all went down at 2:53 p.m.. (Apple doesn't specify, but I imagine that's ET.) This isn't the first time this has happened, of course. In fact, Apple Music was down earlier this year, though it was actually still working for me when Apple said the outage was active.\n\nThat appears to be the situation today, as well. Each report says \"some users are affected,\" not all. As it happens, Apple Music is working on my Mac, and I'm able to stream the free pilot episode of Pluribus without issue.\n\nApple will likely get these services back up and running for affected users. In the meantime, if your Apple Music or Apple TV won't cooperate, this is likely the cause.",

Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today.

    "description": "Vance appeared to joke when replying to a user sharing the rumored image: \"I always wear an undershirt in public to fight with my wife.\"",
    "fullText": "A photo shared online in December 2025 authentically showed U.S. Vice President JD Vance arguing with his wife, Usha Vance, in a restaurant.\n\nIn December 2025, an image circulated on social media purportedly showing U.S. Vice President JD Vance arguing with his wife, Usha Vance, in a restaurant.\n\nThe image appeared to show JD Vance wearing a white T-shirt and a stern expression while sitting across from Usha Vance. One Facebook user who shared it (archived) wrote:\n\nLooks like things are not so good in Republicanistan. Usha is a liberal. Always has been. Apparently they were having and [sic] argument loud enough to quiet the restaurant. Why is he wearing a tee shirt?\n\nThe image circulated elsewhere on Facebook and X (archived here and here). In short, it was fake.\n\nAfter Snopes initially published its story, YouTuber Keith Edwards reached out to confirm the image was a thumbnail he created for an October 2025 video, describing it as \"fake.\" Edwards told us he used the artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT to create the image.\n\nThe thumbnail matched the image circulating on social media. In both, the man wore the same facial expression and the woman was positioned the same way. A reverse image search did not lead us to any earlier version of the fabricated image.\n\nJD Vance himself appeared to support the conclusion that the image was fake in a Dec. 9 X post (archived), replying to a user who shared the image with a comment that seemed to poke fun at the rumor: \"I always wear an undershirt when I go out in public to have a fight loudly with my wife.\"\n\nI always wear an undershirt when I go out in public to have a fight loudly with my wife. https://t.co/LUivOsVv2u\n\n— JD Vance (@JDVance) December 9, 2025\n\nWe also ran the image through three AI-detection platforms: Hive, Sightengine and Image Whisperer. Sightengine estimated a 97% probability that the image was AI-generated, while Image Whisperer concluded with \"high confidence\" it was AI-generated.\n\nHive, however, flagged the image as \"not likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content.\" It's worth noting that these tools are not always accurate and their results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nPrior to Edwards' confirmation, the team at GetReal Security, which specializes in authenticating digital media, also analyzed the image for Snopes.\n\nHany Farid, co-founder of GetReal and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told us that the image's low quality made forensic analysis difficult. However, the team found \"biometric anomalies\" suggesting the image \"may be AI-generated or is simply a photo of someone that resembles [JD] Vance.\"\n\n\"In particular, the facial features in the image do not match contemporaneous images of Vance,\" Farid added. Contemporaneous images are photos taken around the same time that are used to verify another image's authenticity.\n\nMatthew Stamm, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Drexel University, told Snopes that he and his doctoral student analyzed the image to determine whether it was AI-generated, using a specialized forensic tool that detects subtle \"fingerprints\" left by generative AI. Stamm said the tool \"determined with roughly 95% confidence that it was unable to detect traces left by generative AI.\"\n\nHowever, he cautioned that this does not prove the image is real and cannot definitively rule out AI generation. Factors such as its size, low resolution and repeated sharing on social media made the analysis difficult, changing \"the quality of the forensic traces that we analyze, similar to how fingerprints at a crime scene might be smudged,\" Stamm explained.\n\nThe fabricated image spread online amid rumors of a rift in the Vances' marriage, which began to spread in October 2025. Photos of Usha Vance without her wedding ring taken the following month further fueled speculation.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson told USA Today in a Nov. 21 statement that Usha Vance \"is a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.\" Other publicly available Getty Images from November showed Usha Vance wearing her wedding ring.\n\nIn a Dec. 4 interview with NBC News, JD Vance said the couple's marriage is \"as strong as it's ever been.\"\n\nX (Formerly Twitter), 9 Dec. 2025, x.com/JDVance/status/1998459532977099256.

    "description": "Scientists used X-rays and CT scans to explore a mummified crocodile, uncovering incredible details about its last meal, and ancient Egyptian rituals.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAncient Egyptians regularly mummified crocodiles in elaborate ceremonies in dedication to their crocodile god Sobek.\n\nA study of one of these crocodiles reveals details about the animal’s death and the methods through which Ancient Egyptians captured these fearsome predators.\n\nUsing x-ray and CT-scanning technologies, archaeozoologists can now explore the insides of these animals, which, unlike human mummification, have their organs intact.\n\nTo uncover the mysteries of the past, scientists employ a wide variety of techniques to get at the truth. Climate scientists drill two-mile-long ice cores to glimpse Earth’s past climatic conditions. Paleontologists analyze sediment layers to visualize the physical timeline of past epochs. And while Egyptologists similarly deploy lots of state of the art archeological techniques, sometimes it’s best to just use a mummified crocodile stomach.\n\nThat’s exactly what researchers at the University of Manchester did with a 3,000-year-old, 7.2-foot-long crocodile corpse, kept at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and known simply as 2005.335. Although Ancient Egyptians typically removed organs when mummifying humans, crocodiles sacrificed to the crocodile god Sobek kept their innards intact, and this small deviation from tradition allows scientists in the 21st century to analyze the organs to unlock mysteries of this strange sacrificial ritual.\n\nTo preserve the specimen for future display, the research team deployed non-invasive techniques, such as x-rays and CT scanning, to catalog the contents of the crocodile’s stomach. Among the ancient gastronomic detritus, scientists found some usual suspects called gastroliths, which are small stones crocodiles regularly swallow to aid digestion.\n\nHowever, the scientists also found intact fish baited to a bronze hook. Because the time frame between the croc’s last meal and its death was so short—the gastroliths hadn’t reached the stomach yet—the crocodile was likely intentionally caught by Ancient Egyptians to be part of a sacrificial ceremony to Sobek.\n\n“Whereas earlier studies favored invasive techniques such as unwrapping and autopsy, 3D radiography provides the ability to see inside without damaging these important and fascinating artifacts,” University of Manchester archaeozoologist Lidija McKnight, co-author of a study published in the journal Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage, said in a press statement.\n\nWhile keeping the long-dead crocodilian intact, McKnight and her team also “virtually” recreated the bronze hook lodged in the specimen’s stomach for future museum displays. McKnight says that in the past Ancient Egyptians likely used hardened clay to create a mold and then poured molten metal over a charcoal fire to create the hook.\n\n“Despite the passing of several millennia between the production of the ancient fish hook and the modern replica, the casting process remains remarkably similar,” McKnight said in the press statement.\n\nAlthough 2005.335 met a grisly fate, crocodiles were actually revered in Ancient Egyptian society for their strength but also their displays of gentleness (especially with their young)—but perhaps they were too revered. Archeologists believe that this Nile-based culture, in which the crocodile was the top predator (besides humans, of course), likely bred the animals specifically for sacrificial purposes by “crocodile cults.” In the Egyptian town of Fayoum, which was the center of worship for Sobek, experts have uncovered thousands of mummified crocodiles, many of them babies.\n\nBut thanks to these long-ago sacrifices, the story behind these ancient mummified crocodiles is finally spilling its guts.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "On Air Force One, Donald Trump was surprised when a door flung open to smack the 79-year-old on his backside.\n\nThis happened on Tuesday night while the President was talking to reporters. Donald was on his way to Monroe County, Pennsylvania, at the time to deliver a speech. While the awkward moment was captured on tape, the President seemed to take it all with a grain of salt, having fun with it all.\n\n.@POTUS: \"You're going to have to take it easy with that thing. It's a government plane, but I like to take care of it.\"\n\nALWAYS WATCHING OUT FOR THE TAXPAYER! pic.twitter.com/i31QMF62XL\n\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 9, 2025\n\nWhat began as friendly banter with the press became a rather bizarre moment on the Presidential plane on Tuesday. Donald happened to be near the bathroom at the time before realizing someone was inside. The door happened to hit the President in the back.\n\nMembers of the media seemed to have a good chuckle over that, including the President, who told the person inside to “come on out.” The nameless person proceeded to close the door, perhaps out of fear of embarrassment or being identified.\n\nTuesday’s moment, while awkward, was one of the more light-hearted ones that we have seen involving Donald and the media. The President doesn’t seem to have a particularly healthy relationship with the press and has notably had very harsh responses to female reporters. He recently attacked Rachel Scott for her question about whether or not they’d release video of alleged airstrikes on Venezuela.\n\nDonald has also verbally attacked female reporters while aboard his plane. Catherine Lucy previously asked him about the Jeffrey Epstein files, prompting Donald to reply, “Quiet Piggy” to her. The Commander-in-Chief looked her dead in the eye and reportedly pointed at her when making the remark, according to reports.\n\nThe President playfully chastised somebody with a large boom mic during the Air Force One moment after they supposedly lost their balance.\n\nTELL US – DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HOW AGGRESSIVE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WHEN ANSWERING THE MEDIA’S QUESTIONS?\n\nThe post Donald Trump Hit During Live Press Conference appeared first on Reality Tea.",

There was a lot of learning. Every one of our biggest defeats, we will always come back better.\n\n\"These players are maxing. You don't want to lose a game but you have to learn from it.

I think I can reach that level.\n\n\"The first goal was really nice, second a tap-in but the first one was sweet. Delighted with the result.\n\n\"We're fighting on all fronts. I feel like we can win this competition and win the league - that has to be the aim. We're in a good place at the moment.\"",
