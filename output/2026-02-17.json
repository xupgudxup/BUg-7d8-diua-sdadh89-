That doesn’t that is enough for the empire Roger Goodell has helped expand.\n\nAfter NBC and the NBA agreed to a contract for Sunday Night basketball, it was revealed the NBA will be paid $2.45B per year.

Their viewership and brand is much stronger than that over the NBA.\n\nFor reference, the NFL’s Christmas Day performance saw a 27.5M viewership for one game versus the NBA’s 5.5M. It’s clear the NFL product is much more valuable. Is it worth a fuss over $450M margin?\n\nAfter all, the league is doing plenty well both in the owners’ and player’s pockets.

However, with the recent hire of Paul DePodesta as president of baseball operations and Josh Byrnes as general manager, things are starting to change.\n\nYou also cannot forget that Colorado has been loading up their farm system over the years, and players like Charlie Condon, Chase Dollander, and Brody Brecht are right around the corner from being on the big league roster.\n\nHowever, fans may want to prepare themselves for more of the same this season. They do not have the talent to do much, but should have a better record than their 43-119 record last season.\n\nMORE: Rockies' Zac Veen added 40-plus pounds amid positive offseason makeover\n\nWith Spring Training this week, many fans are starting to pay attention to the position battles at camp. Some teams have some top prospects looking to force their front office's hand, teams looking to finalize their rotation, or spots in the infield or outfield.\n\nTypically, there is only one or two major battles to watch for with each team. However, things are different for Colorado.\n\nInstead of needing to finalize one position, Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter explains the Rockies' need to finalize their entire infield situation minus shortstop.\n\n\"There's casting a wide net, and then there's whatever the Rockies are doing when it comes to building their 2026 infield. Ezequial Tovar is locked in at shortstop, but the other three spots are truly wide open. Edouard Julien figures to start somewhere on the right side of the infield, while Kyle Karros showed enough last year to get an extended look at the hot corner. Ryan Ritter has a 20/20 ceiling and veteran Willi Castro can plug in anywhere, though he's most valuable playing everywhere. With no shortage of options, this battle could rage on until Opening Day rosters are announced.\"\n\nColorado has a ton to figure out over the next few weeks, but things could be worse. It's better to have too many options than to have very few, if none at all.\n\nPirates' fans won't like seeing this Konnor Griffin roster prediction\n\nVeterans and a top prospect square off for the Cubs' fourth outfielder spot\n\nRangers head to camp with Kumar Rocker and Jacob Latz battling for the rotation\n\nA's still looking for their closer following the Mason Miller trade\n\nTravis Bazzana's WBC commitment may cost him an Opening Day roster spot",

After a perfect run through Group C, the Americans have officially secured their spot in the quarterfinals of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. By finishing as the No. 2 overall seed, just behind Canada, the U.S. has earned a critical first-round bye, allowing them to bypass the qualification playoffs and head straight into the final eight.\n\nThe preliminary round finale was a statement victory as Team USA dismantled Germany with a 5-1 win on Sunday. Captain Auston Matthews silenced early-tournament critics by exploding for two goals and an assist, leading an offensive onslaught that saw the Americans control the pace from the opening puck drop. Behind him, the physical presence of the Tkachuk brothers and a 23-save performance from goaltender Connor Hellebuyck proved that this roster is as balanced as it is star-studded.\n\nWhile the U.S. enjoyed a smooth path through the group stage -- outscoring opponents 16-5 over three games -- the competition is about to intensify.

The first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.  “When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter.",
    "fullText": "DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the last person to leave the Toronto dugout after the Game 7 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series last fall because the star slugger wanted that to be the moment when he moved on.\n\nThe first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.\n\n“When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter. “Right then, I just turned the page.”\n\nThe Blue Jays lost the decisive game 5-4 in 11 innings, missing on a second consecutive chance to clinch the franchise's third championship at home. For manager John Schneider, this spring training is no different from a year ago.\n\n“The main message is we’re not defending anything,” Schneider said. “We’re not defending the AL East. We’re not defending the American League. We’re attacking 2026 like we did in 2025 or any year, really. You’re trying to win the division, you’re trying to win the World Series. That’s it.”\n\nGuerrero jolted the franchise at the start of the spring last year, when he said there was no deal on a new contract and that his own deadline for getting one done had passed, raising the specter of free agency in 2026.\n\nInstead, the sides settled on a $500 million, 14-year contract early last season, and the son of Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero went on to hit .292 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs.\n\nIn the postseason, Guerrero had a 1.289 OPS while hitting .397 with eight homers in 18 games and was MVP of the American League Championship Series. He didn't homer in any of his first three trips to the playoffs, and the Blue Jays lost all six of those games.\n\n“Going back to the postseason last year, I think it’s really cool for everyone to be on that heightened stage and to see how they responded,” Schneider said. “I think that kind of bleeds into this year, but (Guerrero) has been a little bit more vocal than I’ve ever seen him, a little bit more loose than I’ve ever seen him and understands that he’s one of the best players in the game.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Guerrero, a five-time All-Star, is now the longest-tenured Blue Jays player.\n\n“I don’t see myself as a leader,” Guerrero said. “I always put myself as a good teammate, and when you are a good teammate, then you become a good leader. I’m a good teammate.”\n\nHis role as the face of the franchise was cemented when Bo Bichette left the team, signing a $126 million, three-year with the New York Mets and moving from shortstop to third base.\n\n“It’s difficult not having him around,” said Guerrero, who played with Bichette through the minor leagues. “I mean, we played 10 years together. But at the same time, I understand it’s business, and he has to take care of his family as well.”\n\nThe Blue Jays signed Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto to fill the void left by Bichette while adding pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce.\n\n“I think we’re very capable,” Guerrero said. “I think it’s going to be more fun, and I’m actually more happy than last year.”\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "fullText": "Three-year NFL veteran and safety for the Cleveland Browns, Ronnie Hickman, was assaulted by a group of four individuals following a confrontation in the lobby of a Sixty Les hotel located on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York. The incident occurred at approximately 4:30 am after a group of individuals, who remain unidentified, approached Hickman shortly after he entered the building.\n\nAccording to the local authorities who originally spoke with the New York Post, police are actively investigating the matter, as well as whether or not Hickman’s status as a professional athlete had any influence in their decision to approach him. “The suspects slugged Hickman and took off,” the official report states.\n\nThe franchise itself confirmed that Hickman “was a victim of assault early Monday morning at a New York City hotel,” and a personal representative of the Ohio State product also informed the post that “Ronnie was treated for minor injuries at an area hospital after the incident, was later released, and is home resting with his family.”\n\nThe incident, unfortunately, comes right after Hickman had managed to enjoy a career-defining breakout. After recording just 70 total tackles with the Browns throughout all of 2023 and 2024, he managed to finally become a full-time starter in 2025.\n\nThe 2023 undrafted free agent tallied 103 combined tackles throughout his 17 starts this past season, snagging two interceptions and deflecting seven passes along the way. At this time, police have admitted that no arrests have been made and that all four of the primary suspects remain at large.\n\nStaff members who were on site at the time of the assault have also refused to offer up any sort of comments on the issue, but given the upscale nature of the establishment, it’s widely speculated that Hickman may have been profiled. The 24-year-old prospect is set to become a restricted free agent later this offseason, and will likely be resigning with the Browns for a “projected contract between $7 million to $8 million.”\n\nABC7 has suggested that Hickman was, in fact, identified by the four individuals, and that things only escalated after Hickman refused to acknowledge them, but that has yet to be confirmed by either official sources or any of the members in Hickman’s camp.\n\nThe post Cleveland Browns News: Ronnie Hickman Attacked by Goons in Sixty Les Hotel’s Lobby, No Arrests Yet appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Joey Logano has etched his name into the same book as NASCAR greats, with three Cup titles with Team Penske. However, his climb did not come on a smooth road.",
    "fullText": "Joey Logano has etched his name into the same book as NASCAR greats, with three Cup titles with Team Penske. However, his climb did not come on a smooth road. Some drivers hit bumps early and learn the ropes while the stakes stay low. Others, like Logano, taste success early and then get a wake-up call when they line up with the sport’s big boys.\n\nLoganolit up the record books in the lower ranks, earning the nickname “Sliced Bread” before he hit his teens. Barely a year after he started racing at six, he grabbed his first title at seven in 1997. From there, the trophies kept rolling in. He won the National Bandolero Bandits crown in 1999, the Young Lions National Championship in 2002, and the Pro National Championship in Legends, making him the youngest champion in that series. The wins kept stacking up in the K&N Pro Series East in 2007, ARCA, Late Models, and even the Xfinity Series in 2008.\n\nBut when he stepped into the Cup Series with Joe Gibbs Racing in 2009, that golden run hit a wall. Reflecting on that period ahead of the Daytona 500, Logano opened up about how it all happened.\n\n“It’s a tricky place for a young kid to grow up in, right, to have all that hype. It can affect you in a lot of different ways and, unfortunately, mainly bad ways,” the Team Penske driver said. on First Things First. “Because I think you start to drink your own Kool-Aid, if you will. You start to believe in all the hype, and you start to just think you’re that great. And you don’t go to work like you’re supposed to. Or you start to get a little arrogant. At some point reality gonna slap you in the face.”\n\n“When I got to the cup level, the NASCAR top level here, I got the slice of humble pie that I deserved. I went up against all the guys that were the phenoms, right, growing up. And I got my butt kicked for three years before I was able to get my head wrapped around things…”\n\n“If I’m being honest, I failed at that. I lost my job. I was at a point that I was like, well, ‘Uh-oh, what am I going to do the rest of my life? I’m 21 years old, and I don’t know if I’m going to make it.”\n\nBack then, his results left Joe Gibbs Racing scrambling to land sponsorship. When Roger Penske called Joe Gibbs and asked about Logano, acting on Brad Keselowski’s nudge, Gibbs asked for a week as they were trying to get sponsors for Logano. Without funding lined up, the options were thin for JGR. They would have either moved him back to Xfinity or released him.\n\nPenske stepped in and threw Logano a lifeline, and that move flipped the young driver’s career. The struggles, though, left their mark. That tough period taught Logano how to lose before he could learn how to win again. Each failure became a lesson, each misstep a brick in rebuilding belief.\n\nAnd he has stayed in that same camp ever since, and that turning point still echoes in how he carries himself. It taught him to punch the clock and keep grinding. To this day, Logano reminds himself not to coast, keeping that hunger alive and pushing to raise his game lap after lap.\n\nThe post Joey Logano Reveals Brutal Reality Check When He Lost His NASCAR Seat After Coming In As A Superstar appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Who will Canada play next in hockey? Explaining 2026 Olympic bracket opponent for quarterfinals originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a dominant run through Group A, Team Canada has officially secured its spot in the quarterfinals of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. By finishing as the No. 1 overall seed, Canada has earned a critical first-round bye, allowing them to bypass the qualification playoffs and head straight into the final eight.\n\nThe preliminary round finale was a sheer display of power as Team Canada dismantled France with a 10-2 win on Sunday. Captain Sidney Crosby made history by becoming Canada's all-time leading scorer in Olympic play featuring NHL players, while Connor McDavid took over the tournament scoring lead with a clinical performance. With a roster featuring Nathan MacKinnon, Macklin Celebrini and Cale Makar, the Canadians outscored their opponents 20-3 across three games, proving why they are the favorites to reclaim the gold.\n\nWhile Canada enjoyed a smooth path through the group stage, the intensity is about to ramp up significantly. With the NHL back on the Olympic stage for the first time since 2014, the margin for error has vanished, and the Canadians know that the single-elimination format on Wednesday leaves no room for a slow start. For a nation that views hockey as its heartbeat, Milan represents the first opportunity in over a decade to see their greatest generational stars compete for gold together.\n\nThe road to the podium is clearly defined. If the seeds hold, a potential collision course with Team USA looms in the gold medal game, a matchup that hockey fans have been salivating over since the NHL's participation was confirmed. For Sidney Crosby, who famously scored the \"Golden Goal\" in 2010, this tournament is about more than a medal—it's about leading a new era of Canadian excellence back to the top of the world.\n\nHere's who Team Canada plays next.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nThe men's preliminary round has concluded in Milan, and the bracket is now set for the knockout stages. Canada, the United States, Slovakia, and Finland have secured the top four seeds and will receive a bye directly to the quarterfinals.\n\nThe remaining eight teams will compete in a qualification playoff on Tuesday to determine who fills the final four spots in the quest for gold.\n\nThe following teams have earned a direct path to the quarterfinals on Wednesday:\n\nFinland (Best Second-Place Team)\n\nThe qualification playoffs occur on Tuesday.\n\nMORE: Day-by-day TV, streaming schedule for 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nCanada will play the winner of Denmark vs. Czechia.\n\nThe Canadians enter the quarterfinal as the No. 1 seed after going 3-0-0 to go on top of Group A. Because of goal differential, boosted by a 10-2 win over France, Canada clinched the top seed over Team USA, who also went undefeated in their group.\n\nCanada already faced Czechia in their opening game of the tournament, winning 5-0, but they must wait for the result of the Tuesday matchup to see if a rematch is on the horizon for Wednesday at 10:40 a.m. ET.\n\nBoth Czechia and Denmark lost twice in the preliminary rounds, and now, the winner of this game will face the Canadian juggernaut.\n\nMORE: Updated medal count at 2026 Olympics\n\nThe 2026 Olympic men's hockey tournament features 12 nations split into three groups of four for the opening round-robin phase.\n\nThe three group winners and the highest-ranked second-place finisher earn an automatic bye into the quarterfinals. The remaining eight teams are seeded 5th through 12th for a single-elimination qualification playoff, where the winners advance to join the top seeds in the final eight.\n\nTo ensure the most competitive matchups later in the tournament, the IIHF re-seeds the four semifinalists based on their original preliminary round rankings, pitting the highest remaining seed against the lowest for a spot in the gold medal game.\n\nMORE: USA men's hockey schedule\n\n(3) Slovakia vs. Germany/France winner\n\n(1) Canada vs. Czechia/Denmark winner\n\n(4) Finland vs. Switzerland/Italy winner\n\n(2) USA vs. Sweden/Latvia winner\n\nBronze Medal: Sweden vs. Switzerland\n\nBronze Medal Game (TBD vs. TBD)",

On Monday, he threw a baseball for the first time, which is a step in the right direction.\n\nAlthough Houck is already throwing, he said the goal is to return in September for a playoff push.\n\n“My whole goal is to be back in September,” Houck said on Monday, via The Athletic. “I set that goal basically the day after the surgery. I wanted to do it smart and the right way. …\n\n“I can have my goal, but if God has a different plan, then I might have to readjust as things ramp up with throwing and see how the body recovers.”\n\nIf Houck can return in September, he can provide the Red Sox with some depth to the rotation and potentially into the playoffs.\n\nHouck is coming off a disappointing 2025 season, as before the injury, he struggled. The right-hander went 0-3 with an 8.04 ERA in nine starts.\n\nHowever, he was solid in 2024 as the right-hander went 9-10 with a 3.12 ERA in 30 starts and was named an All-Star.

The franchise will be looking to build the practice facility in Scottsdale and increase the size from the previous performance center by tenfold. The team will hold a groundbreaking event on February, 19th with the City of Phoenix and Arizona Commerce Authority on-site.\n\nOct 29, 2023; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill looks on against the Baltimore Ravens during the second half at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\n“Last September, the Cardinals announced the updated plans and location for the team’s new performance center in North Phoenix, located west of Scottsdale Road and north of the Loop 101. The targeted opening for the new performance center and team headquarters is 2028.\n\n“The 217-acre property was purchased at auction from the Arizona State Land Department for $136 million by an affiliate of the team. The new performance center and business operations will anchor the mixed-use development site, occupying 30 acres and over 250,000 square feet. The footprint of the team’s current facility is 14 acres and 156,000 square feet.\n\n“It will feature three natural-grass outdoor practice fields and a fieldhouse with a full-size turf field indoors. Additional elements of the new, world-class performance center will include a greatly expanded and modern locker room and state-of-the-art team spaces for athletic training, sports medicine and strength and conditioning in addition to updated dining areas, meeting rooms, a player lounge and more.”\n\nDec 28, 2024; Inglewood, California, USA; Arizona owner Bidwill reacts during the game against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nArizona’s Tempe training facility was constructed in 1990, before opening a year later. The franchise had just moved to the Valley a few years earlier from St. Louis and began building roots. For the past 35 years, despite some renovations, the practice building has largely remained the same, but changes are coming.\n\nThe new facility is big news following the team being ranked last in all the NFL in the NFLPA’s report cards. Owner Michael Bidwill is obviously trying to turn that perception around for his new head coach Michael Bidwill, as the duo heads towards the future.\n\nThe 3-14 season doesn’t truly matter. The Las Vegas Raiders have a complete failure of a year, but it’s clear the ownership is committed to the player’s with the high-tech Allegiant Stadium. If the owner, like Bidwill, is investing in the future, it goes a long way of building hope across the Valley.\n\nCardinals part of 11-team grievance against 2025 NFLPA report cards",

Instead, he focused on what sports can represent at a broader level.\n\nAfter watching the NBA All-Star Game and Team USA compete at the Winter Olympics, Obama posted a message about the impact of sports.\n\nHe tweeted: “Watching the NBA All-Star game and Team USA at the Winter Olympics, it’s clear that sports — just like music and art — still have the power to bring us together, build community, and remind us of our common humanity.”\n\nObama compared sports to music and art, suggesting they share a unique ability to connect people across different backgrounds.\n\nHis message centered on unity and shared experience rather than competition.\n\nAll-Star weekend, which features players from across the league and around the world, provided a fitting backdrop for that reflection.\n\nMichelle Obama also posted on social media after attending the game with Barack.\n\n“My favorite teammates on and off the court,” she wrote.\n\nHer caption accompanied a photo of the couple courtside at the Intuit Dome, adding a lighthearted note to the evening.\n\nThe post quickly drew attention from fans, many of whom enjoyed seeing the former president and first lady taking in the event together.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron jokes as Victor Wembanyama takes center stage at NBA All-Star Game\n\n‘Who is that?’ – Anthony Edwards’ Cristiano Ronaldo moment at NBA All-Star Game goes viral\n\nMetta Sandiford-Artest claims he can’t travel to Australia due to 2004 Malice at the Palace incident",

    "fullText": "The 2026 Hana Bank K League 1 season marks Daejeon Hana Citizen's fourth year back in the top flight. But what's different about this season is that the Purples are aiming to challenge for a first-ever top division title.\n\nDaejeon Hana Citizen recorded their best-ever finish to a K League 1 season last year, finishing as runners-up. The Purples were helped by being attack-minded with a forward line led by Joo Min-kyu, whose 14 goals were the team's highest. Daejeon scored 58 times, the third-highest total, from an xG of 54.7 (6th), by having one of the best shot conversion rates in the division, second only to Jeonbuk. Their tactical approach centred on winning the ball back quickly and supplying wide players with pace who could hurt teams on the counterattack.\n\nDaejeon were also sensible in the transfer market, moving to replace the injured Victor Bobsin - a key player in their system - with as good a like-for-like replacement domestically as there could be in Kim Bong-soo, and added attacking impetus with wide players Joao Victor and Hernandes Rodriques.\n\nDaejeon were consistent and were able to put together unbeaten runs of six or seven games at certain points in the campaign. Hwang Sun-hong's men were, more or less, just as dangerous at home as they were away, earning 10 home wins and eight on the road with four losses at Purple Arena and five away from it. They led the league in the earlier part of the campaign, but their undoing was a poor record against eventual champions Jeonbuk, picking up just one point from the four league meetings all season.\n\n[READ: Daejeon Hana Citizen 2025 Season Review]\n\nDaejeon have taken a quality over quantity approach to the winter transfer window, adding players with title-winning pedigree. Wing duo Gustav Ludwigson and Um Won-sang arrive from Ulsan HD, while powerful Brazilian striker Diogo Oliveira will provide competition for Joo Min-kyu in attack. Cho Seong-gwon, who has worked under Hwang Sun-hong with the U23 national team, signs to provide competition for the right centre back spot. The club have also signed Joao Victor and Ha Chang-rae on permanent deals, having spent the 2025 season on loan.\n\n[READ: Daejeon's winter recruits and where they might fit in]\n\nEven at 35, soon to be 36, Joo Min-kyu is still lethal in front of goal. He is also a very clever player with excellent vision to feed teammates and help start (and sometimes finish) counterattacks from deep. Not only will he most likely be Daejeon's top scorer again, but he has a lot of experience in winning teams and in the AFC Champions League. The phrase \"winning mentality\" gets used a lot, but Joo brings that to Daejeon and as skipper, his influence will be felt even \n\nThe U22 rule is no more in K League 1, not in the same way it was at least. Instead, teams will need to have two U22 players on the bench if they are to have a full nine-man bench. Daejeon don't have too many U22 players left, having sent Kim Han-seo and Lee Jun-gyu out on loan to Yongin FC and Gimhae FC 2008, respectively, and Kim Hyeon-oh to Gyeongnam. It means that Daejeon are gonig to have to pluck some kids out of the academy to make a full bench, or just have two substitutes fewer than they're permitted to.\n\nAre Daejeon really title contenders?\n\nDaejeon have not been shy in saying that the aim is to challenge for the title this season. They finished second last year, but once Jeonbuk leapfrogged them into top spot, the Purples never looked like returning to the K League 1 summit. Recruitment has been good, but the club have also lost influential coach Yoshida Tatsuma so there'll be question marks as to whether the magic is still there from the last 18 months.\n\nJeonbuk and Ulsan have dominated K League for the last 12 years, mostly the former, leading to calls for other teams to step up, for owners to invest, and to try to break the duopoly. Daejeon are showing what can be done if an owner invests heavily in a football club. The club is ambitious but the owners want to see a return on their investment. The 2026 season will be a good test to see if Daejeon can repay them with some silverware.",

    "title": "Nimslo stereo camera",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Nimslo is a stereo camera with a brightfield viewfinder that produces 3D pictures that can be viewed without glasses. This is done using lenticular printing. It uses common 35 mm film in 135 film format cartridges. It was produced in the 1980s by Nimstec of Atlanta, and manufactured by Timex in Dundee, Scotland.[1]\n\nThe Nimslo had fixed focus and automatic exposure. It featured a leathered metal body and glass lenses. Using its four lenses, four images from slightly different viewing angles were taken simultaneously. With the individual images half the size of the usual 35mm image frames, each 3D photograph taken used the space of 2 full 35mm exposures on the film. So a roll labeled as \"36 exposures\" would yield 18 3D pictures with four images each.\n\nThe Nimslo was the first consumer level three-dimensional lenticular camera of the 1980s. There were previous lenticular cameras aimed at amateurs, such as the six-lens Lentic, introduced in 1953, which used 120 roll film,[2] but the Nimslo was probably the first to use 35mm film, and certainly the first that could fit in a pocket.\n\nThe camera used a red LED to put a green dot on the negative. This was how the printer knew where a group of four negatives started. This dot appeared in the otherwise blank area above the image so it didn't appear in the printed frame. This feature appears to be unique to the NimsLo. Allen Kwok Wah Lo is known for his work in 3D display technologies. He is believed to operate his current Companies in Hong Kong, as CEO of U.S. Technology Ltd. and 3DV Co., Ltd. As to his past involvement with 3D, Allen Lo was President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of ITII (Image Technologies International, Inc.) and President and Director of 3DIT (3D Image Technologies Company) in 1997, when an action was tried against him and them in Atlanta Federal District Court. The action alleged Lo and his Companies induced ND3D B.V. (“ND3D”) to enter into an acquisition agreement and then commercially exploited ND3D, leaving it a company without assets. Despite advising the industry and former clients and contacts of ND3D that ND3D has been absorbed by Defendant Image Technology International, Inc. (\"ITII\"), despite enticing ND3D’s principal, Andrew Joel (“Joel”), to leave ND3D as its Director to come work for ITII, and despite utilizing Joel’s know-how and contacts and ND3D’s assets, Defendants refused to pay one cent to ND3D. In a June 6, 1995 letter from Lo to Joel, after ITII's evaluation of ND3D's assets, Lo proposed a fixed number of shares that ITII and 3DIT would provide to ND3D in exchange for all of the assets and goodwill of ND3D. The parties formalized their effort to have ITII acquire ND3D by executing on June 21, 1995, an Acquisition and Cooperation Agreement. The parties attempted to settle their disputes in February 1997, prior to the initiation of litigation. After two days of fruitless negotiations, ITII served Joel and Marc Wolters (the Netherland District Court trustee in bankruptcy for EGN) with complaints in a lawsuit that had been previously filed in Gwinnett Superior Court (unbeknownst to Joel, Wolters, and their counsel). That case has been dismissed on summary judgment, leaving only Joel’s claims against ITII, 3DIT and Lo in that case. Judgment was granted in favor of ND3D and Joel for $1,000,000.00 plus costs and attorneys fees in the United States District Court case, ND3D B.V. v. IMAGE TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL, INC., ET AL. in the Northern District of Georgia, before Judge Owen Forrester (not reported).Other lenticular cameras don't have it and other lenticular printers don't use it.\n\nThe Nimslo was originally built in a Timex factory in Dundee, Scotland. A massive strike in Dundee, as the U.S. rollout was gaining strong momentum, caused Nimslo to miss the delivery dates on all cameras sold. This led to the cancellation of the Timex contract.[3][4] Later cameras were built by Sunpak in Japan.\n\nNimslo and its lenticular printer were invented by Jerry Curtis Nims from Georgia, USA, and Allen Kwok Wah Lo. Jerry Nims received one of the ten outstanding engineering achievements in the United States for the Nimslo Three-Dimensional Photographic System at the 17th Annual Competition of the National Society of Professional Engineers in 1983.\n\nLenticular prints would be ordered from special print shops using dedicated printers.\nThe pictures produced by the Nimslo camera create a three-dimensional image that can be seen with the naked eye. This 3D image is made possible by the lenticular printing process that was customized by the Nimslo inventors, though professional lenticular prints had been around for a while.\n\nThe technology was protected by US patents.\n\nThe shares of the Nimstec were bought by Eagleville Company in October 1980, controlled by the Ptarmigan Trust that at the same time gained control over Timex Corporation. The operation was controlled by billionaire Fredrik Olsen, head of the Fred. Olsen & Co. shipping company. Olsen was a technological and industrial visionary and believed strongly in the Nimslo product. He wanted the Timex factory in Dundee in Scotland to produce the cameras, as they had already produced cameras for Polaroid. He established a guarantee of US$25 million for the acquisition of the Nimslo shares.[5][6] Nimslo was taken publicly on the Unlisted Securities Market (USM) London by Baring Brothers and Carr, Sebag.[7][8] Later, as an American depository receipt (ADR), Nimslo was the number one selling stock on the NASDAQ until the strike in Dundee stopped deliveries. Later still, Nimslo was public on the Bermuda Exchange, including substantial oil interests which had been added by Fred Olsen. Soon thereafter, Nimslo was privatized.\n\nThe original Nimslo photographic printer (the Mark 1S) was controlled by a KIM-1 processor. The operator had to view the actual images to align the images. The time to create a picture was measured in minutes. The second photographic printer was the Mark 1A. This printer was controlled by a Data General MicroNova processor, using the MP/OS operating system. This machine used a video system and was able to create a picture in about 15 seconds.\n\nNimslo prints are created by printing the four images through the lenticular print material, each at a different angle, to a photosensitive emulsion on the back of the lenticular material. The print material is then processed in a normal photofinishing machine, as the back of the print material is permeable to the photofinishing chemicals.\n\nAlthough the idea of a consumer level camera that could make lenticular 3D prints similar to those that had appeared for many years on book covers and other novelty items certainly had appeal, it did not receive a large market share of camera purchases, partially due to the high costs of processing and longer wait times than traditional cameras. In the summer of 1982, Nimslo was the fastest selling 35mm camera in the U.S., including being on the cover of the Sears catalog.\n\nDuring the height of its meteoric rise, Nimslo had sought to acquire Berkey Industries (NYSE-BKY), of which it had obtained sixteen percent.[9] Instead, after the strike, its plans to acquire Berkey were abandoned.[3] Berkey issued its LOI to acquire the photo finishing labs of Nimslo International Ltd., for common stock, which would have raised the Nimslo holdings of Berkey from 16 to 45 percent.[10] However, this transaction was never consummated.\n\nAfter the Dundee strike, the sales team, led by former top Polaroid executive, Corvin Cianci, could not regain the top position with the replacement camera manufactured in Japan by Sunpak Company.[1]\n\nNimslo Corp was partly sold to Nishika, a Nevada company that acquired the Nimslo patents, and continued the Nimslo as \"Nishika 3-D N8000\". In April 1989,[11] Nishika introduced the four lens Nishika N8000 and later the four lens N9000. The N8000 featured a plastic body with plastic lenses, a fixed 1/60 shutter speed and a three-position manual aperture lever that selected f8, f11 or f19.[12][13] The N9000 was a more compact, sleeker version but was essentially the same camera, except with 2 aperture settings, f8 and f16, instead of 3. Part of the marketing effort included a promotional/instructional video starring Vincent Price.[14] Nishika also offered a companion flash, similar to the Nimslo Optilite but much bulkier and with just one contact plus ground. They also offered a number of other accessories including a \"professional\" strap, Nishika Tripod, a Nishika deluxe camera case, a lens cleaning kit and even a line of Nishika brand color print film, marked with both regular and 3D exposures, though the advertising stressed that it could use any ASA 100 color print film.[citation needed]\n\nNishika also, of course, offered a lenticular processing service.\n\nThe flash contact sits atop a small platform which resembles the Pentaprism found on an SLR. The camera is much larger than it needs to be, a lead weight was included to make it heavier, there is a plastic panel on top designed to look like an LCD readout and the two AA batteries serve no function except to power the \"light meter\" which merely indicates whether or not flash should be used. The \"use flash\" indicator is not coupled to the aperture lever and is thus valid only when f8 (cloudy/indoors) is selected and when ASA 100 film is used.[13] Also, the hot shoe has three contacts (in addition to ground), but two simply sit on top of the plastic with no internal connection. The companion flash has only a single contact in addition to ground.[13]\n\nNishika was the number one selling direct sales product until bad color emulsions from 3M caused the 3D snapshots to fade. As a result, Nishika sued 3M.[15]\n\nAttempting to recover, Nishika used misleading[13] and even illegal tactics to market the camera, including an infamous fraudulent prize promotion scheme, which is usually blamed for the company's demise.[16]\n\nStarks claimed that Nishika also made a three-lens camera, but there is no evidence that such a camera ever existed outside his article.[6] It is interesting that some of the Nishika \"dealers\" claimed that the Nimslo had only 3 lenses.[13]\n\nThe confusion on the part of Michael Starks may stem from the introduction about a year later of the 3 lens Trilogy, which sported a built in electronic flash and motorized film advance, and was originally marketed through a system very similar to the multilevel scheme used by Nishika.[17] The same camera was later renamed to Image Tech 3D 1000 and marketed through more traditional channels.[18]\n\nSeveral other three-lens cameras were released, such as the 3D wizard, 3D magic, 'DFX, and Kalimar, some of which sported more modern features such as built-in electronic flash and motorized film advance, but lacked the auto-exposure features of the Nimslo. The 3D trio featured 3 element coated glass lenses, built in flash, motorized film advance, automatic exposure control, compatibility with DX coded ASA 100, 200 and 400 film, and a built in protective lens cover, making it the closest three-lens equivalent to the Nimslo.[19] These 3 lens cameras gave more pictures per roll of film, 16 [20] for 24 exposure roll rather than the 12[21] yielded by Nimslo/Nishika and had less ghosting, but also less depth.[18] There were other four-lens Nimslo clones as well, such as the 3DNext and the Rittai.[22] Like the Nishika, several of these were marketed through multilevel schemes, often in Asian countries, occasionally being the basis of a scam.[6]\n\nIn 2005 the Canadian firm Snap 3D began selling several two-lens and five-lens lenticular cameras made by US technology Ltd in Hong Kong. The five-lens cameras were particularly odd producing five images that were 29.94 mm high and from 24.75 to 26.33 mm wide, all five images having a different width. These were deluxe cameras, featuring glass lenses, adjustable focus with rangefinder, adjustable shutter speeds 1/125, 1/60, 1/30 sec. and \"B\", continuously adjustable aperture from f/5.6 to f22 and a spirit level. They also had automatic film loading and motorized film advance.[23] Indeed, these cameras were so far removed from the Nimslo, that it might be stretching things to call them Nimslo clones. Snap 3D no longer sells these cameras and as of May 2012, no longer does lenticular printing due to failure of their machine.[24]\n\nDespite the fact that Nimslo cameras are no longer produced, one can still obtain a Nimslo through various internet auction sites.[25] In fact, the Nimslo maintains a loyal following among photography buffs. In most recent years, renewed interest in the 1981 Nimslo camera has created a growing online after-market for both the analog camera itself and Nimslo camera prints.[26] This includes a large number of GIF images created using the Nimslo camera, which have proliferated for viewing online.[27]\n\nAs of May 2012, there are no known labs that can make lenticular prints from film.\n\nIn a somewhat \"retro\" development, many stereo photography buffs used the Nimslo to take stereo slides which were mounted in \"4P\" (half frame) slide mounts. This was done by using either slip in cardboard mounts, some specially labeled with the Nimslo name or aluminum masks such as the Realist \"closeup\" mask. These masks were sometimes put in metal frames and placed between glass, much like Realist format slides. The resulting stereo slides could then be viewed using conventional Realist format viewers or even projected with stereo projectors.\n\nThe dot that was green on negatives was red on slide film and so stereo hobbyists could tell which chip was the left frame after\ncutting the film by looking for the red dot. Because many slide mounts were designed for an image frame taller than the Nimslo frame this red dot was sometimes visible in the picture.\n\nThe glass lenses and automatic exposure control of the Nimslo made it well suited for this purpose, unlike similar cameras such as the Nishika that typically sported plastic lenses and limited adjustability, relying on the latitude of the print film to give good results under varied lighting conditions.\n\nOthers used the Nimslo to produce half frame prints that could be used to make stereo cards which could be viewed in conventional stereoscopes.\n\nSince only the two outer images of the four images formed by each snap were mounted, using an unmodified Nimslo to produce stereo pairs results in wasted film. Making prints is even more costly since half of them will be thrown away. The problem of paying for twice as many prints could be solved by covering the two center lenses, but that doesn't solve the problem of film wastage. This spurred some enterprising individuals to come up with modifications.\n\nTechnical Enterprises came out with the Teco-Nimslo which exposed two images at a time and modified the film advance so that there was no film wastage. This produced 24 half-frame pairs on a 24-exposure roll. The result was an ideal camera for those satisfied with half-frame format slides.\n\nDavid Burder came up with more radical modifications. One, the original Burdlo, featured a modified lens board with two lenses but essentially the same film advance to take full-frame stereo pictures. The stereo base was greatly reduced to only 36mm, adequate for closeup work.[28] Other cameras also going by the name Burdlo included multiple Nimslos joined together to make 12 lens and 24 lens lenticular cameras. None of these were as popular as the Teco-Nimslo but pictures of them are easy enough to find on the web[29] and have occasionally been the subject of blog entries.[30]\n\nOthers have modified the Nimslo to make a wide format camera, or have found other non 3D uses, with or without modification.[31]",

    "description": "Detectives desperate to locate a 12-year-old, seen abused online, found a surprising lead.",
    "fullText": "Warning: This article contains details about sexual abuse\n\nSpecialist online investigator Greg Squire had hit a dead end in his efforts to rescue an abused girl his team had named Lucy.\n\nDisturbing images of her were being shared on the dark web - an encrypted corner of the internet only accessible using special software designed to make owners digitally untraceable.\n\nBut even with that level of subterfuge, the abuser was conscious of \"covering their tracks\", cropping or altering any identifying features, says Squire. It was impossible to work out who, or where, Lucy was.\n\nWhat he was soon to discover was that the clue to the 12-year-old's location was hidden in plain sight.\n\nSquire works for US Department of Homeland Security Investigations in an elite unit which attempts to identify children appearing in sexual abuse material.\n\nA BBC World Service team has spent five years filming with Squire, and other investigative units in Portugal, Brazil, and Russia - showing them solving cases such as that of a kidnapped and presumed-dead seven-year-old in Russia, and the arrest of a Brazilian man responsible for five of the biggest child-abuse forums on the dark web.\n\nThe unprecedented access shows how these cases are often cracked, not through state-of-the-art technology, but by spotting tiny revealing details in images or chat forums.\n\nSquire cites Lucy's case, which he tackled early in his career, as the inspiration for his long-term dedication.\n\nHe found it especially disturbing that Lucy was about the same age as his own daughter, and new photos of her being assaulted, seemingly in her bedroom, were constantly appearing.\n\nSquire and his team could see, from the type of light sockets and electrical outlets visible in the images, that Lucy was in North America. But that was about it.\n\nThey contacted Facebook, which at the time dominated the social media landscape, asking for help scouring uploaded family photos - to see if Lucy was in any of them. But Facebook, despite having facial recognition technology, said it \"did not have the tools\" to help.\n\nSo Squire and his colleagues analysed everything they could see in Lucy's room: the bedspread, her outfits, her stuffed toys. Looking for any element which might help.\n\nAnd then they had a minor breakthrough. The team discovered that a sofa seen in some of the images was only sold regionally, not nationally, and therefore had a more limited customer base.\n\nBut that still amounted to about 40,000 people.\n\n\"At that point in the investigation, we're [still] looking at 29 states here in the US. I mean, you're talking about tens of thousands of addresses, and that's a very, very daunting task,\" says Squire.\n\nThe team looked for more clues. And that is when they realised something as mundane as the exposed brick wall in Lucy's bedroom could give them a lead.\n\n\"So, I started just Googling bricks and it wasn't too many searches [before] I found the Brick Industry Association,\" says Squire.\n\n\"And the woman on the phone was awesome. She was like, 'how can the brick industry help?'\"\n\nShe offered to share the photo with brick experts all over the country. The response was almost immediate, he says.\n\nOne of the people who got in touch was John Harp, who had been working in brick sales since 1981.\n\n\"I noticed that the brick was a very pink-cast brick, and it had a little bit of a charcoal overlay on it. It was a modular eight-inch brick and it was square-edged,\" he says. \"When I saw that, I knew exactly what the brick was,\" he adds.\n\nIt was, he told Squire, a \"Flaming Alamo\".\n\n\"[Our company] made that brick from the late 60s through about the middle part of the 80s, and I had sold millions of bricks from that plant.\"\n\nInitially Squire was ecstatic, expecting they could access a digitised customer list. But Harp broke the news that the sales records were just a \"pile of notes\" that went back decades.\n\nHe did however reveal a key detail about bricks, Squire says.\n\n\"He goes: 'Bricks are heavy.' And he said: 'So heavy bricks don't go very far.'\"\n\nThis changed everything. The team returned to the sofa customer list and narrowed that down to just those clients who lived within a 100-mile radius of Harp's brick factory in the US' south-west.\n\nFrom that list of 40 or 50 people, it was easy to find and trawl their social media. And that is when they found a photo of Lucy on Facebook with an adult who looked as though she was close to the girl - possibly a relative.\n\nThey worked out the woman's address, and then used that to find out every other address connected with that person, and all the people they had ever lived with.\n\nThat narrowed Lucy's possible address down further - but they didn't want to go door to door, making enquiries. Get the address wrong, and they could risk the suspect being tipped off that he was on the authorities' radar.\n\nSo Squire and his colleagues began sending photos of these houses to John Harp, the brick expert.\n\nFlaming Alamos were not visible on the outside of any of the homes, because the properties were clad in other materials. But the team asked Harp to assess - by looking at their style and exterior - if these properties were likely to have been built during a period when Flaming Alamos had been on sale.\n\n\"We would basically take a screenshot of that house or residence and shoot it over to John and say 'would this house have these bricks inside?'\" says Squire.\n\nFinally they had a breakthrough. They found an address that Harp believed was likely to feature a Flaming Alamo brick wall, and was on the sofa customer-base list.\n\n\"So we narrowed it down to [this] one address… and started the process of confirming who was living there through state records, driver's licence… information on schools,\" says Squire.\n\nThe team realised that in the household with Lucy was her mother's boyfriend - a convicted sex offender.\n\nWithin hours, local Homeland Security agents had arrested the offender, who had been raping Lucy for six years. He was subsequently sentenced to more than 70 years in jail.\n\nBrick expert Harp was delighted to hear Lucy was safe, especially given his own experiences as a long-term foster parent.\n\n\"We've had over 150 different children in our home. We've adopted three. So, doing that over those years, we have a lot of children in our home that were [previously] abused,\" he said.\n\n\"What [Squire's team] do day in and day out, and what they see, is a magnification of hundreds of times of what I've seen or had to deal with.\"\n\nA few years ago, that pressure on Squire started to take a real toll on his mental health, and he admits that, when he wasn't working, \"alcohol was a bigger part of my life than it should have been\".\n\n\"At that point my kids were a bit older… and, you know, that almost enables you to push harder. Like… 'I bet if I get up at three this morning, I can surprise [a perpetrator] online.'\n\n\"But meanwhile, personally… 'Who's Greg? I don't even know what he likes to do.' All of your friends… during the day, you know, they're criminals… All they do is talk about the most horrific things all day long.\"\n\nNot long afterwards, his marriage broke down, and he says he began to have suicidal thoughts.\n\nIt was his colleague Pete Manning who encouraged him to seek help after noticing his friend seemed to be struggling.\n\n\"It's hard when the thing that brings you so much energy and drive is also the thing that's slowly destroying you,\" Manning says.\n\nSquire says exposing his vulnerabilities to the light was the first step to getting better and continuing to do a job he is proud of.\n\n\"I feel honoured to be part of the team that can make a difference instead of watching it on TV or hearing about it… I'd rather be right in there in the fight trying to stop it.\"\n\nLast summer Greg met Lucy, now in her 20s, for the first time.\n\nShe told him her ability to now discuss what she went through was testament to the support she has around her.\n\n\"I have more stability. I'm able to have the energy to talk to people [about the abuse], which I could not have done… even, like, a couple years ago.\"\n\nShe said at the point Homeland Security ended her abuse she had been \"praying actively for it to end\".\n\n\"Not to sound cliché, but it was a prayer answered.\"\n\nSquire told her he wished he had been able to communicate that help was on its way.\n\n\"You wish there was some telepathy and you could reach out and be like, 'listen, we're coming'.\"\n\nThe BBC asked Facebook why it couldn't use its facial recognition technology to assist the hunt for Lucy. It responded: \"To protect user privacy, it's important that we follow the appropriate legal process, but we work to support law enforcement as much as we can.\"\n\nIf you've been a victim of child sexual abuse, a victim of crime or have feelings of despair, and are in the UK, you'll find details of help and support at bbc.co.uk/actionline.",

    "fullText": "As described previously,\nthe Linux kernel security team does not identify or mark or announce any sort\nof security fixes that are made to the Linux kernel tree. So how, if the Linux\nkernel were to become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) and responsible for\nissuing CVEs, would the identification of security fixes happen in a way that\ncan be done by a volunteer staff? This post goes into the process of how\nkernel fixes are currently automatically assigned to CVEs, and also the other\n“out of band” ways a CVE can be issued for the Linux kernel project.\n\nThis is a post in the series about the Linux kernel CVE release process:\n\nA few months after Linux became a CNA, Lee Jones, one of the members of the\nkernel.org CNA team wrote an\narticle on lwn.net\nas to how CVEs were being assigned, along with some other background\ninformation. That process has pretty much remained the same since then, but\ngiven the number of questions we have had over the past few years, it’s best to\ngo into a bit more detail as to how all of this works, and why some bug fixes\nare marked as a CVE and others are not.\n\nAs is often mentioned, the rate of development of the Linux kernel is very\nhigh, averaging around 9 changes a hour for the past decade or so. Luckily,\nthe kernel developers and maintainers have been manually marking specific\ncommits as “bug fixes” for decades, allowing them to be backported to the\nvarious stable kernel branches. This is to allow users to be able to use the\nlast kernel release, or a “long term” kernel as a base on which to rely on\nuntil they upgrade to the newer version. This process was described earlier\nhere,\n\nBecause there is a “feed of known bugfixes” out of the 9 changes an hour,\naveraging about 30 changes per day, the kernel CNA team determined that they\ncan focus their review efforts on that feed, and ignore the other changes, as\nobviously those changes do not fix a problem. And if the missed changes do fix\na problem, odds are someone will eventually ask for those changes to be\nbackported to a stable kernel, so they can be certain that this is a good set\nof changes to be reviewing for potential vulnerability fixes.\n\nWhile many security people love to argue what is, or is not, a vulnerability,\nwhile dealing with CVEs, a CNA must follow the definition that cve.org\ngives us\nwhich is:\n\n“An instance of one or more weaknesses in a\nProduct that can be exploited, causing a\nnegative impact to confidentiality, integrity,\nor availability; a set of conditions or\nbehaviors that allows the violation of an\nexplicit or implicit security policy.”\n\nSo with that definition in mind, the kernel CNA team members look at every\nbugfix that is added to the stable kernel releases and reviews it to determine\nif it meets this criteria.\n\nAt the level that the Linux kernel runs, almost any type of bug that can affect\na running system can be classified as a vulnerability. Specifically this means\nthat the following bugfixes are classified as fixing a vulnerability:\n\nMany bugfixes in the kernel resolve a problem where a\nWARN() or WARN_ON()\ntype of assertion is hit in the kernel. Normally Linux just prints out to the\nkernel log a message about what went wrong, and a stack dump and memory\ninformation, and continues on its merry way, as it is generally considered bad\nform to crash just because a issue was hit that the kernel can properly detect\nand recover from. However, there is a kernel option called\npanic_on_warn\nthat if enabled, Linux will instantly panic and stop if a warning message is\never hit. This is a defensive setting that many users like to enable to\nprotect any possible bug-like condition from being allowed to continue, as they\nwould rather just reboot the machine entirely at that point in time. This\noption is set for a few billion embedded systems running Linux, as well as many\nmany cloud/server systems as they can handle fall-over easily.\n\nBecause of this setting, any kernel fix that resolves a user-reachable\nWARN_ON triggering, must be assigned a CVE entry. If this option were\nnot present, the total number of CVEs assigned by Linux would greatly drop.\n\nWhen the kernel CNA team announced that they were going to start assigning CVEs\nto kernel fixes, the initial worry was that all kernel changes could be thought\nof as fixing a vulnerability. Luckily it turns out that most of the changes\nthat go into the stable kernel releases that fix bugs do not meet the\ndefinition of a “vulnerability fix”, so they do not get assigned a CVE.\nChanges that are common in stable updates that do not get a CVE are:\n\nThere are some bugfixes that many people would think would be classified as a\nvulnerability, but do not meet the cve.org definition, so we are not allowed to\nassign a CVE for them. Those include:\n\nPersonally, I think that filesystem corruption or data loss bug fixes should be\nconsidered a CVE fix, but until cve.org changes their policy, we can not assign\nCVEs for those types of fixes. That is why it is essential for users to always\ntake all stable kernel updates, as odds are, users do like their filesystems to\nstay uncorrupted with no data loss.\n\nFor some filesystem bugs a CVE will not be assigned when a maliciously\ncrafted or accidentally corrupted filesystem image is mounted by the kernel,\nand the kernel crashes or has other problems with it, unless the\nfilesytem-specific userspace fsck program previously ran on the image\nbefore mounting, and it did not find any problems with it. In simpler terms,\nalways run fsck on any untrusted filesystem image before mounting it.\n\nFor many CPU bug fixes, the hardware vendor is responsible for assigning a CVE,\nwhich is why the huge category of the ongoing Spectre cpu bugs do not get CVEs\nassigned by the kernel CNA, but rather the hardware company should be the ones\ndoing that assignment. Many times they do not, but there is nothing that us as\na CNA can really do about that..\n\nThere are 3 core members of the Linux kernel CNA team. The three of us take a\nlist of every commit that is applied to each stable kernel release, and review\nthem to determine if they feel the commit fixes a problem that would resolve a\nvulnerability based on the above definition and descriptions. We all do this\nwork in different ways. I review each patch in mutt\n(after dumping them to a mbox file) and saving off the ones that I think meet\nthe definition. Another member uses\na custom tool\nthat queries some LLM oracles and reviews the output of them for validity,\nwhile another uses a mix of regular expressions combined with manual review\nusing\na custom tool.\n\nWe all check into the\nvulns.git tree our lists of commits\nwe feel should be assigned a CVE id for. Then\nanother tool\nruns on those lists, and if at least 2 members vote for a commit, it is marked\nto be assigned a CVE id.\n\nWe also accept reviews from other community members. At least two different\ndevelopers regularly provide reviews which they email to us in patch form to\nbe applied to the\nvulns.git repository.\nExamples of that can be seen\nhere\nand\nhere.\n\nThese external reviews are taken into consideration after the main voting round\nhappens. If an external person voted for a commit to be marked as a\nvulnerability fix, and a single core member also did, then the commit is\nreviewed again manually to determine what the core member missed, and often\ntimes that commit will then be assigned a CVE id.\n\nAll of this work happens in public, in the\nvulns.git repository.\nCVE ids are usually assigned one to two weeks after the commits have been in a\nreleased kernel version, to allow users time to update their systems. Which is\none key reason why users should always update to newer kernels (more on how to\nkeep a system up to date with the increased numbers of CVE ids being allocated\nin a later article in this series.)\n\nOf course sometimes the CNA team miss commits that should be assigned a CVE, or\na developer or company wishes to have a CVE id assigned before they get through\nthe review process. If that is the case, a simple email to the kernel CNA team\nat the public email address is all that is needed, and then the id will be\nautomatically assigned if the team agrees that the commit meets the\nrequirements of a vulnerability fix.\n\nThis method is used by many developers who know they fixed a vulnerability and\nwish to get a CVE assigned for a presentation or paper due to print deadlines,\nand by many companies who do reviews based on reports sent to them by users.\nRequests are usually handled within a few days, depending on the travel\nschedule of the CNA team members.\n\nAlong with sometimes missing commits that should be assigned a CVE, the CNA\nteam also many times gets reviews incorrect. If anyone thinks that a CVE is\nassigned to a commit incorrectly, because that commit really does not fix a\nvulnerability, please email the CNA team and they will review it and often\ntimes reject the CVE based on that review. This has happened many times when a\nkernel subsystem maintainer patiently explains to the CNA team why a specific\ncommit really is not a vulnerability due to their knowledge of exactly how that\nportion of the kernel works.\n\nWe welcome such emails from all kernel developers and maintainers, for without\nthis type of checks, many commits often are missed, and incorrectly assigned.\nOver the past few years the CNA members have gotten better at reviews and the\nrate of rejection has gotten lower as both the community and the CNA members\nadjust their expectations.\n\nAs the information for what is contained in a CVE record comes directly from\nthe git commit that fixes the vulnerability, sometimes that information can be\nincorrect, or needs to be clarified better. Examples of this is where the\nrange of a vulnerability can not be correctly determined from the commit itself\n(i.e. when the vulnerability showed up, or was backported to), or where\nreferences to external reports for the vulnerability should be added. The\nkernel CNA team has ways to handle all of this by adding the needed range\nbounds, or changing the text, or adding references when requested. Easiest way\nto do this is to just send a patch for the vulns.git repository, adding the\nneeded information. I’ll go into how this all works in more detail into the\nnext article in this series, but if people are interested now, take a look at the\n“schema” file\nthat we use, and some commits in the\nvulns.git repository\n\nfrom\ndifferent\norganizations.\n\nCurrently, the kernel CNA is issuing about 60 CVEs a week, making it the second\nmost prolific CNA currently in the cve.org ecosystem. Trying to keep on top of\nthis type of feed has been “difficult” for traditional security teams that are\nwishing to attempt to manually review and triage every CVE report. As part of\nthe requirement for us to become a CNA, we are required to produce CVE records\nthat can be automatically parsed and handled by tools, without the need for\nhuman interaction.\n\nAs part of that, each CVE we create specifically documents the files affected\nin the kernel source tree for this specific issue, and the exact git ranges, or\nversion ranges if you want that, that the vulnerability originally showed up,\nand where it was fixed. With that information, every Linux user should be able\nto instantly determine if a CVE is applicable for them to review or not by\nfiltering on that data.\n\nBased on some reviews, on average, only 10 CVEs are even applicable to a Linux\nsystem for a normal week, reducing the amount of manual review down to\na very small amount (reading 10 reports a week should be “trivial” for most\nsystem integrators.) This quantity is much lower overall than the other\n“major” operating system vendors produce in a week, if counting CVE numbers as\na reference between projects actually means anything to you.\n\nRemember that software version numbers and git ids are part of a graph, and are\nnot something that you can do a simple “less or greater than” type of\ncomparison. We have seen many companies get this wrong many times. ALWAYS\nproperly walk the git repository tree to determine range checks.\n\nAnd don’t get us started about the uselessness of CPE values, while we do\npopulate those values in the CVE record, they are useless for any real range\nchecking, so please never use them.\n\nAnd yes, PURL will help solve a bit\nof this (it’s better than CPE, a low bar), but PURL does not work for\nself-hosted projects at the moment, like Linux, or GNOME, or KDE, or glibc, or\ngcc, or perl, or python, or curl, well, you get the idea. The PURL developers\nknow this, and we are working with them to solve this issue in the standard to\nhopefully resolve it in the future.\n\nDespite a low number of kernel fixes being applicable to your system every\nweek, many of them do fix real issues that the developers and community know\nabout, so you should upgrade your systems. Ignoring this reported feed will\ndirectly affect the security of your system, so do so at your own risk.\n\nAs stated previously,\nkernel developers do not know how Linux is used, as open source can not\ndictate use. Because of that, we have no way of judging the severity of any\nCVE fix for a user, only the integrator of Linux into their system can properly\ndetermine that. So any group that attempts to give a “severity score” to a\nLinux CVE is lying to you, UNLESS they know exactly your use case.\n\nALWAYS ignore any attempt that groups such as NIST/NVD that purport to\nassign things like CVSS scores to a vulnerability. Those numbers are false and\ngive companies a “fake sense of security”. We have\nasked NIST to stop\nassigning these scores, as it goes against the recently published CISA\nguidelines and we know it is keeping users from updating when they should be,\nas well as causing\nusers to update when they don’t need to be (why would your remote server with\nno physical access to it need to be updated due to a USB gadget driver\nvulnerability?)\n\nThere have been some “working groups” of organizations that use Linux in the\nsame way (i.e. cloud hosting companies) that have attempted to score CVE\nentries in the past. That is the only real way that any attempt to give a\nscore should ever be used, and we welcome groups doing this. However, it seems\nthat all of these groups have stopped doing this work, and instead, have found\nit simpler to just update to the latest stable kernel releases on a more\nregular cadence.\n\ncve.org is looking into having third-party “enrichments” of existing CVE ids,\nbased on the use case of that third party, be added directly to the cve.org\njson record as additional fields. If you are interested in doing this type of\nthing, please contact cve.org, but note that we do not think this is going to\nbe scalable at all, but are more than willing to be proven wrong.\n\nAs mentioned above, CVE ids are usually assigned on a one to two week delay\nfrom when the fix has landed in a released stable kernel version. This allows\nusers who are regularly taking the Linux stable releases to ensure that their\nsystems are secure before CVEs are announced to the world.\n\nKernel CVEs only reference a specific fix in the kernel tree, and do not\nreference any previous changes that might be needed in the tree before that\nspecific change. They are also not tested in an independent way, but only as a\nwhole with all other changes in a specific release by the kernel developer\ncommunity. Because of this, any attempt to only “cherry pick” specific CVE\nfixes can be difficult and is not recommended to be done at all.\n\nThe Linux kernel developer community provides, for free, a constant feed of\ntested bugfixes in stable kernel releases for all to use. Attempting to pick\nand choose individual commits from that feed will cause systems to miss needed\nfixes, as well as create a system that no one has ever seen or tested and can\nnot be supported by anyone else.\n\nThe bonus of just applying all stable releases is that you also get the data\ncorruption and performance improvements for your system as well as the security\nupdates. A result that many ecosystems have already realized is much simpler\noverall to do.\n\nAfter a kernel commit has been declared to be fixing a vulnerability, and\nassigned a CVE, publishing that data to the world in an automated way while\nbeing able to keep the records up to date easily over time at a high volume of\nassigned CVEs was a goal of the kernel CNA team. Over the past 2 years, they\nhave written a number of custom tools and a database to accomplish this,\nevolving from a single bash script to many thousands of lines of multiple\nprograms written in Rust and C. More about how all of those tools work, and\nthe difficulties in doing this all on a fast moving codebase like Linux, will\nbe explained in the next article in this series.",

    "fullText": "Tesla has shifted its Full Self-Driving feature to a subscription model.\n\nOver the weekend, the company removed the option to purchase the feature in the US via a one-time flat fee of $8,000.\n\nFor years, Tesla owners have been able to purchase the service with a one-time payment that would allow them to use it for the full lifespan of their vehicle. Now, the driver-assist feature is available only via a $99-per-month subscription.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk first announced in January that the change would take effect the following month. In the past, Musk has said that Teslas would serve as \"appreciating assets,\" suggesting owners could benefit as the software became increasingly more autonomous.\n\nThe decision to remove lifetime FSD purchases comes shortly after the carmaker stopped offering Autopilot as a free feature for new Tesla purchases. Previously, Autopilot acted as a free driver-assist feature on the expressway, while FSD was an additional paid feature for navigating city streets.\n\nTesla first introduced FSD in 2016, and the pricing has swung dramatically over time. In its early days, FSD cost around $5,000, later climbing to a peak of $15,000. In 2024, Tesla reduced the upfront price to $8,000. The carmaker first introduced a subscription option in 2021 for $199 per month, but the price was later lowered to $99 per month.\n\nMusk said in a post on X last month that the carmaker will raise FSD subscription prices as its \"capabilities improve.\"\n\nTesla's move to a more subscription-focused model reflects a broader industry trend. Under an executive performance plan approved last year, Musk's compensation depends in part on reaching 10 million active FSD subscriptions.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Qualitas Ltd (ASX:QAL) presented its first-half 2026 results on February 17, showcasing robust growth across key metrics despite a challenging global fundraising environment. The Australian alternative real estate investment manager has capitalized on shifting global private credit dynamics that favor the Asia-Pacific region over traditional U.S. markets.\n\nThe company’s stock responded positively to the results, with shares rising 4.21% to close at AUD 3.22 following the announcement, continuing its recovery from a 52-week low of AUD 2.14 toward its high of AUD 4.10.\n\nQualitas reported impressive growth across all major financial metrics, driven by strong deployment and expanding investor relationships. The company’s normalized net profit before tax (NPBT) reached AUD 30 million, representing a 30% increase compared to the first half of 2025.\n\nAs shown in the following summary of key performance metrics:\n\nFee Earning Funds Under Management (FEF) grew 38% year-over-year to AUD 10.9 billion, while deployment surged 57% to AUD 3.7 billion. Transaction fees increased by 69% to AUD 13 million, contributing to a funds management gross operating margin of 46%, up 4% from the previous year.\n\nThe company’s recurring revenue stream showed consistent growth, with recurring funds management revenue up 38% to AUD 43 million and base management fees increasing 28% to AUD 30 million compared to 1H25.\n\nQualitas’ financial results demonstrate the company’s ability to convert strong deployment into sustainable earnings growth. The group’s normalized EBITDA reached AUD 32.9 million with a margin of 51%, while statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) grew 27% to AUD 20.7 million.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of group earnings shows the primary drivers of this performance:\n\nFunds management continues to be the core engine of Qualitas’ growth, with funds management EBITDA margin expanding to 55%, up 4% from 1H25. This improvement reflects the company’s disciplined approach to scaling operations while maintaining cost efficiency.\n\nThe company’s earnings margins show a clear upward trajectory across multiple metrics:\n\nQualitas has successfully expanded its investor and borrower relationships, with 76% of deployment coming from repeat borrowers and 28% from follow-on investments. The company has built a substantial pool of potential embedded and unrecognized performance fees, now standing at AUD 99 million to be realized over the next seven years.\n\nThe company highlighted its expanding relationships with key stakeholders:\n\nResidential development remains a key driver of Qualitas’ growth, with the company gaining market share in financing larger-scale projects. This is particularly significant as residential developments are scaling up, creating demand for financiers with access to large-scale capital.\n\nQualitas is also benefiting from evolving global private credit dynamics, with investor interest shifting from the United States toward Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. This trend is expected to continue, with APAC fundraising growth projected to outpace the US over the next five years.\n\nQualitas reaffirmed its full-year 2026 guidance, projecting NPBT of AUD 60-66 million (representing 13-25% growth over FY25) and earnings per share of 13.9-15.3 cents.\n\nThe company’s outlook is supported by a strong pipeline of opportunities, with AUD 2.0 billion in available capital for deployment. Management highlighted that the undrawn construction credit profile and timing of deployment will be key factors influencing the final results within the guided range.\n\nGroup Managing Director Andrew Schwartz expressed confidence in the company’s positioning for the second half of the financial year, emphasizing Qualitas’ strategic initiatives and robust market position. This sentiment was echoed by Global Head of Real Estate Mark Fischer, who highlighted the stability of their investments, noting that their \"capital is deployed into real assets, supported by long-term, stable demand.\"\n\nThe company’s dividend policy reflects this confidence, with the interim dividend increasing by 40% to 3.5 cents per share compared to 1H25.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, Qualitas acknowledges potential challenges from interest rate fluctuations, competition from traditional banks, and global economic uncertainties that could influence investment decisions in the coming months.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.",

    "fullText": "Lufthansa can finally start making money on its Boeing 787 Dreamliners after a certification debacle left one of its most lucrative cabins largely empty for months.\n\nThe German flag carrier said on Monday that it will begin selling tickets for its Allegris business class on the 787. Allegris, Lufthansa's signature cabin concept, spans economy, premium economy, business, and first class, but the business class rollout has been particularly tricky.\n\nThe program first launched on the Airbus A350 in May 2024, with the cabin spanning the entire plane. The first Allegris-equipped 787 followed in October 2025, but certification of business class dragged on due to the cabin's complexity: there are five staggered seat configurations in a single airplane cabin — some with doors or more legroom, others with extra-long beds.\n\nThis is because the Dreamliner's geometry — including a slightly tighter usable footprint and different fuselage contouring compared to the A350 — made it harder to demonstrate to regulators that passengers could evacuate quickly from every seat, whether staggered, partially enclosed, or fully cocooned, in an emergency.\n\nThe result? For months, only four of the 28 business class seats could be sold — the front-row Business Class Suites — leaving the remaining 24 empty. Business class is a cash cow for airlines, and by flying most of the cabin empty as competitors pour investments into their own premium seats, Lufthansa was essentially leaving money on the table.\n\nIt has been a particularly costly headache for a carrier in the midst of a multi-year turnaround plan to restore profitability after years of financial pressure from frequent maintenance, aircraft shortages, rising operating costs, and labor strikes.\n\nLufthansa even opted for an already-certified business-class seat to retrofit onto its Airbus A380s rather than risk another prolonged and costly certification process.\n\nBut the saga is nearing the finish line. Beginning April 15, Lufthansa plans to carry passengers in 25 business-class seats on its 787s, with three remaining blocked in the second row of the cabin.\n\nBookings are open, though it's unclear whether the news indicates the seats have been fully certified or if that's just Lufthansa's expected timeline.\n\nLufthansa said \"Classic\" seats — one of the Allegris categories available — are free to secure with the premium fare.\n\nThe others require an extra fee: this includes the first-row suites, the \"Privacy\" seat next to the window, the \"Extra Space\" seat with more legroom, and the \"Extra Long Bed\" with an over seven-foot sleeping surface.\n\nThe three second-row seats that are blocked — and not yet available for booking — are two privacy seats and an extra-legroom seat.\n\nLufthansa flies eight Allegris-equipped Dreamliners and expects to have 29 by the end of 2027.\n\nThey are set to first fly from Frankfurt to Rio de Janeiro, Bogota, Cape Town, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, and Austin; New York-JFK and Los Angeles join the roster in June, followed by Delhi in July.\n\nAs part of Lufthansa's greater multibillion-dollar fleet overhaul plan, Allegris is also being fit onto the airline's existing A350s and Boeing 747-8s, as well as its future, yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777Xs.\n\nA similar spacing issue on the 747 double-deckers' upper level means it will have a split business class: the lower deck will have Allegris, while upstairs will feature the plane's original cabin.",

    "title": "AI's first wave was about cutting costs. The second wave is about building things we've never seen.",
    "description": "Startup CEOs like Kylan Gibbs and Sara Beykpour talk about AI's Second Wave, focusing on creating new products beyond cost-cutting.",
    "fullText": "For the past three years, AI has been mostly a cost-cutting tool. A growing number of founders and investors are trying to move beyond that era.\n\nThe next chapter of AI, they argue, will be defined by new kinds of products — apps, games, companions, and services that simply couldn't exist before large language models. They call it AI's \"Second Wave.\"\n\n\"The first wave of AI made existing things cheaper. Automation. Efficiency,\" said Kylan Gibbs, a former Google DeepMind product manager who runs AI startup Inworld. \"The next wave makes things that couldn't exist before. New products. New experiences. New revenue. That's the difference between optimizing spend and creating it.\"\n\nFor Gibbs, that distinction is existential. If AI merely trims costs, it reshuffles value within existing businesses. If it enables entirely new consumer products — ones people will pay for — it expands the economic pie.\n\n\"AI reaches its real economic potential when it creates value consumers want to pay for, not just value businesses want to save,\" he wrote on LinkedIn. That next phase, he says, requires a new \"consumer-scale AI stack\": real-time responses under 300 milliseconds, support for millions of users simultaneously, and deeply personal experiences tailored to individual preferences.\n\nIn January, Gibbs launched a Silicon Valley accelerator to back up to 30 \"Second Wave\" AI startups — companies building new consumer experiences rather than bolting chatbots onto old workflows. Venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, are involved, alongside leaders from OpenAI, Google, and Stripe. A demo day will take place in early March in San Francisco.\n\nThe philosophy echoes a recent post from Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan: \"Instead of worrying about doing the same thing we've been doing for cheaper, why not focus on doing the thing we never even dreamed of doing?\"\n\nA handful of startups already embody that ethos.\n\nSara Beykpour, CEO and cofounder of Particle, says the tech industry is in a liminal moment.\n\n\"We're in a transition between the first wave and the second wave,\" she said.\n\nThe first wave delivered massive productivity gains. At Particle, an AI-native news platform, tasks that once took a month can now be built, tested, and deployed in hours.\n\n\"We actually call each other out in meetings when someone falls into the old way of thinking,\" Beykpour said. \"We jokingly call it 'boomer thinking,' even though we're all millennials.\"\n\nThat shift in mindset gives the startup more time to focus on unlocking new AI-powered formats. Particle recently launched Podcast Clips, a feature that embeds the most relevant snippets of long-form podcasts directly into news stories. Instead of hunting through a three-hour episode, users see curated clips attached to specific topics.\n\n\"It changes the information hierarchy,\" Beykpour said. \"Instead of having to find the podcast you want to listen to, we're bringing the podcast to you based on the most relevant parts.\"\n\nUnder the hood, the system uses AI embeddings to map relationships between transcripts and stories. A clip from a talk show about Greenland and Davos, along with comments from President Donald Trump, can be automatically linked to relevant reporting. Generative AI then layers summaries and context on top.\n\nThese AI embeddings \"have gotten much better in important ways,\" Beykpour told Business Insider in a recent interview.\n\nIf Particle reimagines news, Luvu reinvents personal training using generative AI.\n\nLaunched in August 2025 by CEO Alexis Sursock and CTO Creston Brooks, the AI-powered fitness app has already attracted about 250,000 users. The app features an AI \"marshmallow\" that acts like a personal trainer, sending highly personalized notifications and real-time feedback.\n\n\"The key is the personalization, which is powered by AI models and wouldn't have been possible before this technology appeared in recent years,\" Brooks said.\n\nInstead of generic reminders — \"It's time for your workout\" — Luvu tailors messages. If a user logged that they had a test yesterday, the app might follow up with, \"Your test is over. Time to work out!\"\n\nThe results are striking. Luvu's notification click rate is four times that of typical non-personalized prompts. In an industry where only 2% to 3% of users remain active after 30 days, Brooks said, Luvu claims retention rates that are two to three times higher.\n\nThe app offers three motivational styles: supportive, neutral, or \"meaner marshmallow.\" Behind the scenes, Luvu also uses AI for granular, one-to-one messaging crafted by LLMs.\n\nThe company is also experimenting with reinforcement learning with verified rewards, a relatively new technique for training and improving AI models.\n\nUsers can prop their phones against a surface and record themselves exercising; the app uses computer-vision models to verify whether squats or other moves are performed correctly, offering real-time corrections like \"Straighten your knees.\" These verified signals feed back into the system, helping train what Brooks envisions as a future \"super-motivator\" model.\n\nThis isn't just a chatbot layered on top of a fitness tracker. It's a feedback loop between human behavior and AI, something that couldn't easily exist before the advent of modern models.\n\nFor Fai Nur, CEO and cofounder of AI-powered social simulation game Status, the Second Wave is about imagination.\n\n\"Status could not have existed before LLMs,\" she said.\n\nThe app, which has surpassed 3 million downloads, lets users role-play in AI-generated social media worlds. Think The Sims, though played out as a living, breathing social feed.\n\nUsers can cast themselves as anything they can imagine, such as Hogwarts students, soccer stars, or characters from \"Stranger Things.\" Post an update, and AI-generated characters instantly reply. Events unfold dynamically: miss a penalty kick, and face the backlash. An AI system assigns an \"aura score\" to grade responses and level players up or down.\n\nIn many enterprise settings, the non-deterministic nature of LLM outputs is a liability. Generative AI models sometimes respond to the same prompt in different ways, which doesn't lend itself to applications that require strict accuracy.\n\nIn gaming, this can be an asset because each new AI-generated response can be new, creating a richer, more varied experience.\n\n\"You haven't been able to role-play like this until now,\" Nur said.\n\nBefore LLMs, creating immersive fandom worlds required persuading other humans to participate. Now, entire social universes spin up instantly.\n\nFor Gibbs and other proponents of AI's Second Wave, that's the point. The technology's future won't be defined by incremental cost savings, but by products that feel native to AI — experiences that surprise, motivate, inform, and entertain at consumer scale.\n\nIf the first wave made businesses leaner, the second may make everyday life stranger, richer, and more interactive — and, crucially, something people will pay for.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.

    "fullText": "Although billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg have expansive portfolios, they're not among the largest landowners in the United States.\n\nIn fact, they're not even close.\n\nThe Land Report published its annual roundup of the top private landowners across the country in January. The outlet has collected land ownership data for nearly two decades.\n\nIn 2026, the list includes several billionaires, the children of business moguls, and the family of a former Texas governor.\n\nStanley Kroenke is the largest private landowner in the US with 2.7 million acres. The billionaire bought over 937,000 deeded acres in New Mexico last December, marking the single-largest land purchase in over a decade, according to The Land Report.\n\nKroenke — married to Walmart heiress Ann Walton — is a real estate mogul who has invested heavily in sports teams through his holdings company, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment. That includes owning the NBA's Denver Nuggets, the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, the NFL's Los Angeles Rams, and the Arsenal Football Club.\n\nThe Emmerson Family is the largest private timberland owner in the country, which may not be surprising given their business.\n\nSierra Pacific Industries — founded in 1949 — says it owns and manages over 2.4 million acres of timberland in Washington, Oregon, and California.\n\nMark D. Emmerson and George Emmerson, the sons of Sierra Pacific Industries cofounder Archie \"Red\" Emmerson, now helm the company.\n\nJohn Malone, also known as the Cable Cowboy, is a billionaire media mogul who led Tele-Communications Inc. for over 25 years.\n\nHe owns 2.2 million acres of land across New Mexico, Wyoming, Florida, and Colorado, according to The Land Report.\n\nThe Malone Family Land Preservation Foundation has a joint initiative with The Land Institute called the Perennial Agriculture Project. The project funds research about perennial crop system development.\n\nTed Turner has amassed 2 million acres of land following a high-profile career in American broadcasting.\n\nTurner led Turner Broadcasting Systems before founding CNN, the country's first 24-hour all-news network, in 1980. Eight years later, he created TNT.\n\nTurner Enterprises Inc. oversees the billionaire's investments, business interests, and land holdings. That includes the millions of acres and over 45,000 bison.\n\nThe Reed Family, owners of the Green Diamond Resource Company, has over 1.6 million acres of land, according to the report.\n\nThe Green Diamond Resource Company is one of the largest timberland owner-operators in the US, managing 2.2 million acres across nine states.\n\nThe family-owned business has spanned six generations. Douglas Reed serves as the company's president and chair.\n\nThe Buck Family has accumulated 1.3 million acres across the country, making them the sixth-largest US landowner, according to the report.\n\nThe Buck family amassed their wealth through the late Peter Buck, who cofounded Pete's Super Submarines in Connecticut. The franchise later became Subway, which has over 20,000 restaurants globally.\n\nThe Irving family owns 1.2 million acres in Maine, as well as additional land in parts of Canada, according to the report.\n\nJames Dergavel Irving founded J.D. Irving, Limited, in 1882. The Canadian company's original portfolio included a sawmill, a gristmill, a carding mill, a farm, a general store, and a lumber business.\n\nNow, J.D. Irving, Limited has expanded its services into consumer products, construction, transportation, and other sectors. Robert Irving and Jim Irving serve as co-CEOs.\n\nThe report ranked the heirs of King Ranch, the largest ranch in the US, at No. 8, with 911,000 acres.\n\nThe ranch got its start in 1853 when Captain Richard King purchased land in South Texas. The ranch says it also owns land in Florida.\n\nKing Ranch has a wide range of operations, from cattle ranching to breeding horses.\n\nThe heirs of David Pingree Sr. founded the Seven Islands Land Company in 1964. Pingree was a Salem, Massachusetts, shipping merchant who invested in Maine's timberlands in the 1800s.\n\nAs of 2026, the family has amassed 830,000 acres, according to the report.\n\nThe report ranked the heirs of Hugh Roy Cullen at No. 10 with 800,000 acres in the US.\n\nThe Cullen Foundation says Hugh's career began in Texas in the 1890s. He entered the cotton business before investing in real estate.\n\nHugh founded Quintana Petroleum Corporation in 1932. The company's mining division — Quintana Minerals Corporation— was formed 31 years later.\n\nNow, the corporation is a management company run by the Robertson family. Corbin J. Robertson Jr. is Cullen's grandson.\n\nThe Briscoe family is the 11th largest US landowner.\n\nThe late Dolph Briscoe, Jr., was the governor of Texas from 1973 to 1979. The family's holdings, spanning over 1,000 square miles, are overseen by Dolph \"Chip\" Briscoe III, according to the report.",

    "title": "AH-64 Apache Is Getting Proximity Fuzed 30mm Cannon Ammo For Swatting Down Drones",
    "description": "The XM1225 APEX ammo will offer another arrow in the Apache's growing anti-drone quiver.",
    "fullText": "The AH-64 Apache attack helicopter has evolved into a counter-drone platform in recent years — something we have been following closely. While the Israeli Air Force had pioneered this role for the AH-64 for years, the U.S. Army has now formally codified it and added new capabilities in the process. Now, as we had suggested some time ago, the Apache is getting proximity-fuzed 30mm cannon shells for its chin-mounted M230 cannon that will add to its drone-killing arsenal, giving it a cheaper and more plentiful engagement option than some of the alternatives.\n\nCRAZY footage of an IAF Apache helicopter chasing down a Hezbollah drone over northern Israel and downing it with cannon fire from its chaingun\n\n— Raylan Givens (@JewishWarrior13) November 2, 2024\n\nApaches live-fire tested the 30x113mm XM1225 Aviation Proximity Explosive (APEX) ammo last December, according to a recent Army release. The trials occurred at the service’s sprawling Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) in southern Arizona. Multiple test engagements occurred against various types of drone targets.\n\nThe specialized APEX ammunition works by detonating only when it is close to an object, then it explodes in a spray of shrapnel. This is critical to shooting down drones as they are small, independently moving targets, and the Apache’s monocle-targeted chin gun isn’t exactly a sniper rifle in terms of precision. At the same time, the rounds could also be used against targets on the surface — including personnel, soft-skinned vehicles, and small boats, for instance — offering unique area effects compared to the Apache’s standard impact-detonating, high-explosive ammunition.\n\nVariants of the M230 cannon, the prime contractor for which is now Northrop Grumman, have already become an increasingly popular choice for dealing with lower-end drone threats from the ground. The light-weight M230LF version, designated the M914 in Army service, has found its way onto counter-drone vehicles. This includes the Sgt. Stout Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) system based on the 8×8 Stryker light armored vehicle. The Army has been separately pursuing self-destructing and other kinds of proximity-fuzed 30mm ammunition for use with the M914. The new APEX ammo offers improved performance that can plug-and-play with the Apache/M230 combo. The other rounds for use in ground-based systems have never been cleared for use on the Apache to our knowledge.\n\nAn official Army release on the XM1225’s successful testing reads, in part:\n\n“Developed and managed by Product Manager Medium Caliber Ammunition (PdM MCA) from Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the XM1225 APEX cartridge is designed to counter modern threats, including UAS, exposed personnel, and small boats, without requiring modifications to the Apache’s M230 Area Weapon System or fire control system. The XM1225 has undergone extensive safety testing to ensure reliable performance, making it a safe and effective addition to the Apache’s arsenal. This innovative design ensures seamless integration into existing platforms while delivering enhanced lethality and operational flexibility.\n\n…The primary objective was to evaluate the XM1225 cartridge’s accuracy and compare its performance to the legacy M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge under identical conditions. A secondary objective was to collect data on mixed loads of XM1225 and M789 rounds against both ground and UAS targets.\n\nInitial results were highly successful, with the XM1225 meeting all accuracy requirements and demonstrating exceptional effectiveness against both ground and UAS targets. The proximity-fuzed capability of the XM1225 allows it to detonate near the target, creating a larger lethal radius and significantly improving its ability to neutralize airborne and dispersed threats. This capability positions the Apache to dominate the battlefield in both air-to-ground and air-to-air engagements, providing warfighters with a critical edge in modern combat scenarios.”\n\nA key feature of the APEX ammunition is that it requires little additional training for Apache crews to successfully employ it as it acts very similarly, ballistically, to the M789 high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP) rounds already fielded. Those shells use an impact/grazing fuze to command detonation.\n\nA major issue with using any gun for counter-drone work from the air is that standard high-explosive or incendiary cannon rounds simply keep traveling until they hit something, then they explode. This makes any horizontal or upward aspect shots very problematic, as the rounds can fly many miles before hitting the ground. Anyone or anything in that unpredictable zone would not fare well. Even high-deflection shots are risky, especially considering the size of the drones. Not only will most rounds miss and still hit somewhere below, but the aircraft can easily fly into the drone itself, as judging its distance and keeping track of it in the air is problematic. So, having self-destructing rounds, and even better, proximity fuzed ones that do the same, is key.\n\nAs it sits now, the AH-64 has modified AGM-114 missiles that use the Longbow Radar to prosecute aerial targets. Laser-guided Hellfires are potentially another option. Regardless, any Hellfire costs well into the six-digit realm. Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) laser-guided rockets are a lower-cost option, having a low-to-mid five-digit price tag. It isn’t clear if the AH-64 has been cleared to use air-to-air optimized Fixed Wing, Air Launched, Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Ordnance (FALCO) versions of the APKWS II, which also use a proximity fuze for going after aerial targets, yet.\n\nSo, giving AH-64s the gun option, and in a far more reliable and safer manner via a proximity fuzed round, would be a huge boon for crews tasked with the counter-drone mission. Apaches can carry a whopping 1,200 rounds of 30mm ammunition, and they can be reloaded with more very quickly at forward austere locales on the ground.\n\nSo as it sits now, it likely won’t be too long before the AH-64 has a new arrow in its anti-drone quiver.\n\nContact the author: Tyler@twz.com",

    "fullText": "PRAGUE, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine has received 4.4 million rounds of large-calibre ammunition under a plan pulling ‌together Czech arms traders and producers and funding ‌from foreign donors, President Petr Pavel told a Czech news website in ​an interview.\n\nPavel has been a strong backer of the scheme which includes Czech defence officials and defence firms sourcing 155mm and other large-calibre ammunition around the world, purchasing it ‌and shipping to ⁠Ukraine with funds from Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and other donors.\n\nThe new Czech government of ⁠Prime Minister Andrej Babis' populist ANO party, including the pro-Russian far-right SPD, had considered scrapping the initiative but agreed under pressure ​from Pavel ​and allies to continue ​the plan, although it said ‌it would not give any national funding for the purchases.\n\n\"Since its launch the initiative has brought about 4.4 million pieces of large-calibre ammunition to Ukraine,\" Pavel, a former senior NATO official, told the odkryto.cz website.\n\n\"Without this ammunition ‌reserve, Ukraine's armed forces could not ​effectively lead defence.\"\n\nPavel said nearly 2 ​million rounds were ​delivered last year. That number is slightly above NATO's ‌December estimate of 1.8 million.\n\nDonors ​have given ​billions of euros to the scheme in the past two years, Czech officials have said.\n\nA NATO official said ​last week that ‌more was needed, with commitments at 1.4 billion ​euros versus 5 billion euro target.",

    "fullText": "With a very high cost of operation and in many cases, a concentrated market of competitors, many smaller and even mid-size airlines have already filed for bankruptcy in the first two months of 2026.\n\nA few names of these names include Royal Air Philippines, Indian charter carrier Dove Airlines, Swedish carrier H-Bird, and U.S. charter airline Tailwind Air.\n\nIn the latter case, the carrier, based out of Westchester County Airport (HPN) in New York, filed for Chapter 11 protection after losing its Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) due to lack of funds in January 2025.\n\nThe AOC, the primary certification that allows a civil airline to begin running and selling flights, is issued by the government agency that regulates aviation in a given country (the FAA in the United States).\n\nOver in Austria, Mali Air became the latest small carrier to lose its AOC. Contrary to what its name might suggest, Air Mali had no connection to the West African nation of Mali. It was founded by Austrian pilot and aviation investor Karl-Heinz Mali in 1994 with a single twin-engine Cessna 340A jet.\n\nAs first reported by Swiss outlet ch-aviation, Mali Air no longer had an active AOC as of Feb. 16.\n\nBased out of the regional Graz Airport (GRZ) in southeastern Austria, Mali Air started out by offering wealthy travelers charter flights from Austria to multiple destinations in Eastern Europe in the 1990s and eventually expanded to more European destinations over the years.\n\nOn its website, Mali Air reports a fleet of four planes: a Cessna 340, a Cessna Citation 501, an Eclipse 500, and an Eclipse 550. The latter is a twin-engine jet with just six passenger seats.\n\nIt is not immediately clear whether Mali Air lost an active AOC over its financial situation, a failed safety audit, or another reason, which, in many such cases, relates to operational mismanagement.\n\nThe company also advertises loosely defined services, such as aircraft management and \"complete air logistics services of all cargo and restricted dangerous goods.\"\n\n\"By actively promoting your aircraft for third-party charter flights, we also help you earn income on your aircraft while reducing your fixed expenses,\" Mali Air writes on its website.\n\nSpirit Airlines (Spirit Aviation Holdings, Inc.): Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time on August 29,2025.\n\nRavn Alaska: Ceased operations in August 2025 after earlier Chapter 11 proceedings; shut down flights and folded into other operations such as New Pacific.\n\nCorporate Air: Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (restructuring) in September 2025 as part of a planned sale, according to Bondoro.\n\nPlay Airlines: The Reykjavik-based airline shut down operations and entered involuntary bankruptcy in September 2025.\n\nBraathens Airlines:The airline was forced to file for bankruptcy and canceled all of its flights in September 2025.",

    "description": "Wales needs a specialist defence coach but Welsh rugby greats Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones question when that will happen and who decides.",
    "fullText": "Steve Tandy needs help. As head coach of a crisis-ridden Wales side plunging to new depths every time they take to the field, that much is obvious.\n\nSpecifically, according to two Welsh rugby greats, Tandy needs the support of a full-time defence coach.\n\nHis work as defence coach for Scotland impressed enough to earn the same role with the British and Irish Lions, so Tandy was expected to tighten things up for Wales when he took the reins last September.\n\nYet there has been little case for the defence with Wales.\n\nIn his first six games in charge - albeit including the world's top four teams in their last four Tests - Tandy's Wales have conceded a staggering 302 points and 42 tries.\n\nThe latest battering, Sunday's 54-12 mauling by France in Cardiff, leaves Wales bottom of the Six Nations having already shipped 102 points. No team has conceded \n\nTandy has confirmed Wales will have a specialist defence coach by the summer but the timing of that appointment - and who makes it - has been questioned.\n\nWales cling to optimism despite another record loss\n\nLowest Cardiff Six Nations crowd amid rugby turmoil\n\nScotland game chance for Wales to 'deliver better'\n\nWales have full-time attack and forwards coaches in the form of Matt Sherratt and Danny Wilson, but Tandy only has the temporary support of Dan Lydiate – still very early in his coaching career – in defence.\n\nJuggling that work with his head coach duties, Tandy might be spreading himself too thinly, according to former Wales captains Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\n\"Mid-season it's hard to transition and get someone in,\" Tandy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to have a look at and, probably by the summer, we'll have an option then.\n\n\"It isn't a quick fix. It's something we need to layer and build towards the future.\"\n\nWarburton won two Six Nations titles, including a Grand Slam, with a Wales team built on the rock-solid defensive foundation provided by Shaun Edwards, who now holds that role for France.\n\nThe former Wales captain said Tandy needs help with defence.\n\n\"Steve's admitted he's probably spread himself a bit too thinly,\" Warburton told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He's been doing the defence with Dan Lydiate but then you're trying to do the defence with all the other things that come with being a head coach.\n\n\"Dan is more the micro defensive skills [such as] tackle technique, competition on the floor.\n\n\"Wales don't have a full-time defence coach [and] it's not just about being a coach during campaign time. When the players are playing for their clubs, you're there full-time, watching the regions play, or the Welsh-qualified players playing in England, and you can still keep dialogue and send clips.\n\n\"He needs to bring in a defence coach [but] it sounds like they can't get people out of their contracts because it's difficult to bring people in mid-season.\n\n\"For someone to come in as a full-time defence coach, they need to be tried and tested at this level.\"\n\nWhen taking his role as Welsh Rugby Union's director of rugby last July, Dave Reddin said Tandy would \"not solely select\" his coaching team but would be involved in the process.\n\nHe added: \"It's about getting the right people in those spots as opposed to just getting the next people. It might well be that people are in position already and we need to be a bit more patient.\"\n\nWhoever that new appointment might be, Alun Wyn Jones believes his former Ospreys team-mate Tandy should have the biggest say in the matter.\n\n\"Steve needs to be able to oversee everything and get others to focus on those areas,\" he said.\n\n\"The bigger question I'd ask: Is he going to appoint his own defence coach?\n\n\"There have been questions around that, as opposed to other people in the organisation. That's the most important thing – he's got to be able to pick his own staff.\n\n\"He's got a great grip of the defence, but you can't spread yourself too thinly in that position.\"",

    "description": "The second weekend of the Six Nations brings redemption for Scotland, another blistering display from France and a threat for Ireland.",
    "fullText": "Redemption for Scotland as they end England's unbeaten run, Ireland squeeze past improving Italy, and can anyone stop France?\n\nHere are the main talking points from an enthralling second round of the Six Nations.\n\nThere were questions asked of Scotland and head coach Gregor Townsend after the opening weekend defeat by Italy but you would struggle to find a more emphatic riposte than their 31-20 victory over England.\n\nScotland started brilliantly and never took their foot off the gas to hand Steve Borthwick's side a first defeat in 13 games and improve on their dominant recent record in Calcutta Cup games, having now won six of the past nine.\n\nSpeaking to the Rugby Union Weekly podcast, former Scotland international Johnnie Beattie said: \"This was special. They were humbled last weekend in Rome and this time we had a chance to humble England here and came through.\n\n\"Everything that went wrong last week was righted. We fought and scrapped for everything. It was fully deserved and was a comprehensive Calcutta Cup win.\"\n\nBeattie said Scotland have always had the capacity to win one-off games against top sides but must find more consistency.\n\n\"They've had these seminal moments but not put together a consistent run that would put them in a position to compete for a championship,\" he added.\n\n\"It's how consistently can you find ways to beat these top-level opposition and Scotland don't have the answer yet. Can you finish in the top three? There are some huge games. We have to back it up.\"\n\n'Murrayfield pain will make England a better team'\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nEngland went into the game against Scotland looking for a 13th straight win and a first in Edinburgh since 2020, but were unable to cope with Scotland's energy and intensity.\n\nThey lost last week's hat-trick hero Henry Arundell to an early yellow card, which later became a red, and when they threatened to stage a comeback a chargedown on George Ford's drop-goal attempt led to Huw Jones' eighth try against England - the most of any player in the Six Nations era.\n\n\"Scotland were 20 points better not 11. They were comprehensive winners,\" ex-England scrum-half Matt Dawson told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"In the cold light of day England were taken apart from minute one to minute 80. Scotland were miles better.\"\n\nThe loss was England's fourth in their past five Six Nations away matches and Dawson questioned their tactics.\n\n\"For me it wasn't so much about the kicking game. It was like if that's not working what else are you going to do? Scotland had done their homework and defended ferociously and England were getting no change out of it, so what's the tactic?\" said Dawson.\n\n\"England didn't adjust accordingly. It was a masterclass from the Scotland coaching staff because England were nowhere.\"\n\nFormer England winger Chris Ashton told Rugby Special he felt England looked \"disjointed\" and there had been a \"snowball effect\" as errors mounted up.\n\n\"A lot of it was not being able to handle pressure. It was one thing after another so early in the game. England lost every battle,\" he added.\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\n'I felt guilty' - Tuipulotu says Scotland delivered for Townsend\n\nFrance are the only team still capable of a Grand Slam and the unbeaten Les Bleus put on another masterclass with a 54-12 win over Wales in Cardiff.\n\nIn a blistering display of speed, scything running and joie de vivre, France made 10 line-breaks in the opening 20 minutes on their way to scoring the most points they have racked up against Wales, surpassing the 51-0 win at Wembley in 1998.\n\nAn agile and mobile pack, allied with a magical backline playing with total freedom, the blue shirts were like a blur leaving Wales chasing shadows.\n\n\"You look at this France team and think, who stops them? They have it all,\" former Scotland back row John Barclay told Rugby Special.\n\nAshton said the French side could \"score at will\" and singled out winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey for praise.\n\n\"His all-round game is fantastic, he always seems so confident and does things not many players can,\" he added. \"He's the go-to guy for France.\"\n\nWill anyone stop 'massive favourites' France in Six Nations?\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nThese are tough times to be a Wales fan. The hardest in living memory for a generation who grew up with regular Six Nations success and a team full of stars such as Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\nThere are many issues at play in Welsh rugby, but by any measure, recent results are a complete horror show as Sunday's record loss to France made it 13 consecutive Six Nations defeats and a 10th straight loss at home in the championship.\n\nIt's now 1,072 days since their last Six Nations victory in March 2023 against Italy in Rome and 1,464 days since their last championship win at home against Scotland in February 2022.\n\nIt appears supporters are starting to vote with their feet. The attendance against France was 57,744, making it the lowest Six Nations crowd in Cardiff.\n\nBut speaking after the game on BBC One, former captain Warburton was encouraged by some parts of Wales' play and said they need to look at what went well such as the maul defence, line-out and the performance of Eddie James.\n\n\"Some aspects of the game went quite well, they weren't outpowered, they were outclassed with ball handling. There are some positives to take into next week,\" said Warburton.\n\n\"Looking at the small wins, there's no point kicking them when they're down. It has to be how can we get better from this point? Which young players look like they've got the mentality?\n\n\"We're not trying to solve this in one week, we're in this for a couple of years so let's all get tight and every week look for small improvements and move forward.\"\n\nJones said there had \"definitely been green shoots\".\n\n\"The effort was there but it's international rugby and you're going to be judged on results, but it was there from an effort standpoint,\" he added.\n\nEx-England captain Martin Johnson also offered words of encouragement.\n\n\"Wales can always play and score tries, they have good rugby players so you're never that far away and they can sit there thinking they've been smashed at home against a very good French side.\n\n\"But there will be some games coming up where they think we can win this.\"\n\n'Heartbreaking, sad, disgrace' – Wales fans react to state of game\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nWales still rugby nation despite struggles - Tandy\n\nAfter losing to France in the opening round, Andy Farrell's side survived a scare against an improving Italy side fresh from a home victory over Scotland.\n\nIreland have won all 13 home games against Italy in the Six Nations but that 100% record came under serious threat.\n\nAshton told Rugby Special that Italy, who led at half-time, missed a wonderful opportunity to get a first victory in Ireland.\n\n\"It would have been a long 10 days for Ireland so Farrell would have been happy they got the win but Italy missed so many opportunities. They've got to be annoyed they didn't get the win,\" he told Rugby Special.\n\nFarrell has a big decision to make before Saturday's match away at England after a difficult afternoon for starting fly-half Sam Prendergast, who was replaced by Jack Crowley, with the Munster man putting in a strong showing off the bench.\n\n\"It's hard for Ireland right now, they're in a funny place. They want success all the time and it's going to be hard for them at Allianz Stadium,\" Ashton told Rugby Special.\n\nBarclay added: \"They're not quite there but you don't write them off. They've got experienced British and Irish Lions and it's just small tweaks missing.\"\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nI think Crowley starts against England - Murray\n\nItaly captain Lamaro proud perception has changed\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.",

He did not have a criminal record.\n\nHe will be questioned by prosecutors on Tuesday. The child was treated in hospital and is recovering at home with her parents.\n\n“A survival instinct kicked in,” the father of the toddler, named as Matteo, told Italian television. “To see your daughter in danger is dreadful. The reaction was immediate. You don’t think, you just act.”\n\nHe said that his daughter was seated in a trolley while they were shopping but then wanted to walk.\n\n“I gave her to my partner and I was pushing the trolley. It all happened in a fraction of a second. It is not something that you expect, particularly because the supermarket was packed with people.\n\n“I must thank all the supermarket staff who intervened and the police, who were quick to arrive. My daughter is OK and she is playing despite the plaster cast she has to wear.”\n\nMarco Cadeddu, a senior police officer, said it was a very serious incident. “We arrested the man, took him to the police station, and took care of the child, who was taken to hospital. It could have ended up being a lot worse.”\n\nElena Carnevali, the mayor of Bergamo, expressed solidarity with the parents for the “terrifying experience” they endured.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

During the this time, Muslims abstain from food and drink from dawn until sunset.\n\nWith sunset in the UK ranging from about 17:00 to 19:00 GMT during this period, the only games that could see a break in play will be Saturday's 17:30 kick-off and Sunday's 16:30 kick-off.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, club captains alongside match officials will find a natural pause in the game to allow Muslim players or match officials to break their fast.\n\nTeams and match officials will discuss beforehand whether a pause is required and an approximate time for the stoppage will be agreed. The break will not be used as a team drinks break nor as a tactical time-out.\n\nPlay will not stop while matches are in mid-flow but at the earliest convenient moment during a goal-kick, free-kick or throw-in.\n\nIn 2021, an agreement was put in place to allow Muslim players to break their fast during a Premier League match.\n\nThis first break took place in a game between Leicester City and Crystal Palace in April 2021. The match was paused at a goal-kick around the half-hour mark to allow Leicester's Wesley Fofana and Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate, external to replenish themselves with liquids and energy gels.\n\nOne of the five pillars of Islam is that during Ramadan, Muslims fast during daylight hours to show their devotion to their religion.\n\nMuslim names in the Premier League include Mohamed Salah, William Saliba, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Amad Diallo among others.\n\n\"In the Premier League you are free to do whatever suits you. They will never do anything against your faith and this is great,\" former Everton player Abdoulaye Doucoure told BBC Sport in 2023.\n\n\"I fast every day, I don't miss any day. It has become normal and very easy for me. Training is still the same during Ramadan but when we go [for away matches], we might need to eat later than the others so the chef prepares food for us, making sure everything is in place as at home. We get halal food so there are no problems,\" Doucoure added.\n\nAnd in 2022, former Liverpool player Sadio Mane revealed the club altered their training schedules to support their Muslim players during the month of Ramadan.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Indiana-based PARLOUR Pizza + Pints, which opened its first Lexington location on Harrodsburg Road in 2024, is expanding.\n\nNow, the newest PARLOUR will be coming to Richmond. The new restaurant will open in a former Hooters at 241 Eastern Bypass, about a mile from Eastern Kentucky University, in late March, according to Don Robinson, PARLOUR CEO and president.\n\n“It was always a part of our target demographic for bringing PARLOUR to the Lexington market,” he said. “Most of the time the real estate kind of dictates the location. We really like the layout and the visibility.”\n\nHe said they’d actually intended to open a second Lexington location first, but construction delays mean the Richmond restaurant will leapfrog one coming soon to the Hamburg area.\n\nThis summer, he said, a PARLOUR will open on Justice Drive, near Harry’s, Drake’s, Malone’s, Graeter’s Ice Cream and more. Like the one at 2099 Harrodsburg, the Hamburg spot will have a “UK room” showcasing the University of Kentucky Wildcats and artwork from local artists.\n\nAll will have the same menu and very similar design, usually with outdoor seating. The one in Richmond will have an enclosed patio, but it has five garage doors that can be opened to bring that “inside out” atmosphere, he said. The smaller location doesn’t a have a separate room, but will incorporate local artwork throughout, he said.\n\nThe restaurant chain is known for its relaxed vibe with tons of TVs for watching sports while you enjoy handmade pizza, calzones, grinders, saucy smoked wings, craft cocktails and extensive craft beer selection. Signature dishes include the Sriracha Bourbon BBQ Nachos.\n\nWhy so much expansion in Central Kentucky already? Because business is booming.\n\n“We have been blown away by the way the Lexington Market has welcomed us,” Robinson said. “It’s our No. 1 store out of all of them. It’s been really fun. I didn’t spend a lot of time in Lexington until that store opened, and it’s been fabulous.”\n\nBesides Lexington, there are three locations in Louisville and two in Indiana.\n\nRichmond made sense as well: “We think it’s an underserved market, and we think it’s fantastic.”\n\nAnd if you don’t live in Lexington or Richmond, don’t worry. PARLOUR might be coming your way soon with more growth in the works.\n\n“We’re looking at a couple of different markets,” Robinson said. “We hope to get another one or so open by the end of the year, then three or four a year.”\n\nNew Lexington restaurants opening in 2026: Downtown changes as south side grows\n\nNew Mexican restaurant, sports bar opening in familiar Lexington location\n\nParent of restaurant chain that started in Lexington files for bankruptcy\n\nNew family entertainment venue with ax throwing coming to Lexington\n\nNew Lexington pizza chain has made-from-scratch dough, sauces (including garlic)",

    "description": "A powerful Valentine’s Day storm destroyed a centuries-old seaside arch in southern Italy long associated with romance, dealing a blow to local tourism and highlighting concerns about coastal erosion ...",
    "fullText": "An Italian coastal beauty spot known as “Lovers’ Arch” because of its popularity with courting couples collapsed during heavy storms on Valentine’s Day in what one local official called “a blow to the heart.”\n\nFaraglioni di Sant’Andrea, the site of an arch in the stone cliffs on the coast of Salento — the heel of Italy’s “boot’ — has drawn romantically inclined visitors for centuries, with lovers traditionally proposing marriage, stealing first kisses or celebrating unions. Those who kissed under the arch were destined for eternal love, according to local legend.\n\nBut when a powerful storm swept across southern Italy over the weekend, the arch’s fragile structure gave way, reducing it to a pile of rubble.\n\nIts collapse has dealt a “devastating blow to the image of Salento and to tourism,” Maurizio Cisternino, mayor of the town of Melendugno, near the fallen arch, told CNN. “It’s a blow to the heart.”\n\nThe arch was formed by centuries of harsh wind and high seas grinding away at the Calcarenite stone cliffs of Italy’s Puglia region, on the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea. The site, once a strategic lookout used to warn of pirates, became a magnet for lovers during the late 18th century.\n\nInstagram photos have drawn thousands more couples to the arch in recent years, Cisternino said. Because it’s free and open to the public, it’s impossible to know exactly how many, he added.\n\nLorenzo Barlato, a local resident, proposed to his wife on the clifftop overlooking the arch more than 40 years ago and the pair often returned for anniversaries.\n\n“I couldn’t wait to return,” he posted on Facebook after Saturday’s collapse. “Now, unfortunately, all I have left are the many beautiful photos I took of that piece of paradise.”\n\nThe area is so popular that hotels and resorts — many named for the arch — have sprung up to accommodate visitors.\n\nWarmer sea temperatures as a result of climate change are seen as a factor in driving the extreme weather that battered the arch, which had already been damaged by Cyclone Harry in January.\n\nBut concern over the landmark’s fragility goes back years.\n\nIn 2024, local authorities applied for a $4.5 million grant to fund a preservation project to combat coastal erosion, but failed to secure the money, according to Cisternino.\n\n“It’s a tragedy we knew was inevitable, we just didn’t expect it to happen so soon,” he told local media on Sunday.\n\nHe told CNN that “nature has reclaimed the arch, just as it created it,” and said that resources were needed to tackle the situation along the coast.\n\n“Nature has been transformed: what was there 30 years ago is no longer there.”\n\nThe collapse follows weeks of violent storms across southern Italy. In Sicily, a landslide recently saw houses fall into a ravine in the town of Niscemi. Widespread flooding has taken the lives of several people, including a man who died when his home collapsed near Rome last week.\n\nNow gone, the remnants of the arch will be left to wash out at sea, the municipality says. “It’s like a funeral,” Puglia tourism councillor Francesco Stella said Sunday of what was once one of the happiest places in Italy.",

    "fullText": "The tifo stretched across the Star Lane end by Macclesfield's fans moments before the start of the FA Cup tie with Brentford was emblazoned with the message: \"Against All Odds\".\n\nIt was also displayed in the players' tunnel at Moss Rose as John Rooney's side walked out to attempt a repeat of the historic third-round win against Premier League opposition that left holders Crystal Palace embarrassed and beaten.\n\nAnd for 70 minutes on a freezing Cheshire night, Macclesfield suggested lightning could strike twice as they once again stood toe-to-toe with top-flight opposition, refusing to give an inch.\n\nIt was only then, as tired legs started to betray the National League North side and the gap of 116 places on the game's pyramid finally started to show, that one cruel moment took the dream away.\n\nSam Heathcote, the PE teacher who has been a hero of Macclesfield's FA Cup run, was the victim of the fates this great tournament can inflict along with its glory when he headed Aaron Hickey's cross into his own net.\n\nBrentford grabbed at the gift, even then surviving the odd anxious moment before they were finally able to celebrate victory.\n\nThe honours were Macclesfield's, as illustrated by Brentford head coach Keith Andrews graciously going into their dressing room to offer his personal tribute to their display, before speaking in glowing terms about their opponents.\n\nHe said: \"I love stories like Macclesfield's. They fill my heart. I though they were awesome and a real tribute to John Rooney and his coaching team.\"\n\nRooney, despite the disappointment, appreciated Andrews' words as he said: \"He told us he had seen real togetherness in our group and that's what we work on. We have a good changing room and it takes you a long way.\n\n183 team changes in 14 ties - but does it really matter for the FA Cup?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nMatheson on Old Trafford heroics, 'torrid time' as £1m teenager & McLeod death\n\n\"I really couldn't be prouder of the team. For us to go toe-to-toe with two Premier League teams and to only lose by an own goal is something I'm incredibly proud of.\n\n\"All the lads are down and Sam's the same obviously, having scored an own goal. It's natural, but every player knows what they have achieved for this club on this journey, so we should all be so proud.\n\n\"We now go back to our bread and butter in the league. We train twice a week and we've put that performance on against a Premier League side. How can you not be proud of that achievement?\n\n\"I started my football career at this club and I've started my managerial career at this club. We want to go on and get promoted. We want to try and get in the play-offs.\"\n\nMacclesfield's fans arrived in a blizzard of optimism, the rainbow that arced over this compact, atmospheric stadium after a storm two hours before kick-off offering up an omen that they could claim another pot of gold.\n\nAnd how they revelled in another visit from a Premier League team, chanting \"West Ham away\" after hearing the fifth round draw, then \"are you Palace in disguise\" as they tore into Brentford - both physically and with their football - in the opening exchanges.\n\nMacclesfield captain Paul Dawson, a goal hero in the 2-1 win against Palace, was inches away from a repeat with a 20-yard shot that was just off target.\n\nEvery classic FA Cup ingredient was in this mix. The non-league side with a collection of PE teachers, podcasters and property developers in their squad shaking up elite opposition, with the added factor of Moss Rose's 4G artificial surface.\n\nThere was nothing artificial about the atmosphere as every Macclesfield fan scented another shock in the cold night air.\n\nFew other competitions can offer up such a spectacle and the FA Cup delivered again.\n\nIn some respects, the half-time whistle came at a bad time for Macclesfield as it disturbed their momentum and allowed Brentford to take a breath and regroup.\n\nBrentford head coach Andrews made seven changes, leaving his big attacking weapon Igor Thiago out altogether. It was a high-risk strategy and there were moments in the first 45 minutes when it looked like it might backfire.\n\nAnd even after suffering the devastating blow of Heathcote's own goal, Macclesfield refused to allow Brentford to simply shut the game down, forcing several desperate clearances in the area before referee Darren England sounded the final whistle on this FA Cup odyssey.\n\nMacclesfield will now return to their real world against King's Lynn Town on Saturday - but they have created FA Cup memories that will live forever with players and fans of a club on the rise.\n\nBrentford edge past non-league Macclesfield after second-half own goal\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup begins. So what changes could we see?",
    "fullText": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil begins.\n\nSarina Wiegman's side travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThere are just eight international camps before England hope to be in Brazil for the World Cup - so they will want to ensure there are no slip-ups in their first qualifying matches of the year.\n\nEngland have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.\n\nWiegman will name her squad for the first time in 2026 on Tuesday at 11:00 - who might feature and what are the key decisions for the Dutchwoman?\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nEngland have not had a competitive fixture since winning Euro 2025 as they beat China 8-0 and Ghana 2-0 in friendly matches at the end of last year.\n\nBefore that, they suffered a 2-1 defeat by Brazil on their homecoming return but recorded a 3-0 win over Australia three days later.\n\nThe matches gave Wiegman an opportunity to test new players and formations - handing a debut to 30-year-old goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse in the process.\n\nAmong those to receive their first senior call-ups to the squad were defenders Anouk Denton, Taylor Hinds and forward Freya Godfrey.\n\nThere was also time for England stars Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren James to recover from lengthy injuries.\n\nChelsea defender Millie Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, announced her retirement in October having withdrawn from the Euros.\n\nThere was a serious blow for Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang - one of England's key players in Switzerland - as she was carried off on a stretcher after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during the win over Australia.\n\nBut it's been a successful time for the other Lionesses in Arsenal's squad, including captain Williamson, who lifted the Champions Cup in February.\n\nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was named the world's best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards in September, as Wiegman picked up the best coach award.\n\nHampton also wrapped up the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award in November after being caught up in the fallout of Mary Earps' autobiography, which was released earlier that month.\n\nMost of Wiegman's key players have returned from injury in recent weeks - but there will still be some noteable absentees.\n\nManchester United midfielder Ella Toone is out with a hip issue until the end of March so will not feature against Ukraine or Iceland.\n\nThere are not many midfield options available with Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns also absent, while team-mate Lucia Kendall came off the bench to play 28 minutes of Villa's 7-3 thrashing by Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance in five weeks due to a thigh injury.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal winger Beth Mead fractured her shin so is out but Chloe Kelly made her return at the end of January and is available for selection.\n\nArsenal defender Hinds has had an ankle injury that has kept her out for a few weeks but she could still be included.\n\nChelsea full-back Niamh Charles is also sidelined with an ankle injury but team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones came on as an 83rd-minute substitute in their win over Liverpool on Sunday so her return is timely.\n\nTottenham full-back Ella Morris is close to returning from the ACL injury she suffered last year but will not be back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Agyemang and Arsenal defender Katie Reid are still recovering from their respective ACL injuries.\n\nThere remains a lack of full-back options for Wiegman with Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier seen as back-up for Bronze despite playing her club football at centre-back every week.\n\nCharles' absence and Hinds' recent injury means there are limited options at left-back too - meaning Manchester City's Alex Greenwood could once again make the switch from centre-back to full-back.\n\nThere could be a recall for Bay FC's Anouk Denton, who moved to the American club from West Ham in February, two months after making her England debut.\n\nLondon City Lionesses forward Godfrey has impressed this season and Wiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to see her grab an assist in a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.\n\nThe 20-year-old was called up for the first time in November but remains uncapped - so she will hope to feature this time around.\n\nTeam-mate Izzy Goodwin could be a surprise call-up in Beth Mead's absence, though Chelsea's James is back so Wiegman has other attacking options.\n\nWiegman will need to manage players like Kelly, Bronze and Keira Walsh who have not been fully fit in recent weeks and they may not be able to start both games.\n\nBut she will have been boosted by James' impressive display for Chelsea on Sunday, while Jess Park has shone for United and Lauren Hemp for Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "Coco Gauff says it is \"tough to wake up\" and see what is happening back home in the United States and she will continue to speak out about issues that matter to her.\n\nThe two-time Grand Slam singles champion is among a host of American athletes who have voiced their displeasure with US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nProtests have taken place across the United States since Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed in Minneapolis last month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\n\nGauff, 21, spends most of the year competing overseas and the world number five learned of their deaths while in Australia for the first Grand Slam of the year.\n\n\"I don't think people should be dying in the streets just for existing,\" Gauff told reporters in Dubai, where she is set to compete this week.\n\n\"It is tough to wake up and see something because I do care a lot about our country. I think people think I don't for some reason, but I do. I'm very proud to be American.\n\n\"You don't have to represent the entire values of what's going on in the leadership. I think there's a lot of people around that believe in the things I believe in, believe in diversity and equality.\"\n\nWhen asked about issues in the US during the Australian Open, Gauff called for \"more peace and kindness\" in America.\n\nCompatriot Madison Keys championed immigrants and the diversity they have brought to the US, saying she hopes the country \"can come together\".\n\nTeam GB skier Gus Kenworthy, who grew up in America, said he has received death threats after posting an anti-ICE message on social media.\n\nSpeaking at the Winter Olympics, freestyle skier Hunter Hess added that \"just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US\", and President Trump responded by calling him a \"real loser\".\n\nBea Kim said the US is \"very divided\" but \"diversity is what makes us a very strong country\", while fellow snowboarder Maddie Mastro said she is \"saddened with what's happening at home. I feel like we can't turn a blind eye to that.\"\n\nChloe Kim, a silver medalist in Milan-Cortina, feels that athletes should be \"allowed to voice our opinions on what's going on. And I think that we need to lead with love and compassion.\"\n\nGauff says she feels confident giving honest answers when asked about politics, partly because of her maternal grandmother.\n\nYvonne Lee Odom helped desegregate public schools in the 1960s, becoming the first black student to attend public school in Delray Beach, Florida.\n\n\"My grandma is literally an activist,\" Gauff added. \"This is literally my life.

    "fullText": "Freestyle skier Kirsty Muir once again came heartbreakingly close to a Winter Olympic medal for Team GB with her second fourth-place finish of the Games.\n\nCompeting in the big air, Muir scored a combined 174.75 points from her best two runs, 3.5 points shy of Italian bronze medallist Flora Tabanelli.\n\nIt comes exactly a week after the 21-year-old missed out on slopestyle bronze by just 0.41 points.\n\nCanada's Megan Oldham won gold with China's defending champion Eileen Gu - competing in a big air competition for the first time since winning the Olympic title four years ago - settling for silver this time.\n\n\"I'm really proud of myself for putting the two tricks down that I did, and also going for it in that third run because I've never landed that trick before,\" Muir, competing at her second Games, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I just had to go for it, and yes I crashed out, but I'm still proud of myself.\"\n\nThe final had been delayed by more than an hour after a heavy blizzard set in at Livigno Snow Park, while Mathilde Gremaud, a big favourite for a medal, was one of two Swiss skiers to withdraw last-minute through injury.\n\nThat looked to have opened up the field for Muir, who had qualified in fourth for the final.\n\nBut in an astonishing first round, four skiers posted scores of 90.00 points or more, with Muir languishing in seventh and knowing she needed to go big.\n\nShe did just that, posting 93.00 with a 1620 trick, featuring four and a half rotations, the highest score of the second run and one that catapulted her up the standings into silver medal position.\n\nAt that point Gu, already a silver medallist in the slopestyle at these Games, was way off the pace having struggled with her second attempt, but she made amends on her final jump to bump Muir down into third.\n\nThe Chinese star - the fourth-highest paid female athlete in the world - celebrated like her medal was confirmed at that point, despite plenty of skiers waiting in the wings to nudge her off the podium.\n\nAs it proved, they couldn't do that, though Tabanelli's final jump of 94.25 points - the biggest score of the night - came just 0.75 points shy of silver medal position.\n\nThat piled the pressure on Muir's third and final jump.\n\nShe took her time at the top of the big air structure, talking through her options with her coach and decided to go for another 1620 trick with a different grab, but ultimately could not land her effort, leaving her lost in her thoughts of what might have been as she sat on the snow.\n\n\"When the scores came in for the other girls, I knew I had to give it something really, really good to try and get on that podium, so I'm stoked that I did try that,\" she said.\n\nGB men's curlers' semi-final hopes on line after shock defeat\n\nGB slalom legend Ryding bids farewell to Olympics\n\nIt marks an agonising fifth fourth-place finish for Team GB at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, with time running out to hit the minimum target of four medals set before the Games by UK Sport.\n\nIn addition to Muir's two near-misses, snowboarder Mia Brookes finished fourth in the big air, while the same position was reached by Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds in the mixed doubles curling, and Marcus Wyatt and Freya Tarbit in the mixed team skeleton.\n\nBrookes had been expected to contest for the medals in Tuesday's slopestyle final but failed to qualify, while both GB's men's and women's rinks face uphill battles to reach the semi-finals in their respective curling finals.\n\nHigh hopes remain with freestyle skier Zoe Atkin, who is the current halfpipe world champion. She starts her campaign with qualifying on Thursday, with the final set to take place on Saturday.\n\nShould GB reach the target of five, the team would equal its record haul from a Winter Olympics, achieved at both the 2014 and 2018 Games.\n\nBut even if it doesn't, these Olympics should still be seen as a success for the nation.\n\nSo far, three gold medals have been won, a historic achievement given Team GB had never before won more than one at a single Games.\n\nThat total includes a first Olympic gold on snow, from Huw Nightingale and Charlotte Bankes in the mixed team snowboard cross, in addition to double gold from Matt Weston in the skeleton, the second of those coming in the mixed team event with Tabby Stoecker.\n\nWhy first gold on snow has been just a matter of time\n\nWhy are Team GB so good at skeleton?\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "“The claim that the commanders who were attacked yesterday in Bnei Brak arrived in order to distribute recruitment flyers in the city is incorrect,\" IDF Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said.\n\nThe IDF spokesperson said the police were incorrect in an official response on Monday to an attempt by Tel Aviv police to circulate a report claiming that the female soldiers who arrived in Bnei Brak on Sunday were distributing flyers.\n\n“The claim that the commanders who were attacked yesterday in Bnei Brak arrived in order to distribute recruitment flyers in the city is incorrect. The commanders arrived for a home visit to a pre-draft candidate prior to enlistment,” said IDF Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin in the statement.\n\nThe IDF is angered by what it describes as the police’s attempt to justify a problematic statement by Tel Aviv District Commander Haim Sargrof, who claimed that the army should have coordinated the entry of the female soldiers into Bnei Brak with the police.\n\nThe IDF said that the leaflets in the soldiers’ possession were merely an informational booklet given to every recruit to the Havat Hashomer base, containing basic information about the enlistment process and details about the equipment recruits are required to bring on their draft day.\n\nA military source said, “We do not know why the police are behaving this way. They acted disrespectfully toward the IDF, leaked the soldiers’ testimonies to the media in order to smear army commanders, and now they are releasing inaccurate information about the soldiers’ conduct in Bnei Brak. We would expect the police to act with a bit more maturity and to take responsibility for their conduct, and for statements made by their commanders.”",

    "fullText": "A storm system moving across Southern California brought rain to the desert and snow to the nearby mountains Monday, Feb. 16, with more precipitation expected over the next couple days.\n\nCloudy skies and steady rain arrived around midday in western parts of the Coachella Valley, with cooler temperatures than in recent days.\n\n“We’re kind of seeing the brunt of (the storms) move through at the moment,” Chandler Price, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s San Diego office, said Monday afternoon.\n\n“After that, we’re going to get showers through tomorrow (Tuesday) morning, then lightening up mid-to-late morning, then probably like 10 hours of sort of clear skies before the next (system) comes roaring in late Tuesday into early Wednesday,” he added.\n\nAs of about 3 p.m. Monday, the Palm Springs International Airport had recorded 0.10 inches of rainfall, while in the mid-valley, Thousand Palms had seen 0.12 inches.\n\nTo the east, Indian Palms Country Club in Indio had recorded just a trace of rain — 0.02 inches — as of Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Riverside area had seen a wider range of rainfall totals as of 3 p.m.\n\nThe northern side of Riverside had recorded about 0.15 inches of rainfall, while Jurupa Valley, located just west of Riverside, had seen 0.57 inches so far.\n\n“It’s a pretty big range there (in Riverside),” Price said.\n\nIn the nearby San Jacinto and San Gorgonio mountains, a winter storm warning is in effect until noon Wednesday, with the areas potentially seeing up to 3 feet of snow at higher elevation levels.\n\n“Travel could be very difficult to impossible,” the weather service said in its winter weather advisory. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday evening and Tuesday morning commutes. Very strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.”\n\nPrice said snow was starting to cover the roads in the Idyllwild-Pine Cove area above 6,000 feet as of Monday afternoon, but he added the weather service did not yet have exact precipitation totals.\n\nThe Big Bear area was also seeing snowfall Monday afternoon, though exact totals were not yet available. At a slightly lower elevation than Big Bear, Lake Arrowhead had recorded 2 inches of rain as of 3 p.m.\n\nPrice said Palm Springs could see another tenth of an inch of rain through Tuesday morning, with less precipitation expected in the central and southern parts of the valley.\n\nRiverside and the rest of the Inland Empire will likely see higher precipitation levels, potentially up to an inch through early Wednesday.\n\n“It’s really going to start dying down after 6 a.m. Wednesday, and then by noon, we’re looking at completely dry (conditions),” Price said.\n\nOvernight lows will stay in the 40s throughout most of Riverside County this week.\n\nAnother system could hit the region Thursday, potentially bringing more rain to the Inland Empire, though Price said it will likely be weaker than the storms earlier in the week.\n\nCity News Service contributed to this report.\n\nTom Coulter is a reporter for The Desert Sun.

    "description": "\"This amendment creates a narrow, commonsense check to ensure the pardon power is used fairly and responsibly regardless of who occupies the White House\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn before departing the White House, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, in Washington. \n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-NE) signed on Monday to co-sponsor a Democrat-led bill to amend the U.S. Constitution to give Congress oversight of presidential pardons, a measure aimed at pushing back at President Donald Trump’s highly controversial use of the presidential pardon power.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Rep. Johnny Olszewski (D-MD) last December and would allow for a minimum of 20 House members and five senators to call for congressional review of a pardon, which would lead to a 60-day deadline for Congress to nullify that pardon with a two-thirds majority vote – similar to a veto override.\n\nOlszewski announced his bill, the Pardon Integrity Act, in a floor speech listing off some of Trump’s most controversial pardons, including a blanket pardon for all January 6th rioters – including those who violently attacked police officers.\n\n“None of us should accept it as normal practice that a president, any president, used their executive pardon power to absolve convicted drug kingpins, those found guilty of violently attacking law enforcement officers, and even a money laundering crypto magnate with ties to the president’s family business,” Olszewski said in his speech, adding:\n\nYet, this is exactly what President Trump did. On his first day back in office, President Trump pardoned 1,500 people involved in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Since then, he’s pardoned or commuted the sentences of nearly 90 others. Just recently, he added former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to that list. Hernandez was serving a 45-year prison sentence for conspiring to smuggle more than 400 tons or 4.5 billion doses of cocaine into the US. Hernandez was also convicted of accepting bribes from violent drug cartel members to fuel his political career, shielding them from prosecution in exchange for their bribes\n\nOlszewski announced Bacon joining his bill, writing, “The Constitution does not give any president the authority to place themselves above the law. I’m proud to have Congressman Bacon join this effort, because safeguarding democracy and upholding justice should never be a partisan issue. When the pardon power is abused to protect criminals and political allies, Congress has a responsibility to act.”\n\nNo more get out of jail free cards for the wealthy and well-connected. pic.twitter.com/kcwDB3RSjy\n\n— Rep. Johnny Olszewski (@RepJohnnyO) December 19, 2025\n\n“This amendment creates a narrow, commonsense check to ensure the pardon power is used fairly and responsibly regardless of who occupies the White House,” he added.\n\nBacon, a former Air Force general who is not seeking reelection in his swing district, added, “Presidential pardons are an important constitutional authority, but like all powers held by the executive branch, these authorities benefit from the appropriate checks and balances the Constitution envisioned. Across multiple administrations, we’ve seen legitimate questions raised about how this authority has been used at the same time, the ability of Congress to provide oversight has weakened.\n\n“Frankly, it is clear to me the pardon authority has been abused. I’m pleased to cosponsor Rep. Olszewski’s Pardon Integrity Act, a constitutional amendment that establishes a narrow, commonsense guardrail that preserves the pardon power while ensuring Congress can fulfill its constitutional role to provide accountability and uphold the rule of law,” concluded Bacon in a statement. Bacon’s support for the measure followed Trump’s pardon of several NFL players who had been convicted of various crimes, including drug trafficking.\n\nBacon is also behind a bipartisan bill to return the power to levy tariffs solely to Congress, adhering to the original wording of the Constitution.\n\nThe post Republican Joins With Dems on Constitutional Amendment to Give Congress Power to Reject Trump Pardons first appeared on Mediaite.",
