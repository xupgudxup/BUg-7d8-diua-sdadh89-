    "fullText": "Justin Allgaier took 100% of the blame for the big wreck that happened during Lap 124 of the Daytona 500 on Sunday. Denny Hamlin, too, was involved in the incident and admitted graciously on Actions Detrimental that 20% of the blame belonged to him. The wreck collected 20 drivers and changed the dynamics of the race altogether.\n\nAllgaier was the race leader at the time of the wreck and Hamlin had been running behind him. There was just enough space for Hamlin to get by Allgaier and the veteran went for it with a push from behind. Just as he was about to pass, Allgaier pulled a late block and ended up turning both of them to the inside. Several cars behind them choked up as well.\n\nHamlin said on his podcast that what he made was definitely an aggressive move. But he also stood ground that he was going to take every opportunity he got to take the lead and that he had made up his mind 100 yards before actually making the move that he was going to do it. He also clarified that there would have been enough space for him on the outside had Allgaier not moved up.\n\nHe went on to explain, “My 20% is that he didn’t have a whole lot of time for him to react or see that it was coming.” Now knowing what the outcome of his attempt is, there are things that Hamlin would have done differently.\n\n“We were running 10 miles an hour faster than him at the time because of the push we got,” he said. “It would have caused a huge domino effect had I just checked up and not taken it. Or I could just gone to the bottom and probably cleared him doing it. All over again, had I known what the result was gonna be, I would have just stayed in line for a few more laps.”\n\nHamlin ended the race in an underwhelming 31st position. Allgaier ended up with a disappointing DNF in what was his second Daytona 500 start for JR Motorsports. He’d told the press after the race that he would have rather it be someone else’s fault than his own. But he did take up the responsbility completely and explain why he did what he did.\n\n“But you can only do the things you know at 100%, and I did that and it didn’t work out,” he said. “I hate it for everyone else, right, but I’ll stand here and take the blame square on my shoulders.” He will find a bit of ease knowing that Hamlin has taken a bit of the weight off him.\n\nThe post Denny Hamlin Admits He Is Also in the Wrong for Justin Allgaier Incident at Daytona 500 appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "College basketball analyst Seth Greenberg went off on the Kansas State Wildcats for how they handled the firing of head coach Jerome Tang.",
    "fullText": "Seth Greenberg takes shot at Kansas State Wildcats after Jerome Tang firing appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Kansas State Wildcats’ decision to fire basketball head coach Jerome Tang is garnering serious criticism from the likes of Seth Greenberg.\n\nKansas State made the decision to fire Tang after four seasons, having hired him in 2022. The athletics department stated they had cause to fire the head coach midseason, per ESPN’s college sports insider Pete Thamel.\n\n“Kansas State is firing Jerome Tang for cause. They’ve informed him of this formally tonight. The basis for the for cause firing is language in his contract that references any activity that brings “public disrepute, embarrassment, ridicule” to Kansas State,” Thamel wrote.\n\nGreenberg made a Feb. 17 appearance on ESPN’s SportsCenter. He called out the Wildcats’ reasoning for letting go of Tang, citing it was the lack of wins that led to the firing, not for his actual conduct and behavior.\n\n“The university said his behavior was embarrassing. To me, the university’s behavior is embarrassing. The athletic director’s behavior is embarrassing,” Greenberg said.\n\n“Jerome Tang, he made mistakes. He made mistakes in his roster construction. He made mistakes in terms of how maybe he handled this team. But one thing he didn’t do, he didn’t deserve to be fired with cause; he’s getting fired because he did not win enough games.”\n\nSeth Greenberg on Kansas State firing Jerome Tang for cause: “The university said his behavior was embarrassing. To me, the university’s behavior is embarrassing. The athletic director’s behavior is embarrassing… He didn’t deserve to be fired with cause…” pic.twitter.com/6FQvP3UVfI\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) February 16, 2026\n\nSeth Greenberg is right to question Kansas State’s approach to its decision. Regardless, Jerome Tang will be looking for a new team next season.\n\nMaking the Elite Eight of the 2023 NCAA Tournament and the NIT the following year, Tang suffered back-to-back losing campaigns since. Throughout his four years with the Wildcats, he finished with a 71-57 overall record. This includes a 29-39 display throughout the team’s matchups in conference play.\n\nKansas State has a 10-15 overall record on the season, going 1-11 in its Big 12 matchups so far. They are close to the bottom of the Big 12 standings, having a tiebreaker advantage over the Utah Utes while trailing the Baylor Bears and the Colorado Buffaloes.\n\nGoing through six consecutive losses, the Wildcats will hope to return to the win column in their next matchup. They host the Bears as tip-off will take place on Feb. 17 at 9 p.m. ET.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Anastasia Kucherova, a Russian living in Milan, voiced her opposition to Russia’s war against Ukraine with a highly symbolic, if anonymous, act: Carrying the Ukraine team placard during the opening ceremony of the Milan Cortina Winter Games.\n\nKucherova was swathed in a long, hooded silver puffer coat, her eyes covered with dark glasses — like all the other placard bearers for the 92 nations competing in the Olympics. The Ukraine sign was illuminated for the crowd to read.\n\nAt first the country assignments were going to be random, but later the choreographer asked if the volunteers had preferences, and Kucherova chose Ukraine.\n\nKucherova, an architect who has been living in Milan for 14 years, was unrecognizable, and her nationality was not announced to the public when she led the five Ukrainian athletes competing in Milan into San Siro stadium to resounding cheers.\n\nShe first revealed her role to her 879 Instagram followers and then in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\n“When you walk by the side of these people you realize they have every human right to feel hatred towards any Russian,’’ she told the AP on Monday. “Still, I think it’s important to do even a small action to show them that maybe not all the people are thinking the same way.\"\n\nFor Kucherova, speaking about her small act of resistance on the second anniversary of the poisoning death of dissident Alexei Navalny is a way of reminding the world that the war continues, even as life elsewhere goes on.\n\n“Ukrainians don’t have any possibility to avoid these thoughts or to ignore the existence of war. So it is their reality. They keep loving each other, getting married or doing sports, coming to the Olympics. But all of this is happening (against) a devastating background.”\n\nWithout being told that Kucherova was Russian, the athletes immediately recognized her origins and addressed her in Russian. That was a sign for Kucherova of “some profound connection” between Russians and Ukrainians “that obviously could live on if not for the war.”\n\nThe Milan delegation was led by flag bearer Yelyzaveta Sydorko, a short track speedskater, and included figure skater Kyrylo Marsak. Both athletes have fathers who are fighting on the front lines in a war that is nearing its fourth anniversary.\n\n“There is literally no word you can say that can undo the harm that these people have already suffered, and there is no word that can come in close to forgiveness,’’ said Kucherova.\n\nRight before walking into the stadium, “I turned around — I didn’t know what to say to them — but I just said that the entire stadium is going to give them the standing ovation.’’ The Ukrainians appeared skeptical, she said.\n\nWhen the cheers came, Kucherova said it felt like the entire stadium was “recognizing their independence, recognizing their will for freedom, their courage in making it all the way to the Olympics.”\n\nShe cried, silently, behind her glasses.\n\nKucherova hasn't visited Russia since 2018, but understands that she is taking a risk by defying the regime.\n\n“I have to be worried about this, and I’m supposed to be scared about this. And I cannot guarantee that me speaking out will not harm any people I know,’’ she said. “But what I think is that if I, living in a democratic country and enjoying all the freedoms, if I am scared, this means that the regime has won.”\n\nKucherova held the sign for another delegation, Denmark, which also received a rousing ovation for that nation's resistance of U.S. threats to take over Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.\n\n“Yes, this is a coincidence, but I pondered over it,” Kucherova said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Las Vegas Raiders coach Klint Kubiak does not want to lose defensive end Maxx Crosby in his first stint with the team.",
    "fullText": "Raiders’ Klint Kubiak making strategic moves to win over Maxx Crosby appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders are facing another offseason filled with uncertainties despite the hiring of coach Klint Kubiak. Arguably, the biggest question is: Will Maxx Crosby remain with the Silver and Black?\n\nCrosby has been at the center of trade rumors following another atrocious campaign by the Raiders, which saw them win only three games and miss the playoffs for the fourth straight season.\n\nAt this point, the star defensive end’s future in Las Vegas is teetering. But according to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Kubiak is making strategic moves to entice the five-time Pro Bowler to stay.\n\n“Klint Kubiak comes in, and one of the first things he does is he goes and gets a cup of coffee the other morning with Maxx Crosby. My understanding is that the breakfast went really well, that there was a good rapport between Klint Kubiak and Maxx Crosby. But that nothing really materially changed,” said Breer on his show.\n\n“Now, since then, Kubiak has decided to name Rob Leonard, who was the defensive line coach and the run team coordinator last year, Maxx Crosby’s position coach, the new defensive coordinator of the Raiders. So could that move the needle? We’ll see.”\n\nIn March, the Raiders signed the 28-year-old Crosby to a three‑year extension worth $106.5, making him the highest‑paid non‑quarterback in league history, further underscoring his importance to the team.\n\nYet a season later, the relationship between the team and its cornerstone defender appears to have frayed. For a guy as competitive as Crosby, being on a losing team must be extremely frustrating. He, however, has also discussed the importance of loyalty, stating that he wants to build something with the Raiders.\n\nWhile Crosby has largely dismissed the trade rumors, Kubiak, who replaced Pete Carroll, should not be complacent and ensure that the two-time All-Pro will stay in Sin City.",

    "description": "This one started as an interesting game and ended as an absolute tour de force for the Blue Devils.",
    "fullText": "Syracuse kept up with Duke for about the first 11 1/2 minutes but after that it was all Duke in a 101-64 blowout.\n\nFor the first few minutes, Syracuse did play well and to their credit they competed hard throughout. But Duke was just much, much better in this one.\n\nCameron Boozer had a double-double – in the first half. And arguably, he was the second-best player for Duke in that half, behind Isaiah Evans.\n\nDuke dominated in nearly every facet. Although the Blue Devils started slow from outside, that changed as the game went on. And they dominated around the basket despite William Kyle’s best efforts at controlling the lane.\n\nBoozer and Evans were particularly difficult for Syracuse to control. Boozer finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds while Evans racked up 21.\n\nEvans in particular showed a lot of growth and toughness. He’s a long way from the three-point specialist he was as a freshman. He drove the lane, he faked, he muscled around the basket. It was a really solid performance on his part.\n\nYou know who else was incredibly impressive? Dame Sarr.\n\nThat guy is turning into an unbelievable defender. He’s been so aggressive that the crowd is actually oohing and aahhing over how he’s just smothering guys on defense. It’s pretty unusual to see someone who is that quick on defense and he’s 6-7. When he’s on, what can you do? He’s emerging as a devastating defender.\n\nPat Ngongba has had some erratic performances this year, notably at Louisville and UNC. Not this time.\n\nNgongba finished with 12 points and 7 rebounds and was aggressive inside without getting into foul trouble.\n\nCaleb Foster didn’t score much – just one three – but he ran the team well. He also had no turnovers. Here’s an incredibly impressive stat, by the way: Duke had just 4 turnovers all game.\n\nMaliq Brown, Nik Khamenia and Cayden Boozer were all great off the bench. Brown did his usual things – defending guys in ways they could never expect and scoring and passing efficiently. He finished with 6 points and 5 assists and several surprises for the Orange.\n\nAs for Khamenia, this was a really good game from him. He finished with 14 points on 5-7/3-3 from the floor and played with immense confidence, which was great to see. In his last few games he’s seemed to lack that at times. He was a huge factor.\n\nHe’s emerged as a steady player and one who tends to make particularly smart plays in winning time. Those won’t always show up in a box score, but they still count. He gets those plays right an amazing number of times.\n\nCheck out his stat line here: 12 points on 5-6/2-3 from the floor, with 1 rebound, 4 assists, 0 turnovers and 3 steals.\n\nIn the end, Syracuse played hard and never quit, but the lead just kept growing. Soon after the half, it swelled past 20, then past 25 and ultimately to 37 by the end.\n\nThere’s just not a lot to pick over here. Could Duke have been better at the line? Yeah, that might be a problem in a tighter game. The Blue Devils shot just 13-20 (65%). However, of those 7 misses, Sarr missed all 4 of his attempts, which skews things a bit.\n\nIn general, this game was a Cameron thrill ride, especially in the second half. Everyone played well and more importantly, played well together.\n\nNow it’s on to Michigan Saturday, and that game is going to be really interesting and a great stress test for both teams.\n\nNotes – William Kyle also missed all four of his free throw attempts and he may have the ugliest form we’ve ever seen…he’s tall and athletic but other than blocking shots and dunking, he hasn’t leveraged it much…Cameron Sheffield got in late and got a three and a rebound…Duke’s bigs got 9 assists between them…Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel and Khaman Maluach were all in attendance, as was Steve Wojciechowski, among other former Blue Devils…Syracuse is now 15-12 and a 37-point loss will cause more hot-seat talk for Adrian Autry…Nate Kingz had a tough childhood…he’s an easy guy to pull for and we hope he keeps rising…JJ Starling shot just 3-13…Duke and Sarr harassed Naithan George into 4 turnovers…\n\nNo. 3 Duke men’s basketball rides season-high shooting clip to 101-64 win over Syracuse\n\nNo. 3 Duke Blitzes Syracuse in Second Half for 101-64 Win – Duke University\n\n5 observations from No. 3 Duke men’s basketball’s first half against Syracuse\n\nCooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel in Attendance As Jon Scheyer’s Duke Runs Up 101 vs Syracuse\n\nCameron Boozer joins elite company as Duke dominates Syracuse\n\nCameron Boozer epitomizes difference between Syracuse and Duke\n\nDuke HC Jon Scheyer reveals major key behind Syracuse blowout\n\nAdrian Autry discusses Syracuse’s loss to Duke\n\nSyracuse trailed by 5 late in the 1st half.

    "fullText": "MITCHELL, S.D. (KELO) — The class ‘A’ state gymnastics meet was held on Friday in Mitchell. The race for the crown came down to just a few points as a familiar name continued its dominant run.\n\nThe Redhawks entered Friday’s team competition as the three-time defending state champs. That placed a target on their back, but the team was able to fight through the pressure.\n\n“Our team was just rallied behind each other and having a good time. We were doing our things and hitting our routines,” Johnson said. “That’s all we could ask for.”\n\nEstelline/Hendricks claimed a fourth straight title, edging out Parkston/Ethan/Hanson/Mt. Vernon by less than three points.\n\n“Very relieved, very happy and very proud of our team. We had a lot of injuries and it was very hard for everybody to forget about that and work as hard as we can, but we did,” Hausman said.\n\n“I’m feeling so excited. We did a lot of hard work and it’s just so relieving to get here,” Hartung said.\n\nSherri Johnson is in her eighth year as the Estelline/Hendricks head coach. She says all seasons are special, but this one will standout.\n\n“Just the adversity that we went through and just to call on some kids that had to step up,” Johnson said. “It was a whole team effort to get there. It gave me chills, and I had tears my eyes.”\n\nThe Redhawks have 20 athletes on their roster, 15 of which are freshman or younger, but that’s one of Coach Johnson’s favorite parts of the sport.\n\n“That’s the great thing that I love about gymnastics is you get them in seventh grade and you get to keep them until 12th,” Johnson said. “You’re a family and they’re like your own daughters.”\n\nThe Redhawks found success in the individual competiton on Saturday. Hausman claimed first place, while Hartung earned third.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 league year is coming next month. It officially begins on March 11, with the legal negotiating period beginning on March 9.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have many roster decisions to make before then.\n\nLeading up to the new league year, we will profile every player on the roster, go over what they did last season, what their contract status is and what they face in 2026.\n\nNext up is quarterback Jacoby Brissett.\n\nBrissett joined the Cardinals on a two-year contract last offseason to be Kyler Murray's backup.\n\nHe ended up being the Cardinals' No. 1 quarterback after Murray's foot injury. He started 12 games, went 1-11 and 0-9 in the final nine games, but he had a career year.\n\nHe completed 64.9% of his passes for 3,366 yards, 23 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He set career-highs in passing yards and touchdown passes.\n\nBrissett is signed through 2026. He will make $4.9 million salary and a $2 million bonus. He will count nearly $9.2 million against the salary cap.\n\nWhile the biggest question of the offseason is about Kyler Murray, another very important question is what the Cardinals expect from Brissett in 2026? Will he enter the season as the starter after going 1-11 as a starter and not playing well in any high-leverage situation? Will he be happy returning to a backup role? Does new head coach Mike LaFleur want him?\n\nBrissett might actually have the better trade value between him and Murray because Brissett's contract is very reasonable, especially if a team needs someone who can start.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Manchester United are reportedly exploring a possible summer move for Athletic Club winger Nico Williams.\n\nAccording to a report from TeamTalk, United have already held talks regarding the Spain international.\n\nThe update suggests that the 23-year-old’s name is being discussed as the club looks ahead to potential attacking additions for the next transfer window.\n\nThe situation is seen as a major opportunity, with Williams described as a forward who could add a new dynamic in wide areas.\n\nThe same report references a valuation of £87m, underlining the scale of any deal should United decide to move beyond initial contacts.\n\nWilliams has long been linked with Premier League clubs, and he is positioned as a high-upside target.\n\nWayne Rooney has previously been unequivocal about the winger’s ceiling, comparing his style to Cristiano Ronaldo’s early years.\n\nThe former United striker wrote: “Williams, for me, is exceptional. He reminds me of Cristiano Ronaldo when Cristiano was young.”\n\nRooney added: “He’s a big lad, he’ll take the ball and sometimes tries too much but usually makes the right decisions.”\n\nHe continued: “He is an incredible threat in one-on-one situations and scores goals as well.”\n\nWhile recruitment planning intensifies behind the scenes, United’s immediate focus remains on a return to Premier League action at the Hill Dickinson Stadium when they face Everton away on Monday, 23 February.\n\nWith the season entering a decisive stretch, it remains to be seen whether the report develops into a formal approach.\n\nFor now, the latest claim simply places Williams on the list of wide forwards being discussed, with Rooney’s Ronaldo comparison serving as a reminder of the level United would be aiming to add.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "What's next for Tyreek Hill after his release from the Dolphins? Keep an eye on Chiefs and Bills",
    "description": "Tyreek Hill is now a free agent for the first time in his career.",
    "fullText": "Tyreek Hill is officially a free agent, putting him in an unfamiliar position for the first time in his career.\n\nSo, what’s next for the star wide receiver?\n\nThe Miami Dolphins officially released Hill on Monday, ending a four-season run in which the franchise bet big on him being a key piece to pair with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Ultimately, that didn’t work out. The Dolphins failed to win a single playoff game during his time in South Florida, continuing a drought that dates back to the 2000 season.\n\nHill went down with a devastating knee injury early this past season, too, including a dislocated knee. Hill’s agent said Monday that he’s “progressing well” in his rehab and will be ready to play at some point next season, and Hill vowed to return.\n\nBut who is in play for Hill next season? Yahoo Sports’ “Inside Coverage” podcast discussed a couple of possibilities Monday.\n\n\"He still has that speed. Even if he's 80% of what he was, he's still going to be one of the faster players in the NFL,\" Yahoo Sports senior betting analyst Ben Fawkes said. \"So I think he can be a useful piece for a contender, but also at what price is the big question too.\"\n\nThe first landing spot is obvious. The Chiefs are the easiest match for Hill because his career began in Kansas City, and he won a Super Bowl ring there. He appeared to give a nod of approval on social media of the Chiefs' recent re-hiring of Eric Bieniemy as offensive coordinator.\n\nBut Hill’s usage in Kansas City may not be what he’s used to.\n\n\"Is [Hill] willing to accept a lesser role if that's what he is right now? Let's say the Chiefs, right? Well, is he their No. 1 [wideout]? No, that's probably Rasheed Rice, who has his own set of baggage,” Yahoo Sports NFL senior reporter Frank Schwab said. “And is he their speed guy? Well, no, that's probably Xavier Worthy. What role is he willing to accept? How much money is he willing to accept?\"\n\nThere are, naturally, a lot of questions to be answered there. But Hill would be a solid weapon for the Chiefs, who just missed the playoffs for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nBuffalo appears hellbent on doing just about anything possible to help lift quarterback Josh Allen over the postseason hump and to a Super Bowl. That included jettisoning a successful head coach in Sean McDermott in favor of offensive coordinator Joe Brady earlier this offseason.\n\nHill could be an easy add for a team needing an extra option. Khalil Shakir was their leading receiver last year with just 719 receiving yards, while tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox were second and third.\n\n\"They need that veteran piece,\" podcast host Andrew Siciliano. \"They need that deep threat. They need a guy who down the field — I'm sorry, Brandin Cooks — can attack that football or just run away from the guy closest to him. So he doesn't have to have a contested catch there to win a playoff game in Denver.\"\n\nThe Chargers could be a great fit for Hill for multiple reasons. He’d get to pair up with Justin Herbert, who has statistically been a top tier quarterback during his first six seasons in the league even if the team has struggled at times. The Chargers have plenty of money to pay Hill, too, as they’re sitting with the third-most salary cap space in the league this offseason.\n\nOh, and Mike McDaniel is now the Chargers’ offensive coordinator after he was fired by the Dolphins earlier this offseason. Reuniting with his former head coach on the other side of the country feels like it would make things even easier for Hill coming off of his injury.\n\nSure, the Patriots reached Super Bowl LX this past season. But something was missing, and that was very evident in the final game as the Seahawks cruised to the dominant win in the Bay Area.\n\nHill could easily step into New England and help young quarterback Drake Maye as he enters his third season in the league. Pairing Hill with fellow star Stefon Diggs, who racked up 1,013 receiving yards last season, and tight end Hunter Henry, might just be the boost the team needs to get over the hump.\n\nNow this may not be Hill's first choice, considering the state of the Raiders in recent years. But there are plenty of reasons why it would work.\n\nThe Raiders are under new leadership once again this season with Klint Kubiak coming in as their head coach. The franchise has the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, too, which they will presumably use on Indiana quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza. Getting Mendoza a veteran like Hill right away in his career, along with young running back Ashton Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers, would be huge early on in his career.\n\nOh, and the Raiders have money to spend. That'd be nice for Hill, too.",

    "fullText": "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has doubled down on some Chelsea transfer news regarding striker Nicolas Jackson.\n\nThe Blues player is currently on loan at Bayern Munich for the season, but it has become pretty clear that they will not be signing him in the summer when his loan deal runs out, and he will return back to Chelsea.\n\nBut does that mean he now has a chance of coming back into the Chelsea squad and in the thinking of new manager Liam Rosenior? Well, anything can happen in this game, but Romano still doesn’t think Jackson will, despite reports from Germany yesterday suggesting that Jackson could now move forward and stay with Chelsea into next season and beyond.\n\nRomano was always adamant that Jackson was leaving Chelsea before the summer of 2025 and that there was no way he would be staying at the club. So this paints the picture that his Chelsea story is over, and now he’s doubling down on that.\n\nNicolas Jackson playing for Bayern. (Photo by Adam Pretty/Getty Images)\n\nIn words cited on X last night, Romano said on Nicolas Jackson:\n\n“Remember Chelsea already signed a striker for the summer, [Emmanuel] Emegha, who is similar in terms of skills to Jackson, so that’s a point. Of course a change of manager means a possibility [Nicolas] Jackson stays, but my understanding is that it’s expected that different opportunities on the market will be explored, rather than staying.”\n\nChelsea tried to stop his loan move to Bayern when Liam Delap got injured but the striker point blankly refused to come back. It would SHOCK me if they could all move forward together now!",

    "fullText": "China is a huge market for the NBA, and that is nothing new. Among the league’s international audiences, few countries can go toe to toe with the second-most populous nation in the world. Because of that, the NBA makes sure to establish its presence on the ground every single year. The face of the league, LeBron James, understands this as well.\n\nJames has been to China 15 times so far for his Nike promo tour. It’s also not been that long since his last visit, with the King traveling to China as recently as 2025 to promote his “Forever King” tour, to promote his LeBron 23 shoes. Was it also a farewell visit? One last visit to China?\n\nNot according to James, who, during media availability at All-Star Weekend, admitted that he would like to make another trip to the East.\n\n“To all my fans and people over there it’s always been great,” James stated. “Always welcomed me and my friends and family in open arms. I’ve always appreciated it, they’re be another opportunity for me to go over there at some point.”\n\nJames has remained coy on his relationship with China over the years. He found himself in hot water in 2019 when he went against Daryl Morey’s statement on China.\n\n“I don’t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.”\n\nSince then James has returned to China on a semi-regular basis as he did before the incident as well. So, it’s safe to say he’s welcome in the country to quite a fair extent.\n\nEven if James retires from the NBA after the 2025-26 season, as some believe he will, Nike, which has supported him throughout his career, would still look to capitalize on his popularity in China. Both James and the iconic American brand remain hugely popular there, despite the political tensions between the two countries.\n\nAt the same time, it looks as though James has another country in his mind he would love to visit. And that’s Israel.\n\nIn the same presser in L.A., James was asked about his thoughts on the Middle-Eastern country, and his reply showed that he really wanted to go there. “If I have fans over there — I’ve never been there — I hope you follow my career, I hope I inspire people over there.”\n\n“Not only to be great in sports, but to be better in general in life, hopefully someday I can make it over there,” the Lakers icon added. “I’ve heard great things and I appreciate the question.”\n\nFor now, though, James cannot travel anywhere that far from home. Crunch time in the season is here with the All-Star break nearly over, and his focus is solely on possibly ending his career with a fifth ring.\n\nThe post LeBron James Admits To Wanting To Visit China “At Some Point” appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "“I really do hope that moving forward, the void that Kristjaan Speakman leaves won’t lead to instability”.",
    "fullText": "If the confirmation and timing of Kristjaan Speakman’s Sunderland departure took many people by surprise when it was confirmed on Friday afternoon, the only thing more worthy of animated discussion than his legacy at Sunderland was what his exit might lead to — as well as the precedent the departure of such a notable figure in our recent history might set.\n\nDid he get everything right during his five-year spell at the Stadium of Light? Of course not.\n\nDid he occasionally make decisions on recruitment which were unpopular and sometimes misguided, as well as leaving people frustrated at his public statements? Yes.\n\nDid the end — that of gaining a place in the Premier League — justify the means? Without a doubt, and for what it’s worth, I always felt his comments in the media were lost to print as in reality, he’s a calm, measured and effective speaker — something I certainly noticed during his appearance at a fan forum following the appointment of Régis Le Bris.\n\nTime will be very kind to Speakman’s legacy on Wearside but with Florent Ghisolfi now at the helm and a key component of our recent structure gone, it’ll be a new version of Sunderland AFC that tackles the remainder of the campaign and Le Bris may find himself being judged by a different set of standards as a result — something I do feel could potentially be hazardous.\n\nI really do hope that moving forward, the void that Speakman leaves won’t lead to instability, a lack of forward planning and the kind of uncertainty that we need to avoid at any and all costs. Much has been made of the ambition of Kyril Louis-Dreyfus and his willingness to make bold calls in order to ensure continued progress, but I also think a note of caution should be sounded.\n\n“Ruthlessness” — however it may manifest itself — in footballing circles is often dangerous and as we see with some of the frankly cartoonish dismissals and panicked appointments made in the Premier League, flexing your muscles as an owner (occasionally to rectify a mistake that should never have been made) can be riddled with potential pitfalls.\n\nTaking what often appeared to be a cold, iron-clad approach to hiring and firing might’ve worked for Chelsea when Roman Abramovich’s rubles were keeping the Blues on the leading edge of dominance, but we’re different — or we should be — and I would hate to think that Speakman’s departure heralds the dawn of a scattergun approach that ultimately leads to the kind of turbulence that we’ve tried to escape from.\n\nBarring a cataclysmic end to the season, Le Bris’ position ought to be as safe as houses.\n\nHe’s been one of the most important Sunderland head coaching appointments of my lifetime. He’s helped to create a sense of togetherness that we’ve seldom seen and has propelled us forward rapidly, and his calm, measured and unflappable personality is a perfect fit for our club.\n\nYes, we may have a little bit of work to do in the league and to realign the balance from defensive-minded football to a more positive approach, but let nobody be any doubt that 2025/2026 has the potential to be a memorable season for Sunderland, and our head coach has been as key to that as any of his players.\n\nPerhaps I’m something of a lone voice here, but as much as I’d sell a kidney in order to see Sunderland competing in Europe and the like, I’m not in a rush. I’ve experienced enough highs and lows in thirty years of red and white fandom and I can honestly say that I can’t understand the desperation in some circles to see certain boxes ticked by a certain time or date.\n\nHere and now, I’m happy for the club to be a stable and competitive top flight outfit and to hopefully develop a style of play that can eventually enable us to compete in the upper reaches of the table. I firmly believe Le Bris can be the man to oversee that process and I would only advocate a change in the dugout if a genuine upgrade appeared on the club’s radar — which is by no means guaranteed.\n\nFor everyone — fans and owner alike — patience and planning are the watchwords and just as Le Bris said that we wouldn’t play like other teams because “We are Sunderland and I am Régis Le Bris”, perhaps a similar mindset: “We won’t manage our personnel like Watford or Nottingham Forest”, should be adopted by those in the boardroom.\n\nFor our long-term stability and top flight prospects, it would surely be a smart thing to do.",

    "title": "Lasses Spotlight: Ella West — The Quiet Rise Of A Sunderland Talent",
    "description": "“West’s journey this season has been a lesson in resilience”, writes Charlotte Patterson of the young defender.",
    "fullText": "There are players whose progress feels inevitable, even when circumstances conspire to slow their momentum.\n\nElla West is one of them, and her call‑up to the Scotland U19 squad for their upcoming double‑header against Belgium is more than a line on a squad announcement graphic. Instead, it’s a statement, a reminder, and confirmation that the talent Sunderland have long known they possess is still very much recognised beyond Wearside — even after a season that’s been shaped more by recovery than by rhythm.\n\nFor Sunderland supporters, the news carries a mixture of pride and relief.\n\nPride because her ability has never been in doubt; relief because this season has offered far fewer opportunities to see her in red and white than anyone would’ve hoped. Injuries have a way of interrupting even the most promising trajectories, and West’s campaign has been defined by the kind of stop‑start pattern that frustrates players and fans alike.\n\nYet here she is, selected for her country and trusted to represent Scotland at a level where competition is fierce and standards uncompromising. It’s testament to her quality, her resilience and the impression she’s already made on coaches at both club and international level.\n\nWest’s story this season isn’t one of failure or stagnation — it’s one of patience.\n\nShe’s spent much of the year working her way back to fitness, rebuilding her sharpness and waiting for the moment when her body would allow her to show what her mind has always known she can do. For a young player, that kind of enforced pause can be difficult as the game moves quickly and opportunities come and go, yet she’s handled it with maturity and her Scotland call‑up is the clearest sign yet that her development hasn’t been derailed, merely delayed.\n\nWhat makes her selection even more impressive is the context of her role at Sunderland. She’s predominantly a PGA player and part of the club’s development pathway, but she isn’t a stranger to senior football.\n\nLast season, she earned starts and minutes with the first team, stepping into the then-Championship environment with a composure that belied her age. Whether deployed in her natural position at centre back or pushed into central midfield, she showed the same qualities: intelligence, calmness and an ability to read the game that marks her out as a player with a high ceiling.\n\nThose senior minutes mattered, showing that she could cope with the physicality, the tempo, and the tactical demands of the league. They proved that she wasn’t simply a promising academy player, but someone capable of contributing in real matches and under real pressure. And they showed that Sunderland’s long‑term plan for her, to integrate her gradually into the senior squad wasn’t just aspirational, but achievable.\n\nThis season, injuries have slowed that process and Sunderland have had to manage her carefully, ensuring that her recovery is prioritised over short‑term needs.\n\nIt’s meant fewer appearances, fewer opportunities and fewer moments for supporters to see her progress. But the club never wavered in their belief in her. They know what she brings, what she’ll become, and that her route back to the senior squad is there.\n\nHer call‑up to the Scotland U19s is a significant step in that journey. International football — even at youth level — demands a level of concentration and tactical discipline that accelerates development. It exposes players to different styles, different challenges, and different expectations.\n\nFor West, who’s spent much of the season rebuilding physically, the chance to test herself in this environment is invaluable. It gives her minutes, confidence and momentum at a time when she needs all three.\n\nIt also offers something more subtle: validation.\n\nFor a young player recovering from injury, confidence can be fragile. You can train well, feel sharp and pass every fitness test, but until someone selects you and says, “We trust you”, there’s always lingering doubt. Scotland have removed that doubt, showing that they still see her as part of their plans, that they believe in her potential and still want her involved. That kind of affirmation can transform a player’s mindset.\n\nFor Sunderland, the timing couldn’t be better.\n\nThe senior squad has been stretched this season, and the defensive unit in particular has faced its share of challenges. The team have lacked depth at centre back at times, but West’s ability to cover ground, read danger early and to play out from the back with composure makes her a natural fit for the way Sunderland want to build.\n\nShe’s not just a defender who clears her lines — she starts attacks, and her experience in central midfield only adds to her value.\n\nIt’s given her a broader understanding of the pitch, a better sense of timing and a confidence in possession that many centre halves her age don’t possess. It also means she can step into the midfield lines when needed, helping Sunderland maintain structure in transitions and offering an extra layer of control when the team are under pressure. That versatility is rare and it’s one of the reasons the club sees her as a long‑term asset.\n\nOnce she returns from Scotland duty, the expectation is that she will rejoin senior training more consistently.\n\nThe coaching staff have been cautious but they’ve also been clear: West is part of their plans. They want her involved, competing and pushing for a place on the bench again. And once she’s back on the bench, the next step becomes inevitable: minutes. Real minutes. Not token appearances, but meaningful involvement in matches where Sunderland need fresh legs, fresh ideas and fresh energy.\n\nSupporters haven’t forgotten what she offered last season.\n\nThey remember the calmness, the maturity and the way she slotted into the back line without fuss. They also remember the glimpses of a player who could become a mainstay in years to come, and they know that Sunderland’s identity — built on developing young talent, trusting their pathway and on giving opportunities to players who come through the system — is strengthened every time someone like West takes the next step.\n\nHer return will not solve every issue Sunderland have faced this season, but it’ll help, adding depth, competition and a sense of renewal at a moment when the squad needs it. It’ll also remind everyone that the club’s future isn’t just about the players who start every week, but about the players who are being shaped, nurtured and prepared to take on bigger roles.\n\nWest’s journey this season has been a lesson in resilience.\n\nInjuries test more than the body; they test belief, patience and the ability to stay focused when the game moves on without you. She’a passed that test by staying committed, engaged and ready. And now, with her Scotland call‑up, she’s been rewarded.\n\nThe next chapter is hers to write and it won’t be long before she’s training with the senior squad, competing for a place on the bench and pushing for minutes. And if her development continues on its current trajectory, it’s only a matter of time before those minutes become more frequent, meaningful, and more reflective of the talent she possesses.\n\nFor now, though, she heads to Belgium with her country. Fit again. Trusted again. Recognised again. And ready to remind everyone — Sunderland, Scotland and herself — of the player she’s becoming.",

    "description": "“A tussle with a familiar opponent was the palate-cleanser I think we all needed after a run of difficult games”.",
    "fullText": "Being a Sunderland fan is a funny thing.\n\nOne minute you’re seemingly teetering on the edge of unholy disaster, then, poof — it can all change in an instant. You’re getting promoted, you’re winning games, and you’re on a cup run.\n\nJust as quickly as things can ramp up, stuff goes awry and it’s that constant rollercoaster ride that makes Sunderland such a compelling football club — and why companies like Netflix invested money and time in documenting how batshit mental we are over a number of years.\n\nStill, it’s fair to say that right now, things are about as good as they’ve even been in my lifetime, and whilst the demon on my right shoulder keeps telling me that this will all go tits up eventually, I’m pleasantly surprised by how well we seem to be staying the course right now in the Premier League.\n\nTrips to Anfield and Old Trafford are great, but there was something hopelessly nostalgic about Sunderland’s trip to Oxford on Sunday. It was warm, comfortable and familiar. We’ve been treated to some big games against big opponents with big-name players over the last six months or so, but a shithouse tussle with a familiar opponent at the weekend was the palate cleanser I think that we all needed after a run of difficult and demanding games in the top flight.\n\nI love Luke O’Nien and Dennis Cirkin, so any opportunity that I get to see them run it back for us is a huge positive. And in both cases, they gave classic performances that reminded me of the days we spent in the EFL, going toe-to-toe with some absolute cloggers that on their day can scare and upset you if you don’t want it quite as much as they do.\n\nDon’t get me wrong — I absolutely love Reinildo Mandava and Omar Alderete, and it’s been an absolute joy (for the most part) to see them in a Sunderland shirt this season, but players like O’Nien and Cirkin are the real reasons that I fell back in love with Sunderland all over again after an immensely mentally scarring period under some seriously shitty ownership and management.\n\nThey came along during the club’s worst ever period, and have survived to tell the tale. They — and we — are living proof that it doesn’t matter how bad things are, your club will eventually come out of the other side much stronger and better off for it. Sheffield Wednesday and Leicester fans, take note.\n\nOf course, I’m absolutely buzzing for the game on Sunday and I can’t wait to be there to cheer the Lads on, but that doesn’t make the feeling of seeing the likes of O’Nien playing and playing well any less sweet.\n\nI know Luke has a personal love/hate relationship with this here website, but he’s always been a Sunderland legend to me and I just absolutely adore him. He’s my favourite ever Sunderland player and I get genuine, serious pleasure from watching him play as well as he did on Sunday. It’ll be a sad day when he eventually leaves, so I’ll hold days like that dearly close to my heart and hope that there are still many more to come.\n\nI hated the EFL but I can’t deny that it brought us many happy memories too, and it brought players like Luke, Dennis, Dan Ballard and Trai Hume into our lives, and for that I’m thankful.\n\nSunday was a reminder of the journey we’ve been on, passing through places like Oxford with players like Luke in our team.\n\nWhere are we headed from here? Who knows, though the trajectory of the club would suggest that there will be far fewer trips to places like Oxford, and perhaps far more trips to places that we possibly have never been before.",

    "fullText": "Tyler Reddick and his family went through a tough time in the latter half of 2025. The Cup Series driver’s infant son, Rookie, had to undergo surgery to remove a kidney after he was diagnosed with a tumor that was increasing the stress on his heart. In an interview after he won the Daytona 500 on Sunday, he detailed how the NASCAR community helped him in those days.\n\nRookie was born on May 25, 2025. It was around late September when doctors at the Atrium Health Levine Children’s Hospital in Charlotte confirmed that he had a tumor in his chest and that it was compressing his renal artery and vein. This was causing his heart to work heavier than normal, and it was why he was showing signs of heart failure.\n\nAny parent in this situation would be terrified, and Reddick was too. Fortunately, he received some able support from his friends. He said, “Michael and everybody at 23XI Racing basically told me, ‘Look. If you need to step away and not run another race… do whatever you need to do.’ Just having everyone’s support along the way was incredible.”\n\nThe support wasn’t limited to his team. He continued, “When my wife was headed down there, Rick Hendrick and his whole group were doing everything they could to kind of expedite the process for Rookie. Joey Logano, a fellow competitor of mine, was reaching out, doing everything he could to pick up Beau and let him go hang out with Joey’s kids while we were dealing with that.”\n\nHe quipped that the amount of support he got from the NASCAR community throughout the whole deal was incredible. At the end of the day, all that matters is that the boy is safe and is recovering well. The cherry on top of the cake is that Rookie actually began crawling for the first time during the Daytona 500 weekend.\n\nReddick was jubilant about that as well. To win the Harley J. Earl trophy and to celebrate it with his family after undergoing such scary battles must be a memorable moment for him. The season has just begun under the Chase format, and he has kicked off on the best foot possible.\n\nBut winning the championship will require consistency at this same level throughout the year. Reddick is only too capable of producing that. Without question, Rookie, too, wouldn’t mind visiting more Victory Lanes with his father.\n\nThe post How NASCAR Team Owners and Drivers Supported Tyler Reddick After His Son’s Unfortunate Health Condition appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s hierarchy’s two biggest priorities ahead of next season are to find a permanent manager and strengthen their midfield.\n\nOn Monday, Jurgen Klopp’s agent, Marc Kosicke, claimed that the former Liverpool boss turned down approaches from United and Chelsea following his departure from Anfield.\n\nIt has been widely reported that Real Madrid are interested in hiring Klopp, who is currently Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull. United might have failed in their bid to convince Klopp, but his next potential move could fix their second concern: the midfield.\n\nAccording to a report in Spain, as relayed by Football365, Jude Bellingham has “agreed in principle” to join Manchester United in the summer if Real Madrid secure the services of Jurgen Klopp.\n\nIt has been a rough season for Los Blancos and Bellingham. Early this season, Real Madrid sacked Xabi Alonso and placed Alvaro Arbeloa in charge of the first team.\n\nAt the time, it was suggested that there was a rift between Bellingham, who is enduring an injury-laden campaign, and Alonso. Now, it is being claimed that the Englishman would not be part of Klopp’s plans if the German were to accept the Spanish giants’ job offer.\n\nIt is claimed that Bellingham “has a deal in place to leave Real Madrid if Jurgen Klopp takes over as manager.”\n\nThe England international has “reached an agreement in principle with Manchester United to facilitate an immediate departure should a change in management occur.”\n\nThe report adds: “The move is contingent solely on Klopp’s arrival. If the German coach does not land at the Santiago Bernabéu, the midfielder intends to remain at the club.”\n\nBellingham allegedly prefers to “get ahead of the curve” and find a club where he would be handed a prominent role.\n\nIt is understood United are prepared to offer him that status and build their project around him.\n\nFormer United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer tried to sign Bellingham after he broke through at Birmingham City. Eventually, the 22-year-old chose Borussia Dortmund before sealing a €103 million move to Real, where he has already lifted the Champions League trophy.\n\nThere are question marks over Bellingham’s attitude, but as far as on-field quality is concerned, there are only a few midfielders better than the Real Madrid superstar.\n\nFeatured image Angel Martinez via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "A classic Roker Park atmosphere and a lively cup tie was sure to get the fire burning for legions of Lads’ fans!",
    "fullText": "A wonderfully evocative article from Barry Jackson has prompted today’s feature, which looks at a game that brought the romance of the FA Cup back to Wearside just as his new love affair with Sunderland was blossoming.\n\nThe Lads’ battling fifth round showing in Staffordshire forced a replay and despite Stoke City’s top flight status, the rematch at Roker Park seemed to be firmly in the balance.\n\nOur strong home record would eventually see us finish the season as Division Two champions, and when added to their notorious cup pedigree, it gave many supporters the sense that an upset was on the cards — although as it happened, large sections were anything but comfortable for the hosts.\n\nManager Bob Stokoe, whose main concern prior to kick off was a flu bug that was starting to spread through the club, had to watch on as his team were put through a tough examination by the Potters. As it was, only Billy Hughes and Ian Porterfield — two men who’ll have recalled a similar issue when the FA Cup was won earlier in the decade but had since fallen out of first team contention — were the only players laid up, yet those able to take to the pitch found the going tough.\n\nWell-structured Stoke had plenty of the ball, although they didn’t always turn possession into clear-cut chances, and it was Sunderland that looked the more dangerous actually when they did get the opportunity to push forward.\n\nHaving seen a thirty-fifth minute Pop Robson strike ruled out for offside, Bob Moncur and Mel Holden also went close before a finely-poised chess battle ensued, with Stokoe’s decision to opt for a back five giving the Rokerites the ability to stem the flow of pressure their higher division opponents were looking to build on.\n\nThe massed crowd, which had given the club their biggest attendance of the season thus far, was beginning to sense that things could go either way but rather than add to the tension, they began to turn the volume up.\n\nA wall of noise began to swirl around the stadium and when the final fifteen minutes brought about an intense period of drama, the atmosphere was right up there in terms of classic Roker nights. A superb near post header from Holden as he connected with a Bobby Kerr corner was greeted by jubilant scenes on the terraces, and whilst Denis Smith soon replied for Stoke, the fans didn’t waver once.\n\nSmith — who in time would himself get to enjoy the backing of the red and white army when he became manager on Wearside — registered an instant leveller when a free kick found its way onto the post and he was on hand to poke it over the line, yet the scruffy nature of the equaliser meant Sunderland were able to maintain the belief that they were good enough to win, as rather than being outdone by a moment of skill, they’d instead been pegged back through a touch of misfortune.\n\nKerr, who was awesome throughout, soon set about Stokoe’s left hand side and when his centre was half-cleared, the ball was put back into the area by Dick Malone.\n\nIt was a wonderfully weighted cross and one that Robson was able to control and flick into the net (albeit via a deflection), to spark further celebrations in the jam-packed Fulwell End behind the net.\n\nDespite owing something to luck just as the goal that had proceeded it, the winner felt fully deserved.\n\nIn Robson, the Lads had a finisher every bit as good as Stoke’s usual First Division adversaries, whilst behind him was a level of energy and determination that any successful side needs – a feeling summed up moments before the goals when Jimmy Robertson put a late tackle in on Tony Towers and the skipper was more than happy to give a bit back.\n\nFollowing the clash, Robertson was booked whilst Towers got let off with a stern telling-off from referee Mr T.H.C Reynolds, but the message was clear: Sunderland were up for the cup.\n\nWith a place in the quarter finals now confirmed, murmurings of a potential remarkable double soon got traction.\n\nHowever, the push went to pot when a niggly sixth round encounter with Crystal Palace turned Sunderland into the victims of a giant-killing and with all the attention quickly reverting to the promotion chase, this match can now sometimes be overlooked when recounting the big post-war cup ties staged at Roker.\n\nStill, there’ll be some for whom the memories still exist — and maybe even be one or two who pinpoint the replay as the day their own Sunderland relationship began.\n\nBarry’s origin story is shared by many and although the locations and the characters might change, the essence is the same: love at first sight that leads to a passionate tale that spans a many great years.\n\nSunderland versus Stoke in 1976 might be less heralded that when Manchester City were the opponents at the same stage three years earlier, for instance, but it’ll be no less important to somebody that fell head over heels.\n\nSunderland 2 (Holden 77’, Robson 81’)\n\nSunderland: Montgomery, Malone, Clarke; Moncur, Ashurst, Bolton; Kerr, Towers, Finney (Halom 83’); Holden, Robson",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nJohn Wetzel, a 6-foot-5 wing, emerged as a stud at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in the mid-1960s before the Lakers took him in the eighth round of the 1966 NBA Draft. An injury forced him to wait until the 1967-68 season before he made his NBA debut, but he averaged 3.7 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 11.4 minutes a game that year for L.A.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns then took Wetzel in the 1968 expansion draft, and he ended up playing for the Suns and Atlanta Hawks before his NBA career ended following the 1975-76 season. He finished with career averages of 3.4 points, 1.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 13.2 minutes a game, and he later served as the Suns' head coach during the 1987-88 campaign.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 24 — John Wetzel",

It’s going to take a while for this to sink in. I still can’t believe it. I can’t even put into words what this means, I’m just so excited,\" she said.\n\n\"There were so many moments I thought it wasn’t possible, and I had some really good people in my corner who believed in me. And people from all over the world reaching out and telling me their stories, and how they had kids with Down syndrome, they had deaf kids, and how they believed in me, too,\" she added.\n\nHer eldest son, Nico, was born with Down syndrome. He and his younger brother Noah have deafness due to a mutation unrelated to Down syndrome.\n\nMeyers Taylor won with a combined time of 3 minutes 57.93 seconds from four runs.\n\nGermany's Nolte had topped all the previous three heats, but she made too many mistakes at the top, losing precious time in the final run, and watching her 0.15 seconds lead vanish.\n\nThe World Cup winner had to settle for silver, 0.04 seconds behind Meyers Taylor, while bronze also went to the US with Kaillie Armsbruster Humphries.\n\n\"I'm a bit sad because at the moment it feels like I lost gold - and not that I won silver. In a few hours I think I can celebrate it, because it's still a great result,\" she said.\n\n\"If you lose speed at the upper part you can't catch it back on the down part. So I was angry, but I was still focusing on the next corners, because I was hoping that there's still a chance to somehow get closer, but it wasn't enough.\"\n\nHumphries, meanwhile, stressed that she and Meyers Taylor are proof that mothers and older athletes can still compete at high level.\n\n\"You get a lot of people that like to write you off as soon as you reach 40, it's all downhill from there, is what you hear. I think Elana and I are both proof that that's not true,\" she said.\n\n\"As soon as you become a mom, your body's not the same, and you can never get that high performance back, and I think we were able to show that that's not true again.\n\n\"For every girl out there that wants that dream of being a high-performance athlete, to stand on an Olympic podium and be a mom at the same time, it can happen.\"",

    "fullText": "Only after the 0-4 defeat at Atletico Madrid did FC Barcelona file a formal referee complaint with the Spanish Football Federation. In yesterday’s derby loss (1-2 in Girona), there were immediately more situations in which the Catalans felt disadvantaged.\n\nFans online, for example, criticized the decision not to retake the penalty missed by Lamine Yamal shortly before halftime with the score at 0-0.\n\nIn various images, you can see that players from both teams apparently entered the penalty area too early—which in that case would normally have meant a new chance for the shooter.\n\nHowever, it was this scene that caused even more controversy: Shortly before Girona’s decisive winning goal (final score 2-1), Echeverri stepped on Barca’s Jules Koundé’s foot. Moments later, the ball reached Fran Beltran via Roca, who slotted it into the bottom left corner. The duel just before, which was definitely right on the edge of a foul, was waved through by VAR.\n\nA decision that not all observers can understand—and not all players on the pitch either.\n\nThus, the scorer of Barca’s temporary lead, Pau Cubarsí, said after the final whistle about the scene: “Everyone has already seen it, I won’t give my opinion on it. People already know what happened. But we also have to do better, because they can’t just score two goals against us. We played a bad game and need to look at ourselves first.”\n\nAnd German coach Hansi Flick also seems to have had enough of publicly discussing questionable referee decisions. He too kept quiet: “I don’t want to talk about it, because everyone saw the situation before the second goal.”\n\nIn the end, however, Flick said that Girona deserved the win from his point of view. After the final whistle, Flick explained that he would give his players two days off so they could rest and then calmly prepare for the next match.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali has played down rumours linking him with a move away from St. James Park this summer.\n\nThe 25-year-old was a late target for Arsenal during the winter transfer window.\n\nHowever, a mid-season move was never on the cards despite claims that the Gunners had spoken with his representatives.\n\nThe Premier League leaders could revive their interest in the Magpies midfielder next summer, but they’ll face serious competition from Manchester United.\n\nThe Red Devils are also keeping tabs on Tonali and are planning to launch an official proposal if they qualify for the Champions League.\n\nSpeculation about Tonali’s long-term future at Newcastle comes from reports claiming that there’s a rift between the midfielder and manager Eddie Howe.\n\nHowever, he has shut down those rumours, insisting that their relationship is “perfect”.\n\nTonali used his celebrations to make it clear that he had no problems with Howe after bagging a brace in the 3-1 FA Cup fourth round victory over Aston Villa.\n\nHe celebrated his second goal by running over to the touchline to embrace Howe. “The first one, this celebration was, I think, seven months without scoring,” Tonali said (via The Standard).\n\n“But after the second goal, I came to Eddie because in the past few weeks, people spoke about our relationship.\n\n“But I work every day with the gaffer, the gaffer works every day with me, and our relationship is perfect. It’s not broken, and I think this is perfect for the team.”\n\nTonali’s agent, Giuseppe Riso, also dismissed the rumours, stating he “never had any conversation” with Arsenal. Yet he didn’t completely shut the door on a potential summer exit.\n\nRiso hinted that qualifying for the Champions League will increase Newcastle’s chances of keeping Tonali.\n\n“Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,” Riso said.\n\n“We’ll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later.”\n\nNewcastle currently sit 10th in the Premier League table, nine points off fourth-placed Man United.",

    "fullText": "Skeleton slider Vladyslav Heraskevych late on Monday said he had returned to Ukraine after being excluded from the Olympic competitions.\n\nIn a video posted on X, the 27-year-old appeared to record himself in darkness in central Kiev. He said he was standing near St Sophia's Cathedral, which could not be seen behind him because of Russian attacks.\n\nHeraskevych criticized the International Olympic Committee (IOC), saying more and more Russian athletes were returning to international arenas, \"while Ukrainians continue to live through a humanitarian catastrophe caused by Russian shelling.\"\n\n\"When the IOC plays along with Russian propaganda, it effectively becomes complicit in these crimes,\" he wrote.\n\nHeraskevych was disqualified shortly before the start of the skeleton events at the Winter Olympics in Italy after refusing to remove a helmet that had been banned by the IOC. The helmet featured images of more than 20 athletes who have died since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn an expedited procedure, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld the decision by the sport's governing body, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).\n\nAccording to the guidelines of the Olympic Charter, athletes are prohibited from making political statements during an ongoing competition. Heraskevych argues that the gesture is a commemoration rather than a political statement, something he says other athletes have been allowed to do.",

    "fullText": "Prospective Sheffield Wednesday owner James Bord has become the subject of a major legal battle in the United States, according to The Times.\n\nThe English businessman and former professional poker player led the group that won the race to take over Wednesday after the club’s administrators announced an agreement.\n\nBord is being sued by his former business partner, Jonathan Cohen, over his investment in Spanish second division club Cordoba, where he is both a part-owner and a director.\n\nAccording to court papers filed in Clark County, Nevada, Bord allegedly misled Cohen during an investment deal linked to Cordoba in 2024.\n\nIn the complaint, Cohen says he was told Cordoba were debt-free when he agreed to invest. He now alleges that the club was in fact carrying debts of around $23 million (£16.9m) at the time.\n\nCohen argues that this information was crucial to his decision and that he would not have invested had he known the club’s true financial position.\n\nThe legal documents also claim that Bord wrongfully took control of a bitcoin account worth around $6m which belonged to Cohen.\n\nIn addition, Cohen says that Bord failed to formally confirm his stake in Cordoba through a written contract, ignoring numerous notifications to do so.\n\nOne of the more unusual claims in the filing is that Bord offered Cohen a “coupon” in exchange for a share in the club, a proposal Cohen’s team suggests was not a serious or fair arrangement.\n\nCohen’s lawyers, Holland & Hart LLP, are seeking punitive damages. They argue that Bord’s actions amount to fraud, oppression and deliberate wrongdoing.\n\nCohen has filed a total of seven separate claims, including fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment and breach of confidence.\n\nBord’s representatives have responded by referring to the situation as a “deeply upsetting matter” for their client.\n\nThey have also claimed that over the past few years, Bord has “helped and supported Jonathan [Cohen] financially and personally, and has long considered him a friend”.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the situation will affect Bord’s Wednesday takeover, which is still pending green light from the English Football League.",

I am really proud of myself for the three solid runs and to be sat 11th going into the last run shows the potential.\n\n\"I know everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong and it is just one of those nightmare performances that I'll hopefully move on from.\"\n\nNicoll - a three-time British shot put champion - was a travelling reserve for the two-woman bobsleigh at the 2022 Games in Beijing where the monobob made its debut as a Winter Olympics event.\n\n\"Hopefully that shows people that this is raw and it is not all sunshine and rainbows,\" she added.\n\n\"I've had to overcome a lot of hurdles to even be here. I started off this season not even walking and had to overcome a serious injury to even be on the starting block today.\n\n\"I am just taking some accountability for that fourth run not being good enough and I need to pull it together for the two-woman.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nJamaica's Mica Moore, from Newport in south Wales, finished four places ahead of Nicoll in 14th and was delighted with the outcome having switched in 2022 from representing GB after claiming she had witnessed \"damaging and offensive behaviour\".\n\nMoore told BBC Sport: \"I'm so happy. It has been a real tough journey to get here, it hasn't been easy at all. I guess to me it is just a story of not giving up.\n\n\"I had a really difficult time with Great Britain and that is not secret at all and I'm just so proud I didn't give up on myself and I'm so grateful for my family and friends for digging myself out of the trenches when it was really tough and just keep going. Moments like this make it really worth it.\"\n\nMoore began her sporting career as an athlete - representing Wales at the 2014 Commonwealth Games - before switching to bobsleigh.\n\nHer grandfather, Venson Byfield, came to the UK in the Windrush generation and settled in Wales.\n\n\"It is a really proud moment,\" she added.\n\n\"I've spoken a lot about my grandfather and how we came over with the Windrush generation and I never got the pleasure of meeting him, but my mum has told me so many stories about him and I just had that in my heart the whole time. I just wanted to make my family proud.\n\n\"They've supported me for so long.

    "fullText": "It sounds a bit crazy, but it's true: Feyenoord has relocated its training program abroad at short notice. The reason is a single, prominent new star signing: Raheem Sterling.\n\nAfter terminating his contract with Chelsea at the end of January, Sterling signed a contract last week until the end of the season with the second-placed team in the Dutch Eredivisie.\n\nTo integrate him into the team as quickly as possible, the club has gotten creative.\n\nSince Sterling does not yet have a valid work permit for the Netherlands, his new team is accommodating him. Quite literally.\n\nRotterdam's coach Robin van Persie has reportedly organized a training camp in Belgium specifically for Sterling, according to reports from the 'Mirror' and 'Spox'.\n\nThe coach explained: \"This is allowed abroad. We are doing this for him, but I also want to work on the development of our team. We can exchange ideas well and do something fun together.\"\n\nThe lack of a work permit is not the only obstacle for the first appearance of the 31-year-old Englishman. \"We will see week by week when he is fit for a game. It will take some time, but that seems logical to me since he hasn't played for six months,\" added van Persie. Sterling did not collect a single minute of play in the first half of the season at Chelsea.\n\nSo it will probably take a while before the Rotterdam transfer coup really pays off.\n\nAt least the first training session with the new team won't be long in coming - even if it initially takes place not in the Netherlands, but in Belgium.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

He also became the fastest player in NFL history to reach 1,000 career receptions and surpassed Antonio Gates to become the Chargers' all-time receptions leader.\n\nAllen is 534 yards away from passing Gates as the franchise's receiving yards leader.\n\nAllen will be one of the more reliable veteran free agent receivers available, and he should draw interest from teams needing a proven slot if he tests the market.\n\nWith the Chargers' ample cap space, re-signing Allen is possible. He has made it clear that he has no interest in testing free agency and wants to continue to play in L.A.\n\nHowever, the question becomes whether McDaniel sees him as an option in his offense and whether it makes sense to pair him with Ladd McConkey again, as Allen's presence cut into McConkey's route tree and production in 2025. McConkey finished with 66 catches for 789 yards after posting 82 catches for 1,149 yards as a rookie.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: Keenan Allen contract projection: Will Chargers re-sign free agent?",

    "fullText": "It has been just a week since the Seattle Seahawks beat the New England Patriots to win Super Bowl LX. Immediately after which, Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak was named the Raiders next head coach.\n\nThe move had been expected in the week leading up to the Super Bowl and with that came the expectation that he would bring over several other Seahawks assistants to join him in Las Vegas. Sunday, he landed perhaps the most significant of those assistants in terms of how the Seahawks went about winning the title -- the rushing attack.\n\nObviously, Kubiak was the architect of that offense, but it was run game coordinator Rick Dennison who gets credit for what the Seahawks were able to do to the Patriots on the ground.\n\nThe #Raiders are expected to hire #Seahawks run game coordinator and senior offensive advisor Rick Dennison, sources tell @CBSSports.\n\nDennison has 30 years of NFL coaching experience, including as an offensive coordinator with the Bills, Broncos and Texans. pic.twitter.com/p8Zy0ezEGU\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) February 17, 2026\n\nThe Seahawks run game had the Patriots defense out of sorts all game long and running back Kenneth Walker II gouged the New England defense all game long.\n\nThe 67-year-old Dennison's ties to Klint Kubiak go back to his father with whom he coached with as far back as 1995. That relationship led to Dennison working with Klint at four different spots, including with the Saints in 2024 and Seahawks in 2025. Clearly he was in Seattle because of Kubiak, so his move to Las Vegas was for the same reason.\n\nKubiak had already lured QB coach Andrew Janocko as his OC. Now he gets another key member of that Seahawks staff as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Raiders Wire: Raiders reel in coach who was key component in Seahawks Super Bowl win",

This news was put out allegedly by Klopp’s agent.\n\nThe news did not surprise me and to be honest, despite Chelsea denying it, I’m inclined to believe the agent and I’d fully expect Chelsea to have approached Klopp when he was available. I mean, why wouldn’t they? They would have to at least try to bring in one of the best available head coaches in the world, right? They would be silly not to try. I think they probably did try, or at least reach out to his agents, but they were politely told no thanks, and they would rather deny a story like that. This is just my opinion anyway, appreciate others may have different views on it.\n\nSky Sports News, via X, have reported that Chelsea have denied having any contact with Jurgen Klopp’s agent after he said the club made an enquiry.\n\nIt was suggested that Klopp’s trusted advisor/agent, Marc Kosicke, said otherwise.\n\nEven if they didn’t approach him, if they did, it’s obvious he was going to say no. He wanted a break from football first and foremost but also, I can not see a manager like Klopp working under an ownership like Chelsea have.\n\nKlopp would get very little say in anything and would have to accept that the sporting directors and owners run the rule over Chelsea – it just would not work.\n\nChelsea have drawn Wrexham in the FA Cup fifth round, a really fun and interesting draw – but one we have to win.\n\nPeople are bending over backwards to try and find nice things to say about Liam Delap’s performance on Friday against Hull, including the crew on the London is Blue podcast.",

I would love to be on that April card, the Miami card (UFC 327). There's no opponent yet. There's no contract yet. We don't have any of that. Whoever. Let's go. I'm ready to go again and get back to my belt as soon as possible. Don't really matter who it is.\"\n\nDu Plessis won the 185-pound championship at UFC 297 in January 2024 by defeating then-titleholder Sean Strickland via split decision. He successfully defended the belt twice before losing to Chimaev at UFC 319.\n\nWhile du Plessis is willing to face anyone at UFC 327, he knows who he'd like to fight. The South African wants a rematch with the champion despite their UFC 319 title bout being a one-sided dominating grappling performance by Chimaev.\n\n\"I would of course love for it to be Khamzat and redeem that loss,\" he said. \"For me, right now the next fight is the most important fight of my life. And I will win that fight and I will get my belt back.\"\n\n\"Fighting Khamzat again is of course what I'm after. Expecting any surprises (in a rematch)? No. There's not going to be any surprises. I mean, that is the way that he's going to fight. And if he tries anything different, it will be a terrible night (for him). We all know that, but he did what he had to do to win that belt. We can't hate on him for that. He did what he needed to do. It's the rules of the game and he did it. So, saying it's not fair, it is fair. He did what he had to do. It's not how I would win my belt, or would like to, but that's what he did. Now it's my responsibility to go and fix that to stop him from doing that again and get him to fight my fight,\" du Plessis continued.\n\n\"It's always great when you have a guy that comes and fights because that's my style and it's what I love to do to entertain, to hear the crowd go crazy. But he knows that and that's why he went for that style because, and once again I understand that it wasn't the best fight to watch. In fact, it was a terrible fight to watch. But he did what he had to do to win that title. And good for him. My responsibility is to stop him from doing that, and that's what I will do ... I'll have my belt back by the end of this year.\"",

    "description": "Fujitsu Limited today announced the development and launch of its AI-Driven Software Development Platform, a new initiative to bring software development into the AI age and contribute to the sustainable growth of its customers and society.",
    "fullText": "Kawasaki, Japan, February 17, 2026\n\nFujitsu Limited today announced the development and launch of its AI-Driven Software Development Platform, a new initiative to bring software development into the AI age and contribute to the sustainable growth of its customers and society. This platform automates the entire software development process, from requirements definition and design to implementation and integration testing. By leveraging the Takane large language model (LLM) [1] and agentic AI technology for large-scale software development developed by Fujitsu Research, the AI-Driven Software Development Platform enables AI agents to understand complex, evolving large-scale systems owned by enterprises and public organizations. The platform has multiple AI agents collaboratively execute each stage of software development, achieving full automation of the entire process without human intervention.\n\nFujitsu aims to use this AI-Driven Software Development Platform to carry out revisions to all 67 types of medical and government business software products provided by Fujitsu Japan Limited by the end of fiscal year 2026. The revisions are necessary due to legal and regulatory changes. From January 2026, the platform has been used in Japan for software modifications made necessary by the 2026 medical fee revisions [2]. In a PoC that updated software as per the 2024 medical fee revisions, the platform demonstrated a significant reduction in development time for one of approximately 300 change requests. Using conventional software development methods [3] the modifications would have taken three person-months. With this technology that was dramatically shortened to four hours, achieving a 100-fold increase in productivity.\n\nIn AI-driven development, Fujitsu positions AI-Ready Engineering—the process of preparing assets and knowledge to ensure AI correctly understands existing systems and achieves highly reliable automation—as crucial. With AI-Ready Engineering and the AI-Driven Software Development Platform working in tandem, Fujitsu will accelerate AI-driven software development. Fujitsu will promote a transformation in engineers' work styles, strengthening its Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) complement, and shifting the paradigm of software development from a conventional person-month-based approach to a customer value-based approach.\n\nMoving forward, Fujitsu plans to expand the application of the AI-Driven Software Development Platform to a wide range of sectors, including finance, manufacturing, retail, and public services, by the end of fiscal year 2026. Fujitsu will also begin offering this service to customers and partner companies to enable them to rapidly and flexibly develop systems that adapt to changes in their business environments. Through these efforts, Fujitsu aims to transform the software development process into an AI-driven model as an industry standard.\n\n(Order that companies appear is aligned with the original Japanese press release)\n\nTakashi Manabe, Senior Research Director, AI & Automation, IDC Japan\n“IDC forecasts that from 2026 onward, the acceleration of AI/agent-based business utilization and the modernization of existing systems will be key drivers of transformation in the Japanese IT market. Fujitsu’s announcement aims to redefine complex legacy system assets into a state where AI can accurately understand and process them, and to automate the entire waterfall development process. This initiative is expected to provide a practical pathway for many domestic enterprises facing the ongoing challenge of maintaining and operating legacy assets, while also promoting a shift in software engineering away from a labor-intensive model.”\n\nShinji Kajitani, Director and President Executive Officer, Optima Corporation\n“I am deeply impressed by the concept of automating the entire software development process from upstream to downstream using AI, and even entrusting the verification process to AI. This overturns the traditional assumption that human checks are ultimately indispensable, and I see great potential, especially in targeting business packages that undergo complex system changes every year. Our company has also been involved in business package modifications for many years, and how to complete system revisions with high quality in a short period has always been a major challenge. We believe that the knowledge and expertise accumulated during that process can significantly contribute to the realization and advancement of this concept. Our company will continue to contribute to the business expansion of Fujitsu and Fujitsu Japan through ongoing cooperation, not limited to this project.”\n\nHiroshi Nakatani, Representative Director, Executive Vice President, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.\n\"This AI automation initiative promoted by Fujitsu is not merely about improving development efficiency; we recognize it as a significant challenge to pass on and evolve the extensive business knowledge and design philosophies cultivated by companies over many years to the next generation. In particular, the concept of providing end-to-end support, from requirements definition to design, implementation, and quality assurance, triggered by changes in laws and rules, opens up new possibilities in areas that have traditionally relied on human experience and tacit knowledge. We see great significance in AI functioning as a foundation that supports human judgment and creativity, rather than replacing it.\nIn the manufacturing industry, challenges such as design changes, regulatory compliance, and understanding the scope of impact are becoming increasingly complex year by year. Fujitsu's approach of advancing both knowledge standardization and AI utilization in these areas offers valuable insights for enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the entire industry.\nKawasaki Heavy Industries sincerely hopes that this initiative will be a crucial step in driving the transformation of Japanese manufacturing and a wide range of other industries, and we wholeheartedly support its further development.\"\n\nYasushi Matsuda, President and CEO, Kewpie Digital Innovation Co., Ltd. \n“Systems have become increasingly complex through years of operation and often now require significant maintenance effort. While the introduction of generative AI has improved auditing efficiency, its accuracy remains insufficient for reliable practical application. Amidst this situation, we place great expectations on “Multi-layer Quality Control,” which automatically corrects ambiguities and omissions. We are confident that this mechanism, where AI itself audits quality and autonomously repeats processes, will dramatically enhance the reliability of system development. We eagerly await its future development.”\n\nJunichi Aruji, Managing Director, Kintetsu Information System Co., Ltd. \n“The challenge of revamping existing systems has long been a significant one for engineers. Fujitsu’s AI-Driven Software Development Platform has the potential to dramatically transform the labor previously involved in understanding complex laws and regulations, analyzing vast historical assets, and grasping the tacit knowledge of the field.\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is the AI's ability to autonomously learn \"human intelligence,\" thereby dramatically enhancing the accuracy of requirements definition. Furthermore, it can complete everything from program structure analysis and standardization to the extensive testing phase with incredible speed and comprehensiveness. This makes it possible to deliver high-quality products in a short period.\nAs the role of AI expands and frees people from routine tasks, engineers can focus on more creative activities. I have high expectations for the paradigm shift in system renovation that this solution will bring.”\n\nYumi Ueno, Managing Director, Partner Ecosystem & Corporate Business, Google Cloud Japan G.K. \n“This initiative to achieve comprehensive, one-stop automation spanning from requirements definition to system validation is a groundbreaking innovation for the industry. The technology enables AI to accurately understand vast assets, including long-established programs and design documentation, and we are delighted at the potential for both production-grade quality and exceptional productivity gains. We are confident that this platform will become the new standard for development and accelerate our customers' digital transformation. We remain committed to working with Fujitsu to address social challenges through AI.”\n\nMasahiro Niimi, Managing Executive Officer, Head of Information Systems Management Division, CISO, Sakura KCS Corporation \n“I believe Fujitsu Limited's AI-driven development framework has the potential to become the ‘new paradigm of system development.’ It cannot be achieved simply by feeding existing code or design information into AI, and while there are various hurdles, such as converting documentation to Markdown and establishing test environments, overcoming these hurdles can lead to solving traditional system development challenges (like QCD).\nWhat particularly caught my attention is not just improvements in the development process, but what comes after generative AI, i.e., the incorporation of detailed specifications and code (logic). I see tremendous potential here as a solution to the greatest challenge: visualizing and transferring the tacit knowledge of veteran software engineers’ that is traditionally missing from documentation. We expect generative AI to act as an advisor for less experienced software engineers, readily answering questions anytime, thereby dramatically advancing know-how transfer to the next generation. On the other hand, this mechanism also has the potential to dramatically change the traditional SI business model, and we are watching future developments closely.”\n\nTakao Kazama, Executive Officer, Group Companies and Accounting & Finance, The Shizuoka Shimbun and Shizuoka Broadcasting Co., Ltd. \n\"This initiative for complete automation of application development and maintenance represents a highly valuable transformation for our company. It formalizes and establishes a reproducible process for tasks that have long relied on the implicit knowledge and experience of individual staff members, and we have great expectations for it. In particular, it has the potential to significantly improve quality variations in legacy system maintenance and lost opportunities due to delayed change responses. Furthermore, the evolving ability of AI to perform root cause analysis and identify necessary additional information is a major step towards advanced and efficient system operations, with the potential to change the very nature of system development. We share Fujitsu's commitment to improving productivity across the entire industry and establishing new development standards. We look forward to its continued strong promotion as an initiative that will advance the entire industry.\"\n\nShimane Prefectural Central Hospital \n\"The AI-Driven Software Development Platform presented by Fujitsu offers a practical and robust approach to the long-standing challenges faced by medical institutions: the increasing complexity of medical fee calculations and the growing workload of claims processing. The mechanism where AI analyzes legal documents and extracts the relevant areas, while explicitly highlighting points open to interpretation to supplement human judgment, is particularly impressive. This design demonstrates a deep understanding of on-site operations and is highly commendable. Furthermore, the Japanese-specific LLM and the consideration for safety are indispensable elements for AI utilization in the medical field. Beyond medical fee claims, this technology has potential for integration with related areas such as bed management and understanding performance requirements, making a strong contribution to overall hospital operational efficiency in the future. This is a promising initiative that warrants positive consideration for adoption to alleviate the burden on medical professionals.\"\n\nShinichi Aikawa, Executive Officer, Head of Systems Division, SBI Sumishin Net Bank, Ltd.\n“We expect Fujitsu's AI-Driven Software Development Platform to be an initiative with the potential to fundamentally transform the software development process itself. If a world can be realized where everything from requirements definition to design, coding, and testing can be automatically executed in a seamless, one-stop manner, it will be possible to achieve both a dramatic improvement in development speed and quality. \nSince 2024, we have been working with Fujitsu in some areas of this field. Through these initiatives, we are confident that the entire development process will be automated end-to-end in the near future. By realizing this transformation, the possibilities for the services we can provide to our customers will greatly expand. We think about ideas for new services for our customers on a daily basis. This would allow us to rough out these ideas in a short period of time and provide them to our customers quickly. We hope that this new world of value creation will arrive as soon as possible.”\n\nMasaki Murata, Vice President, IBM Japan \n“We strongly believe that Fujitsu’s announcement marks a significant step forward in the evolution of system development in Japan. It aligns closely with IBM Japan’s vision and represents an important initiative that will help shape the future of the industry as a whole. We look forward to driving this momentum together and contributing to the creation of a more robust and vibrant ecosystem.”\n\nRyota Sato, Managing Executive Officer, Global Communications & IT Services Group, Microsoft Japan Co., Ltd. \n\"We sincerely welcome Fujitsu Limited’s announcement of the AI-Driven Software Development Platform as a pioneering initiative that opens a new chapter in system development for the AI era. By orchestrating multiple AI agents to automate the end-to-end development lifecycle—from requirements definition through ongoing enhancement—while integrating human-led quality assurance, this platform embodies a new engineering model in which people and AI truly work together. We view this initiative as highly significant, as it directly addresses the critical challenges facing Japan’s system development industry, including severe talent shortages and the increasing complexity and sophistication of modern systems. We strongly expect this bold effort to drive the evolution of Japan’s system development business and to grow into a transformation model with global relevance. Moving forward, we will continue to work closely with Fujitsu, combining the strengths of both companies to strongly support our customers in their journey toward becoming Frontier Firms.”\n\nTatsuo Ogawa, Executive Officer Group CTO, Panasonic Holdings Corporation\n“We believe that the AI-driven end-to-end automated system development announced this time represents not only a significant improvement in productivity, but also a bold challenge to fundamentally transform the way enterprise IT is delivered. By enabling AI to accurately understand frequently updated regulations and complex business knowledge, including implicit know-how, this approach autonomously executes processes seamlessly from requirements definition through system modification. It has the potential to provide an effective solution to the core challenges posed by legacy systems faced by many Japanese enterprises. We look forward to jointly refining this technology through hands-on practice and advancing co-creation by incorporating on-site expertise of both Panasonic and Fujitsu, with the expectation that it will become a new standard for system development and be deployed broadly not only within Panasonic but across society as a whole.”\n\nExecutive at a major manufacturing company's IT subsidiary\n“We anticipate this initiative will bring about a new transformation in system development. This transformation will be driven by the application of advanced Japanese language processing capabilities—such as the understanding of legal documents—to diverse tasks, the reliable execution of each process through quality auditing functions, and the expansion of these capabilities to scratch development. Furthermore, we believe that AI Ready Engineering, by formalizing expert know-how and domain knowledge into explicit knowledge and transforming it into AI-usable assets, will significantly contribute to the succession of expertise from an increasingly limited pool of skilled professionals. We sincerely hope that the co-creation between the knowledge-inheriting AI and on-site personnel will generate new value and form the cornerstone for innovation in the system development industry, and indeed, across all industries.”\n\nJointly developed by Fujitsu and Cohere Inc.\n\nA national system that reviews public medical fees and adjusts cost allocation for medical procedures.\n\nDevelopment methods where quality is verified at each stage, from software requirements definition, design, and implementation to integration testing.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 represent a set of common goals to be achieved worldwide by 2030.\nFujitsu’s purpose — “to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation” — is a promise to contribute to the vision of a better future empowered by the SDGs.\n\nPublic and Investor Relations Division\n\nAll company or product names mentioned herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners.

    "fullText": "Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris addressed the controversy over CEO Marc Benioff's ICE jokes in an internal meeting, saying he was \"not OK with it,\" Business Insider has learned.\n\n\"Marc made a very bad joke,\" Harris, who is the company's chief technical officer, said. \"But that's something that Marc did, and I'm not gonna call him out in public out on the internet.\"\n\nA transcript of Harris' remarks at a meeting of the product and tech team last week was posted by an employee to a Slack channel. Business Insider verified that the transcript was accurate.\n\nSalesforce did not respond to a request for comment. Benioff has not spoken about the jokes or the company's reaction to them.\n\nIn his meeting, Harris began by addressing a question about why many company leaders had not addressed Benioff's comments at Salesforce's employee-only company kickoff in Las Vegas last Tuesday.\n\n\"So I'll start by saying that somebody already has, and it was immediately leaked,\" Harris said, referring to a Business Insider story about another executive who criticized Benioff's jokes.\n\n\"Let's talk about it with each other and not out to Business Insider and other places because it doesn't do us any good,\" he said, adding, \"It's a violation of the Code of Conduct, and it's a fireable offense. And if we do catch you, we will fire you.\"\n\nAt the kickoff, Benioff made \"multiple\" jokes about ICE, including one about agents surveilling Salesforce employee travel, employees told Business Insider at the time.\n\nWorkers reacted with anger on Slack, which is owned by Salesforce. Slack General Manager Rob Seaman posted a comment saying he could not \"defend or explain\" his boss' comments.\n\n\"They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well,\" he wrote.\n\nCraig Broscow, a Salesforce VP, acknowledged the \"deep disappointment\" in his own Slack message after the kickoff remarks.\n\n\"It would be a step in the right direction and for Marc to acknowledge as soon as possible — ideally publicly — that his attempted joke was extremely upsetting to large segments of his employee base,\" Broscow said.\n\nSpeaking to his team, Harris said Seaman got in hot water for his post.\n\n\"I'll tell you personally, and this is what Rob said as well, and I respect Rob for saying that, but he got in big trouble 'cause it went out on the internet,\" Harris said. \"Personally, I'm not OK with that joke.\"\n\nHarris went on to say that \"it's hard right now with what is going on [in] the US\" and \"what's going in, like, Minneapolis is not about our software. Our software is not being used there.\"\n\nHarris said Salesforce is \"not a political organization\" and encouraged employees to make their views known at the ballot box.\n\n\"I'm going to use my democratic right to vote, and that's how I'm gonna take action against some of the things that I'm not okay with,\" he said.\n\nHe closed with saying, \"So that's my statement. It may not make you feel better. So I'm sorry if it doesn't make you feel better. I think we should keep talking about it. I'm totally fine talking about it more.

    "description": "Nvidia was his dream job, but he got turned down. So this 30-year-old regrouped and strategized. He shares how he got a job offer there.",
    "fullText": "As Sylendran Arunagiri considered moving from India to the US to pursue a master's degree, some friends and mentors advised him to delay his move. They warned that the US tech job market had become too challenging.\n\nArunagiri's goal was to move to the US in late 2023, begin a master's program in product management at Carnegie Mellon University, and land a Big Tech internship for the summer of 2024. He hoped this would be a stepping stone toward landing an AI-related role, ideally at Nvidia, his \"dream company\" because of its central role in the AI technologies he'd long wanted to work on.\n\nHowever, there were several things working against him. For one, the US tech hiring landscape was already creating headaches for job seekers. Openings had plummeted from highs reached a year earlier, and industry layoffs were increasing competition for available roles.\n\nAdditionally, Arunagiri had grown accustomed to the job market in India, where he earned a bachelor's degree and an MBA from top institutions that he said relied on structured campus placement programs to funnel many students directly into jobs. But from what he'd heard, the US was very different. Job fairs were often more like networking events than recruiting opportunities.\n\n\"You're completely on your own,\" said the 30-year-old, who now lives in San Jose.\n\nArunagiri is among the many job seekers who have struggled to navigate a US hiring landscape that's become more challenging in recent years. Amid economic uncertainty, the early effects of generative AI adoption, and a broader push to streamline operations, US businesses are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nStill, some people have managed to break through in a challenging market. Arunagiri shared how he pursued his goal of working at Nvidia — a company he described as his dream employer — and offered his top advice for other job seekers.\n\nMany of the tech companies Arunagiri was targeting had conducted summer internship interviews the previous fall, so he began applying before moving to the US. After sending out many applications, he landed an interview with Nvidia in November 2023.\n\nArunagiri said the interview process went so well that he stopped applying to other internships. But after moving to the US and completing his final interview in February, he learned that he wouldn't be getting the role — which left him scrambling to find another internship.\n\n\"I had to start from scratch, but by then many of the applications had dried out,\" he said\n\nArunagiri was able to land an AI product manager internship based in India at the tech company Informatica. However, that summer, he found it difficult to stop thinking about what went wrong during his interview process with Nvidia — and began setting his sights on eventually landing a full-time role with the company.\n\nUpon reflection, Arunagiri suspected that his final Nvidia interview may have doomed him. He said he was lower energy than usual because he was feeling sick that day, and that he'd been hesitant to postpone it out of fear that the opportunity would be filled in the meantime. In hindsight, he said that decision was likely a mistake.\n\n\"I came off as a dull candidate, but I'm usually energetic and conversational,\" he said. \"I should have probably postponed it to a day that I was feeling better.\"\n\nArunagiri decided to reach out to an HR professional from Nvidia to get insight into where he fell short, and they agreed to jump on a call with him. While they didn't provide specific insights into his candidacy, he said they recommended he try to connect with people at Nvidia in current roles, including hiring managers and interns, to get insight into the kinds of projects they were working on and how he could better align his profile.\n\nHe eventually connected with about five Nvidia interns, who he said provided valuable insights. Those conversations helped shape the personal AI-related projects he began pursuing and sharing on LinkedIn in hopes of standing out.\n\nAfter the summer, Arunagiri dove back into the job search, eager to land a role before he graduated in December 2024. He knew that if he didn't land a job within 90 days after graduation, his F-1 visa restrictions would force him to return to India.\n\nIn September 2024, he submitted a cold application for a technical product marketing role in agentic AI at Nvidia —a role he described as his \"dream AI role\" at his dream company. He was asked to interview starting in October, and around the same time, he was also invited to interview for a more junior product management role at Microsoft.\n\nIn December, with his graduation looming later that month, Arunagiri received offers from Nvidia and Microsoft within days of each other. Given that Nvidia was his dream employer, the role checked a lot of his boxes, and the pay was higher than Microsoft's, he said the decision was fairly easy — and he accepted Nvidia's offer. He said that so far, working at Nvidia has been \"everything that I've dreamed of.\"\n\nArunagiri believes that his LinkedIn presence helped him stand out. During the interview process, he said, the hiring manager told him that he'd reviewed his LinkedIn profile and noticed the projects he'd been working on, including small experiments with new generative AI tools and models he'd shared publicly.\n\nHe has a few pieces of advice for job seekers. First, he said, time management is key, particularly because applying for jobs and connecting with people can be time-consuming. Second, he said, never compare your job search journey to anyone else's, since a variety of factors can influence how it plays out.\n\nRather than quietly applying and networking, he recommends sharing tangible projects publicly — such as posting about AI tools you've explored and linking to projects on LinkedIn or a personal website — so hiring managers can see your work.\n\n\"You need to find something that sets you apart from others,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "\"Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday\" — except when it ends in a midair brawl.\n\nThe British budget carrier has issued lifetime bans to two passengers after a flight from Turkey to England diverted to Belgium on Thursday following a fight on board, the airline told multiple news outlets.\n\nIt's unclear what caused the altercation, but videos circulating on social media show passengers screaming and pushing as cabin crew and others attempted to break it up. The plane later continued to the UK after police removed the two passengers.\n\nJet2 said in a statement that the pair exhibited \"appalling behavior\" and that it would \"vigorously pursue them\" to recoup the costs of the diversion.\n\nDiversions aren't cheap: they can cost airlines tens of thousands of dollars in fuel, labor, and airport fees. Any hotel and transportation costs also add up.\n\n\"As a family-friendly airline, we take a zero-tolerance approach to disruptive passenger behaviour, and we are very sorry that other customers and our colleagues on board had to experience this too,\" the airline said.\n\nJet2 has a history of chasing down unruly passengers. In 2019, the airline barred a disruptive traveler and billed her about $115,000 after she attempted to open an exit door midair, prompting a diversion escorted by military jets. In 2022, two brothers who fought on board another Jet2 flight forced a diversion and were later charged about $68,000 and issued lifetime bans.\n\nOther airlines have taken similar approaches, seeking reimbursement from passengers whose behavior disrupted flights.\n\nBudget competitor Ryanair, for example, last year filed a lawsuit seeking about $18,000 from a passenger it described as disruptive after a diversion to Portugal in April 2024 left 160 people needing overnight accommodation.\n\nUnruly passenger incidents surged during the pandemic, when mask mandates fueled confrontations between travelers and airline staff.\n\nData from the Federal Aviation Administration shows there were nearly 6,000 reports on US airlines in 2021 — up about 500% from roughly 1,000 the year before.\n\nReports fell to about 2,500 in 2022 and further to roughly 1,600 in 2025, though they still remain well above pre-pandemic levels. There have been 126 reports so far in 2026.\n\nThe FAA maintains a zero-tolerance policy and has issued more than $20 million in civil fines since 2020 (these are separate from the money airlines can collect through lawsuits).\n\nIn more extreme cases — such as physical assaults on crew — passengers have faced criminal prosecution, including by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, resulting in larger fines and jail time.",

I was humbled.\n\nHawker centers, like where Ang set up shop, are the go-to for budget meals in Singapore. They're cheap, hearty, and convenient, and I've eaten from them as long as I can remember.\n\nThere are 123 hawker centers in the country, managed by the National Environment Agency. On average, each center has about seven to 10 individual stalls.\n\nTraditionally, they sell dishes like Hainanese chicken rice, bak kut teh, a peppery and flavorful pork soup, or nasi lemak, aromatic rice served with dishes. The stalls are typically run by middle-aged to senior hawkers.\n\nBut as younger hawkers join the business, there's been an increase in specialty stalls selling matcha, craft beer, baked goods, and fusion dishes.\n\nSuccess is an uphill battle, with a massive failure rate due to rising store rents and a frugal consumer base. In 2025, 3,074 food and beverage businesses in Singapore closed their doors, per statistics from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore.\n\nThis has not deterred hopeful entrepreneurs — 4,103 new food businesses opened last year.\n\nMost of the young chefs I interviewed work six to seven days a week, getting up well before the sun rises to prep ingredients for the day and retiring late into the night after feeding hungry dinner crowds.\n\nI spoke with eight Gen Z and millennial F&B owners across the country about what makes them tick, what fears give them chills at night, and if they regret choosing a risky career path.",

    "fullText": "Cosmos floated his quadcopter over the ruined warehouse, guiding it through a corner of the roof where shattered metal sheets had collapsed to form a hole.\n\nThe drone pilot's unit, the Wild Division, suspected that the building was a logistics hub for Russian soldiers, roughly 15 km, or about 9 miles, from the line of contact in southern Ukraine. These hidden locations often held ordnance or fuel stockpiles, and Cosmos' fiber-optic drone was armed with explosives to destroy them.\n\nYet inside, the drone rotated its camera to reveal what looked more like a farmer's garage: Four civilian cars, a pair of motorcycles, and two bridled horses.\n\n\"We had not expected to see this. It was unusual,\" Cosmos told Business Insider, speaking on condition that he be identified only by his call sign.\n\n\"We were expecting to find some armored vehicles,\" he added.\n\nVideo of the discovery went viral last week in Ukraine, as the war has increasingly seen Russian soldiers using unconventional transport tools, such as pack animals and bicycles, to conduct assaults or logistics missions. Cosmos said his drone mission was conducted in early February.\n\nThe smaller profile of a horse or civilian car might be harder for a drone to spot, though Russia's repeated use of them has also raised questions about the viability of its tactics and whether it's been producing enough military equipment to sustain its invasion.\n\nCosmos' squad mates and officers at the Wild Division, a first-person-view drone company in the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, had seen clips of Russian soldiers riding on horses to attack Ukrainian positions before.\n\nOne famous example they remember was in Zaporizhzhia, when a Ukrainian drone crew attacked Russian infantry crossing the front lines on horseback last month.\n\nCosmos, who's been piloting drones for a year, said it was the first time he'd personally seen the animals on the front lines.\n\nHe flew his explosive-laden drone straight into the back of one of the cars, and said his crew later struck several other vehicles inside. When Russian troops moved their transport assets, the Wild Division found the next warehouse and attacked that one, too, Cosmos said.\n\n\"The enemy usually lives in hiding close to these places,\" Cosmos said of the warehouse. \"It's common for us to check all targets. Sometimes we can see the enemy infantry, or you can see their vehicles.\"\n\nThe Wild Division declined to say where exactly the warehouse was located, but its brigade is generally deployed in the Donbas.\n\nThe commander of Cosmos' battalion told Business Insider that the discovery of the horses surprised him, too.\n\n\"I thought it had been a location for transport vehicles, sort of a transfer hub,\" said the major, whose call sign is Fizruk.\n\nFizruk said the appearance of horses and cars in his area of the front line could be a sign that Russian forces are running low on standard resources, but also reflects Moscow's attritional nature of fighting.\n\nThe cars discovered by Cosmos appear to be Nivas, inexpensive civilian off-road vehicles from the Russian Lada car brand.\n\n\"They treat these like they will be losses anyway, that they will be destroyed anyway,\" he said. \"Look, a Niva costs, let's say, $2,000. A Hummer, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine uses in many places, costs $20,000, maybe more.\"\n\n\"Since they lose their equipment in assaults, from that point of view, why pay $20,000 for one vehicle if you can buy 10 Nivas for $20,000?\" Fizruk added.\n\nThe Kremlin is known to pressure the front line with repeated ground assaults, sending small groups of infantry to approach Ukrainian positions on foot or in cheap vehicles. The strategy has been costly, with NATO now saying that up to 25,000 Russian troops are dying each month.\n\nSustaining that style of war has pushed Moscow to informal means of recruitment and weapons procurement, including hiring troops from overseas and receiving ammunition from North Korea.",

    "description": "Even though he realized right away, it took TK three years to quit what he thought was his dream career since college.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nic Huzz, 28, who quit a Sydney-based venture capital job to run a silent disco business in Bali, Indonesia. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was never one of those kids who knew what they wanted to be when they grew up.\n\nWhen I was six, we were asked to draw a picture of our future job. I stared at a blank page until I remembered a weekend trip to the mall with my mom, where I'd wandered into a game store and decided the owner must get to play with the toys all day. So I just drew that.\n\nThat uncertainty followed me even when I was 18. When it came time for university, I did what everyone told me to do: choose something broad, keep my options open. I studied communications and entrepreneurship, took on unpaid internships, and worked my way into the startup world. Eventually, I got a full time role at what I thought was my dream job: working at a venture capital firm in Sydney.\n\nOn paper, it was perfect. I was helping founders build companies. I had a title people respected.\n\nBut within a month of starting full time, I realized I wasn't happy. The job wasn't bad, and that was part of the problem. I'd spent years chasing it, and when I finally arrived, I felt empty. I began to understand that what I actually wanted wasn't the job itself, but the validation I thought came with it.\n\nMost days, I sat behind a desk from 9 to 5. The parts I loved — facilitating programs, traveling, working with founders — made up a small fraction of my week. I realized I had too much energy to sit still in an office for that long.\n\nThen, in 2020, lockdowns hit, and the job became even more soul-crushing because I didn't have the weekends to escape it all. Even though I figured out that I wasn't happy nearly right away, it took me more than three years to quit.\n\nI tried everything. For the first two years, I went on this massive journey where I learned how I could start designing a life that feels true for me. I spent around 42,000 Australian dollars, or $30,000, on more than 50 self-help coaches, programs, online learning courses, and books. You name it, I did it. I had all the mental models and frameworks in the world, but little about my reality changed.\n\nI began to realize that you don't rise to the level of your ambitions — you fall to the level of what feels safe. I was stuck because of fear: fear of judgment, failure, and not being good enough.\n\nIn the months before I quit, I challenged myself to do one thing every week that genuinely terrified me. At first, it was small — posting a vulnerable video online, dancing on my Instagram story, performing magic tricks for strangers in restaurants. Then it escalated to stand-up comedy and singing in public, with no background in either. Within five weeks of that challenge, I'd moved to Bali to work remotely for the firm.\n\nAbout three months after working from Bali in 2023, I got a text from my boss saying we were opening a new office in Sydney and that it was time for me to come back. I remember my body physically froze, and I told her I could not do it.\n\nShe told me she saw it coming and was actually proud of me for finally saying it and wanting to move on to do different things.\n\nI didn't have an alternate plan for months and was living off my savings. I went from earning 85,000 Australian dollars a year to earning nothing. For months, I lived on a few hundred dollars a week. Twice, my bank account dropped close to zero.\n\nAs part of my challenge, I had started bringing a couple of silent disco headphones to the beaches in Bali and Thailand and was asking strangers to join me as I danced. More and more people kept joining each time I did it, and a friend suggested I start taking donations. My imposter syndrome crept in, and I told them that I was just doing it for fun. I was so conditioned to associate work with suffering that it felt unfair to make money while having fun.\n\nI finally listened to my friends about the donations. At the fourth or fifth disco, I remember making more money in an hour than I did in a day at my corporate job. I started running silent disco sessions and was even asked if I could rent out my headsets to others.\n\nAt one point, a club owner asked if I could provide them with 300 headsets, and I had to go to the best bank in the world — the bank of mom and dad — for a loan to buy 250 more headsets. The loan was worth more than I had earned in the past 12 months, but it helped me eventually support major conferences in Bali, such as AWS, Amazon, and IBM.\n\nLast year, I made around 30,000 Australian dollars, which is a lot less than I made in Sydney. But I wake up excited every day and get to choose where I live and how I work.\n\nMy nervous system went through hell getting here, and I don't believe anyone should quit their job overnight. But I do think most of us stay stuck because we think safety comes from a salary. I've learned that it comes from trusting myself.",

This included pictures of children.\n\nThe commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, said in the release that it notified X of the investigation on Monday.\n\nX did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nGrok is a chatbot developed by Musk's xAI, now a subsidiary of his aerospace company SpaceX.\n\nThe commission's investigation follows several weeks of controversy around Grok and X. The platform came under fire worldwide in January after reports emerged of Grok users generating sexualized images of real people, including minors.\n\nCountries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines temporarily suspended access to Grok. The European Commission launched an investigation into Grok, while India's information technology ministry voiced its opposition via a letter to the chief compliance officer of X's India operations.\n\nCalifornia's Attorney General, Rob Bonta, also said in early January that he had launched a probe into Grok's AI deepfakes.\n\nIn response, X made Grok's AI image generation tool a premium feature limited to paying subscribers and later stopped it from generating sexualized images altogether. However, a Business Insider report found that it was still possible to trigger these images in Grok's web and mobile applications.\n\nIn response to backlash over Grok, Musk said in an X post on January 3, \"Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"",

    "description": "A hierarchy of simplicity for every layer of the stack. Flask over Django, HTML over React, bare server over Kubernetes, small models over the latest GPT. And when each one actually earns its complexity.",
    "fullText": "2026-02-14 · engineering, architecture, opinion, simplicity, ai\n\nThere's a mass delusion in software engineering that more tools equals more capability. That if Netflix uses Kubernetes, you should too. That if Facebook built React, your three-page marketing site needs it. That the \"modern stack\" is modern for a reason, and choosing anything simpler means you're behind.\n\nIt's nonsense. Most of the time, the simplest tool that solves your problem is the right tool. Not the most popular one. Not the one with the best conference talks. The one with the fewest moving parts.\n\nHere's how I think about technology choices, layer by layer.\n\nIf you're building an API, start with FastAPI or Flask. One file. A few routes. You can read the entire application in ten minutes. There's no ORM you didn't ask for, no admin panel you'll never use, no middleware stack you need to understand before you can return JSON.\n\nDjango is a different tool for a different problem. It's an application framework, not a microframework. It makes decisions for you: how your database models work, how authentication works, how your admin interface looks. If you're building a product with user accounts, permissions, a database-backed admin panel, and you have a team of five or more, Django saves you months. It's opinionated in ways that keep large teams from making inconsistent choices.\n\nThe mistake is reaching for Django when you need three endpoints and a database query. You'll spend more time learning what Django wants than building what you want.\n\nSpring is the same idea taken further. Enterprise teams, compliance requirements, complex service meshes. If you're at a bank with 200 engineers and a mandate to use Java, Spring is genuinely good at what it does. If you're two people building a SaaS, it'll bury you.\n\nThe rule: Pick the framework whose complexity matches your problem's complexity. If you can describe your backend in one sentence, you probably need a one-file framework.\n\nThis is where the industry has lost its mind the most.\n\nPlain HTML with some CSS works for an astonishing number of things. This site you're reading is static HTML. No JavaScript framework. No build step. No node_modules folder with 800 packages. I write Markdown, a Python script generates HTML, and Nginx serves it. It loads in under a second on any connection.\n\nWhen you need interactivity, HTMX is a revelation. It lets you add dynamic behavior by writing HTML attributes instead of JavaScript. Need a button that loads content without a page refresh? One attribute. Need a form that submits asynchronously? One attribute. You keep writing HTML and your server keeps rendering HTML. No JSON APIs, no client-side state management, no hydration bugs.\n\nSvelte sits in a similar sweet spot. It compiles to vanilla JavaScript. No virtual DOM. No runtime library. The output is small and fast. If you need more interactivity than HTMX gives you but don't want the overhead of a full SPA framework, Svelte is excellent.\n\nReact makes sense when you're building a genuinely complex, stateful application. Think Figma. Think Google Docs. Think Notion. Applications where the UI has hundreds of independent state changes, where components need to communicate across deep trees, where you need a component ecosystem because you're building something too large for one team to own entirely.\n\nThe problem is that people use React for everything. Landing pages. Blogs. Documentation sites. Marketing pages. I've seen teams spend three sprints setting up Next.js for a site that could have been twenty HTML files. The framework overhead, the build pipeline, the SSR complexity, the hydration issues. All of it unnecessary. All of it actively making the product worse by making it slower and harder to maintain.\n\nI run this site on a Raspberry Pi behind Nginx. The deploy script is 40 lines of bash. rsync copies files, Nginx serves them. If the Pi dies, I buy a new one for $50 and rsync again. Total infrastructure cost: about 5 watts of electricity. Twelve months in, it's still running.\n\nFor most small projects and early-stage products, a single server with systemd services is all you need. You SSH in. You know what's running. You can read the logs. When something breaks, you fix it directly. There's one machine, one set of logs, one reality to debug.\n\nDocker containers make sense when you need reproducible environments. When your app has dependencies that conflict with other things on the same machine. When you need to hand off a project and say \"run docker compose up and it works.\" When you're deploying the same service across staging and production and need them to be identical. Containers solve real problems.\n\nBut Docker adds a layer. Now you're debugging things inside a container that works differently than your local machine. Now your logs are in a different place. Now you need to understand volumes, networks, build caches. Every layer you add is a layer you need to understand when things go wrong.\n\nKubernetes makes sense at scale. When you have dozens of services, when you need automated scaling, when you need rolling deployments with zero downtime across multiple regions. When you have a platform team whose full-time job is managing infrastructure. Google built Kubernetes because Google has Google-sized problems.\n\nIf you're three engineers running a SaaS with a few thousand users, Kubernetes is not solving your problem. It's replacing your problem with a harder problem. You'll spend more time writing YAML manifests and debugging pod scheduling than building your product.\n\nI've watched startups with five engineers spend months setting up Kubernetes clusters. The CTO wanted it on the resume. The engineers wanted to learn it. The product needed a VPS and a Postgres database. They could have shipped in a week and scaled later. Instead they built infrastructure for a million users while they had twelve.\n\nSQLite is the most underrated database in existence. It's a single file. No server process. No connection management. No port configuration. It handles more concurrent reads than most apps will ever need. If your data fits on one machine and you don't need concurrent writes from multiple processes, SQLite is fast, reliable, and effectively zero maintenance.\n\nPostgres is the right choice for most production applications. It's battle-tested, well-documented, and handles basically everything. JSON columns, full-text search, geospatial queries, pub/sub. Before you reach for Redis, Elasticsearch, or any other specialized database, check if Postgres can already do what you need. It usually can.\n\nDistributed databases (CockroachDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) solve problems that 99% of applications don't have. If you need writes across multiple regions with single-digit millisecond latency, sure. If you need to handle millions of writes per second, sure. If you're building a CRUD app with a few thousand users, a single Postgres instance on a $20/month VPS will serve you for years.\n\nThis is the one closest to home because I build tools around this exact principle at NehmeAI Labs.\n\nThe default instinct right now is to throw the biggest frontier model at every problem. Summarization? Frontier model. Classification? Frontier model. Extracting a date from an email? Frontier model. It's the Kubernetes of AI: massively capable, massively overkill for most tasks.\n\nA 4B parameter model trained on a specific task will outperform a 400B general model on that task. Not sometimes. Reliably. FlashCheck is a 4B model that detects hallucinations in RAG pipelines. It scores 91.7% on RAGTruth. It beats Llama 405B on this specific task while using 100x less compute. Not because small models are magic, but because a focused model doesn't waste capacity on things it doesn't need to know.\n\nThe same logic applies to inference costs. Most teams routing everything through their most expensive model are sending simple prompts to a frontier model because they never measured whether a cheaper one could handle it. RightSize exists to answer exactly that question: it evaluates your real prompt traffic and finds where smaller, cheaper models are sufficient. Typical savings are 50-100x. Not because the quality drops. Because most prompts don't need the most powerful model available.\n\nThis maps directly to the philosophy of this entire post. Your inference costs are a design choice, not a fact of life. You don't start with the biggest model and optimize later. You start with the smallest model that works and scale up only where the task demands it.\n\nThe pattern is always the same. Start simple. Measure. Add complexity only where the data tells you to.\n\nI'm not arguing that simple is always right. I'm arguing that it's the right default. You should start simple and add complexity when you feel the pain, not before.\n\nHere's when you genuinely need the heavier tools:\n\nLarge teams. Django's opinions prevent 50 engineers from making 50 different architectural choices. React's component model lets teams work on the same frontend without stepping on each other. Kubernetes lets a platform team provide self-service infrastructure to dozens of product teams. The overhead pays for itself through coordination.\n\nCompliance and enterprise. Banks, healthcare, government. When you need audit trails, role-based access at every layer, and the ability to prove exactly what ran in production six months ago. Spring Boot's security stack and Kubernetes' declarative infrastructure make compliance audits possible at scale.\n\nGenuine scale. When your SQLite file would be terabytes. When your single server can't handle the traffic. When you actually have the users and the load that demand distributed systems. The key word is \"actually.\" Not \"projected.\" Not \"hoped for.\" Actually. And when you do migrate, be honest that it's a rewrite, not a simple upgrade.\n\nComplex client-side applications. If your users spend hours in your app doing complex, stateful work (design tools, collaborative editors, data dashboards), React or similar frameworks earn their complexity budget.\n\nEvery tool you add is a tool you need to:\n\nA three-person startup using Kubernetes, React, GraphQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Terraform has the operational complexity of a 50-person engineering org without the people to manage it. They'll spend 70% of their time on infrastructure and 30% on the product. That ratio should be inverted.\n\nThe best engineers I know aren't the ones who use the most tools. They're the ones who use the fewest tools that solve the problem. They resist the urge to optimize for problems they don't have. They ship with boring technology and save the interesting technology for when it's actually needed.\n\nSimple isn't a limitation. It's a discipline. And the debugging is a lot easier when there are fewer layers to dig through.",

    "fullText": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed an executive order on Monday, intending to speed up the permitting process within the state government.\n\nThe order mandates that any cabinet-level state agency, board, or commission review its permitting process within 120 days. Specific agencies mentioned in the Order include the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy and Environment, the Department of Labor and Licensing and the Department of Health.\n\nGov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders addresses Arkansas linemen ahead of winter storm\n\nWithin 180 days, the order continues, the same agencies must submit a written improvement plan to the governor that focuses on improving the current process. Where possible, agencies are expected to establish clear, publicly available timelines for all major permits and licenses, develop one-stop online application portals, expand concurrent reviews across agencies and provide applicants with real-time status updates and single points of contact.\n\n“Arkansas is one of the best states in the nation to start, build, and grow a business – but we have to do better to compete across the country and globe,” the governor said. “This Executive Order puts people before paperwork, adding transparency and speed to our permitting process to ensure major economic development projects aren’t held up by unnecessary red tape.”\n\nGov. Sanders announces measures to strengthen rural healthcare\n\nA text of the order is on the governor’s website.",

    "fullText": "PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) — A shooting during a Rhode Island youth hockey game left three people dead, including the shooter, and three more hospitalized Monday night in critical condition, authorities said.\n\nPawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters that someone helped bring a swift end to the violent scene Monday afternoon by intervening and trying to subdue the shooter, who was at an arena to watch a family member's hockey game. The shooter died from an apparent self-inflicted gun wound, she said, noting that authorities were still investigating.\n\n“It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,” she said.\n\nGoncalves identified the shooter as Robert Dorgan, who she said also went by the name Roberta Esposito and was born in 1969.\n\nThe police chief did not provide further details about the shooter or the victims, except for saying it appeared that both victims who died were adults.\n\nShe said investigators were trying to piece together what happened and have spoken with scores of witnesses who were there inside Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, a few miles outside Providence. They also were reviewing video taken from the hockey game. Unverified footage circulating on social media shows players diving for cover and fans fleeing their seats after popping sounds are heard.\n\nOutside the arena, tearful families and high school hockey players still in uniform were seen hugging before they boarded a bus to leave the area.\n\nMonday's shooting came nearly two months after Rhode Island was rocked by a gun violence tragedy at Brown University, where a gunman killed two students and wounded nine others. That shooter went on to also fatally shoot a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor. Authorities later found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a New Hampshire storage facility.\n\n“The fortunate thing is that the two incidents are not related, but it is very tragic,” Pawtucket Mayor Don Grebien said. “These are high school kids. They were doing an event, they were playing with their families watching, a fun time, and it turned into this.”\n\nPawtucket is nestled just north of Providence and right under the Massachusetts state border. A city of just under 80,000, Pawtucket had up until recently been known as the home to Hasbro’s headquarters.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the shooting occurred on Monday, not Tuesday.",

Quality stocks are those with strong and consistent cash flow and earnings, experienced management teams, and competitive advantages.\n\nIt may sound like an obvious place to be at all times, not just when things are volatile. But the factor has lagged the broader market over the last year and beyond as investors have piled into more speculative stocks.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan data, quality is in one of its worst stretches in almost two decades. Here's the performance of the MSCI World Quality Index relative to the MSCI World Index.\n\nHere's a year-by-year look at the performance. Quality stocks underperformed their counterparts by almost 5% in 2025.\n\nRough patches like this have, in the past, tended to bode well for future performance, the bank said.\n\n\"Periods of quality underperformance can be followed by sharp reversals,\" Meera Pandit, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a February 4 report.\n\nWhat's more, if the broader market were to plummet, investors are likely flock to the quality factor, the report said.\n\n\"The period from 2003 to 2008 provides a prime example. Higher-quality companies lagged broader developed markets for four consecutive years from 2003 to 2006, in the run-up to the global financial crisis,\" Pandit said. \"But as the cycle matured and the global economy eventually entered recession, higher-quality fundamentals returned to the fore, with quality stocks outperforming by 7 percentage points in both 2007 and 2008.\"\n\n\"Developed market stocks have seen nine drawdowns of 10% or more over the last 30 years,\" the report continued. \"During these periods, quality stocks have outperformed 78% of the time, with a median excess return of 3.4 percentage points.\"\n\nExamples of broader quality factor funds include the iShares MSCI Global Quality Factor ETF (AQLT) and the Vanguard US Quality Factor ETF (VFQY).\n\nBut for investors who do decide to lean into quality stocks, Pandit said to be conscious of those with a high weighting in AI stocks, as the theme could lead the next market drawdown.",

    "fullText": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had a run-in with Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week on the origins of America’s cowboy, leading to a broader conversation on the history of the West.\n\nWhile criticizing a recent speech, Ocasio-Cortez took issue with what she claimed was Rubio’s statement that America’s cowboys came from Spain.\n\n“My favorite part was when he said that American cowboys came from Spain,” she said in her criticism of Rubio’s speech. “And I believe the Mexicans and descendants of African enslaved peoples would like to have a word on that.”\n\nAOC mocks Rubio: \"My favorite part is he said cowboys are rooted in Spain. Uhhh, speak to Mexicans & African slaves!\"\n\nSpain introduced horses to Mexico pic.twitter.com/xHt1jZCoSi\n\n— End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) February 15, 2026\n\nThe comment quickly went viral, with experts weighing in on what is believed to have been a mix of origins for cowboy culture in America.\n\nThe History Channel reports that America’s cowboy culture stretches back further than America itself, to the era of Spanish colonialism.\n\n“Hundreds of years before there was the American cowboy, there was the vaquero,” it says, referring to expert horsemen who came after the Spaniards landed in 1519 in what is now Mexico.\n\nThe first vaqueros, it says, were “Indigenous Mesoamerican men who learned from their Spanish colonizers how to herd cattle on horseback.”\n\nIndependent historian Pablo A. Rangel, who has studied vaquero history extensively, says it is “a forgotten history of centuries of horsemanship in the Americas that roots the vaqueros in the colonial past.”\n\nThe word “vaquero” itself comes from “vaca,” which is the Spanish word for cow. As Spain extended its North American Empire into what are now Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California, the vaquero played a crucial role. The vaquero domesticated wild horses, braided ropes, constructed saddles, and learned to use a lasso expertly.\n\nMany cowboys’ traditions actually originated with the Spanish and Mexicans.\n\nThe word “lasso” itself comes from “lazo,” Spanish for “rope.” The early cowboys’ ropes were made of braided leather and horsehair. The vaquero’s rope skills are now an important part of rodeo competitions.\n\nThe chaps also originated from “chaparreras,” which protected gear from “chaparral,” a type of Southwestern brush.\n\nAs ranching expanded into what was then known as New Spain, the vaquero also functioned as an auxiliary force in regional battles. The vaquero played an important role at missions, especially in California.\n\nSeveral cultures contributed to the development of cowboy culture, which later spread to the United States.\n\nFollowing Texas’ independence from Mexico and subsequent admittance to the U.S. in 1845, Anglo settlers began to assume ranch duties. The Mexicans remained as skilled laborers on Texas ranches, training Anglo cowboys in horse and cattle skills.\n\nHistorians estimate that as many as one-fourth of all cowboys in the 19th century were black.\n\nPerformers such as Buffalo Bill Cody also incorporated Mexican vaqueros into their traveling Wild West shows, though in a rather romanticized, stereotypical fashion. The Hollywood Westerns of the early 20th century began to portray cowboys as heroic white Americans, rather than the multiracial groups that developed the practice.\n\n“That’s when the vaquero turns into something else,” Rangel told the History Channel. “He becomes this racialized, vilified character.”\n\nThe post AOC Schools Marco Rubio on Cowboys, Ends Up Needing a History Lesson Herself appeared first on Where Is The Buzz | Breaking News, Entertainment, Exclusive Interviews & More.",

    "description": "Although China launching a hypersonic missile towards America isn't that simple, it may still surprise you just how fast these weapons could reach the West.",
    "fullText": "Technological advancements are a double edged-sword. Telecommunication and fast transport through airplanes have made life much more convenient, and medical advancements have made conditions easier to treat. However, that same science is used to create weapons of mass destruction that can potentially leave everlasting stains on human history. A hypersonic missile is one of the scariest, being able to traverse the globe faster than sound.\n\nHypersonic missiles move at five times the speed of sound, meaning they can go over Mach 5 (3,836 miles per hour). Most commercial airplanes are slower than Mach 1, making such high speeds impossible to comprehend. China has a number of terrifying technologies at its disposal — such as its large aircraft carrier with a 100 drone capacity or high-powered drone-frying microwave – but even a simple missile is more than a significant threat. If China suddenly targeted U.S. soil, how fast would a hypersonic missile land, and would we even have enough time to intercept it?\n\nTo answer, we'd need to calculate wind turbulence, the angle of projection, the curvature of the earth, gravity, and additional factors that require a group of engineers. Fortunately, we don't need all that to get a good estimate. We can just use the formula for speed, distance, and time: Time = Distance/Speed. Generally, it can take anywhere from around an hour to less than 20 minutes, depending on certain factors.\n\nChina has many different weapons with varying speeds and distances. For this calculation, we'll use the DF-27A due to its high maneuverability and relatively fast speed –- though China has faster missiles around.\n\nWe can assume the missile originates from China's Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi which is 5,130 miles to Hawaii, 5,650 miles to Seattle, and 7,080 miles to New York. The DF-27A is said to reach average speeds of around Mach 8.6, which means it can cover 6,598 miles in an hour. Plugging these numbers into the formula, the missile would take 47 minutes to reach Hawaii, 51 to Seattle, and 64 to New York from mainland China.\n\nKeep in mind that these only account for a specific scenario, though. If China chose to target an island like Guam — just 2,676 miles away from Shanxi — the missile will reach in just 24 minutes. If China launches it from a coastal city like Fuzou — where the distance to Guam becomes just 1,864 miles — it'll only take 17 minutes for the missile to hit.\n\nEven if China could send a hypersonic missile at America out of the blue, our theoretical experiment isn't as simple as it seems. China is fully capable of attacking certain U.S. cities, but an Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) like the DF-27 simply isn't built for such distances. The missile could still hit Guam or other remote islands, but it can't travel further away in Central America.\n\nThis doesn't mean that China can't target Central American cities, though, just that a hypersonic missile like the DF-27 wouldn't be what they use. High-supersonic Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) like the DF-31, the DF-41, and the DF-5C can all travel much further, with DF-5C specifically having global access. The DF-27 is considered more of a threat because of its use of a Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV) that is significantly harder to predict the path of – something that might become even scarier with China getting access to better NVIDIA AI chips.\n\nA DF-5C nuclear warhead would take less than half the time to the American mainland as a DF-27. Resources estimate its speed at tens of Mach, with some claiming it can reach Mach 22. At Mach 22, it'll take 6 minutes to reach Guam, 19 minutes to Hawaii, 20 minutes to Seattle, and 25 minutes to New York. If you order pizza at the same time China presses launch, the missile will likely reach first.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

The accident triggered a grueling 17-hour ordeal, including a nine-hour technical rescue operation through some of the most challenging vertical terrain in the state.\n\nRescuers had to navigate the injured woman through narrow \"squeezes,\" including one measuring just 12 inches by 36 inches, as well as vertical pits ranging from 30 to 90 feet in depth. According to a statement from an official oversight member, the route involved a series of steep drops known as the \"Poltergeist Pit\" and \"Demon Drop\".\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol’s Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) team made contact with the cave researchers at 3 a.m. Sunday. BORSTAR agents provided fresh manpower and additional ropes, allowing the team to move the patient through the final vertical pits and a narrow squeeze without the time-consuming need to de-rig and reset rescue lines.\n\nThe researcher finally exited the cave at 4:45 a.m. and was taken across uneven terrain to a waiting AeroCare helicopter. She was airlifted to a hospital in Odessa, where she remains in the intensive care unit. Officials did not release her condition, but stated she was stable.\n\nThe massive effort included the Terrell County Sheriff’s Office, Texas Game Wardens and Texas DPS, Sanderson and Fort Stockton Fire Departments, Sanderson EMS, and National Cave Rescue Commission and San Antonio Technical Rescue.\n\nSorcerer’s Cave, located on private land in remote Terrell County, in the broader area of the Big Bend region, is noted for its record-setting depth of 567 feet and the \"Sirion River,\" a subterranean waterway flowing along the bottom. Experts note that while the cave is a site of significant scientific interest, its vertical layout makes it exceptionally dangerous for the inexperienced or the injured.\n\nInformation in this article is from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Terrell County Sheriff's Office and a statement from a person directly involved in the oversight of the caving operation.",

    "fullText": "Feb 16 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX and its wholly-owned subsidiary xAI are competing in a secret new Pentagon contest to ‌produce voice-controlled, autonomous drone swarming technology, Bloomberg News reported on ‌Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and the Pentagon's defense innovation unit ​did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not independently verify the report.\n\nTexas-based SpaceX recently acquired xAI in a deal that combined Musk's major space and defense contractor with the billionaire entrepreneur's artificial ‌intelligence startup. It occurred ahead ⁠of SpaceX's planned initial public offering this year.\n\nMusk's companies are reportedly among a select few chosen to participate ⁠in the $100 million prize challenge initiated in January, according to the Bloomberg report.\n\nThe six-month competition aims to produce advanced swarming technology that can translate ​voice ​commands into digital instructions and run ​multiple drones, the report said.\n\nMusk ‌was among a group of AI and robotics researchers who wrote an open letter in 2015 that advocated a global ban on \"offensive autonomous weapons,\" arguing against making \"new tools for killing people.\"\n\nThe U.S. Defense Secretary last year outlined a new strategy to accelerate drone development and deployment ‌by aiming to cut bureaucracy and boost ​domestic drone manufacturing.\n\nThe U.S. also has been ​seeking safe and cost-effective ​ways to neutralize drones, particularly around airports and large ‌sporting events - a concern that has ​become more urgent ​ahead of the FIFA World Cup and America250 anniversary celebrations this summer.\n\nOpenAI, Alphabet's Google, Anthropic and xAI last year won contracts ​that are worth ‌up to $200 million each and aimed at scaling up adoption ​of advanced AI capabilities in the Pentagon.",

    "description": "\"They expected me to teach her the job they said I wasn't good enough for.\"",
    "fullText": "A TikTok creator is going viral after refusing to train the 25-year-old coworker who was promoted over her, arguing that companies routinely exploit experienced workers while favoring younger and cheaper employees.\n\nThe creator, who goes by The Unobsolete (@theunobsolete), said her employer expected her to hand over decades of knowledge for free, despite passing her over for the role.\n\nIn the Feb. 10, 2026 video, she explained why she said no and the fallout that resulted from her decision.\n\n“They expected me to teach her the job they said I wasn’t good enough for,” The Unobsolete said.\n\nShe went on to say that if they wanted her 25 years of knowledge, they would have to pay her appropriately. Furthermore, she was not going to be passed up for someone younger, willing to work for a fraction of her salary, and then use her experience to train them.\n\n“I’m not your free training program,” she explained. “Want me to smile while you humiliate me? Wrong person.”\n\nThe creator received backlash from her company for her decision, but she told viewers that she didn’t care.\n\n“They said (I was) not supporting team. I said (the) team didn’t support me.”\n\nThe video concluded with some words of advice for navigating the corporate landscape: “The second you stop being useful, they stop pretending to care,” she said.\n\n“So stop pretending you owe them anything.”\n\nThe video immediately went viral, receiving nearly 4 million views and 400,000 likes. Most comments were in support of the creator, applauding her for setting boundaries and pushing back against age discrimination.\n\n“Can’t be a team player for a team that played you,” said one user. Another said, “Someone should tell corporate America that is illegal.”\n\nAnother simply wrote, “ageism is very alive and well.”\n\nOthers recounted their own workplace inequities. “They hired 6 people to replace me and the work I was doing & wanted me to train them.” One TikToker recounted. “Nope.”\n\n“My aunt sued the state of Ohio for the exact situation and she won her suit,” said another. “You did the right thing.”\n\nForbes reported that 99% of workers over the age of 40 reported ageism in the workplace. This included navigating ageist stereotypes, bullying, and feeling pressure to hide their age.\n\nAdditionally, according to the AARP 22% of workers over 50 years old say they are being pushed out of their job because of their age.\n\nA day after posting the TikTok, The Unobsolete posted an update to her situation, garnering over 2.3 million views.\n\nShe shared that she had a meeting discussing her “attitude.” While she didn’t get fired (which would be illegal), after the meeting, she began being excluded from company functions and given less work.\n\nAdditionally, her interactions were constantly being scrutinized. This was no surprise, as she was warned in the meeting that the company’s culture might not be a “good fit” for her.\n\n“I agree,” the Unobsolete said in the meeting. “A culture that exploits experience isn’t a fit for me.”\n\nThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.",

    "fullText": "Since the Nancy Guthrie case began, the Pima County Sheriff, Chris Nanos, has faced intense scrutiny from the public and experts alike. Now, he has shared news about the personal tragedy he has been dealing with throughout the investigation. The law enforcement official's brother died the day after Nancy was reported missing. That fact adds another heartbreaking layer to this profoundly tragic story.\n\nEven though the FBI has been involved in Nancy Guthrie's abduction case, the Pima County Sheriff, Chris Nanos, has been the public face of the investigation from day one. That is the case because he has repeatedly spoken to the press to provide updates and dispel rumors. While his interactions with the press have been focused on trying to get to the bottom of what has happened to Savannah Guthrie's mom, he recently briefly opened up about his own loss.\n\nDuring a February 2026 Daily Mail interview, he was telling the outlet about having thick skin amid the criticism he has received. In that context, Nanos shared that the day after Nancy was taken, his own brother, who was in hospice, passed away. Knowing that the man who has spent days fighting to return a mother to her family has recently lost his own sibling adds a poignant twist to this already devastating case.\n\nHigh-profile criminal cases like this one naturally draw heavy criticism from the interested public. That has definitely been the case for Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos and his team. Even the Daily Mail article that revealed the news about the Sheriff's brother dying featured a headline that called the Guthrie case's investigation \"shambolic.\" That is especially incredible since the report quoted Nanos asking the media to be more responsible.\n\nWhile speaking to the outlet, the Sheriff urged the online media conjecture about Tommaso Cioni to stop. \"People out there can get pretty ugly and mean and nasty and not have the facts,' he said. 'I tell my journalists, you guys need to be a little more responsible… because that's just really nasty stuff.\"\n\nAfter stressing that nobody has been ruled out in the investigation, Nanos pushed back on baseless online rumors about the Guthrie family members. \"I understand the pundits are out there. They're gonna say, well, he's the last one to see her alive. We understand that stuff. But, my goodness, you're putting a mark on somebody who could be completely innocent. And more important than that, he's family.\"\n\nHe also discussed observers who've criticized aspects of the investigation, like how quickly the police released the crime scene at Nancy Guthrie's home. Nanos explained that he was confident that his officers had thoroughly searched the scene for evidence. \"My officers were there for almost 20 hours, and they processed their scene, got it done, and brought in all the evidence,' he said. 'Then the FBI came and did their thing.\"\n\nNanos' defense of the investigation also centered on allegations that have been made about him personally. In response to reports claiming he'd blocked the FBI from gaining access to evidence, he completely disputed that. \"That's just so far-fetched. Why would I do that? It makes no sense.\"",

    "fullText": "A tractor-trailer drove off the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel on Sunday, killing the driver.\n\nRonnie Andrews, 61, of Robersonville, North Carolina, was identified as the driver. His body was recovered with the truck later Sunday.\n\nAt about 6:30 a.m., the tractor-trailer went overboard, just south of Fisherman’s Island after a single-vehicle crash near the North Channel Bridge.\n\nThe tractor-trailer was a Perdue Farms vehicle.\n\n“Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family, friends, and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,” a Perdue spokesperson said. “He had been a valued member of our team, and his loss will be deeply felt across our organization.”\n\nThe spokesperson said the company is fully cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues.\n\nAt 9:21 a.m., there was a wind advisory for the bridge-tunnel, meaning there were wind speeds of 35 mph. The speed limit was reduced to 45 mph on the bridge-tunnel with no passing allowed. In a statement sent Sunday evening, a spokesperson for the bridge-tunnel said weather was not a factor in the crash.\n\nThe crash caused guardrail and curb damage to the bridge-tunnel, and maintenance crews made emergency repairs. Traffic was stopped on the bridge while repairs were made. As of Sunday evening, a single lane of southbound traffic was open as crews completed repairs. A spokesperson advised that repairs could take several days.\n\n“The thoughts and prayers of everyone at the CBBT are with the family, loved ones and fellow employees of Mr. Andrews during this difficult time,” said Jeff Holland, Executive Director of the CBBT in a statement.\n\nThere is a very small margin of error for tractor-trailers on the bridge-tunnel, which is the only direct link between Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore and is used by travelers along the East Coast. The guardrails on the bridge are designed to withstand glancing blows from cars or pickup trucks going 62 mph or less.\n\nThe posted speed limit is 55 mph. These guardrails are not as strong as the concrete jersey barriers at the Hampton Roads and the Monitor-Merrimac bridge-tunnels.",

However, things are different for Colorado.\n\nInstead of needing to finalize one position, Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter explains the Rockies' need to finalize their entire infield situation minus shortstop.\n\n\"There's casting a wide net, and then there's whatever the Rockies are doing when it comes to building their 2026 infield. Ezequial Tovar is locked in at shortstop, but the other three spots are truly wide open. Edouard Julien figures to start somewhere on the right side of the infield, while Kyle Karros showed enough last year to get an extended look at the hot corner. Ryan Ritter has a 20/20 ceiling and veteran Willi Castro can plug in anywhere, though he's most valuable playing everywhere. With no shortage of options, this battle could rage on until Opening Day rosters are announced.\"\n\nColorado has a ton to figure out over the next few weeks, but things could be worse. It's better to have too many options than to have very few, if none at all.\n\nPirates' fans won't like seeing this Konnor Griffin roster prediction\n\nVeterans and a top prospect square off for the Cubs' fourth outfielder spot\n\nRangers head to camp with Kumar Rocker and Jacob Latz battling for the rotation\n\nA's still looking for their closer following the Mason Miller trade\n\nTravis Bazzana's WBC commitment may cost him an Opening Day roster spot",

So, entering spring training, Duran admits that last year was a disappointment, but it’s something he’s ready to move on from.\n\n“I’m always disappointed in myself,” Duran said on Monday. “I always feel like I don’t do the best that I can do. I feel like I let the fans down sometimes, or my teammates. But it’s a new year, so you just have to flush it and go out there and do my thing.”\n\nDuran is expected to mix between left field and the DH with Roman Anthony. He will also play right field in spring training, as he will play the position in the WBC.\n\n“Hopefully we can get him in games, playing that position, get him ready,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said.\n\n“If he’s going to play right field (in the WBC), he better be ready, because it’d be hard for me to be watching a game and then all of a sudden he gets hurt because he wasn’t prepared for that.”\n\nRegardless of his past season, Duran is excited to make an impact for the Red Sox and help Boston get back to the playoffs.\n\nTanner Houck Gets Positive Injury Update As Red Sox Camp Begins",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTeam USA is onto the knockout stages. After a perfect run through Group C, the Americans have officially secured their spot in the quarterfinals of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. By finishing as the No. 2 overall seed, just behind Canada, the U.S. has earned a critical first-round bye, allowing them to bypass the qualification playoffs and head straight into the final eight.\n\nThe preliminary round finale was a statement victory as Team USA dismantled Germany with a 5-1 win on Sunday. Captain Auston Matthews silenced early-tournament critics by exploding for two goals and an assist, leading an offensive onslaught that saw the Americans control the pace from the opening puck drop. Behind him, the physical presence of the Tkachuk brothers and a 23-save performance from goaltender Connor Hellebuyck proved that this roster is as balanced as it is star-studded.\n\nWhile the U.S. enjoyed a smooth path through the group stage -- outscoring opponents 16-5 over three games -- the competition is about to intensify. With the NHL back on the Olympic stage, the margin for error has vanished, and the Americans know that one off-night on Wednesday could end their quest for the first men's gold medal since the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice.\"\n\nThe road to the podium is clearly defined but fraught with peril. If the seeds hold, a potential collision course with arch-rival Canada looms in the gold medal game, a matchup that hockey fans have been salivating over since the NHL's participation was confirmed.

    "fullText": "DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the last person to leave the Toronto dugout after the Game 7 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series last fall because the star slugger wanted that to be the moment when he moved on.\n\nThe first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.\n\n“When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter. “Right then, I just turned the page.”\n\nThe Blue Jays lost the decisive game 5-4 in 11 innings, missing on a second consecutive chance to clinch the franchise's third championship at home. For manager John Schneider, this spring training is no different from a year ago.\n\n“The main message is we’re not defending anything,” Schneider said. “We’re not defending the AL East. We’re not defending the American League. We’re attacking 2026 like we did in 2025 or any year, really. You’re trying to win the division, you’re trying to win the World Series. That’s it.”\n\nGuerrero jolted the franchise at the start of the spring last year, when he said there was no deal on a new contract and that his own deadline for getting one done had passed, raising the specter of free agency in 2026.\n\nInstead, the sides settled on a $500 million, 14-year contract early last season, and the son of Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero went on to hit .292 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs.\n\nIn the postseason, Guerrero had a 1.289 OPS while hitting .397 with eight homers in 18 games and was MVP of the American League Championship Series. He didn't homer in any of his first three trips to the playoffs, and the Blue Jays lost all six of those games.\n\n“Going back to the postseason last year, I think it’s really cool for everyone to be on that heightened stage and to see how they responded,” Schneider said. “I think that kind of bleeds into this year, but (Guerrero) has been a little bit more vocal than I’ve ever seen him, a little bit more loose than I’ve ever seen him and understands that he’s one of the best players in the game.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Guerrero, a five-time All-Star, is now the longest-tenured Blue Jays player.\n\n“I don’t see myself as a leader,” Guerrero said. “I always put myself as a good teammate, and when you are a good teammate, then you become a good leader. I’m a good teammate.”\n\nHis role as the face of the franchise was cemented when Bo Bichette left the team, signing a $126 million, three-year with the New York Mets and moving from shortstop to third base.\n\n“It’s difficult not having him around,” said Guerrero, who played with Bichette through the minor leagues. “I mean, we played 10 years together. But at the same time, I understand it’s business, and he has to take care of his family as well.”\n\nThe Blue Jays signed Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto to fill the void left by Bichette while adding pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce.\n\n“I think we’re very capable,” Guerrero said. “I think it’s going to be more fun, and I’m actually more happy than last year.”\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "fullText": "Three-year NFL veteran and safety for the Cleveland Browns, Ronnie Hickman, was assaulted by a group of four individuals following a confrontation in the lobby of a Sixty Les hotel located on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York. The incident occurred at approximately 4:30 am after a group of individuals, who remain unidentified, approached Hickman shortly after he entered the building.\n\nAccording to the local authorities who originally spoke with the New York Post, police are actively investigating the matter, as well as whether or not Hickman’s status as a professional athlete had any influence in their decision to approach him. “The suspects slugged Hickman and took off,” the official report states.\n\nThe franchise itself confirmed that Hickman “was a victim of assault early Monday morning at a New York City hotel,” and a personal representative of the Ohio State product also informed the post that “Ronnie was treated for minor injuries at an area hospital after the incident, was later released, and is home resting with his family.”\n\nThe incident, unfortunately, comes right after Hickman had managed to enjoy a career-defining breakout. After recording just 70 total tackles with the Browns throughout all of 2023 and 2024, he managed to finally become a full-time starter in 2025.\n\nThe 2023 undrafted free agent tallied 103 combined tackles throughout his 17 starts this past season, snagging two interceptions and deflecting seven passes along the way. At this time, police have admitted that no arrests have been made and that all four of the primary suspects remain at large.\n\nStaff members who were on site at the time of the assault have also refused to offer up any sort of comments on the issue, but given the upscale nature of the establishment, it’s widely speculated that Hickman may have been profiled. The 24-year-old prospect is set to become a restricted free agent later this offseason, and will likely be resigning with the Browns for a “projected contract between $7 million to $8 million.”\n\nABC7 has suggested that Hickman was, in fact, identified by the four individuals, and that things only escalated after Hickman refused to acknowledge them, but that has yet to be confirmed by either official sources or any of the members in Hickman’s camp.\n\nThe post Cleveland Browns News: Ronnie Hickman Attacked by Goons in Sixty Les Hotel’s Lobby, No Arrests Yet appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Joey Logano has etched his name into the same book as NASCAR greats, with three Cup titles with Team Penske. However, his climb did not come on a smooth road. Some drivers hit bumps early and learn the ropes while the stakes stay low. Others, like Logano, taste success early and then get a wake-up call when they line up with the sport’s big boys.\n\nLoganolit up the record books in the lower ranks, earning the nickname “Sliced Bread” before he hit his teens. Barely a year after he started racing at six, he grabbed his first title at seven in 1997. From there, the trophies kept rolling in. He won the National Bandolero Bandits crown in 1999, the Young Lions National Championship in 2002, and the Pro National Championship in Legends, making him the youngest champion in that series. The wins kept stacking up in the K&N Pro Series East in 2007, ARCA, Late Models, and even the Xfinity Series in 2008.\n\nBut when he stepped into the Cup Series with Joe Gibbs Racing in 2009, that golden run hit a wall. Reflecting on that period ahead of the Daytona 500, Logano opened up about how it all happened.\n\n“It’s a tricky place for a young kid to grow up in, right, to have all that hype. It can affect you in a lot of different ways and, unfortunately, mainly bad ways,” the Team Penske driver said. on First Things First. “Because I think you start to drink your own Kool-Aid, if you will. You start to believe in all the hype, and you start to just think you’re that great. And you don’t go to work like you’re supposed to. Or you start to get a little arrogant. At some point reality gonna slap you in the face.”\n\n“When I got to the cup level, the NASCAR top level here, I got the slice of humble pie that I deserved. I went up against all the guys that were the phenoms, right, growing up. And I got my butt kicked for three years before I was able to get my head wrapped around things…”\n\n“If I’m being honest, I failed at that. I lost my job. I was at a point that I was like, well, ‘Uh-oh, what am I going to do the rest of my life? I’m 21 years old, and I don’t know if I’m going to make it.”\n\nBack then, his results left Joe Gibbs Racing scrambling to land sponsorship. When Roger Penske called Joe Gibbs and asked about Logano, acting on Brad Keselowski’s nudge, Gibbs asked for a week as they were trying to get sponsors for Logano. Without funding lined up, the options were thin for JGR. They would have either moved him back to Xfinity or released him.\n\nPenske stepped in and threw Logano a lifeline, and that move flipped the young driver’s career. The struggles, though, left their mark. That tough period taught Logano how to lose before he could learn how to win again. Each failure became a lesson, each misstep a brick in rebuilding belief.\n\nAnd he has stayed in that same camp ever since, and that turning point still echoes in how he carries himself. It taught him to punch the clock and keep grinding. To this day, Logano reminds himself not to coast, keeping that hunger alive and pushing to raise his game lap after lap.\n\nThe post Joey Logano Reveals Brutal Reality Check When He Lost His NASCAR Seat After Coming In As A Superstar appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Who will Canada play next in hockey? Explaining 2026 Olympic bracket opponent for quarterfinals originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a dominant run through Group A, Team Canada has officially secured its spot in the quarterfinals of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. By finishing as the No. 1 overall seed, Canada has earned a critical first-round bye, allowing them to bypass the qualification playoffs and head straight into the final eight.\n\nThe preliminary round finale was a sheer display of power as Team Canada dismantled France with a 10-2 win on Sunday. Captain Sidney Crosby made history by becoming Canada's all-time leading scorer in Olympic play featuring NHL players, while Connor McDavid took over the tournament scoring lead with a clinical performance. With a roster featuring Nathan MacKinnon, Macklin Celebrini and Cale Makar, the Canadians outscored their opponents 20-3 across three games, proving why they are the favorites to reclaim the gold.\n\nWhile Canada enjoyed a smooth path through the group stage, the intensity is about to ramp up significantly. With the NHL back on the Olympic stage for the first time since 2014, the margin for error has vanished, and the Canadians know that the single-elimination format on Wednesday leaves no room for a slow start. For a nation that views hockey as its heartbeat, Milan represents the first opportunity in over a decade to see their greatest generational stars compete for gold together.\n\nThe road to the podium is clearly defined. If the seeds hold, a potential collision course with Team USA looms in the gold medal game, a matchup that hockey fans have been salivating over since the NHL's participation was confirmed. For Sidney Crosby, who famously scored the \"Golden Goal\" in 2010, this tournament is about more than a medal—it's about leading a new era of Canadian excellence back to the top of the world.\n\nHere's who Team Canada plays next.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nThe men's preliminary round has concluded in Milan, and the bracket is now set for the knockout stages. Canada, the United States, Slovakia, and Finland have secured the top four seeds and will receive a bye directly to the quarterfinals.\n\nThe remaining eight teams will compete in a qualification playoff on Tuesday to determine who fills the final four spots in the quest for gold.\n\nThe following teams have earned a direct path to the quarterfinals on Wednesday:\n\nFinland (Best Second-Place Team)\n\nThe qualification playoffs occur on Tuesday.\n\nMORE: Day-by-day TV, streaming schedule for 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nCanada will play the winner of Denmark vs. Czechia.\n\nThe Canadians enter the quarterfinal as the No. 1 seed after going 3-0-0 to go on top of Group A. Because of goal differential, boosted by a 10-2 win over France, Canada clinched the top seed over Team USA, who also went undefeated in their group.\n\nCanada already faced Czechia in their opening game of the tournament, winning 5-0, but they must wait for the result of the Tuesday matchup to see if a rematch is on the horizon for Wednesday at 10:40 a.m. ET.\n\nBoth Czechia and Denmark lost twice in the preliminary rounds, and now, the winner of this game will face the Canadian juggernaut.\n\nMORE: Updated medal count at 2026 Olympics\n\nThe 2026 Olympic men's hockey tournament features 12 nations split into three groups of four for the opening round-robin phase.\n\nThe three group winners and the highest-ranked second-place finisher earn an automatic bye into the quarterfinals. The remaining eight teams are seeded 5th through 12th for a single-elimination qualification playoff, where the winners advance to join the top seeds in the final eight.\n\nTo ensure the most competitive matchups later in the tournament, the IIHF re-seeds the four semifinalists based on their original preliminary round rankings, pitting the highest remaining seed against the lowest for a spot in the gold medal game.\n\nMORE: USA men's hockey schedule\n\n(3) Slovakia vs. Germany/France winner\n\n(1) Canada vs. Czechia/Denmark winner\n\n(4) Finland vs. Switzerland/Italy winner\n\n(2) USA vs. Sweden/Latvia winner\n\nBronze Medal: Sweden vs. Switzerland\n\nBronze Medal Game (TBD vs. TBD)",

On Monday, he threw a baseball for the first time, which is a step in the right direction.\n\nAlthough Houck is already throwing, he said the goal is to return in September for a playoff push.\n\n“My whole goal is to be back in September,” Houck said on Monday, via The Athletic. “I set that goal basically the day after the surgery. I wanted to do it smart and the right way. …\n\n“I can have my goal, but if God has a different plan, then I might have to readjust as things ramp up with throwing and see how the body recovers.”\n\nIf Houck can return in September, he can provide the Red Sox with some depth to the rotation and potentially into the playoffs.\n\nHouck is coming off a disappointing 2025 season, as before the injury, he struggled. The right-hander went 0-3 with an 8.04 ERA in nine starts.\n\nHowever, he was solid in 2024 as the right-hander went 9-10 with a 3.12 ERA in 30 starts and was named an All-Star.

    "fullText": "GLENDALE – Before the 2025 season, the Arizona Cardinals made an announcement about building a new performance center, and after the season, they have provided more details. The franchise will be looking to build the practice facility in Scottsdale and increase the size from the previous performance center by tenfold. The team will hold a groundbreaking event on February, 19th with the City of Phoenix and Arizona Commerce Authority on-site.\n\nOct 29, 2023; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill looks on against the Baltimore Ravens during the second half at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\n“Last September, the Cardinals announced the updated plans and location for the team’s new performance center in North Phoenix, located west of Scottsdale Road and north of the Loop 101. The targeted opening for the new performance center and team headquarters is 2028.\n\n“The 217-acre property was purchased at auction from the Arizona State Land Department for $136 million by an affiliate of the team. The new performance center and business operations will anchor the mixed-use development site, occupying 30 acres and over 250,000 square feet. The footprint of the team’s current facility is 14 acres and 156,000 square feet.\n\n“It will feature three natural-grass outdoor practice fields and a fieldhouse with a full-size turf field indoors. Additional elements of the new, world-class performance center will include a greatly expanded and modern locker room and state-of-the-art team spaces for athletic training, sports medicine and strength and conditioning in addition to updated dining areas, meeting rooms, a player lounge and more.”\n\nDec 28, 2024; Inglewood, California, USA; Arizona owner Bidwill reacts during the game against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nArizona’s Tempe training facility was constructed in 1990, before opening a year later. The franchise had just moved to the Valley a few years earlier from St. Louis and began building roots. For the past 35 years, despite some renovations, the practice building has largely remained the same, but changes are coming.\n\nThe new facility is big news following the team being ranked last in all the NFL in the NFLPA’s report cards. Owner Michael Bidwill is obviously trying to turn that perception around for his new head coach Michael Bidwill, as the duo heads towards the future.\n\nThe 3-14 season doesn’t truly matter. The Las Vegas Raiders have a complete failure of a year, but it’s clear the ownership is committed to the player’s with the high-tech Allegiant Stadium. If the owner, like Bidwill, is investing in the future, it goes a long way of building hope across the Valley.\n\nCardinals part of 11-team grievance against 2025 NFLPA report cards",

Instead, he focused on what sports can represent at a broader level.\n\nAfter watching the NBA All-Star Game and Team USA compete at the Winter Olympics, Obama posted a message about the impact of sports.\n\nHe tweeted: “Watching the NBA All-Star game and Team USA at the Winter Olympics, it’s clear that sports — just like music and art — still have the power to bring us together, build community, and remind us of our common humanity.”\n\nObama compared sports to music and art, suggesting they share a unique ability to connect people across different backgrounds.\n\nHis message centered on unity and shared experience rather than competition.\n\nAll-Star weekend, which features players from across the league and around the world, provided a fitting backdrop for that reflection.\n\nMichelle Obama also posted on social media after attending the game with Barack.\n\n“My favorite teammates on and off the court,” she wrote.\n\nHer caption accompanied a photo of the couple courtside at the Intuit Dome, adding a lighthearted note to the evening.\n\nThe post quickly drew attention from fans, many of whom enjoyed seeing the former president and first lady taking in the event together.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron jokes as Victor Wembanyama takes center stage at NBA All-Star Game\n\n‘Who is that?’ – Anthony Edwards’ Cristiano Ronaldo moment at NBA All-Star Game goes viral\n\nMetta Sandiford-Artest claims he can’t travel to Australia due to 2004 Malice at the Palace incident",

    "fullText": "The 2026 Hana Bank K League 1 season marks Daejeon Hana Citizen's fourth year back in the top flight. But what's different about this season is that the Purples are aiming to challenge for a first-ever top division title.\n\nDaejeon Hana Citizen recorded their best-ever finish to a K League 1 season last year, finishing as runners-up. The Purples were helped by being attack-minded with a forward line led by Joo Min-kyu, whose 14 goals were the team's highest. Daejeon scored 58 times, the third-highest total, from an xG of 54.7 (6th), by having one of the best shot conversion rates in the division, second only to Jeonbuk. Their tactical approach centred on winning the ball back quickly and supplying wide players with pace who could hurt teams on the counterattack.\n\nDaejeon were also sensible in the transfer market, moving to replace the injured Victor Bobsin - a key player in their system - with as good a like-for-like replacement domestically as there could be in Kim Bong-soo, and added attacking impetus with wide players Joao Victor and Hernandes Rodriques.\n\nDaejeon were consistent and were able to put together unbeaten runs of six or seven games at certain points in the campaign. Hwang Sun-hong's men were, more or less, just as dangerous at home as they were away, earning 10 home wins and eight on the road with four losses at Purple Arena and five away from it. They led the league in the earlier part of the campaign, but their undoing was a poor record against eventual champions Jeonbuk, picking up just one point from the four league meetings all season.\n\n[READ: Daejeon Hana Citizen 2025 Season Review]\n\nDaejeon have taken a quality over quantity approach to the winter transfer window, adding players with title-winning pedigree. Wing duo Gustav Ludwigson and Um Won-sang arrive from Ulsan HD, while powerful Brazilian striker Diogo Oliveira will provide competition for Joo Min-kyu in attack. Cho Seong-gwon, who has worked under Hwang Sun-hong with the U23 national team, signs to provide competition for the right centre back spot. The club have also signed Joao Victor and Ha Chang-rae on permanent deals, having spent the 2025 season on loan.\n\n[READ: Daejeon's winter recruits and where they might fit in]\n\nEven at 35, soon to be 36, Joo Min-kyu is still lethal in front of goal. He is also a very clever player with excellent vision to feed teammates and help start (and sometimes finish) counterattacks from deep. Not only will he most likely be Daejeon's top scorer again, but he has a lot of experience in winning teams and in the AFC Champions League. The phrase \"winning mentality\" gets used a lot, but Joo brings that to Daejeon and as skipper, his influence will be felt even \n\nThe U22 rule is no more in K League 1, not in the same way it was at least. Instead, teams will need to have two U22 players on the bench if they are to have a full nine-man bench. Daejeon don't have too many U22 players left, having sent Kim Han-seo and Lee Jun-gyu out on loan to Yongin FC and Gimhae FC 2008, respectively, and Kim Hyeon-oh to Gyeongnam. It means that Daejeon are gonig to have to pluck some kids out of the academy to make a full bench, or just have two substitutes fewer than they're permitted to.\n\nAre Daejeon really title contenders?\n\nDaejeon have not been shy in saying that the aim is to challenge for the title this season. They finished second last year, but once Jeonbuk leapfrogged them into top spot, the Purples never looked like returning to the K League 1 summit. Recruitment has been good, but the club have also lost influential coach Yoshida Tatsuma so there'll be question marks as to whether the magic is still there from the last 18 months.\n\nJeonbuk and Ulsan have dominated K League for the last 12 years, mostly the former, leading to calls for other teams to step up, for owners to invest, and to try to break the duopoly. Daejeon are showing what can be done if an owner invests heavily in a football club. The club is ambitious but the owners want to see a return on their investment. The 2026 season will be a good test to see if Daejeon can repay them with some silverware.",

    "title": "Nimslo stereo camera",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Nimslo is a stereo camera with a brightfield viewfinder that produces 3D pictures that can be viewed without glasses. This is done using lenticular printing. It uses common 35 mm film in 135 film format cartridges. It was produced in the 1980s by Nimstec of Atlanta, and manufactured by Timex in Dundee, Scotland.[1]\n\nThe Nimslo had fixed focus and automatic exposure. It featured a leathered metal body and glass lenses. Using its four lenses, four images from slightly different viewing angles were taken simultaneously. With the individual images half the size of the usual 35mm image frames, each 3D photograph taken used the space of 2 full 35mm exposures on the film. So a roll labeled as \"36 exposures\" would yield 18 3D pictures with four images each.\n\nThe Nimslo was the first consumer level three-dimensional lenticular camera of the 1980s. There were previous lenticular cameras aimed at amateurs, such as the six-lens Lentic, introduced in 1953, which used 120 roll film,[2] but the Nimslo was probably the first to use 35mm film, and certainly the first that could fit in a pocket.\n\nThe camera used a red LED to put a green dot on the negative. This was how the printer knew where a group of four negatives started. This dot appeared in the otherwise blank area above the image so it didn't appear in the printed frame. This feature appears to be unique to the NimsLo. Allen Kwok Wah Lo is known for his work in 3D display technologies. He is believed to operate his current Companies in Hong Kong, as CEO of U.S. Technology Ltd. and 3DV Co., Ltd. As to his past involvement with 3D, Allen Lo was President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of ITII (Image Technologies International, Inc.) and President and Director of 3DIT (3D Image Technologies Company) in 1997, when an action was tried against him and them in Atlanta Federal District Court. The action alleged Lo and his Companies induced ND3D B.V. (“ND3D”) to enter into an acquisition agreement and then commercially exploited ND3D, leaving it a company without assets. Despite advising the industry and former clients and contacts of ND3D that ND3D has been absorbed by Defendant Image Technology International, Inc. (\"ITII\"), despite enticing ND3D’s principal, Andrew Joel (“Joel”), to leave ND3D as its Director to come work for ITII, and despite utilizing Joel’s know-how and contacts and ND3D’s assets, Defendants refused to pay one cent to ND3D. In a June 6, 1995 letter from Lo to Joel, after ITII's evaluation of ND3D's assets, Lo proposed a fixed number of shares that ITII and 3DIT would provide to ND3D in exchange for all of the assets and goodwill of ND3D. The parties formalized their effort to have ITII acquire ND3D by executing on June 21, 1995, an Acquisition and Cooperation Agreement. The parties attempted to settle their disputes in February 1997, prior to the initiation of litigation. After two days of fruitless negotiations, ITII served Joel and Marc Wolters (the Netherland District Court trustee in bankruptcy for EGN) with complaints in a lawsuit that had been previously filed in Gwinnett Superior Court (unbeknownst to Joel, Wolters, and their counsel). That case has been dismissed on summary judgment, leaving only Joel’s claims against ITII, 3DIT and Lo in that case. Judgment was granted in favor of ND3D and Joel for $1,000,000.00 plus costs and attorneys fees in the United States District Court case, ND3D B.V. v. IMAGE TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL, INC., ET AL. in the Northern District of Georgia, before Judge Owen Forrester (not reported).Other lenticular cameras don't have it and other lenticular printers don't use it.\n\nThe Nimslo was originally built in a Timex factory in Dundee, Scotland. A massive strike in Dundee, as the U.S. rollout was gaining strong momentum, caused Nimslo to miss the delivery dates on all cameras sold. This led to the cancellation of the Timex contract.[3][4] Later cameras were built by Sunpak in Japan.\n\nNimslo and its lenticular printer were invented by Jerry Curtis Nims from Georgia, USA, and Allen Kwok Wah Lo. Jerry Nims received one of the ten outstanding engineering achievements in the United States for the Nimslo Three-Dimensional Photographic System at the 17th Annual Competition of the National Society of Professional Engineers in 1983.\n\nLenticular prints would be ordered from special print shops using dedicated printers.\nThe pictures produced by the Nimslo camera create a three-dimensional image that can be seen with the naked eye. This 3D image is made possible by the lenticular printing process that was customized by the Nimslo inventors, though professional lenticular prints had been around for a while.\n\nThe technology was protected by US patents.\n\nThe shares of the Nimstec were bought by Eagleville Company in October 1980, controlled by the Ptarmigan Trust that at the same time gained control over Timex Corporation. The operation was controlled by billionaire Fredrik Olsen, head of the Fred. Olsen & Co. shipping company. Olsen was a technological and industrial visionary and believed strongly in the Nimslo product. He wanted the Timex factory in Dundee in Scotland to produce the cameras, as they had already produced cameras for Polaroid. He established a guarantee of US$25 million for the acquisition of the Nimslo shares.[5][6] Nimslo was taken publicly on the Unlisted Securities Market (USM) London by Baring Brothers and Carr, Sebag.[7][8] Later, as an American depository receipt (ADR), Nimslo was the number one selling stock on the NASDAQ until the strike in Dundee stopped deliveries. Later still, Nimslo was public on the Bermuda Exchange, including substantial oil interests which had been added by Fred Olsen. Soon thereafter, Nimslo was privatized.\n\nThe original Nimslo photographic printer (the Mark 1S) was controlled by a KIM-1 processor. The operator had to view the actual images to align the images. The time to create a picture was measured in minutes. The second photographic printer was the Mark 1A. This printer was controlled by a Data General MicroNova processor, using the MP/OS operating system. This machine used a video system and was able to create a picture in about 15 seconds.\n\nNimslo prints are created by printing the four images through the lenticular print material, each at a different angle, to a photosensitive emulsion on the back of the lenticular material. The print material is then processed in a normal photofinishing machine, as the back of the print material is permeable to the photofinishing chemicals.\n\nAlthough the idea of a consumer level camera that could make lenticular 3D prints similar to those that had appeared for many years on book covers and other novelty items certainly had appeal, it did not receive a large market share of camera purchases, partially due to the high costs of processing and longer wait times than traditional cameras. In the summer of 1982, Nimslo was the fastest selling 35mm camera in the U.S., including being on the cover of the Sears catalog.\n\nDuring the height of its meteoric rise, Nimslo had sought to acquire Berkey Industries (NYSE-BKY), of which it had obtained sixteen percent.[9] Instead, after the strike, its plans to acquire Berkey were abandoned.[3] Berkey issued its LOI to acquire the photo finishing labs of Nimslo International Ltd., for common stock, which would have raised the Nimslo holdings of Berkey from 16 to 45 percent.[10] However, this transaction was never consummated.\n\nAfter the Dundee strike, the sales team, led by former top Polaroid executive, Corvin Cianci, could not regain the top position with the replacement camera manufactured in Japan by Sunpak Company.[1]\n\nNimslo Corp was partly sold to Nishika, a Nevada company that acquired the Nimslo patents, and continued the Nimslo as \"Nishika 3-D N8000\". In April 1989,[11] Nishika introduced the four lens Nishika N8000 and later the four lens N9000. The N8000 featured a plastic body with plastic lenses, a fixed 1/60 shutter speed and a three-position manual aperture lever that selected f8, f11 or f19.[12][13] The N9000 was a more compact, sleeker version but was essentially the same camera, except with 2 aperture settings, f8 and f16, instead of 3. Part of the marketing effort included a promotional/instructional video starring Vincent Price.[14] Nishika also offered a companion flash, similar to the Nimslo Optilite but much bulkier and with just one contact plus ground. They also offered a number of other accessories including a \"professional\" strap, Nishika Tripod, a Nishika deluxe camera case, a lens cleaning kit and even a line of Nishika brand color print film, marked with both regular and 3D exposures, though the advertising stressed that it could use any ASA 100 color print film.[citation needed]\n\nNishika also, of course, offered a lenticular processing service.\n\nThe flash contact sits atop a small platform which resembles the Pentaprism found on an SLR. The camera is much larger than it needs to be, a lead weight was included to make it heavier, there is a plastic panel on top designed to look like an LCD readout and the two AA batteries serve no function except to power the \"light meter\" which merely indicates whether or not flash should be used. The \"use flash\" indicator is not coupled to the aperture lever and is thus valid only when f8 (cloudy/indoors) is selected and when ASA 100 film is used.[13] Also, the hot shoe has three contacts (in addition to ground), but two simply sit on top of the plastic with no internal connection. The companion flash has only a single contact in addition to ground.[13]\n\nNishika was the number one selling direct sales product until bad color emulsions from 3M caused the 3D snapshots to fade. As a result, Nishika sued 3M.[15]\n\nAttempting to recover, Nishika used misleading[13] and even illegal tactics to market the camera, including an infamous fraudulent prize promotion scheme, which is usually blamed for the company's demise.[16]\n\nStarks claimed that Nishika also made a three-lens camera, but there is no evidence that such a camera ever existed outside his article.[6] It is interesting that some of the Nishika \"dealers\" claimed that the Nimslo had only 3 lenses.[13]\n\nThe confusion on the part of Michael Starks may stem from the introduction about a year later of the 3 lens Trilogy, which sported a built in electronic flash and motorized film advance, and was originally marketed through a system very similar to the multilevel scheme used by Nishika.[17] The same camera was later renamed to Image Tech 3D 1000 and marketed through more traditional channels.[18]\n\nSeveral other three-lens cameras were released, such as the 3D wizard, 3D magic, 'DFX, and Kalimar, some of which sported more modern features such as built-in electronic flash and motorized film advance, but lacked the auto-exposure features of the Nimslo. The 3D trio featured 3 element coated glass lenses, built in flash, motorized film advance, automatic exposure control, compatibility with DX coded ASA 100, 200 and 400 film, and a built in protective lens cover, making it the closest three-lens equivalent to the Nimslo.[19] These 3 lens cameras gave more pictures per roll of film, 16 [20] for 24 exposure roll rather than the 12[21] yielded by Nimslo/Nishika and had less ghosting, but also less depth.[18] There were other four-lens Nimslo clones as well, such as the 3DNext and the Rittai.[22] Like the Nishika, several of these were marketed through multilevel schemes, often in Asian countries, occasionally being the basis of a scam.[6]\n\nIn 2005 the Canadian firm Snap 3D began selling several two-lens and five-lens lenticular cameras made by US technology Ltd in Hong Kong. The five-lens cameras were particularly odd producing five images that were 29.94 mm high and from 24.75 to 26.33 mm wide, all five images having a different width. These were deluxe cameras, featuring glass lenses, adjustable focus with rangefinder, adjustable shutter speeds 1/125, 1/60, 1/30 sec. and \"B\", continuously adjustable aperture from f/5.6 to f22 and a spirit level. They also had automatic film loading and motorized film advance.[23] Indeed, these cameras were so far removed from the Nimslo, that it might be stretching things to call them Nimslo clones. Snap 3D no longer sells these cameras and as of May 2012, no longer does lenticular printing due to failure of their machine.[24]\n\nDespite the fact that Nimslo cameras are no longer produced, one can still obtain a Nimslo through various internet auction sites.[25] In fact, the Nimslo maintains a loyal following among photography buffs. In most recent years, renewed interest in the 1981 Nimslo camera has created a growing online after-market for both the analog camera itself and Nimslo camera prints.[26] This includes a large number of GIF images created using the Nimslo camera, which have proliferated for viewing online.[27]\n\nAs of May 2012, there are no known labs that can make lenticular prints from film.\n\nIn a somewhat \"retro\" development, many stereo photography buffs used the Nimslo to take stereo slides which were mounted in \"4P\" (half frame) slide mounts. This was done by using either slip in cardboard mounts, some specially labeled with the Nimslo name or aluminum masks such as the Realist \"closeup\" mask. These masks were sometimes put in metal frames and placed between glass, much like Realist format slides. The resulting stereo slides could then be viewed using conventional Realist format viewers or even projected with stereo projectors.\n\nThe dot that was green on negatives was red on slide film and so stereo hobbyists could tell which chip was the left frame after\ncutting the film by looking for the red dot. Because many slide mounts were designed for an image frame taller than the Nimslo frame this red dot was sometimes visible in the picture.\n\nThe glass lenses and automatic exposure control of the Nimslo made it well suited for this purpose, unlike similar cameras such as the Nishika that typically sported plastic lenses and limited adjustability, relying on the latitude of the print film to give good results under varied lighting conditions.\n\nOthers used the Nimslo to produce half frame prints that could be used to make stereo cards which could be viewed in conventional stereoscopes.\n\nSince only the two outer images of the four images formed by each snap were mounted, using an unmodified Nimslo to produce stereo pairs results in wasted film. Making prints is even more costly since half of them will be thrown away. The problem of paying for twice as many prints could be solved by covering the two center lenses, but that doesn't solve the problem of film wastage. This spurred some enterprising individuals to come up with modifications.\n\nTechnical Enterprises came out with the Teco-Nimslo which exposed two images at a time and modified the film advance so that there was no film wastage. This produced 24 half-frame pairs on a 24-exposure roll. The result was an ideal camera for those satisfied with half-frame format slides.\n\nDavid Burder came up with more radical modifications. One, the original Burdlo, featured a modified lens board with two lenses but essentially the same film advance to take full-frame stereo pictures. The stereo base was greatly reduced to only 36mm, adequate for closeup work.[28] Other cameras also going by the name Burdlo included multiple Nimslos joined together to make 12 lens and 24 lens lenticular cameras. None of these were as popular as the Teco-Nimslo but pictures of them are easy enough to find on the web[29] and have occasionally been the subject of blog entries.[30]\n\nOthers have modified the Nimslo to make a wide format camera, or have found other non 3D uses, with or without modification.[31]",

    "description": "Detectives desperate to locate a 12-year-old, seen abused online, found a surprising lead.",
    "fullText": "Warning: This article contains details about sexual abuse\n\nSpecialist online investigator Greg Squire had hit a dead end in his efforts to rescue an abused girl his team had named Lucy.\n\nDisturbing images of her were being shared on the dark web - an encrypted corner of the internet only accessible using special software designed to make owners digitally untraceable.\n\nBut even with that level of subterfuge, the abuser was conscious of \"covering their tracks\", cropping or altering any identifying features, says Squire. It was impossible to work out who, or where, Lucy was.\n\nWhat he was soon to discover was that the clue to the 12-year-old's location was hidden in plain sight.\n\nSquire works for US Department of Homeland Security Investigations in an elite unit which attempts to identify children appearing in sexual abuse material.\n\nA BBC World Service team has spent five years filming with Squire, and other investigative units in Portugal, Brazil, and Russia - showing them solving cases such as that of a kidnapped and presumed-dead seven-year-old in Russia, and the arrest of a Brazilian man responsible for five of the biggest child-abuse forums on the dark web.\n\nThe unprecedented access shows how these cases are often cracked, not through state-of-the-art technology, but by spotting tiny revealing details in images or chat forums.\n\nSquire cites Lucy's case, which he tackled early in his career, as the inspiration for his long-term dedication.\n\nHe found it especially disturbing that Lucy was about the same age as his own daughter, and new photos of her being assaulted, seemingly in her bedroom, were constantly appearing.\n\nSquire and his team could see, from the type of light sockets and electrical outlets visible in the images, that Lucy was in North America. But that was about it.\n\nThey contacted Facebook, which at the time dominated the social media landscape, asking for help scouring uploaded family photos - to see if Lucy was in any of them. But Facebook, despite having facial recognition technology, said it \"did not have the tools\" to help.\n\nSo Squire and his colleagues analysed everything they could see in Lucy's room: the bedspread, her outfits, her stuffed toys. Looking for any element which might help.\n\nAnd then they had a minor breakthrough. The team discovered that a sofa seen in some of the images was only sold regionally, not nationally, and therefore had a more limited customer base.\n\nBut that still amounted to about 40,000 people.\n\n\"At that point in the investigation, we're [still] looking at 29 states here in the US. I mean, you're talking about tens of thousands of addresses, and that's a very, very daunting task,\" says Squire.\n\nThe team looked for more clues. And that is when they realised something as mundane as the exposed brick wall in Lucy's bedroom could give them a lead.\n\n\"So, I started just Googling bricks and it wasn't too many searches [before] I found the Brick Industry Association,\" says Squire.\n\n\"And the woman on the phone was awesome. She was like, 'how can the brick industry help?'\"\n\nShe offered to share the photo with brick experts all over the country. The response was almost immediate, he says.\n\nOne of the people who got in touch was John Harp, who had been working in brick sales since 1981.\n\n\"I noticed that the brick was a very pink-cast brick, and it had a little bit of a charcoal overlay on it. It was a modular eight-inch brick and it was square-edged,\" he says. \"When I saw that, I knew exactly what the brick was,\" he adds.\n\nIt was, he told Squire, a \"Flaming Alamo\".\n\n\"[Our company] made that brick from the late 60s through about the middle part of the 80s, and I had sold millions of bricks from that plant.\"\n\nInitially Squire was ecstatic, expecting they could access a digitised customer list. But Harp broke the news that the sales records were just a \"pile of notes\" that went back decades.\n\nHe did however reveal a key detail about bricks, Squire says.\n\n\"He goes: 'Bricks are heavy.' And he said: 'So heavy bricks don't go very far.'\"\n\nThis changed everything. The team returned to the sofa customer list and narrowed that down to just those clients who lived within a 100-mile radius of Harp's brick factory in the US' south-west.\n\nFrom that list of 40 or 50 people, it was easy to find and trawl their social media. And that is when they found a photo of Lucy on Facebook with an adult who looked as though she was close to the girl - possibly a relative.\n\nThey worked out the woman's address, and then used that to find out every other address connected with that person, and all the people they had ever lived with.\n\nThat narrowed Lucy's possible address down further - but they didn't want to go door to door, making enquiries. Get the address wrong, and they could risk the suspect being tipped off that he was on the authorities' radar.\n\nSo Squire and his colleagues began sending photos of these houses to John Harp, the brick expert.\n\nFlaming Alamos were not visible on the outside of any of the homes, because the properties were clad in other materials. But the team asked Harp to assess - by looking at their style and exterior - if these properties were likely to have been built during a period when Flaming Alamos had been on sale.\n\n\"We would basically take a screenshot of that house or residence and shoot it over to John and say 'would this house have these bricks inside?'\" says Squire.\n\nFinally they had a breakthrough. They found an address that Harp believed was likely to feature a Flaming Alamo brick wall, and was on the sofa customer-base list.\n\n\"So we narrowed it down to [this] one address… and started the process of confirming who was living there through state records, driver's licence… information on schools,\" says Squire.\n\nThe team realised that in the household with Lucy was her mother's boyfriend - a convicted sex offender.\n\nWithin hours, local Homeland Security agents had arrested the offender, who had been raping Lucy for six years. He was subsequently sentenced to more than 70 years in jail.\n\nBrick expert Harp was delighted to hear Lucy was safe, especially given his own experiences as a long-term foster parent.\n\n\"We've had over 150 different children in our home. We've adopted three. So, doing that over those years, we have a lot of children in our home that were [previously] abused,\" he said.\n\n\"What [Squire's team] do day in and day out, and what they see, is a magnification of hundreds of times of what I've seen or had to deal with.\"\n\nA few years ago, that pressure on Squire started to take a real toll on his mental health, and he admits that, when he wasn't working, \"alcohol was a bigger part of my life than it should have been\".\n\n\"At that point my kids were a bit older… and, you know, that almost enables you to push harder. Like… 'I bet if I get up at three this morning, I can surprise [a perpetrator] online.'\n\n\"But meanwhile, personally… 'Who's Greg? I don't even know what he likes to do.' All of your friends… during the day, you know, they're criminals… All they do is talk about the most horrific things all day long.\"\n\nNot long afterwards, his marriage broke down, and he says he began to have suicidal thoughts.\n\nIt was his colleague Pete Manning who encouraged him to seek help after noticing his friend seemed to be struggling.\n\n\"It's hard when the thing that brings you so much energy and drive is also the thing that's slowly destroying you,\" Manning says.\n\nSquire says exposing his vulnerabilities to the light was the first step to getting better and continuing to do a job he is proud of.\n\n\"I feel honoured to be part of the team that can make a difference instead of watching it on TV or hearing about it… I'd rather be right in there in the fight trying to stop it.\"\n\nLast summer Greg met Lucy, now in her 20s, for the first time.\n\nShe told him her ability to now discuss what she went through was testament to the support she has around her.\n\n\"I have more stability. I'm able to have the energy to talk to people [about the abuse], which I could not have done… even, like, a couple years ago.\"\n\nShe said at the point Homeland Security ended her abuse she had been \"praying actively for it to end\".\n\n\"Not to sound cliché, but it was a prayer answered.\"\n\nSquire told her he wished he had been able to communicate that help was on its way.\n\n\"You wish there was some telepathy and you could reach out and be like, 'listen, we're coming'.\"\n\nThe BBC asked Facebook why it couldn't use its facial recognition technology to assist the hunt for Lucy. It responded: \"To protect user privacy, it's important that we follow the appropriate legal process, but we work to support law enforcement as much as we can.\"\n\nIf you've been a victim of child sexual abuse, a victim of crime or have feelings of despair, and are in the UK, you'll find details of help and support at bbc.co.uk/actionline.",

    "fullText": "As described previously,\nthe Linux kernel security team does not identify or mark or announce any sort\nof security fixes that are made to the Linux kernel tree. So how, if the Linux\nkernel were to become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) and responsible for\nissuing CVEs, would the identification of security fixes happen in a way that\ncan be done by a volunteer staff? This post goes into the process of how\nkernel fixes are currently automatically assigned to CVEs, and also the other\n“out of band” ways a CVE can be issued for the Linux kernel project.\n\nThis is a post in the series about the Linux kernel CVE release process:\n\nA few months after Linux became a CNA, Lee Jones, one of the members of the\nkernel.org CNA team wrote an\narticle on lwn.net\nas to how CVEs were being assigned, along with some other background\ninformation. That process has pretty much remained the same since then, but\ngiven the number of questions we have had over the past few years, it’s best to\ngo into a bit more detail as to how all of this works, and why some bug fixes\nare marked as a CVE and others are not.\n\nAs is often mentioned, the rate of development of the Linux kernel is very\nhigh, averaging around 9 changes a hour for the past decade or so. Luckily,\nthe kernel developers and maintainers have been manually marking specific\ncommits as “bug fixes” for decades, allowing them to be backported to the\nvarious stable kernel branches. This is to allow users to be able to use the\nlast kernel release, or a “long term” kernel as a base on which to rely on\nuntil they upgrade to the newer version. This process was described earlier\nhere,\n\nBecause there is a “feed of known bugfixes” out of the 9 changes an hour,\naveraging about 30 changes per day, the kernel CNA team determined that they\ncan focus their review efforts on that feed, and ignore the other changes, as\nobviously those changes do not fix a problem. And if the missed changes do fix\na problem, odds are someone will eventually ask for those changes to be\nbackported to a stable kernel, so they can be certain that this is a good set\nof changes to be reviewing for potential vulnerability fixes.\n\nWhile many security people love to argue what is, or is not, a vulnerability,\nwhile dealing with CVEs, a CNA must follow the definition that cve.org\ngives us\nwhich is:\n\n“An instance of one or more weaknesses in a\nProduct that can be exploited, causing a\nnegative impact to confidentiality, integrity,\nor availability; a set of conditions or\nbehaviors that allows the violation of an\nexplicit or implicit security policy.”\n\nSo with that definition in mind, the kernel CNA team members look at every\nbugfix that is added to the stable kernel releases and reviews it to determine\nif it meets this criteria.\n\nAt the level that the Linux kernel runs, almost any type of bug that can affect\na running system can be classified as a vulnerability. Specifically this means\nthat the following bugfixes are classified as fixing a vulnerability:\n\nMany bugfixes in the kernel resolve a problem where a\nWARN() or WARN_ON()\ntype of assertion is hit in the kernel. Normally Linux just prints out to the\nkernel log a message about what went wrong, and a stack dump and memory\ninformation, and continues on its merry way, as it is generally considered bad\nform to crash just because a issue was hit that the kernel can properly detect\nand recover from. However, there is a kernel option called\npanic_on_warn\nthat if enabled, Linux will instantly panic and stop if a warning message is\never hit. This is a defensive setting that many users like to enable to\nprotect any possible bug-like condition from being allowed to continue, as they\nwould rather just reboot the machine entirely at that point in time. This\noption is set for a few billion embedded systems running Linux, as well as many\nmany cloud/server systems as they can handle fall-over easily.\n\nBecause of this setting, any kernel fix that resolves a user-reachable\nWARN_ON triggering, must be assigned a CVE entry. If this option were\nnot present, the total number of CVEs assigned by Linux would greatly drop.\n\nWhen the kernel CNA team announced that they were going to start assigning CVEs\nto kernel fixes, the initial worry was that all kernel changes could be thought\nof as fixing a vulnerability. Luckily it turns out that most of the changes\nthat go into the stable kernel releases that fix bugs do not meet the\ndefinition of a “vulnerability fix”, so they do not get assigned a CVE.\nChanges that are common in stable updates that do not get a CVE are:\n\nThere are some bugfixes that many people would think would be classified as a\nvulnerability, but do not meet the cve.org definition, so we are not allowed to\nassign a CVE for them. Those include:\n\nPersonally, I think that filesystem corruption or data loss bug fixes should be\nconsidered a CVE fix, but until cve.org changes their policy, we can not assign\nCVEs for those types of fixes. That is why it is essential for users to always\ntake all stable kernel updates, as odds are, users do like their filesystems to\nstay uncorrupted with no data loss.\n\nFor some filesystem bugs a CVE will not be assigned when a maliciously\ncrafted or accidentally corrupted filesystem image is mounted by the kernel,\nand the kernel crashes or has other problems with it, unless the\nfilesytem-specific userspace fsck program previously ran on the image\nbefore mounting, and it did not find any problems with it. In simpler terms,\nalways run fsck on any untrusted filesystem image before mounting it.\n\nFor many CPU bug fixes, the hardware vendor is responsible for assigning a CVE,\nwhich is why the huge category of the ongoing Spectre cpu bugs do not get CVEs\nassigned by the kernel CNA, but rather the hardware company should be the ones\ndoing that assignment. Many times they do not, but there is nothing that us as\na CNA can really do about that..\n\nThere are 3 core members of the Linux kernel CNA team. The three of us take a\nlist of every commit that is applied to each stable kernel release, and review\nthem to determine if they feel the commit fixes a problem that would resolve a\nvulnerability based on the above definition and descriptions. We all do this\nwork in different ways. I review each patch in mutt\n(after dumping them to a mbox file) and saving off the ones that I think meet\nthe definition. Another member uses\na custom tool\nthat queries some LLM oracles and reviews the output of them for validity,\nwhile another uses a mix of regular expressions combined with manual review\nusing\na custom tool.\n\nWe all check into the\nvulns.git tree our lists of commits\nwe feel should be assigned a CVE id for. Then\nanother tool\nruns on those lists, and if at least 2 members vote for a commit, it is marked\nto be assigned a CVE id.\n\nWe also accept reviews from other community members. At least two different\ndevelopers regularly provide reviews which they email to us in patch form to\nbe applied to the\nvulns.git repository.\nExamples of that can be seen\nhere\nand\nhere.\n\nThese external reviews are taken into consideration after the main voting round\nhappens. If an external person voted for a commit to be marked as a\nvulnerability fix, and a single core member also did, then the commit is\nreviewed again manually to determine what the core member missed, and often\ntimes that commit will then be assigned a CVE id.\n\nAll of this work happens in public, in the\nvulns.git repository.\nCVE ids are usually assigned one to two weeks after the commits have been in a\nreleased kernel version, to allow users time to update their systems. Which is\none key reason why users should always update to newer kernels (more on how to\nkeep a system up to date with the increased numbers of CVE ids being allocated\nin a later article in this series.)\n\nOf course sometimes the CNA team miss commits that should be assigned a CVE, or\na developer or company wishes to have a CVE id assigned before they get through\nthe review process. If that is the case, a simple email to the kernel CNA team\nat the public email address is all that is needed, and then the id will be\nautomatically assigned if the team agrees that the commit meets the\nrequirements of a vulnerability fix.\n\nThis method is used by many developers who know they fixed a vulnerability and\nwish to get a CVE assigned for a presentation or paper due to print deadlines,\nand by many companies who do reviews based on reports sent to them by users.\nRequests are usually handled within a few days, depending on the travel\nschedule of the CNA team members.\n\nAlong with sometimes missing commits that should be assigned a CVE, the CNA\nteam also many times gets reviews incorrect. If anyone thinks that a CVE is\nassigned to a commit incorrectly, because that commit really does not fix a\nvulnerability, please email the CNA team and they will review it and often\ntimes reject the CVE based on that review. This has happened many times when a\nkernel subsystem maintainer patiently explains to the CNA team why a specific\ncommit really is not a vulnerability due to their knowledge of exactly how that\nportion of the kernel works.\n\nWe welcome such emails from all kernel developers and maintainers, for without\nthis type of checks, many commits often are missed, and incorrectly assigned.\nOver the past few years the CNA members have gotten better at reviews and the\nrate of rejection has gotten lower as both the community and the CNA members\nadjust their expectations.\n\nAs the information for what is contained in a CVE record comes directly from\nthe git commit that fixes the vulnerability, sometimes that information can be\nincorrect, or needs to be clarified better. Examples of this is where the\nrange of a vulnerability can not be correctly determined from the commit itself\n(i.e. when the vulnerability showed up, or was backported to), or where\nreferences to external reports for the vulnerability should be added. The\nkernel CNA team has ways to handle all of this by adding the needed range\nbounds, or changing the text, or adding references when requested. Easiest way\nto do this is to just send a patch for the vulns.git repository, adding the\nneeded information. I’ll go into how this all works in more detail into the\nnext article in this series, but if people are interested now, take a look at the\n“schema” file\nthat we use, and some commits in the\nvulns.git repository\n\nfrom\ndifferent\norganizations.\n\nCurrently, the kernel CNA is issuing about 60 CVEs a week, making it the second\nmost prolific CNA currently in the cve.org ecosystem. Trying to keep on top of\nthis type of feed has been “difficult” for traditional security teams that are\nwishing to attempt to manually review and triage every CVE report. As part of\nthe requirement for us to become a CNA, we are required to produce CVE records\nthat can be automatically parsed and handled by tools, without the need for\nhuman interaction.\n\nAs part of that, each CVE we create specifically documents the files affected\nin the kernel source tree for this specific issue, and the exact git ranges, or\nversion ranges if you want that, that the vulnerability originally showed up,\nand where it was fixed. With that information, every Linux user should be able\nto instantly determine if a CVE is applicable for them to review or not by\nfiltering on that data.\n\nBased on some reviews, on average, only 10 CVEs are even applicable to a Linux\nsystem for a normal week, reducing the amount of manual review down to\na very small amount (reading 10 reports a week should be “trivial” for most\nsystem integrators.) This quantity is much lower overall than the other\n“major” operating system vendors produce in a week, if counting CVE numbers as\na reference between projects actually means anything to you.\n\nRemember that software version numbers and git ids are part of a graph, and are\nnot something that you can do a simple “less or greater than” type of\ncomparison. We have seen many companies get this wrong many times. ALWAYS\nproperly walk the git repository tree to determine range checks.\n\nAnd don’t get us started about the uselessness of CPE values, while we do\npopulate those values in the CVE record, they are useless for any real range\nchecking, so please never use them.\n\nAnd yes, PURL will help solve a bit\nof this (it’s better than CPE, a low bar), but PURL does not work for\nself-hosted projects at the moment, like Linux, or GNOME, or KDE, or glibc, or\ngcc, or perl, or python, or curl, well, you get the idea. The PURL developers\nknow this, and we are working with them to solve this issue in the standard to\nhopefully resolve it in the future.\n\nDespite a low number of kernel fixes being applicable to your system every\nweek, many of them do fix real issues that the developers and community know\nabout, so you should upgrade your systems. Ignoring this reported feed will\ndirectly affect the security of your system, so do so at your own risk.\n\nAs stated previously,\nkernel developers do not know how Linux is used, as open source can not\ndictate use. Because of that, we have no way of judging the severity of any\nCVE fix for a user, only the integrator of Linux into their system can properly\ndetermine that. So any group that attempts to give a “severity score” to a\nLinux CVE is lying to you, UNLESS they know exactly your use case.\n\nALWAYS ignore any attempt that groups such as NIST/NVD that purport to\nassign things like CVSS scores to a vulnerability. Those numbers are false and\ngive companies a “fake sense of security”. We have\nasked NIST to stop\nassigning these scores, as it goes against the recently published CISA\nguidelines and we know it is keeping users from updating when they should be,\nas well as causing\nusers to update when they don’t need to be (why would your remote server with\nno physical access to it need to be updated due to a USB gadget driver\nvulnerability?)\n\nThere have been some “working groups” of organizations that use Linux in the\nsame way (i.e. cloud hosting companies) that have attempted to score CVE\nentries in the past. That is the only real way that any attempt to give a\nscore should ever be used, and we welcome groups doing this. However, it seems\nthat all of these groups have stopped doing this work, and instead, have found\nit simpler to just update to the latest stable kernel releases on a more\nregular cadence.\n\ncve.org is looking into having third-party “enrichments” of existing CVE ids,\nbased on the use case of that third party, be added directly to the cve.org\njson record as additional fields. If you are interested in doing this type of\nthing, please contact cve.org, but note that we do not think this is going to\nbe scalable at all, but are more than willing to be proven wrong.\n\nAs mentioned above, CVE ids are usually assigned on a one to two week delay\nfrom when the fix has landed in a released stable kernel version. This allows\nusers who are regularly taking the Linux stable releases to ensure that their\nsystems are secure before CVEs are announced to the world.\n\nKernel CVEs only reference a specific fix in the kernel tree, and do not\nreference any previous changes that might be needed in the tree before that\nspecific change. They are also not tested in an independent way, but only as a\nwhole with all other changes in a specific release by the kernel developer\ncommunity. Because of this, any attempt to only “cherry pick” specific CVE\nfixes can be difficult and is not recommended to be done at all.\n\nThe Linux kernel developer community provides, for free, a constant feed of\ntested bugfixes in stable kernel releases for all to use. Attempting to pick\nand choose individual commits from that feed will cause systems to miss needed\nfixes, as well as create a system that no one has ever seen or tested and can\nnot be supported by anyone else.\n\nThe bonus of just applying all stable releases is that you also get the data\ncorruption and performance improvements for your system as well as the security\nupdates. A result that many ecosystems have already realized is much simpler\noverall to do.\n\nAfter a kernel commit has been declared to be fixing a vulnerability, and\nassigned a CVE, publishing that data to the world in an automated way while\nbeing able to keep the records up to date easily over time at a high volume of\nassigned CVEs was a goal of the kernel CNA team. Over the past 2 years, they\nhave written a number of custom tools and a database to accomplish this,\nevolving from a single bash script to many thousands of lines of multiple\nprograms written in Rust and C. More about how all of those tools work, and\nthe difficulties in doing this all on a fast moving codebase like Linux, will\nbe explained in the next article in this series.",

    "description": "Tesla eliminated the option to purchase Full Self-Driving with a one-time fee over the weekend.",
    "fullText": "Tesla has shifted its Full Self-Driving feature to a subscription model.\n\nOver the weekend, the company removed the option to purchase the feature in the US via a one-time flat fee of $8,000.\n\nFor years, Tesla owners have been able to purchase the service with a one-time payment that would allow them to use it for the full lifespan of their vehicle. Now, the driver-assist feature is available only via a $99-per-month subscription.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk first announced in January that the change would take effect the following month. In the past, Musk has said that Teslas would serve as \"appreciating assets,\" suggesting owners could benefit as the software became increasingly more autonomous.\n\nThe decision to remove lifetime FSD purchases comes shortly after the carmaker stopped offering Autopilot as a free feature for new Tesla purchases. Previously, Autopilot acted as a free driver-assist feature on the expressway, while FSD was an additional paid feature for navigating city streets.\n\nTesla first introduced FSD in 2016, and the pricing has swung dramatically over time. In its early days, FSD cost around $5,000, later climbing to a peak of $15,000. In 2024, Tesla reduced the upfront price to $8,000. The carmaker first introduced a subscription option in 2021 for $199 per month, but the price was later lowered to $99 per month.\n\nMusk said in a post on X last month that the carmaker will raise FSD subscription prices as its \"capabilities improve.\"\n\nTesla's move to a more subscription-focused model reflects a broader industry trend. Under an executive performance plan approved last year, Musk's compensation depends in part on reaching 10 million active FSD subscriptions.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Qualitas Ltd (ASX:QAL) presented its first-half 2026 results on February 17, showcasing robust growth across key metrics despite a challenging global fundraising environment. The Australian alternative real estate investment manager has capitalized on shifting global private credit dynamics that favor the Asia-Pacific region over traditional U.S. markets.\n\nThe company’s stock responded positively to the results, with shares rising 4.21% to close at AUD 3.22 following the announcement, continuing its recovery from a 52-week low of AUD 2.14 toward its high of AUD 4.10.\n\nQualitas reported impressive growth across all major financial metrics, driven by strong deployment and expanding investor relationships. The company’s normalized net profit before tax (NPBT) reached AUD 30 million, representing a 30% increase compared to the first half of 2025.\n\nAs shown in the following summary of key performance metrics:\n\nFee Earning Funds Under Management (FEF) grew 38% year-over-year to AUD 10.9 billion, while deployment surged 57% to AUD 3.7 billion. Transaction fees increased by 69% to AUD 13 million, contributing to a funds management gross operating margin of 46%, up 4% from the previous year.\n\nThe company’s recurring revenue stream showed consistent growth, with recurring funds management revenue up 38% to AUD 43 million and base management fees increasing 28% to AUD 30 million compared to 1H25.\n\nQualitas’ financial results demonstrate the company’s ability to convert strong deployment into sustainable earnings growth. The group’s normalized EBITDA reached AUD 32.9 million with a margin of 51%, while statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) grew 27% to AUD 20.7 million.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of group earnings shows the primary drivers of this performance:\n\nFunds management continues to be the core engine of Qualitas’ growth, with funds management EBITDA margin expanding to 55%, up 4% from 1H25. This improvement reflects the company’s disciplined approach to scaling operations while maintaining cost efficiency.\n\nThe company’s earnings margins show a clear upward trajectory across multiple metrics:\n\nQualitas has successfully expanded its investor and borrower relationships, with 76% of deployment coming from repeat borrowers and 28% from follow-on investments. The company has built a substantial pool of potential embedded and unrecognized performance fees, now standing at AUD 99 million to be realized over the next seven years.\n\nThe company highlighted its expanding relationships with key stakeholders:\n\nResidential development remains a key driver of Qualitas’ growth, with the company gaining market share in financing larger-scale projects. This is particularly significant as residential developments are scaling up, creating demand for financiers with access to large-scale capital.\n\nQualitas is also benefiting from evolving global private credit dynamics, with investor interest shifting from the United States toward Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. This trend is expected to continue, with APAC fundraising growth projected to outpace the US over the next five years.\n\nQualitas reaffirmed its full-year 2026 guidance, projecting NPBT of AUD 60-66 million (representing 13-25% growth over FY25) and earnings per share of 13.9-15.3 cents.\n\nThe company’s outlook is supported by a strong pipeline of opportunities, with AUD 2.0 billion in available capital for deployment. Management highlighted that the undrawn construction credit profile and timing of deployment will be key factors influencing the final results within the guided range.\n\nGroup Managing Director Andrew Schwartz expressed confidence in the company’s positioning for the second half of the financial year, emphasizing Qualitas’ strategic initiatives and robust market position. This sentiment was echoed by Global Head of Real Estate Mark Fischer, who highlighted the stability of their investments, noting that their \"capital is deployed into real assets, supported by long-term, stable demand.\"\n\nThe company’s dividend policy reflects this confidence, with the interim dividend increasing by 40% to 3.5 cents per share compared to 1H25.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, Qualitas acknowledges potential challenges from interest rate fluctuations, competition from traditional banks, and global economic uncertainties that could influence investment decisions in the coming months.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.",

    "description": "A certification debacle left Lufthansa's complex 787 business class mostly empty for months. The airline said it can finally sell the lucrative seats.",
    "fullText": "Lufthansa can finally start making money on its Boeing 787 Dreamliners after a certification debacle left one of its most lucrative cabins largely empty for months.\n\nThe German flag carrier said on Monday that it will begin selling tickets for its Allegris business class on the 787. Allegris, Lufthansa's signature cabin concept, spans economy, premium economy, business, and first class, but the business class rollout has been particularly tricky.\n\nThe program first launched on the Airbus A350 in May 2024, with the cabin spanning the entire plane. The first Allegris-equipped 787 followed in October 2025, but certification of business class dragged on due to the cabin's complexity: there are five staggered seat configurations in a single airplane cabin — some with doors or more legroom, others with extra-long beds.\n\nThis is because the Dreamliner's geometry — including a slightly tighter usable footprint and different fuselage contouring compared to the A350 — made it harder to demonstrate to regulators that passengers could evacuate quickly from every seat, whether staggered, partially enclosed, or fully cocooned, in an emergency.\n\nThe result? For months, only four of the 28 business class seats could be sold — the front-row Business Class Suites — leaving the remaining 24 empty. Business class is a cash cow for airlines, and by flying most of the cabin empty as competitors pour investments into their own premium seats, Lufthansa was essentially leaving money on the table.\n\nIt has been a particularly costly headache for a carrier in the midst of a multi-year turnaround plan to restore profitability after years of financial pressure from frequent maintenance, aircraft shortages, rising operating costs, and labor strikes.\n\nLufthansa even opted for an already-certified business-class seat to retrofit onto its Airbus A380s rather than risk another prolonged and costly certification process.\n\nBut the saga is nearing the finish line. Beginning April 15, Lufthansa plans to carry passengers in 25 business-class seats on its 787s, with three remaining blocked in the second row of the cabin.\n\nBookings are open, though it's unclear whether the news indicates the seats have been fully certified or if that's just Lufthansa's expected timeline.\n\nLufthansa said \"Classic\" seats — one of the Allegris categories available — are free to secure with the premium fare.\n\nThe others require an extra fee: this includes the first-row suites, the \"Privacy\" seat next to the window, the \"Extra Space\" seat with more legroom, and the \"Extra Long Bed\" with an over seven-foot sleeping surface.\n\nThe three second-row seats that are blocked — and not yet available for booking — are two privacy seats and an extra-legroom seat.\n\nLufthansa flies eight Allegris-equipped Dreamliners and expects to have 29 by the end of 2027.\n\nThey are set to first fly from Frankfurt to Rio de Janeiro, Bogota, Cape Town, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, and Austin; New York-JFK and Los Angeles join the roster in June, followed by Delhi in July.\n\nAs part of Lufthansa's greater multibillion-dollar fleet overhaul plan, Allegris is also being fit onto the airline's existing A350s and Boeing 747-8s, as well as its future, yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777Xs.\n\nA similar spacing issue on the 747 double-deckers' upper level means it will have a split business class: the lower deck will have Allegris, while upstairs will feature the plane's original cabin.",

    "title": "AI's first wave was about cutting costs. The second wave is about building things we've never seen.",
    "description": "Startup CEOs like Kylan Gibbs and Sara Beykpour talk about AI's Second Wave, focusing on creating new products beyond cost-cutting.",
    "fullText": "For the past three years, AI has been mostly a cost-cutting tool. A growing number of founders and investors are trying to move beyond that era.\n\nThe next chapter of AI, they argue, will be defined by new kinds of products — apps, games, companions, and services that simply couldn't exist before large language models. They call it AI's \"Second Wave.\"\n\n\"The first wave of AI made existing things cheaper. Automation. Efficiency,\" said Kylan Gibbs, a former Google DeepMind product manager who runs AI startup Inworld. \"The next wave makes things that couldn't exist before. New products. New experiences. New revenue. That's the difference between optimizing spend and creating it.\"\n\nFor Gibbs, that distinction is existential. If AI merely trims costs, it reshuffles value within existing businesses. If it enables entirely new consumer products — ones people will pay for — it expands the economic pie.\n\n\"AI reaches its real economic potential when it creates value consumers want to pay for, not just value businesses want to save,\" he wrote on LinkedIn. That next phase, he says, requires a new \"consumer-scale AI stack\": real-time responses under 300 milliseconds, support for millions of users simultaneously, and deeply personal experiences tailored to individual preferences.\n\nIn January, Gibbs launched a Silicon Valley accelerator to back up to 30 \"Second Wave\" AI startups — companies building new consumer experiences rather than bolting chatbots onto old workflows. Venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, are involved, alongside leaders from OpenAI, Google, and Stripe. A demo day will take place in early March in San Francisco.\n\nThe philosophy echoes a recent post from Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan: \"Instead of worrying about doing the same thing we've been doing for cheaper, why not focus on doing the thing we never even dreamed of doing?\"\n\nA handful of startups already embody that ethos.\n\nSara Beykpour, CEO and cofounder of Particle, says the tech industry is in a liminal moment.\n\n\"We're in a transition between the first wave and the second wave,\" she said.\n\nThe first wave delivered massive productivity gains. At Particle, an AI-native news platform, tasks that once took a month can now be built, tested, and deployed in hours.\n\n\"We actually call each other out in meetings when someone falls into the old way of thinking,\" Beykpour said. \"We jokingly call it 'boomer thinking,' even though we're all millennials.\"\n\nThat shift in mindset gives the startup more time to focus on unlocking new AI-powered formats. Particle recently launched Podcast Clips, a feature that embeds the most relevant snippets of long-form podcasts directly into news stories. Instead of hunting through a three-hour episode, users see curated clips attached to specific topics.\n\n\"It changes the information hierarchy,\" Beykpour said. \"Instead of having to find the podcast you want to listen to, we're bringing the podcast to you based on the most relevant parts.\"\n\nUnder the hood, the system uses AI embeddings to map relationships between transcripts and stories. A clip from a talk show about Greenland and Davos, along with comments from President Donald Trump, can be automatically linked to relevant reporting. Generative AI then layers summaries and context on top.\n\nThese AI embeddings \"have gotten much better in important ways,\" Beykpour told Business Insider in a recent interview.\n\nIf Particle reimagines news, Luvu reinvents personal training using generative AI.\n\nLaunched in August 2025 by CEO Alexis Sursock and CTO Creston Brooks, the AI-powered fitness app has already attracted about 250,000 users. The app features an AI \"marshmallow\" that acts like a personal trainer, sending highly personalized notifications and real-time feedback.\n\n\"The key is the personalization, which is powered by AI models and wouldn't have been possible before this technology appeared in recent years,\" Brooks said.\n\nInstead of generic reminders — \"It's time for your workout\" — Luvu tailors messages. If a user logged that they had a test yesterday, the app might follow up with, \"Your test is over. Time to work out!\"\n\nThe results are striking. Luvu's notification click rate is four times that of typical non-personalized prompts. In an industry where only 2% to 3% of users remain active after 30 days, Brooks said, Luvu claims retention rates that are two to three times higher.\n\nThe app offers three motivational styles: supportive, neutral, or \"meaner marshmallow.\" Behind the scenes, Luvu also uses AI for granular, one-to-one messaging crafted by LLMs.\n\nThe company is also experimenting with reinforcement learning with verified rewards, a relatively new technique for training and improving AI models.\n\nUsers can prop their phones against a surface and record themselves exercising; the app uses computer-vision models to verify whether squats or other moves are performed correctly, offering real-time corrections like \"Straighten your knees.\" These verified signals feed back into the system, helping train what Brooks envisions as a future \"super-motivator\" model.\n\nThis isn't just a chatbot layered on top of a fitness tracker. It's a feedback loop between human behavior and AI, something that couldn't easily exist before the advent of modern models.\n\nFor Fai Nur, CEO and cofounder of AI-powered social simulation game Status, the Second Wave is about imagination.\n\n\"Status could not have existed before LLMs,\" she said.\n\nThe app, which has surpassed 3 million downloads, lets users role-play in AI-generated social media worlds. Think The Sims, though played out as a living, breathing social feed.\n\nUsers can cast themselves as anything they can imagine, such as Hogwarts students, soccer stars, or characters from \"Stranger Things.\" Post an update, and AI-generated characters instantly reply. Events unfold dynamically: miss a penalty kick, and face the backlash. An AI system assigns an \"aura score\" to grade responses and level players up or down.\n\nIn many enterprise settings, the non-deterministic nature of LLM outputs is a liability. Generative AI models sometimes respond to the same prompt in different ways, which doesn't lend itself to applications that require strict accuracy.\n\nIn gaming, this can be an asset because each new AI-generated response can be new, creating a richer, more varied experience.\n\n\"You haven't been able to role-play like this until now,\" Nur said.\n\nBefore LLMs, creating immersive fandom worlds required persuading other humans to participate. Now, entire social universes spin up instantly.\n\nFor Gibbs and other proponents of AI's Second Wave, that's the point. The technology's future won't be defined by incremental cost savings, but by products that feel native to AI — experiences that surprise, motivate, inform, and entertain at consumer scale.\n\nIf the first wave made businesses leaner, the second may make everyday life stranger, richer, and more interactive — and, crucially, something people will pay for.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.

    "fullText": "Although billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg have expansive portfolios, they're not among the largest landowners in the United States.\n\nIn fact, they're not even close.\n\nThe Land Report published its annual roundup of the top private landowners across the country in January. The outlet has collected land ownership data for nearly two decades.\n\nIn 2026, the list includes several billionaires, the children of business moguls, and the family of a former Texas governor.\n\nStanley Kroenke is the largest private landowner in the US with 2.7 million acres. The billionaire bought over 937,000 deeded acres in New Mexico last December, marking the single-largest land purchase in over a decade, according to The Land Report.\n\nKroenke — married to Walmart heiress Ann Walton — is a real estate mogul who has invested heavily in sports teams through his holdings company, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment. That includes owning the NBA's Denver Nuggets, the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, the NFL's Los Angeles Rams, and the Arsenal Football Club.\n\nThe Emmerson Family is the largest private timberland owner in the country, which may not be surprising given their business.\n\nSierra Pacific Industries — founded in 1949 — says it owns and manages over 2.4 million acres of timberland in Washington, Oregon, and California.\n\nMark D. Emmerson and George Emmerson, the sons of Sierra Pacific Industries cofounder Archie \"Red\" Emmerson, now helm the company.\n\nJohn Malone, also known as the Cable Cowboy, is a billionaire media mogul who led Tele-Communications Inc. for over 25 years.\n\nHe owns 2.2 million acres of land across New Mexico, Wyoming, Florida, and Colorado, according to The Land Report.\n\nThe Malone Family Land Preservation Foundation has a joint initiative with The Land Institute called the Perennial Agriculture Project. The project funds research about perennial crop system development.\n\nTed Turner has amassed 2 million acres of land following a high-profile career in American broadcasting.\n\nTurner led Turner Broadcasting Systems before founding CNN, the country's first 24-hour all-news network, in 1980. Eight years later, he created TNT.\n\nTurner Enterprises Inc. oversees the billionaire's investments, business interests, and land holdings. That includes the millions of acres and over 45,000 bison.\n\nThe Reed Family, owners of the Green Diamond Resource Company, has over 1.6 million acres of land, according to the report.\n\nThe Green Diamond Resource Company is one of the largest timberland owner-operators in the US, managing 2.2 million acres across nine states.\n\nThe family-owned business has spanned six generations. Douglas Reed serves as the company's president and chair.\n\nThe Buck Family has accumulated 1.3 million acres across the country, making them the sixth-largest US landowner, according to the report.\n\nThe Buck family amassed their wealth through the late Peter Buck, who cofounded Pete's Super Submarines in Connecticut. The franchise later became Subway, which has over 20,000 restaurants globally.\n\nThe Irving family owns 1.2 million acres in Maine, as well as additional land in parts of Canada, according to the report.\n\nJames Dergavel Irving founded J.D. Irving, Limited, in 1882. The Canadian company's original portfolio included a sawmill, a gristmill, a carding mill, a farm, a general store, and a lumber business.\n\nNow, J.D. Irving, Limited has expanded its services into consumer products, construction, transportation, and other sectors. Robert Irving and Jim Irving serve as co-CEOs.\n\nThe report ranked the heirs of King Ranch, the largest ranch in the US, at No. 8, with 911,000 acres.\n\nThe ranch got its start in 1853 when Captain Richard King purchased land in South Texas. The ranch says it also owns land in Florida.\n\nKing Ranch has a wide range of operations, from cattle ranching to breeding horses.\n\nThe heirs of David Pingree Sr. founded the Seven Islands Land Company in 1964. Pingree was a Salem, Massachusetts, shipping merchant who invested in Maine's timberlands in the 1800s.\n\nAs of 2026, the family has amassed 830,000 acres, according to the report.\n\nThe report ranked the heirs of Hugh Roy Cullen at No. 10 with 800,000 acres in the US.\n\nThe Cullen Foundation says Hugh's career began in Texas in the 1890s. He entered the cotton business before investing in real estate.\n\nHugh founded Quintana Petroleum Corporation in 1932. The company's mining division — Quintana Minerals Corporation— was formed 31 years later.\n\nNow, the corporation is a management company run by the Robertson family. Corbin J. Robertson Jr. is Cullen's grandson.\n\nThe Briscoe family is the 11th largest US landowner.\n\nThe late Dolph Briscoe, Jr., was the governor of Texas from 1973 to 1979. The family's holdings, spanning over 1,000 square miles, are overseen by Dolph \"Chip\" Briscoe III, according to the report.",

    "title": "AH-64 Apache Is Getting Proximity Fuzed 30mm Cannon Ammo For Swatting Down Drones",
    "description": "The XM1225 APEX ammo will offer another arrow in the Apache's growing anti-drone quiver.",
    "fullText": "The AH-64 Apache attack helicopter has evolved into a counter-drone platform in recent years — something we have been following closely. While the Israeli Air Force had pioneered this role for the AH-64 for years, the U.S. Army has now formally codified it and added new capabilities in the process. Now, as we had suggested some time ago, the Apache is getting proximity-fuzed 30mm cannon shells for its chin-mounted M230 cannon that will add to its drone-killing arsenal, giving it a cheaper and more plentiful engagement option than some of the alternatives.\n\nCRAZY footage of an IAF Apache helicopter chasing down a Hezbollah drone over northern Israel and downing it with cannon fire from its chaingun\n\n— Raylan Givens (@JewishWarrior13) November 2, 2024\n\nApaches live-fire tested the 30x113mm XM1225 Aviation Proximity Explosive (APEX) ammo last December, according to a recent Army release. The trials occurred at the service’s sprawling Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) in southern Arizona. Multiple test engagements occurred against various types of drone targets.\n\nThe specialized APEX ammunition works by detonating only when it is close to an object, then it explodes in a spray of shrapnel. This is critical to shooting down drones as they are small, independently moving targets, and the Apache’s monocle-targeted chin gun isn’t exactly a sniper rifle in terms of precision. At the same time, the rounds could also be used against targets on the surface — including personnel, soft-skinned vehicles, and small boats, for instance — offering unique area effects compared to the Apache’s standard impact-detonating, high-explosive ammunition.\n\nVariants of the M230 cannon, the prime contractor for which is now Northrop Grumman, have already become an increasingly popular choice for dealing with lower-end drone threats from the ground. The light-weight M230LF version, designated the M914 in Army service, has found its way onto counter-drone vehicles. This includes the Sgt. Stout Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) system based on the 8×8 Stryker light armored vehicle. The Army has been separately pursuing self-destructing and other kinds of proximity-fuzed 30mm ammunition for use with the M914. The new APEX ammo offers improved performance that can plug-and-play with the Apache/M230 combo. The other rounds for use in ground-based systems have never been cleared for use on the Apache to our knowledge.\n\nAn official Army release on the XM1225’s successful testing reads, in part:\n\n“Developed and managed by Product Manager Medium Caliber Ammunition (PdM MCA) from Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the XM1225 APEX cartridge is designed to counter modern threats, including UAS, exposed personnel, and small boats, without requiring modifications to the Apache’s M230 Area Weapon System or fire control system. The XM1225 has undergone extensive safety testing to ensure reliable performance, making it a safe and effective addition to the Apache’s arsenal. This innovative design ensures seamless integration into existing platforms while delivering enhanced lethality and operational flexibility.\n\n…The primary objective was to evaluate the XM1225 cartridge’s accuracy and compare its performance to the legacy M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge under identical conditions. A secondary objective was to collect data on mixed loads of XM1225 and M789 rounds against both ground and UAS targets.\n\nInitial results were highly successful, with the XM1225 meeting all accuracy requirements and demonstrating exceptional effectiveness against both ground and UAS targets. The proximity-fuzed capability of the XM1225 allows it to detonate near the target, creating a larger lethal radius and significantly improving its ability to neutralize airborne and dispersed threats. This capability positions the Apache to dominate the battlefield in both air-to-ground and air-to-air engagements, providing warfighters with a critical edge in modern combat scenarios.”\n\nA key feature of the APEX ammunition is that it requires little additional training for Apache crews to successfully employ it as it acts very similarly, ballistically, to the M789 high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP) rounds already fielded. Those shells use an impact/grazing fuze to command detonation.\n\nA major issue with using any gun for counter-drone work from the air is that standard high-explosive or incendiary cannon rounds simply keep traveling until they hit something, then they explode. This makes any horizontal or upward aspect shots very problematic, as the rounds can fly many miles before hitting the ground. Anyone or anything in that unpredictable zone would not fare well. Even high-deflection shots are risky, especially considering the size of the drones. Not only will most rounds miss and still hit somewhere below, but the aircraft can easily fly into the drone itself, as judging its distance and keeping track of it in the air is problematic. So, having self-destructing rounds, and even better, proximity fuzed ones that do the same, is key.\n\nAs it sits now, the AH-64 has modified AGM-114 missiles that use the Longbow Radar to prosecute aerial targets. Laser-guided Hellfires are potentially another option. Regardless, any Hellfire costs well into the six-digit realm. Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) laser-guided rockets are a lower-cost option, having a low-to-mid five-digit price tag. It isn’t clear if the AH-64 has been cleared to use air-to-air optimized Fixed Wing, Air Launched, Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Ordnance (FALCO) versions of the APKWS II, which also use a proximity fuze for going after aerial targets, yet.\n\nSo, giving AH-64s the gun option, and in a far more reliable and safer manner via a proximity fuzed round, would be a huge boon for crews tasked with the counter-drone mission. Apaches can carry a whopping 1,200 rounds of 30mm ammunition, and they can be reloaded with more very quickly at forward austere locales on the ground.\n\nSo as it sits now, it likely won’t be too long before the AH-64 has a new arrow in its anti-drone quiver.\n\nContact the author: Tyler@twz.com",

    "fullText": "With a very high cost of operation and in many cases, a concentrated market of competitors, many smaller and even mid-size airlines have already filed for bankruptcy in the first two months of 2026.\n\nA few names of these names include Royal Air Philippines, Indian charter carrier Dove Airlines, Swedish carrier H-Bird, and U.S. charter airline Tailwind Air.\n\nIn the latter case, the carrier, based out of Westchester County Airport (HPN) in New York, filed for Chapter 11 protection after losing its Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) due to lack of funds in January 2025.\n\nThe AOC, the primary certification that allows a civil airline to begin running and selling flights, is issued by the government agency that regulates aviation in a given country (the FAA in the United States).\n\nOver in Austria, Mali Air became the latest small carrier to lose its AOC. Contrary to what its name might suggest, Air Mali had no connection to the West African nation of Mali. It was founded by Austrian pilot and aviation investor Karl-Heinz Mali in 1994 with a single twin-engine Cessna 340A jet.\n\nAs first reported by Swiss outlet ch-aviation, Mali Air no longer had an active AOC as of Feb. 16.\n\nBased out of the regional Graz Airport (GRZ) in southeastern Austria, Mali Air started out by offering wealthy travelers charter flights from Austria to multiple destinations in Eastern Europe in the 1990s and eventually expanded to more European destinations over the years.\n\nOn its website, Mali Air reports a fleet of four planes: a Cessna 340, a Cessna Citation 501, an Eclipse 500, and an Eclipse 550. The latter is a twin-engine jet with just six passenger seats.\n\nIt is not immediately clear whether Mali Air lost an active AOC over its financial situation, a failed safety audit, or another reason, which, in many such cases, relates to operational mismanagement.\n\nThe company also advertises loosely defined services, such as aircraft management and \"complete air logistics services of all cargo and restricted dangerous goods.\"\n\n\"By actively promoting your aircraft for third-party charter flights, we also help you earn income on your aircraft while reducing your fixed expenses,\" Mali Air writes on its website.\n\nSpirit Airlines (Spirit Aviation Holdings, Inc.): Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time on August 29,2025.\n\nRavn Alaska: Ceased operations in August 2025 after earlier Chapter 11 proceedings; shut down flights and folded into other operations such as New Pacific.\n\nCorporate Air: Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (restructuring) in September 2025 as part of a planned sale, according to Bondoro.\n\nPlay Airlines: The Reykjavik-based airline shut down operations and entered involuntary bankruptcy in September 2025.\n\nBraathens Airlines:The airline was forced to file for bankruptcy and canceled all of its flights in September 2025.",

    "description": "Wales needs a specialist defence coach but Welsh rugby greats Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones question when that will happen and who decides.",
    "fullText": "Steve Tandy needs help. As head coach of a crisis-ridden Wales side plunging to new depths every time they take to the field, that much is obvious.\n\nSpecifically, according to two Welsh rugby greats, Tandy needs the support of a full-time defence coach.\n\nHis work as defence coach for Scotland impressed enough to earn the same role with the British and Irish Lions, so Tandy was expected to tighten things up for Wales when he took the reins last September.\n\nYet there has been little case for the defence with Wales.\n\nIn his first six games in charge - albeit including the world's top four teams in their last four Tests - Tandy's Wales have conceded a staggering 302 points and 42 tries.\n\nThe latest battering, Sunday's 54-12 mauling by France in Cardiff, leaves Wales bottom of the Six Nations having already shipped 102 points. No team has conceded \n\nTandy has confirmed Wales will have a specialist defence coach by the summer but the timing of that appointment - and who makes it - has been questioned.\n\nWales cling to optimism despite another record loss\n\nLowest Cardiff Six Nations crowd amid rugby turmoil\n\nScotland game chance for Wales to 'deliver better'\n\nWales have full-time attack and forwards coaches in the form of Matt Sherratt and Danny Wilson, but Tandy only has the temporary support of Dan Lydiate – still very early in his coaching career – in defence.\n\nJuggling that work with his head coach duties, Tandy might be spreading himself too thinly, according to former Wales captains Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\n\"Mid-season it's hard to transition and get someone in,\" Tandy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to have a look at and, probably by the summer, we'll have an option then.\n\n\"It isn't a quick fix. It's something we need to layer and build towards the future.\"\n\nWarburton won two Six Nations titles, including a Grand Slam, with a Wales team built on the rock-solid defensive foundation provided by Shaun Edwards, who now holds that role for France.\n\nThe former Wales captain said Tandy needs help with defence.\n\n\"Steve's admitted he's probably spread himself a bit too thinly,\" Warburton told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He's been doing the defence with Dan Lydiate but then you're trying to do the defence with all the other things that come with being a head coach.\n\n\"Dan is more the micro defensive skills [such as] tackle technique, competition on the floor.\n\n\"Wales don't have a full-time defence coach [and] it's not just about being a coach during campaign time. When the players are playing for their clubs, you're there full-time, watching the regions play, or the Welsh-qualified players playing in England, and you can still keep dialogue and send clips.\n\n\"He needs to bring in a defence coach [but] it sounds like they can't get people out of their contracts because it's difficult to bring people in mid-season.\n\n\"For someone to come in as a full-time defence coach, they need to be tried and tested at this level.\"\n\nWhen taking his role as Welsh Rugby Union's director of rugby last July, Dave Reddin said Tandy would \"not solely select\" his coaching team but would be involved in the process.\n\nHe added: \"It's about getting the right people in those spots as opposed to just getting the next people. It might well be that people are in position already and we need to be a bit more patient.\"\n\nWhoever that new appointment might be, Alun Wyn Jones believes his former Ospreys team-mate Tandy should have the biggest say in the matter.\n\n\"Steve needs to be able to oversee everything and get others to focus on those areas,\" he said.\n\n\"The bigger question I'd ask: Is he going to appoint his own defence coach?\n\n\"There have been questions around that, as opposed to other people in the organisation. That's the most important thing – he's got to be able to pick his own staff.\n\n\"He's got a great grip of the defence, but you can't spread yourself too thinly in that position.\"",

    "description": "The second weekend of the Six Nations brings redemption for Scotland, another blistering display from France and a threat for Ireland.",
    "fullText": "Redemption for Scotland as they end England's unbeaten run, Ireland squeeze past improving Italy, and can anyone stop France?\n\nHere are the main talking points from an enthralling second round of the Six Nations.\n\nThere were questions asked of Scotland and head coach Gregor Townsend after the opening weekend defeat by Italy but you would struggle to find a more emphatic riposte than their 31-20 victory over England.\n\nScotland started brilliantly and never took their foot off the gas to hand Steve Borthwick's side a first defeat in 13 games and improve on their dominant recent record in Calcutta Cup games, having now won six of the past nine.\n\nSpeaking to the Rugby Union Weekly podcast, former Scotland international Johnnie Beattie said: \"This was special. They were humbled last weekend in Rome and this time we had a chance to humble England here and came through.\n\n\"Everything that went wrong last week was righted. We fought and scrapped for everything. It was fully deserved and was a comprehensive Calcutta Cup win.\"\n\nBeattie said Scotland have always had the capacity to win one-off games against top sides but must find more consistency.\n\n\"They've had these seminal moments but not put together a consistent run that would put them in a position to compete for a championship,\" he added.\n\n\"It's how consistently can you find ways to beat these top-level opposition and Scotland don't have the answer yet. Can you finish in the top three? There are some huge games. We have to back it up.\"\n\n'Murrayfield pain will make England a better team'\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nEngland went into the game against Scotland looking for a 13th straight win and a first in Edinburgh since 2020, but were unable to cope with Scotland's energy and intensity.\n\nThey lost last week's hat-trick hero Henry Arundell to an early yellow card, which later became a red, and when they threatened to stage a comeback a chargedown on George Ford's drop-goal attempt led to Huw Jones' eighth try against England - the most of any player in the Six Nations era.\n\n\"Scotland were 20 points better not 11. They were comprehensive winners,\" ex-England scrum-half Matt Dawson told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"In the cold light of day England were taken apart from minute one to minute 80. Scotland were miles better.\"\n\nThe loss was England's fourth in their past five Six Nations away matches and Dawson questioned their tactics.\n\n\"For me it wasn't so much about the kicking game. It was like if that's not working what else are you going to do? Scotland had done their homework and defended ferociously and England were getting no change out of it, so what's the tactic?\" said Dawson.\n\n\"England didn't adjust accordingly. It was a masterclass from the Scotland coaching staff because England were nowhere.\"\n\nFormer England winger Chris Ashton told Rugby Special he felt England looked \"disjointed\" and there had been a \"snowball effect\" as errors mounted up.\n\n\"A lot of it was not being able to handle pressure. It was one thing after another so early in the game. England lost every battle,\" he added.\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\n'I felt guilty' - Tuipulotu says Scotland delivered for Townsend\n\nFrance are the only team still capable of a Grand Slam and the unbeaten Les Bleus put on another masterclass with a 54-12 win over Wales in Cardiff.\n\nIn a blistering display of speed, scything running and joie de vivre, France made 10 line-breaks in the opening 20 minutes on their way to scoring the most points they have racked up against Wales, surpassing the 51-0 win at Wembley in 1998.\n\nAn agile and mobile pack, allied with a magical backline playing with total freedom, the blue shirts were like a blur leaving Wales chasing shadows.\n\n\"You look at this France team and think, who stops them? They have it all,\" former Scotland back row John Barclay told Rugby Special.\n\nAshton said the French side could \"score at will\" and singled out winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey for praise.\n\n\"His all-round game is fantastic, he always seems so confident and does things not many players can,\" he added. \"He's the go-to guy for France.\"\n\nWill anyone stop 'massive favourites' France in Six Nations?\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nThese are tough times to be a Wales fan. The hardest in living memory for a generation who grew up with regular Six Nations success and a team full of stars such as Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\nThere are many issues at play in Welsh rugby, but by any measure, recent results are a complete horror show as Sunday's record loss to France made it 13 consecutive Six Nations defeats and a 10th straight loss at home in the championship.\n\nIt's now 1,072 days since their last Six Nations victory in March 2023 against Italy in Rome and 1,464 days since their last championship win at home against Scotland in February 2022.\n\nIt appears supporters are starting to vote with their feet. The attendance against France was 57,744, making it the lowest Six Nations crowd in Cardiff.\n\nBut speaking after the game on BBC One, former captain Warburton was encouraged by some parts of Wales' play and said they need to look at what went well such as the maul defence, line-out and the performance of Eddie James.\n\n\"Some aspects of the game went quite well, they weren't outpowered, they were outclassed with ball handling. There are some positives to take into next week,\" said Warburton.\n\n\"Looking at the small wins, there's no point kicking them when they're down. It has to be how can we get better from this point? Which young players look like they've got the mentality?\n\n\"We're not trying to solve this in one week, we're in this for a couple of years so let's all get tight and every week look for small improvements and move forward.\"\n\nJones said there had \"definitely been green shoots\".\n\n\"The effort was there but it's international rugby and you're going to be judged on results, but it was there from an effort standpoint,\" he added.\n\nEx-England captain Martin Johnson also offered words of encouragement.\n\n\"Wales can always play and score tries, they have good rugby players so you're never that far away and they can sit there thinking they've been smashed at home against a very good French side.\n\n\"But there will be some games coming up where they think we can win this.\"\n\n'Heartbreaking, sad, disgrace' – Wales fans react to state of game\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nWales still rugby nation despite struggles - Tandy\n\nAfter losing to France in the opening round, Andy Farrell's side survived a scare against an improving Italy side fresh from a home victory over Scotland.\n\nIreland have won all 13 home games against Italy in the Six Nations but that 100% record came under serious threat.\n\nAshton told Rugby Special that Italy, who led at half-time, missed a wonderful opportunity to get a first victory in Ireland.\n\n\"It would have been a long 10 days for Ireland so Farrell would have been happy they got the win but Italy missed so many opportunities. They've got to be annoyed they didn't get the win,\" he told Rugby Special.\n\nFarrell has a big decision to make before Saturday's match away at England after a difficult afternoon for starting fly-half Sam Prendergast, who was replaced by Jack Crowley, with the Munster man putting in a strong showing off the bench.\n\n\"It's hard for Ireland right now, they're in a funny place. They want success all the time and it's going to be hard for them at Allianz Stadium,\" Ashton told Rugby Special.\n\nBarclay added: \"They're not quite there but you don't write them off. They've got experienced British and Irish Lions and it's just small tweaks missing.\"\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nI think Crowley starts against England - Murray\n\nItaly captain Lamaro proud perception has changed\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.",

He did not have a criminal record.\n\nHe will be questioned by prosecutors on Tuesday. The child was treated in hospital and is recovering at home with her parents.\n\n“A survival instinct kicked in,” the father of the toddler, named as Matteo, told Italian television. “To see your daughter in danger is dreadful. The reaction was immediate. You don’t think, you just act.”\n\nHe said that his daughter was seated in a trolley while they were shopping but then wanted to walk.\n\n“I gave her to my partner and I was pushing the trolley. It all happened in a fraction of a second. It is not something that you expect, particularly because the supermarket was packed with people.\n\n“I must thank all the supermarket staff who intervened and the police, who were quick to arrive. My daughter is OK and she is playing despite the plaster cast she has to wear.”\n\nMarco Cadeddu, a senior police officer, said it was a very serious incident. “We arrested the man, took him to the police station, and took care of the child, who was taken to hospital. It could have ended up being a lot worse.”\n\nElena Carnevali, the mayor of Bergamo, expressed solidarity with the parents for the “terrifying experience” they endured.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "The Premier League and English Football League will resume their procedures for Ramadan, with matches pausing briefly to allow Muslim players to break their fast.\n\nRamadan starts this week and will last for a month. During the this time, Muslims abstain from food and drink from dawn until sunset.\n\nWith sunset in the UK ranging from about 17:00 to 19:00 GMT during this period, the only games that could see a break in play will be Saturday's 17:30 kick-off and Sunday's 16:30 kick-off.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, club captains alongside match officials will find a natural pause in the game to allow Muslim players or match officials to break their fast.\n\nTeams and match officials will discuss beforehand whether a pause is required and an approximate time for the stoppage will be agreed. The break will not be used as a team drinks break nor as a tactical time-out.\n\nPlay will not stop while matches are in mid-flow but at the earliest convenient moment during a goal-kick, free-kick or throw-in.\n\nIn 2021, an agreement was put in place to allow Muslim players to break their fast during a Premier League match.\n\nThis first break took place in a game between Leicester City and Crystal Palace in April 2021. The match was paused at a goal-kick around the half-hour mark to allow Leicester's Wesley Fofana and Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate, external to replenish themselves with liquids and energy gels.\n\nOne of the five pillars of Islam is that during Ramadan, Muslims fast during daylight hours to show their devotion to their religion.\n\nMuslim names in the Premier League include Mohamed Salah, William Saliba, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Amad Diallo among others.\n\n\"In the Premier League you are free to do whatever suits you. They will never do anything against your faith and this is great,\" former Everton player Abdoulaye Doucoure told BBC Sport in 2023.\n\n\"I fast every day, I don't miss any day. It has become normal and very easy for me. Training is still the same during Ramadan but when we go [for away matches], we might need to eat later than the others so the chef prepares food for us, making sure everything is in place as at home. We get halal food so there are no problems,\" Doucoure added.\n\nAnd in 2022, former Liverpool player Sadio Mane revealed the club altered their training schedules to support their Muslim players during the month of Ramadan.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Indiana-based PARLOUR Pizza + Pints, which opened its first Lexington location on Harrodsburg Road in 2024, is expanding.\n\nNow, the newest PARLOUR will be coming to Richmond. The new restaurant will open in a former Hooters at 241 Eastern Bypass, about a mile from Eastern Kentucky University, in late March, according to Don Robinson, PARLOUR CEO and president.\n\n“It was always a part of our target demographic for bringing PARLOUR to the Lexington market,” he said. “Most of the time the real estate kind of dictates the location. We really like the layout and the visibility.”\n\nHe said they’d actually intended to open a second Lexington location first, but construction delays mean the Richmond restaurant will leapfrog one coming soon to the Hamburg area.\n\nThis summer, he said, a PARLOUR will open on Justice Drive, near Harry’s, Drake’s, Malone’s, Graeter’s Ice Cream and more. Like the one at 2099 Harrodsburg, the Hamburg spot will have a “UK room” showcasing the University of Kentucky Wildcats and artwork from local artists.\n\nAll will have the same menu and very similar design, usually with outdoor seating. The one in Richmond will have an enclosed patio, but it has five garage doors that can be opened to bring that “inside out” atmosphere, he said. The smaller location doesn’t a have a separate room, but will incorporate local artwork throughout, he said.\n\nThe restaurant chain is known for its relaxed vibe with tons of TVs for watching sports while you enjoy handmade pizza, calzones, grinders, saucy smoked wings, craft cocktails and extensive craft beer selection. Signature dishes include the Sriracha Bourbon BBQ Nachos.\n\nWhy so much expansion in Central Kentucky already? Because business is booming.\n\n“We have been blown away by the way the Lexington Market has welcomed us,” Robinson said. “It’s our No. 1 store out of all of them. It’s been really fun. I didn’t spend a lot of time in Lexington until that store opened, and it’s been fabulous.”\n\nBesides Lexington, there are three locations in Louisville and two in Indiana.\n\nRichmond made sense as well: “We think it’s an underserved market, and we think it’s fantastic.”\n\nAnd if you don’t live in Lexington or Richmond, don’t worry. PARLOUR might be coming your way soon with more growth in the works.\n\n“We’re looking at a couple of different markets,” Robinson said. “We hope to get another one or so open by the end of the year, then three or four a year.”\n\nNew Lexington restaurants opening in 2026: Downtown changes as south side grows\n\nNew Mexican restaurant, sports bar opening in familiar Lexington location\n\nParent of restaurant chain that started in Lexington files for bankruptcy\n\nNew family entertainment venue with ax throwing coming to Lexington\n\nNew Lexington pizza chain has made-from-scratch dough, sauces (including garlic)",

    "description": "A powerful Valentine’s Day storm destroyed a centuries-old seaside arch in southern Italy long associated with romance, dealing a blow to local tourism and highlighting concerns about coastal erosion ...",
    "fullText": "An Italian coastal beauty spot known as “Lovers’ Arch” because of its popularity with courting couples collapsed during heavy storms on Valentine’s Day in what one local official called “a blow to the heart.”\n\nFaraglioni di Sant’Andrea, the site of an arch in the stone cliffs on the coast of Salento — the heel of Italy’s “boot’ — has drawn romantically inclined visitors for centuries, with lovers traditionally proposing marriage, stealing first kisses or celebrating unions. Those who kissed under the arch were destined for eternal love, according to local legend.\n\nBut when a powerful storm swept across southern Italy over the weekend, the arch’s fragile structure gave way, reducing it to a pile of rubble.\n\nIts collapse has dealt a “devastating blow to the image of Salento and to tourism,” Maurizio Cisternino, mayor of the town of Melendugno, near the fallen arch, told CNN. “It’s a blow to the heart.”\n\nThe arch was formed by centuries of harsh wind and high seas grinding away at the Calcarenite stone cliffs of Italy’s Puglia region, on the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea. The site, once a strategic lookout used to warn of pirates, became a magnet for lovers during the late 18th century.\n\nInstagram photos have drawn thousands more couples to the arch in recent years, Cisternino said. Because it’s free and open to the public, it’s impossible to know exactly how many, he added.\n\nLorenzo Barlato, a local resident, proposed to his wife on the clifftop overlooking the arch more than 40 years ago and the pair often returned for anniversaries.\n\n“I couldn’t wait to return,” he posted on Facebook after Saturday’s collapse. “Now, unfortunately, all I have left are the many beautiful photos I took of that piece of paradise.”\n\nThe area is so popular that hotels and resorts — many named for the arch — have sprung up to accommodate visitors.\n\nWarmer sea temperatures as a result of climate change are seen as a factor in driving the extreme weather that battered the arch, which had already been damaged by Cyclone Harry in January.\n\nBut concern over the landmark’s fragility goes back years.\n\nIn 2024, local authorities applied for a $4.5 million grant to fund a preservation project to combat coastal erosion, but failed to secure the money, according to Cisternino.\n\n“It’s a tragedy we knew was inevitable, we just didn’t expect it to happen so soon,” he told local media on Sunday.\n\nHe told CNN that “nature has reclaimed the arch, just as it created it,” and said that resources were needed to tackle the situation along the coast.\n\n“Nature has been transformed: what was there 30 years ago is no longer there.”\n\nThe collapse follows weeks of violent storms across southern Italy. In Sicily, a landslide recently saw houses fall into a ravine in the town of Niscemi. Widespread flooding has taken the lives of several people, including a man who died when his home collapsed near Rome last week.\n\nNow gone, the remnants of the arch will be left to wash out at sea, the municipality says. “It’s like a funeral,” Puglia tourism councillor Francesco Stella said Sunday of what was once one of the happiest places in Italy.",

    "description": "Macclesfield's FA Cup odyssey may have ended against Brentford but they have made memories to last a lifetime, says chief football writer Phil McNulty.",
    "fullText": "The tifo stretched across the Star Lane end by Macclesfield's fans moments before the start of the FA Cup tie with Brentford was emblazoned with the message: \"Against All Odds\".\n\nIt was also displayed in the players' tunnel at Moss Rose as John Rooney's side walked out to attempt a repeat of the historic third-round win against Premier League opposition that left holders Crystal Palace embarrassed and beaten.\n\nAnd for 70 minutes on a freezing Cheshire night, Macclesfield suggested lightning could strike twice as they once again stood toe-to-toe with top-flight opposition, refusing to give an inch.\n\nIt was only then, as tired legs started to betray the National League North side and the gap of 116 places on the game's pyramid finally started to show, that one cruel moment took the dream away.\n\nSam Heathcote, the PE teacher who has been a hero of Macclesfield's FA Cup run, was the victim of the fates this great tournament can inflict along with its glory when he headed Aaron Hickey's cross into his own net.\n\nBrentford grabbed at the gift, even then surviving the odd anxious moment before they were finally able to celebrate victory.\n\nThe honours were Macclesfield's, as illustrated by Brentford head coach Keith Andrews graciously going into their dressing room to offer his personal tribute to their display, before speaking in glowing terms about their opponents.\n\nHe said: \"I love stories like Macclesfield's. They fill my heart. I though they were awesome and a real tribute to John Rooney and his coaching team.\"\n\nRooney, despite the disappointment, appreciated Andrews' words as he said: \"He told us he had seen real togetherness in our group and that's what we work on. We have a good changing room and it takes you a long way.\n\n183 team changes in 14 ties - but does it really matter for the FA Cup?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nMatheson on Old Trafford heroics, 'torrid time' as £1m teenager & McLeod death\n\n\"I really couldn't be prouder of the team. For us to go toe-to-toe with two Premier League teams and to only lose by an own goal is something I'm incredibly proud of.\n\n\"All the lads are down and Sam's the same obviously, having scored an own goal. It's natural, but every player knows what they have achieved for this club on this journey, so we should all be so proud.\n\n\"We now go back to our bread and butter in the league. We train twice a week and we've put that performance on against a Premier League side. How can you not be proud of that achievement?\n\n\"I started my football career at this club and I've started my managerial career at this club. We want to go on and get promoted. We want to try and get in the play-offs.\"\n\nMacclesfield's fans arrived in a blizzard of optimism, the rainbow that arced over this compact, atmospheric stadium after a storm two hours before kick-off offering up an omen that they could claim another pot of gold.\n\nAnd how they revelled in another visit from a Premier League team, chanting \"West Ham away\" after hearing the fifth round draw, then \"are you Palace in disguise\" as they tore into Brentford - both physically and with their football - in the opening exchanges.\n\nMacclesfield captain Paul Dawson, a goal hero in the 2-1 win against Palace, was inches away from a repeat with a 20-yard shot that was just off target.\n\nEvery classic FA Cup ingredient was in this mix. The non-league side with a collection of PE teachers, podcasters and property developers in their squad shaking up elite opposition, with the added factor of Moss Rose's 4G artificial surface.\n\nThere was nothing artificial about the atmosphere as every Macclesfield fan scented another shock in the cold night air.\n\nFew other competitions can offer up such a spectacle and the FA Cup delivered again.\n\nIn some respects, the half-time whistle came at a bad time for Macclesfield as it disturbed their momentum and allowed Brentford to take a breath and regroup.\n\nBrentford head coach Andrews made seven changes, leaving his big attacking weapon Igor Thiago out altogether. It was a high-risk strategy and there were moments in the first 45 minutes when it looked like it might backfire.\n\nAnd even after suffering the devastating blow of Heathcote's own goal, Macclesfield refused to allow Brentford to simply shut the game down, forcing several desperate clearances in the area before referee Darren England sounded the final whistle on this FA Cup odyssey.\n\nMacclesfield will now return to their real world against King's Lynn Town on Saturday - but they have created FA Cup memories that will live forever with players and fans of a club on the rise.\n\nBrentford edge past non-league Macclesfield after second-half own goal\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil begins.\n\nSarina Wiegman's side travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThere are just eight international camps before England hope to be in Brazil for the World Cup - so they will want to ensure there are no slip-ups in their first qualifying matches of the year.\n\nEngland have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.\n\nWiegman will name her squad for the first time in 2026 on Tuesday at 11:00 - who might feature and what are the key decisions for the Dutchwoman?\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nEngland have not had a competitive fixture since winning Euro 2025 as they beat China 8-0 and Ghana 2-0 in friendly matches at the end of last year.\n\nBefore that, they suffered a 2-1 defeat by Brazil on their homecoming return but recorded a 3-0 win over Australia three days later.\n\nThe matches gave Wiegman an opportunity to test new players and formations - handing a debut to 30-year-old goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse in the process.\n\nAmong those to receive their first senior call-ups to the squad were defenders Anouk Denton, Taylor Hinds and forward Freya Godfrey.\n\nThere was also time for England stars Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren James to recover from lengthy injuries.\n\nChelsea defender Millie Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, announced her retirement in October having withdrawn from the Euros.\n\nThere was a serious blow for Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang - one of England's key players in Switzerland - as she was carried off on a stretcher after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during the win over Australia.\n\nBut it's been a successful time for the other Lionesses in Arsenal's squad, including captain Williamson, who lifted the Champions Cup in February.\n\nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was named the world's best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards in September, as Wiegman picked up the best coach award.\n\nHampton also wrapped up the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award in November after being caught up in the fallout of Mary Earps' autobiography, which was released earlier that month.\n\nMost of Wiegman's key players have returned from injury in recent weeks - but there will still be some noteable absentees.\n\nManchester United midfielder Ella Toone is out with a hip issue until the end of March so will not feature against Ukraine or Iceland.\n\nThere are not many midfield options available with Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns also absent, while team-mate Lucia Kendall came off the bench to play 28 minutes of Villa's 7-3 thrashing by Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance in five weeks due to a thigh injury.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal winger Beth Mead fractured her shin so is out but Chloe Kelly made her return at the end of January and is available for selection.\n\nArsenal defender Hinds has had an ankle injury that has kept her out for a few weeks but she could still be included.\n\nChelsea full-back Niamh Charles is also sidelined with an ankle injury but team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones came on as an 83rd-minute substitute in their win over Liverpool on Sunday so her return is timely.\n\nTottenham full-back Ella Morris is close to returning from the ACL injury she suffered last year but will not be back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Agyemang and Arsenal defender Katie Reid are still recovering from their respective ACL injuries.\n\nThere remains a lack of full-back options for Wiegman with Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier seen as back-up for Bronze despite playing her club football at centre-back every week.\n\nCharles' absence and Hinds' recent injury means there are limited options at left-back too - meaning Manchester City's Alex Greenwood could once again make the switch from centre-back to full-back.\n\nThere could be a recall for Bay FC's Anouk Denton, who moved to the American club from West Ham in February, two months after making her England debut.\n\nLondon City Lionesses forward Godfrey has impressed this season and Wiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to see her grab an assist in a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.\n\nThe 20-year-old was called up for the first time in November but remains uncapped - so she will hope to feature this time around.\n\nTeam-mate Izzy Goodwin could be a surprise call-up in Beth Mead's absence, though Chelsea's James is back so Wiegman has other attacking options.\n\nWiegman will need to manage players like Kelly, Bronze and Keira Walsh who have not been fully fit in recent weeks and they may not be able to start both games.\n\nBut she will have been boosted by James' impressive display for Chelsea on Sunday, while Jess Park has shone for United and Lauren Hemp for Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "Coco Gauff says it is \"tough to wake up\" and see what is happening back home in the United States and she will continue to speak out about issues that matter to her.\n\nThe two-time Grand Slam singles champion is among a host of American athletes who have voiced their displeasure with US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nProtests have taken place across the United States since Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed in Minneapolis last month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\n\nGauff, 21, spends most of the year competing overseas and the world number five learned of their deaths while in Australia for the first Grand Slam of the year.\n\n\"I don't think people should be dying in the streets just for existing,\" Gauff told reporters in Dubai, where she is set to compete this week.\n\n\"It is tough to wake up and see something because I do care a lot about our country. I think people think I don't for some reason, but I do. I'm very proud to be American.\n\n\"You don't have to represent the entire values of what's going on in the leadership. I think there's a lot of people around that believe in the things I believe in, believe in diversity and equality.\"\n\nWhen asked about issues in the US during the Australian Open, Gauff called for \"more peace and kindness\" in America.\n\nCompatriot Madison Keys championed immigrants and the diversity they have brought to the US, saying she hopes the country \"can come together\".\n\nTeam GB skier Gus Kenworthy, who grew up in America, said he has received death threats after posting an anti-ICE message on social media.\n\nSpeaking at the Winter Olympics, freestyle skier Hunter Hess added that \"just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US\", and President Trump responded by calling him a \"real loser\".\n\nBea Kim said the US is \"very divided\" but \"diversity is what makes us a very strong country\", while fellow snowboarder Maddie Mastro said she is \"saddened with what's happening at home. I feel like we can't turn a blind eye to that.\"\n\nChloe Kim, a silver medalist in Milan-Cortina, feels that athletes should be \"allowed to voice our opinions on what's going on. And I think that we need to lead with love and compassion.\"\n\nGauff says she feels confident giving honest answers when asked about politics, partly because of her maternal grandmother.\n\nYvonne Lee Odom helped desegregate public schools in the 1960s, becoming the first black student to attend public school in Delray Beach, Florida.\n\n\"My grandma is literally an activist,\" Gauff added. \"This is literally my life.

    "fullText": "Freestyle skier Kirsty Muir once again came heartbreakingly close to a Winter Olympic medal for Team GB with her second fourth-place finish of the Games.\n\nCompeting in the big air, Muir scored a combined 174.75 points from her best two runs, 3.5 points shy of Italian bronze medallist Flora Tabanelli.\n\nIt comes exactly a week after the 21-year-old missed out on slopestyle bronze by just 0.41 points.\n\nCanada's Megan Oldham won gold with China's defending champion Eileen Gu - competing in a big air competition for the first time since winning the Olympic title four years ago - settling for silver this time.\n\n\"I'm really proud of myself for putting the two tricks down that I did, and also going for it in that third run because I've never landed that trick before,\" Muir, competing at her second Games, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I just had to go for it, and yes I crashed out, but I'm still proud of myself.\"\n\nThe final had been delayed by more than an hour after a heavy blizzard set in at Livigno Snow Park, while Mathilde Gremaud, a big favourite for a medal, was one of two Swiss skiers to withdraw last-minute through injury.\n\nThat looked to have opened up the field for Muir, who had qualified in fourth for the final.\n\nBut in an astonishing first round, four skiers posted scores of 90.00 points or more, with Muir languishing in seventh and knowing she needed to go big.\n\nShe did just that, posting 93.00 with a 1620 trick, featuring four and a half rotations, the highest score of the second run and one that catapulted her up the standings into silver medal position.\n\nAt that point Gu, already a silver medallist in the slopestyle at these Games, was way off the pace having struggled with her second attempt, but she made amends on her final jump to bump Muir down into third.\n\nThe Chinese star - the fourth-highest paid female athlete in the world - celebrated like her medal was confirmed at that point, despite plenty of skiers waiting in the wings to nudge her off the podium.\n\nAs it proved, they couldn't do that, though Tabanelli's final jump of 94.25 points - the biggest score of the night - came just 0.75 points shy of silver medal position.\n\nThat piled the pressure on Muir's third and final jump.\n\nShe took her time at the top of the big air structure, talking through her options with her coach and decided to go for another 1620 trick with a different grab, but ultimately could not land her effort, leaving her lost in her thoughts of what might have been as she sat on the snow.\n\n\"When the scores came in for the other girls, I knew I had to give it something really, really good to try and get on that podium, so I'm stoked that I did try that,\" she said.\n\nGB men's curlers' semi-final hopes on line after shock defeat\n\nGB slalom legend Ryding bids farewell to Olympics\n\nIt marks an agonising fifth fourth-place finish for Team GB at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, with time running out to hit the minimum target of four medals set before the Games by UK Sport.\n\nIn addition to Muir's two near-misses, snowboarder Mia Brookes finished fourth in the big air, while the same position was reached by Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds in the mixed doubles curling, and Marcus Wyatt and Freya Tarbit in the mixed team skeleton.\n\nBrookes had been expected to contest for the medals in Tuesday's slopestyle final but failed to qualify, while both GB's men's and women's rinks face uphill battles to reach the semi-finals in their respective curling finals.\n\nHigh hopes remain with freestyle skier Zoe Atkin, who is the current halfpipe world champion. She starts her campaign with qualifying on Thursday, with the final set to take place on Saturday.\n\nShould GB reach the target of five, the team would equal its record haul from a Winter Olympics, achieved at both the 2014 and 2018 Games.\n\nBut even if it doesn't, these Olympics should still be seen as a success for the nation.\n\nSo far, three gold medals have been won, a historic achievement given Team GB had never before won more than one at a single Games.\n\nThat total includes a first Olympic gold on snow, from Huw Nightingale and Charlotte Bankes in the mixed team snowboard cross, in addition to double gold from Matt Weston in the skeleton, the second of those coming in the mixed team event with Tabby Stoecker.\n\nWhy first gold on snow has been just a matter of time\n\nWhy are Team GB so good at skeleton?\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "A storm system moving across Southern California brought rain to the desert and snow to the nearby mountains Monday, Feb. 16, with more precipitation expected over the next couple days.\n\nCloudy skies and steady rain arrived around midday in western parts of the Coachella Valley, with cooler temperatures than in recent days.\n\n“We’re kind of seeing the brunt of (the storms) move through at the moment,” Chandler Price, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s San Diego office, said Monday afternoon.\n\n“After that, we’re going to get showers through tomorrow (Tuesday) morning, then lightening up mid-to-late morning, then probably like 10 hours of sort of clear skies before the next (system) comes roaring in late Tuesday into early Wednesday,” he added.\n\nAs of about 3 p.m. Monday, the Palm Springs International Airport had recorded 0.10 inches of rainfall, while in the mid-valley, Thousand Palms had seen 0.12 inches.\n\nTo the east, Indian Palms Country Club in Indio had recorded just a trace of rain — 0.02 inches — as of Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Riverside area had seen a wider range of rainfall totals as of 3 p.m.\n\nThe northern side of Riverside had recorded about 0.15 inches of rainfall, while Jurupa Valley, located just west of Riverside, had seen 0.57 inches so far.\n\n“It’s a pretty big range there (in Riverside),” Price said.\n\nIn the nearby San Jacinto and San Gorgonio mountains, a winter storm warning is in effect until noon Wednesday, with the areas potentially seeing up to 3 feet of snow at higher elevation levels.\n\n“Travel could be very difficult to impossible,” the weather service said in its winter weather advisory. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday evening and Tuesday morning commutes. Very strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.”\n\nPrice said snow was starting to cover the roads in the Idyllwild-Pine Cove area above 6,000 feet as of Monday afternoon, but he added the weather service did not yet have exact precipitation totals.\n\nThe Big Bear area was also seeing snowfall Monday afternoon, though exact totals were not yet available. At a slightly lower elevation than Big Bear, Lake Arrowhead had recorded 2 inches of rain as of 3 p.m.\n\nPrice said Palm Springs could see another tenth of an inch of rain through Tuesday morning, with less precipitation expected in the central and southern parts of the valley.\n\nRiverside and the rest of the Inland Empire will likely see higher precipitation levels, potentially up to an inch through early Wednesday.\n\n“It’s really going to start dying down after 6 a.m. Wednesday, and then by noon, we’re looking at completely dry (conditions),” Price said.\n\nOvernight lows will stay in the 40s throughout most of Riverside County this week.\n\nAnother system could hit the region Thursday, potentially bringing more rain to the Inland Empire, though Price said it will likely be weaker than the storms earlier in the week.\n\nCity News Service contributed to this report.\n\nTom Coulter is a reporter for The Desert Sun.

    "description": "\"This amendment creates a narrow, commonsense check to ensure the pardon power is used fairly and responsibly regardless of who occupies the White House\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn before departing the White House, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, in Washington. \n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-NE) signed on Monday to co-sponsor a Democrat-led bill to amend the U.S. Constitution to give Congress oversight of presidential pardons, a measure aimed at pushing back at President Donald Trump’s highly controversial use of the presidential pardon power.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Rep. Johnny Olszewski (D-MD) last December and would allow for a minimum of 20 House members and five senators to call for congressional review of a pardon, which would lead to a 60-day deadline for Congress to nullify that pardon with a two-thirds majority vote – similar to a veto override.\n\nOlszewski announced his bill, the Pardon Integrity Act, in a floor speech listing off some of Trump’s most controversial pardons, including a blanket pardon for all January 6th rioters – including those who violently attacked police officers.\n\n“None of us should accept it as normal practice that a president, any president, used their executive pardon power to absolve convicted drug kingpins, those found guilty of violently attacking law enforcement officers, and even a money laundering crypto magnate with ties to the president’s family business,” Olszewski said in his speech, adding:\n\nYet, this is exactly what President Trump did. On his first day back in office, President Trump pardoned 1,500 people involved in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Since then, he’s pardoned or commuted the sentences of nearly 90 others. Just recently, he added former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to that list. Hernandez was serving a 45-year prison sentence for conspiring to smuggle more than 400 tons or 4.5 billion doses of cocaine into the US. Hernandez was also convicted of accepting bribes from violent drug cartel members to fuel his political career, shielding them from prosecution in exchange for their bribes\n\nOlszewski announced Bacon joining his bill, writing, “The Constitution does not give any president the authority to place themselves above the law. I’m proud to have Congressman Bacon join this effort, because safeguarding democracy and upholding justice should never be a partisan issue. When the pardon power is abused to protect criminals and political allies, Congress has a responsibility to act.”\n\nNo more get out of jail free cards for the wealthy and well-connected. pic.twitter.com/kcwDB3RSjy\n\n— Rep. Johnny Olszewski (@RepJohnnyO) December 19, 2025\n\n“This amendment creates a narrow, commonsense check to ensure the pardon power is used fairly and responsibly regardless of who occupies the White House,” he added.\n\nBacon, a former Air Force general who is not seeking reelection in his swing district, added, “Presidential pardons are an important constitutional authority, but like all powers held by the executive branch, these authorities benefit from the appropriate checks and balances the Constitution envisioned. Across multiple administrations, we’ve seen legitimate questions raised about how this authority has been used at the same time, the ability of Congress to provide oversight has weakened.\n\n“Frankly, it is clear to me the pardon authority has been abused. I’m pleased to cosponsor Rep. Olszewski’s Pardon Integrity Act, a constitutional amendment that establishes a narrow, commonsense guardrail that preserves the pardon power while ensuring Congress can fulfill its constitutional role to provide accountability and uphold the rule of law,” concluded Bacon in a statement. Bacon’s support for the measure followed Trump’s pardon of several NFL players who had been convicted of various crimes, including drug trafficking.\n\nBacon is also behind a bipartisan bill to return the power to levy tariffs solely to Congress, adhering to the original wording of the Constitution.\n\nThe post Republican Joins With Dems on Constitutional Amendment to Give Congress Power to Reject Trump Pardons first appeared on Mediaite.",
