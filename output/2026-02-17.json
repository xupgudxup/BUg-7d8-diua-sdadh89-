    "fullText": "The Georgia Bulldogs are in a free fall, losing five of their last six. That’s not how you want to embark on a trip to Rupp Arena to face the Kentucky Wildcats.\n\nI break down why Collin Chandler will add to their misery in my Georgia vs. Kentucky predictions and college basketball picks for Tuesday, February 17.\n\nGeorgia vs Kentucky best bet: Collin Chandler Over 2.5 threes made (+135)\n\nCollin Chandler is a big reason why the Kentucky Wildcats lead the SEC in three-point accuracy since the start of conference play. He’s shooting 46.4% from downtown through 12 conference games.\n\nAnd over his past four games, he’s stepped up big for the Wildcats. He’s connected on 14 of 25 efforts from beyond the arc, making at least three treys in each of his last three outings.\n\nThe Georgia Bulldogs are allowing SEC opponents to shoot 34.2% from deep, and allow the most offensive rebounds in the league.\n\nLook for Chandler to capitalize on open looks and extended possessions.\n\nGeorgia’s seven defeats in SEC play have each featured its opponents scoring at least 86 points. That’s what happens when you rank 339th nationally in defensive rebound rate and allow teams to shoot 54.5% from inside the arc.\n\nIf you give the Wildcats open looks off second-chance points, they’ll make you pay. Kentucky will hit the team total Over for the fifth straight game.\n\nCollin Chandler Over 2.5 threes made\n\nMalachi Moreno has improved week after week for this Kentucky team, and should have a strong game against this struggling Georgia frontcourt.\n\nHe’s posting a 12.5% offensive rebound rate in SEC play, and is coming off an 11-point, 11-rebound performance against the Gators.\n\nMoreno’s scored in double-figures in three of his last four games, and will flirt with another double-double against the Bulldogs.\n\nCollin Chandler Over 2.5 threes made\n\nMalachi Moreno Over 7.5 rebounds\n\nSpread: Georgia +7 (-110) | Kentucky -7 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Georgia +240 | Kentucky -300\n\nOver/Under: Over 161.5 (-110) | Under 161.5 (-110)\n\nKentucky has hit the Team Total Over in their last 4 games (+4.00 Units / 87% ROI).

    "description": "On Friday, the NFL Players Association fired long-time security officer Craig Jones, whose eloquent email challenging the state of union leadership emerged last year, during the quickly-unfolding turmoil that resulted in the abrupt resignation of NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell.",
    "fullText": "On Friday, the NFL Players Association fired long-time security officer Craig Jones, whose eloquent email challenging the state of union leadership emerged last year, during the quickly-unfolding turmoil that resulted in the abrupt resignation of NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell.\n\nAfter being fired, Jones sent a new email to various current and former NFLPA employees. PFT has obtained a copy of the email, and has verified its authenticity.\n\nBecause Jones speaks directly to players in his email, and because plenty of players visit this space from time to time, we've decided to post the message in full.\n\nBefore posting, we invited the NFLPA to respond to all or any portion of it. The union declined to comment.\n\nHere's the full content of the Craig Jones email:\n\n\"Good day. My name is Craig Hampton Jones, and for 17 1/2 years, I was in the employ of the NFLPA. I served the union and the players we served with professional carriage, dedication, and with an enthusiasm for excellence. Through the years, I earned the respect of my peers and the players we served.\n\n\"On Jan. 18, 2026, I was informed that I was being placed on administrative leave for sending emails. On Feb. 13 2026 while in the throes of a family member being murdered on Jan. 25, while caring for my 94 year old mother who suffers with dementia, I received an email from Kim Murray that I was terminated immediately for sending emails deemed antagonistic.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Lloyd Howell's debacle and resignation, I sent an all staff email asking how we as a union move forward, cleansed of the miasma of Lloyd Howell's strip club schemes to undermine the NFLPA if chief architects of those schemes were still employed at the NFLPA.\n\n\"Another email that was deemed antagonistic was asking Jalen Maybin how you chose a new Executive Director with the same obvious flawed format that chose Lloyd Howell. My query was deemed antagonistic. But on Feb. 3, 2026, at the NFLPA press conference, 42 minutes in, Mike Jones of [The Athletic] asked Mr. Maybin, the exact same question I asked Mr. Maybin. At the same press conference, 54 minutes in Johnathan Jones of CBS Sports asked Mr. Maybin as well about the integrity of a selection process that is done 'oscuro.' My termination is nothing more than retaliation because I spoke simple truths to corrupt jaundice power. I couldn't stand silently by and watch the undermining of a storied union dedicated to the players whose trust we had earned with employees of commitment and a consistent well spring of results for our players.\n\n\"Charlatans bought in by Lloyd Howell in his attempt to pimp like Anamika Gupta and Matt Curtin, still lurk the halls of the NFLPA. And to make matters worse, the eunuch-esque leadership of David White and Jaylen Maybin and the jaded leadership of the HR department, morale is low in absence of prodigious leadership akin to Gene Upshaw and DeMaurice Smith.\n\n\"But players of today and storied players of yesteryear . . . don't despair or lose faith in the NFLPA.\n\n\"Even though the loyal workforce was eviserated [sic] unjustly by the Lloyd Howell banana republic and his leftover operatives still attempt to contaminate, please know players that there is still a small collective of honest, hardworking ethical staff who on most nights take their work on your behalf home with them because their regard for the players they behold as sacred.\n\n\"And despite the stench that still permeates in the ranks of some executive leadership, the rank and file of the employees who champion player concerns have faith that one day soon, players will again step up to preserve their gains and perform an exorcism within NFLPA executive leadership. The players once again becoming truly their brothers keeper will restore the union back to its illustrious mission. Always know players... with men of courage and altruism at the helm of leadership, the employees will ensure that you will never walk alone.\n\n\"To my former co-workers whom I hold so dear...you know who you are. I genuflect in your honor on how you continue unselfishly you to serve players with unwavering verve and professional aplomb as executive ineptitude swirls still around you. Don't despair. Muhammad Ali once told me, 'the deeper the pressure, the greater the poise.' You will always be cherished.\n\n\"I love you. Please remember what I always told you that I will always protect you so you can get home to your loved one's first, then I can go home to my love ones. Don't worry about me. No go fund me. I will for free any day protect what is right for free. As a prostate cancer survivor, I have no fear of the folly of fragile egotistical men. Tim Christine. I will always be indebted to the quasar light of your leadership. Finally to Don Davis and Zamir Cobb. I wish you well. You could have stood up for me.\n\nThe email strongly suggests that Jones will be exploring his options for a possible legal challenge to the termination. The union currently is defending a lawsuit filed by former in-house counsel Heather McPhee.\n\nAgain, the NFLPA has declined to comment on the termination of Jones, or as to the contents of his email.",

    "fullText": "Japanese figure skater Kaori Sakamoto launches her quest for a fairytale Olympic swansong on Tuesday as heavy snow in the Italian Alps disrupted the schedule at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nThe three-time Olympic medallist and triple world champion, who will hang up her skates after the competition this week, has never topped the podium at a Winter Games.\n\nBut she goes into the women's singles as the form skater after winning both of her segments in the team event as Japan took silver behind the United States.\n\nThe 25-year-old faces a fierce challenge from America's Alysa Liu, the 2025 world champion and Grand Prix Final winner, in a competition that could boil down to a battle between the United States and Japan.\n\nSakamoto's teammates Mone Chiba and Ami Nakai are also likely to be a threat, along with America's Amber Glenn and Russian athlete Adeliia Petrosian, competing as neutral.\n\nThe short programme takes place at the Milano Ice Skating Arena on Tuesday, with the free skate to follow on Thursday.\n\n\"This is really the last time,\" said Sakamoto, who won singles bronze at the 2022 Beijing Games and has two silvers in the team event. \"So I want to enjoy it fully, but also make sure to do what needs to be done.\"\n\nAffectionately called \"big sister\" by her teammates, she is leading a new generation of Japanese stars including Nakai, 17, and Chiba, 20.\n\n\"Japanese skating is strong right now,\" said Sakamoto. \"I'm really a little bit scared about the younger skaters. They are so good.\"\n\nShe will be desperate to avoid the disaster that befell hot men's favourite Ilia Malinin, who suffered a nightmare last week, slumping to an eighth-place finish.\n\nNorway's Jens Oftebro won his second nordic combined gold medal of the Olympics when he added the big hill to the normal hill combined title.\n\nThe 25-year-old could make it a treble when he and his compatriots defend their crown from the 2022 Beijing Games in the team combined on Thursday.\n\nOftebro -- whose older brother Einar was sixth in Tuesday's event -- was 22 seconds off leader Ryota Yamamoto after the ski jump.\n\nHowever, he was unstoppable in the 10 kilometres cross country ski, beating Austria's Johannes Lamparter, who also took silver in the normal hill, with Ilkka Herola of Finland filling third spot.\n\nAt the speedskating track, the Canadian trio of Ivanie Blondin, Valerie Maltais and Isabelle Weidemann won team pursuit gold ahead of the Netherlands, with Japan taking bronze.\n\nAn Italian team comprising Davide Ghiotto, Andrea Giovannini and Michele Malfatti held off world champions the USA for victory in the men's event, China rounding out the podium.\n\nIt was Italy's third speedskating gold after Francesca Lollobrigida's double in the women's 3,000 and 5,000m.\n\nAt the biathlon in Anterselva, the French quartet of Fabien Claude, Emilien Jacquelin, Quentin Fillon Maillet and Eric Perrot won the men's relay.\n\nIt was a 16th Olympic medal for France, surpassing their previous best.\n\nHeavy snow in Livigno on Tuesday morning forced a number of postponements, including the women's snowboard slopestyle final and the men's and women's aerials qualifiers in freestyle skiing.\n\nThe men's big air competition is due to take place at at 1830 GMT, with Norway's defending champion Birk Ruud bidding for his second gold of the games.\n\nAway from the slopes, ski star Lindsey Vonn said \"being back on home soil feels amazing\" after returning to the United States having undergone four operations on the broken leg she suffered in a horrific crash in the women's downhill.\n\nThe 41-year-old had been in hospital in Italy since her heavy fall in the women's downhill on February 8.",

    "fullText": "Six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will compete under their nations' flags at the upcoming Winter Paralympics.\n\nIn September, the International Paralympic Committee lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.\n\nBoth countries were suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus a close ally of Russia. A partial ban - allowing athletes to compete as neutrals - was introduced in 2023.\n\nHowever, the four individual governing bodies in charge of the six sports contested at the Paralympics decided to keep their bans in place.\n\nIn December, Russia and Belarus won an appeal against FIS - the governing body for skiing and snowboarding - at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), permitting them to compete and accumulate ranking points.\n\nThe IPC confirmed to BBC Sport that the 10 athletes have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete in Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\n\"The IPC can confirm that NPC Russia has been awarded a total of six slots: two in Para alpine skiing (one male, one female), two in Para cross-country skiing (one male, one female), and two in Para snowboard (both male),\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"NPC Belarus has been awarded four slots in total, all in cross-country skiing (one male and three female).\"\n\nBipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\", among other factors.\n\nIt will mark the first time a Russian flag has been flown at a Paralympic Games since the Sochi 2014 Games, firstly due to the country's state-sponsored doping programme, before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian news agency TASS reports that among the athletes set to compete are Aleksey Bugaev, a three-time Paralympic champion in Alpine skiing, and cross-country skiers Ivan Golubkov and Anastasiia Bagiian - both are World Championship medallists.\n\nAll three returned to competition in January, and both Bugaev and Bagiian have since won World Cup titles.\n\nThe Milan-Cortina Winter Paralympics will take place from 6-15 March.",

    "fullText": "Proposed Mets blockbuster trade sees New York land $100 million two-time All-Star, Platinum Glove to replace Pete Alonso originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile the New York Mets have taken strides in rebuilding their team after losing key superstars, they still haven’t addressed a couple issues. One of those issues is that while they’ve replaced the offense of Pete Alonso, they haven’t replaced his power.\n\nLuckily, a star New York’s been linked to in the past could fit the bill. Fansided’s Mark Powell and Wynston Wilcox believe the Mets should make a deal with the Minnesota Twins for their two-time All-Star Byron Buxton. Buxton is a destroyer of baseballs, and anchors the final spot in their outfield with a Platinum Glove.\n\nMORE: Proposed Yankees blockbuster trade sees New York land $100 million two-time All-Star to anchor outfield with Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger\n\n“What do the Minnesota Twins actually gain from keeping Byron Buxton at this point? That's the biggest reason the Twins would trade him…Much like the Phillies, adding as much firepower into the batting order is necessary. The Mets had a disappointing 2025 season, fell short of the MLB postseason and now have to figure out how to contend in 2026. The Mets added Juan Soto last offseason as their big addition and now they need to replace Pete Alonso's bat. Buxton seems like the perfect option,” Powell and Wilcox wrote.\n\nThis past season, Buxton slashed .264/.327/.551/.878 with 21 doubles, 35 home runs, and 83 RBI in 126 games played. He’s a perfect replacement for Alonso’s power, and his defense is a major upgrade.\n\nMORE: Red Sox predicted to part ways with $90 million .282 AVG star outfielder through trade, make more room for Jarren Duran and Co.\n\nBuxton’s also only set to make around $45 million over the final three years of his contract, and for the big-spending Mets, that could be very attractive.\n\nHopefully, the Mets start negotiations as soon as they can; otherwise, another contender could swoop in and trade for him right under their noses.\n\nProposed blockbuster Pirates trade sees Pittsburgh finish off explosive offseason by landing $330 million two-time MVP, eight-time All-Star to replace Spencer Horwitz\n\nReds predicted to be dark horse blockbuster trade candidate for $330 million two-time MVP, eight-time All-Star after whiffing on Kyle Schwarber\n\nProposed blockbuster Phillies trade sees Philadelphia land $100 million two-time All-Star, Platinum Glove to replace Nick Castellanos",

Her growth into one of the premier defenders in this league speaks to what she puts in every single day, and we’re proud that our environment and support system have been part of that journey.

    "fullText": "Walsall head coach Mat Sadler said \"it's not my job to worry about that\" following a statement from the club's board last week in the midst of their stuttering promotion challenge.\n\nThe Saddlers have seen a four-point lead at the top of League Two in December whittle away into a 14-point deficit behind current leaders Bromley, slipping from first place to ninth in the process.\n\nTheir run of one win in eight league games since 26 December has seen them drop one point outside the play-off places and led to the board to announce last Friday they were \"aware of the urgency to improve results\".\n\nIn the build up to Wednesday's game at Grimsby, Sadler was asked about his take on what the board said.\n\n\"It's not my job to worry about that,\" he told BBC Radio WM.\n\n\"It's my job to make sure the players see me, win, lose or draw as exactly the same person.\n\n\"My role is doing exactly what we've done for the last three and a half years through scrutiny, through every single part of that.\"\n\n\"The belief I have in the players and their willingness to work all comes though me.

I'm certainly not looking back. I never will be because this is a completely different group and team,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not a completely different environment - we get constant reminders about that - our job is to focus on us and not on what anyone else is saying - good and bad.\n\n\"I live in a positive world. I recognise where we are, and where we want to get to, and we do that doing it our way.\n\n\"Everyone's human and different things happen. Sometimes that edge of uncertainty can affect people.

    "description": "Following his best game of the season, Dailyn Swain is adding to his trophy case. The transfer from Xavier was named the SEC Co-Player of the Week.",
    "fullText": "During his first season as a Texas Longhorn, Dailyn Swain has arguably been the team's most important player. Since the season opener, he has been a scoring machine for Sean Miller as Texas has inched closer to a March Madness berth. On Monday, the talented junior added to his trophy case when he was named the SEC Men's Basketball Co-Player of the Week.\n\nIn the Longhorns' latest win over Missouri on Saturday, Swain recorded a game-high 25 points and two steals in 37 minutes of action. He also added six rebounds and two assists to his resume. Regardless of where he was on the court, Swain was dangerous with the ball in his hands, going 3-6 from three-point range.\n\nTexas star Dailyn Swain has been named the SEC Co-Player of the Week, the conference announced. \n\nShares the honor with Florida guard Xaivian Lee.\n\nSwain posted 25 points, 6 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in Saturday's win vs. Missouri.#HookEm pic.twitter.com/tO7puhEhKU\n\n— Zach Dimmitt (@ZachDimmitt7) February 16, 2026\n\nFor Swain, Monday's honor was the latest in an unforgettable 2025-2026 campaign. Earlier this month, the Columbus native was named to the Midseason Watch List for the Julius Erving Small Forward of the Year Award. He currently leads the Longhorns in points per game with 17.6, rebounds per game with 7.3, and assists with 85.\n\nWith four games left in the regular season, Swain has playing his best basketball of the season at the perfect time. He has scored at least 18 points in six of his last seven games. That included a 26-point effort against Georgia who is ranked as the 21st best team in the country. For a team with national championship aspirations, that was a major win.\n\nDailyn Swain ices the game for Texas. \n\nThe Longhorns have won four straight and are 7-5 in the SEC. Big road win for Texas' NCAA Tournament chances.pic.twitter.com/cc8YIU4eLt\n\n— Zach Dimmitt (@ZachDimmitt7) February 15, 2026\n\nAdditionally, Swain has taken his game to another level in conference play. Against SEC teams, the Africentric Early College alum is averaging 20.4 points and 7.8 rebounds per game. That has helped the Longhorns hold their own against some of the best teams in the country.\n\nAs long as Swain continues his recent play, more accolades could be heading his way. His play against Missouri was just one of many examples of why he has become a fan favorite in the Forty Acres.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Longhorns Wire: Dailyn Swain wins SEC honors after Longhorns basketball streak",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — First came the expletives. Then the allegations. Then the media glare and hilarious memes.\n\nGlobal interest in curling surged over the past week when a cheating controversy erupted at the Winter Olympics, rocking a staid, 500-year-old sport known for its etiquette, manners and friendliness.\n\nAfter a wild few days for curling featuring plenty of verbal jousting and a brief rule change, things have calmed down and both players and officials appear ready to move on with the medal games approaching.\n\n“It’s the Olympics,” said Canadian curler Ben Hebert, whose team has been a central character in the controversy. “It’ll be over in two weeks and everyone will go back to covering curling in four years.”\n\nYet the headline-grabbing saga has highlighted some issues in a sport eager for exposure – and one slowly becoming more professional — but maybe isn’t ready for all the trappings that come with it.\n\nSweden crying foul over a rule infringement, an illegal double-touch by Canada’s Marc Kennedy in the act of releasing his stone down the ice, called into question whether the so-called “spirit of curling” had been broken.\n\nCurling, after all, has long been a tight-knit sport where players typically call their own fouls, shake hands at the end of a match and share a beer or two afterwards.\n\nThe Swedish and Canadian players have been long-time rivals but they’re also friendly. Couldn’t they just have dealt with this behind closed doors without all the bruising?\n\n“That’s where I think the spirit of curling is in a little bit of trouble,” Kennedy said, “and honestly that’s probably come from the quest for medals. But it’s OK. It’s all about the evolution of the sport. There’s opportunity here as well, right? For the sport to really figure it out as we all go forward.”\n\nIt seems the top of the sport isn’t quite ready for that.\n\nThere are no video replays in curling, unlike with sports like soccer, cricket and in the NFL, so officials aren’t allowed to re-umpire decisions like the hog line violation apparently committed by Kennedy when he poked one of the granite stones with his outstretched finger after releasing it.\n\nIn response, curling’s higher-ups first stationed umpires at the hog line to check for future fouls, but then reverted to the traditional practice of players policing themselves.\n\n“We’re trying to spread the word about our culture, and our culture is one based on integrity, and honor, and friendship,” World Curling President Beau Welling told The Associated Press in a phone interview. “We live by this code — the spirit of curling — where you’re expected to have honorable conduct on ice, but also off ice.\n\n“Obviously, this has been tested a little bit this week. But, fundamentally, that’s who we are,” he said. “And I really don’t see that changing.”\n\nSome might see this as sweeping the issue under curling's rug.\n\nYet this is the Olympic Games — it’s serious business, being played out in front of curling’s biggest audience.\n\n“Curling needs to professionalize a little bit,” Canada Curling CEO Nolan Thiessen told the AP at the Cortina Curling Center. “If we want to be where we want to be as a sport, there’s some steps we have to take, and some give and take probably. You know, having officials making subjective calls ... there’s a lot of sports that have that. And we probably need to get there as opposed to, ‘I think you did this’ and ‘Well, I don’t think I did.’\n\n“We’re trying,” he added, “to find the right balance as a sport.”\n\nThe Olympics soon will be without Sweden’s defending champion men’s team, which was officially eliminated from semifinal contention on Tuesday after a sixth loss in seven matches in round-robin play.\n\n“We maybe should have done something different and could have dealt with it differently,” Sweden skip Niklas Edin said of what he described as a “horrible week.”\n\nPlenty of curling traditionalists will no doubt agree with that.\n\nAP Sports Writer Jimmy Golen and Associated Press writer Julia Frankel contributed to this story.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Manchester United will not reduce the asking price for Marcus Rashford if Barcelona want to buy the on-loan forward.\n\nBarcelona have an option to purchase the England international for £26m in the summer and there are suggestions in Spain that they may seek to renegotiate the deal and try and get Rashford for less.\n\nBut United’s view is that, if Barcelona do choose to keep the 28-year-old, they will have to pay the amount agreed.\n\nIt is thought that Rashford, who has two-and-a-half years left on his contract at Old Trafford, is keen to stay with the reigning champions of La Liga.\n\nHe has impressed during his stint at the Nou Camp, getting 10 goals and 11 assists from his 34 appearances.\n\nRashford has not played for United since December 2024 after being exiled from the first team by former head coach Ruben Amorim and then spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.\n\nAmorim’s sacking could have opened the door for him to return to Old Trafford, with his former teammate Michael Carrick now in charge, albeit only until the end of the season.\n\nIn October, Rashford said his preference was to remain at Barcelona after the end of his loan. If they were to buy the Mancunian, who scored 138 goals in 426 games for United, it would remove one of the biggest salaries on the wage bill at Old Trafford, though Barcelona are covering his pay in full this season.\n\nSince Rashford last played for United, they have bought three other forwards at a cost of around £200m, in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",

    "description": "A recent report suggests the Arizona Cardinals may be after the Chicago Bears' backup quarterback. Details here from @wiltfongjr.",
    "fullText": "‘Tis the season of rumors, reports, speculation, leaks, and agent-media quid pro quo, so take this as you will, but earlier today, John Gambadoro, who works for Arizona Sports 98.7 FM out of Phoenix, shared this via his social media account.\n\n“Have heard the Cardinals are intrigued by Bears backup QB Tyson Bagent. He has one-year left on his deal so would have to trade for him. Grew up in Martinsburg, West Virginia and went to Shepherd University. Was an undrafted free-agent who beat out PJ Walker for the backup job with Chicago and was so good the Bears signed him to a 2-year $10M extension.”\n\nI asked around to gauge Gambadoro’s reputation with breaking Arizona Cardinals news, and was told he’s legit and not some engagement farmer.\n\nThe Cardinals seem intent on trading or releasing long-time starting quarterback Kyler Murray, so adding Bagent (signed through 2027) to a quarterback room with veteran Jacoby Brisset (signed through 2026) would give new head coach Mike LaFleur a couple of options.\n\nThe Chicago Bears clearly value Bagent’s place on the roster, but getting a draft pick for a former undrafted free agent they signed and developed is good business. I can’t see the Bears sending him away for just anything, but if the Cardinals make a serious offer, it makes sense for the Bears to listen.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on what a Bagent trade would look like?",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid have only the final pieces of their famous 2014 title victory in tact, but they might be about to lose another one this summer. It appears that veteran defender Jose Maria Gimenez could be on his way out of the club after more than a decade.\n\nGimenez arrived for just under €1m from Danubio in Uruguay in 2013, and made an immediate impact, competing with Miranda for first-team minutes in Atletico Madrid’s 2014 title and Champions League final run. There was talk that Gimenez could have left last summer, but eventually no satisfactory offer arrived.\n\nThe 31-year-old stalwart will bring up 13 years in Madrid this summer, but RadioMarca report that this is his last. Matteo Moretto explains that Atletico have promised Gimenez that he can leave on a free in the summer despite being under contract until 2028. If Gimenez is keen on a particular destination, they will shake hands and he will leave.\n\nAtletico’s motivation to do so is related to his age, performance and salary. Gimenez earns between €6m and €7m net every year, making him one of their higher earners, but is no longer a guaranteed starter. He has also suffered significantly with injuries.\n\nFernando Cruz of DSports Radio, as quoted by Atletico Universe, has explained that Gimenez has been in talks with Boca Juniors President Juan Roman Riquelme over a potential move to Buenos Aires in the summer. Gimenez would leave after the World Cup.\n\nOn the other hand, it had been reported that AC Milan were willing to pay up to €30m for Gimenez, but if he is available on a free, then he will be much more appealing to the Rossoneri. Moretto has also confirmed there is interest from Serie A in him.",

Not a problem. The Italians claimed the gold medal by finishing 4 1/2 seconds faster than the American world record-holders, and that margin was so large that Giovannini pulled his two white-gloved hands together and pressed them to the side of his head at the close, just the way NBA star Curry does.\n\n“The last lap, we were in control,” Giovannini said, “and I was just waiting for that finish line to emulate Steph.”\n\nGiovannini said he remembered watching on TV during the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics when Curry did his signature move after one of his late 3-pointers sealed a 98-87 victory for the U.S. against France to win gold in men's basketball.\n\n“Emblematic of having cold blood,” Giovannini said.\n\nSo a couple of days ago, Giovannini was chatting with his Olympic roommate, speedskating teammate Francesco Betti, and told him he planned to go with the “Night night.”\n\n“It happened,” Giovannini said. “I was worried I would forget.”\n\nOne of the other team pursuit gold medalists, Ghiotto, said later he hadn't seen what Giovannini did — and actually wasn't even sure what the whole thing was about, because he wasn't aware of who Curry is.\n\nHearing that, Giovannini joked: “Tonight we’ll watch a basketball game.”\n\nThe American trio of Casey Dawson, Emery Lehman and Ethan Cepurian — who got the bronze in the event at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and set the world record in November — weren't aware of Giovannini's gesture.\n\n“It’s better,” Lehman said with a big laugh, “than getting two middle fingers from the Russians four years ago.”\n\nAP Sports Writer Daniella Matar contributed to this report.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

Aden Holloway scored 20 points for the Crimson Tide. Labaron Philon and Latrell Wrightsell Jr. both added 19.\n\nThe Crimson Tide have won four straight games after opening the month with a 100-77 loss to the Florida Gators in Gainesville. Nate Oats' team currently sits No. 21 in the NET rankings and No. 18 in the latest KenPom ratings. Recent NCAA Tournament projections have Alabama anywhere from a No. 5-7 seed in March Madness.\n\nArkansas (19-6, 9-3) is coming off an 88-75 win over Auburn last Saturday. Coach John Calipari's Razorbacks have won three straight games and is ranked No. 17 in the USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll.

Alabama has a 17.8 overall rating. The metrics give the Tide an 11.8 rating on offense, which is No. 5 nationally, and a 6.1 rating on defense that rates 42nd.\n\nArkansas is only four spots far behind Alabama in ESPN's BPI. The Razorbacks are 21st nationally with a 17.0 overall rating.

    "fullText": "Destanee Aiava recently announced her retirement from tennis at the age of 25, citing major issues with the sport’s culture.\n\nAiava’s decision comes just three weeks after her first-round exit at the Australian Open. In a post on social media, she described tennis as a ‘toxic boyfriend’ and criticised its culture as ‘racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn’t fit the mould.’\n\nThe former world number 147 also said that her time in tennis had taken a toll on her health and family.\n\nAiava also added: “I learned what type of people gravitate toward a sport that’s designed to keep certain people out – one that will change you without remorse.”\n\nSpeaking with reporters in Dubai, Anisimova acknowledged she’d seen Aiava’s retirement post and was aware of the strong language it contained.\n\n“I would say that’s tough for me to answer. Obviously, the post was disheartening, and it was sad to read,” Anisimova said.\n\n“I personally don’t know her story. I don’t know her that well. I’m not really sure what she was talking about in that aspect. I don’t know if she was talking more about the reactions she received on social media or people in tennis.\n\n“I just don’t know enough in detail to be able to answer that question.\n\n“At the end of the day it is heartbreaking she had that experience. Hopefully, maybe she’ll change her mind and have a restart in tennis. You never know.”\n\nAfter a strong junior career that included an exhibition match with Steffi Graf, Destanee Aiava made her WTA Tour debut at the 2017 Brisbane International.\n\nShe earned her place in that tournament by winning the U18 Girls’ Australian Championships in December 2016. Though she lost to Mona Barthel in the first round, it marked her entry into top-level tennis.\n\nAiava has gone on to win 24 ITF Circuit titles across singles and doubles. In 2025, she partnered with Cristina Bucsa to claim her first WTA Challenger title at the Birmingham Open.\n\nHer best results at major tournaments have come at home. She reached the second round of both singles and doubles at the Australian Open, making appearances in 2024 and again in 2025.\n\nAiava’s final appearance came at the 2026 Australian Open, where she fell short of qualifying for the main draw after losing to Harriet Dart. In women’s doubles, she and Maddison Inglis were defeated by Aldila Sutjiadi and Giuliana Olmos in their opening match.\n\nCoco Gauff reveals who she’s closest to on the WTA Tour\n\nJasmine Paolini explains why Dubai feels ‘Weird’ to play\n\nBen Shelton claps back at fan reacting to viral moment with Trinity Rodman",

    "fullText": "Portland Trail Blazers rookie Yang Hansen recently revealed that he has received a lot of advice from Hall of Famer Yao Ming since arriving in the United States last year.\n\nYang was the 16th pick in the NBA draft after playing two seasons with Qingdao in the CBA, the top professional league in China. He was an All-Star and All-CBA domestic first-team selection in each season, and was the 2024 CBA Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nThere have been very few players from China drafted in the NBA, so Yang understands that what Yao says carries a lot of weight as a basketball pioneer for their country. Yang said that Yao has been a valuable resource for him throughout the season.\n\n\"Actually, he is a great, great (man) to me,\" Yang said of Yao on Friday through translator Chris Liu. \"He shares a lot of experience with me. If I get some confusion, I will text him. I will ask him. He'll always give me some suggestions from his perspective.\"\n\nYang has played sporadically this season with the Trail Blazers, averaging 2.2 points and 1.6 rebounds in 7 1/2 minutes across 34 appearances. He started for the first time on Dec. 7, totaling four points, five rebounds and two assists in 19 minutes.\n\nWith limited minutes available, Yang has spent time in the G League, averaging 16.8 points, 9.5 rebounds, three assists and 1.4 blocks while shooting 51.7% from the field in eight games. He has registered two double-doubles, including a 14-point, 16-rebound effort on Jan. 16.\n\nTrail Blazers interim coach Tiago Splitter has urged patience with Yang throughout the season as the 7-footer adjusts to a new game and playing style in the U.S. Since joining the team, Yang has worked daily to bridge that gap after playing in China.\n\n\"A new season, a new experience every day,\" Yang said. \"I know how much I'm behind everyone here, so I try to just work hard every day and get better every day.\"\n\nYang Hansen showed off his bag in @Castrol Rising Stars ✨ pic.twitter.com/B6dXpRINRR\n\n— #NBAAllStar (@NBAAllStar) February 17, 2026\n\nYang was among seven players from the G League chosen to participate in the Rising Stars Game on Friday at NBA All-Star Weekend in Inglewood, California. He recorded 10 points and two rebounds for Team Austin in a loss against Team Melo.\n\nThe 20-year-old was grateful to suit up in the annual showcase event and compete against some of the top players in the league. He wants to continue improving and share his experience with the next wave of players, much like Yao did in the 2000s.\n\n\"I'm learning the best basketball in the world right now in the NBA,\" Yang said. \"I want to try to learn as much as I can and carry it back to China or Asia. There are a lot of talented kids in Asia (and) a lot of different countries. I think they will try to chase their dream and to reach the NBA. We'll see more and more Asian players on the NBA court.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rookie Wire: Trail Blazers news: Yang Hansen talks about mentorship of Yao Ming",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees didn't have the most active offseason by any means, but they still are heading into 2026 with a solid roster in both the lineup and the pitching staff.\n\nTwo of their biggest roster moves were Trent Grisham accepting his $22.025 million qualifying offer and Cody Bellinger re-signing on a long-term deal.\n\nBut those two moves have left Jasson Dominguez with an uncertain future. As MLB.com's Bryan Hoch notes, the Yankees' plan with Dominguez is unclear amid the crowded outfield in New York.\n\n\"Dominguez's playing time dropped significantly in the second half last season, and with Cody Bellinger and Trent Grisham returning to join Aaron Judge in the outfield, it's unclear how the Yankees intend to find at-bats for Dominguez,\" Hoch writes.\n\nThis unclear situation for Dominguez is a problem, though it's not necessarily a bad one to have. Their outfield is one of the best in all of MLB, leaving them with few options with Dominguez.\n\nJudge, Bellinger, and Grisham are everyday starters, while their designated hitter spot is also occupied. Keeping Dominguez on the MLB roster doesn't really make much sense.\n\nMore: Former Yankees, Reds, A's outfielder agrees to $4M deal with Padres\n\nWhile the Yankees aren't going to give up on Dominguez, they might be forced to make a difficult decision this year.\n\nSending their top outfield prospect back to the minor leagues to begin the season, so he can get at-bats and develop a bit, might be the best option for the Yankees this season.\n\nThey can always call him up if there's an injury, or if he's playing great while one of the MLB starters is struggling.

But Jones is running out of time to be that guy.\n\n\"Jones finished fourth in NL Rookie of the Year Award voting in 2023 with the Rockies, but has dealt with injuries and offensive struggles the past two seasons,\" MLB.com's Tim Stebbins wrote on Tuesday in a new article. \"The Guardians reacquired their one-time top prospect last March, and he slashed .211/.296/.304 with five homers over 136 games in 2025. Cleveland believes in Jones' potential; it avoided arbitration with him in November (one-year, $2 million deal).

He's a big, strong, left-handed hitter who can show off a strong arm from right field.\n\nHe has lacked the consistency needed to succeed at the major league level, though, and Cleveland can't give him forever.\n\nThe Guardians simply haven't solved their outfield in recent years, particularly right field. Jones was one guy given plenty of runway to be the solution without making it happen.\n\nHe may still have more chances to come. After all, Cleveland can't give up on him, apparently.

    "fullText": "Warriors' recently acquired $60 million star named among NBA's most overrated players originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors may not have paired Stephen Curry with the star he envisioned playing alongside (Giannis Antetokounmpo), but a star is a star at this point.\n\nThe Warriors needed to add another high-caliber contributor to the roster after Jimmy Butler’s ACL injury, and they did just that before the Feb. 5 trade deadline. However, Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz believes the Dubs recently acquired 7-foot-2 star is among the most overrated players in the NBA right now.\n\n“Kristaps Porziņgis has the highest swing rating of any player on this list and is still a productive player when he's on the floor,” Swartz wrote Monday. “Therein lies the problem for the 30-year-old.”\n\n“Porziņgis continues to be plagued by injuries and is currently sidelined with left Achilles tendinitis. He's played just 17 total games for the Atlanta Hawks all season and just five since November. Porzingis was averaging just 45.4 healthy games over the last eight years coming into this season. Injuries have unfortunately robbed him of a potential Hall of Fame career.”\n\n“That didn't stop the Golden State Warriors from making Porziņgis their big trade deadline acquisition, however.”\n\nAccording to Swartz, Porzingis is the 4th most overrated player in the league right now. While Porzingis is unreliable at this stage of his career, he isn’t overrated. The former New York Knicks star is simply injury-prone, making it challenging for him to find a rhythm on the hardwood.\n\nIf Porzingis were regularly active and underperforming on both ends, Swartz would have a legitimate case for including the former lottery pick in the overrated category.\n\nHopefully, for the Warriors’ sake, Porzingis doesn’t experience any devastating injuries moving forward.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors sign 6-foot-5 former Lakers guard to assist Stephen Curry",

    "description": "AI protocols, such as MCP and Agent Skills, are agent-first, which risks bypassing the governance, security, and access controls that enterprises have spent years building around their APIs and data.",
    "fullText": "“The API landscape is a mess, and very few people understand it,” Kin Lane, API industry veteran and founder of Naftiko, tells The New Stack.\n\nSome days it feels like we are living in an XKCD cartoon.\n\nOrganizations don’t typically migrate legacy systems from one spec to another as new ideas emerge. Instead, they accumulate layers of integration standards over time, with each era leaving behind systems that are too costly or risky to excavate. “I get a call from a 20-year veteran at a large enterprise, who says, ‘We still have EDI and WSDLs, a lot of Swagger and OpenAPI. We’re trying to do more Async API. MCP is popping up, and we’re looking at Agent Skills, but we have a global business to run, and it’s got to be stable.’”\n\nIt was seeing this recurring pattern of API sediment that prompted Lane to found Naftiko.\n\nThe evolution and splintering of API specifications\n\n“Organizations… accumulate layers of integration standards over time, with each era leaving behind systems that are too costly or risky to excavate.”\n\nLane argues that competing standards are a consequence of vendor ‘land grabs’, where competing vendors exploit specs to exert influence. I don’t disagree with his hypothesis, but I would add that the different standards also reflect when they were developed.\n\nWeb Services Description Language (WSDL) emerged from the Enterprise SOA movement of the 2000s as a formal contract language for web services. Governed by W3C but heavily influenced by IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle, it was technically open but reflected corporate middleware needs, with verbose XML schemas defining operations, messages, and bindings.\n\nIn the 2010s, REST APIs displaced SOAP, and lighter-weight specifications emerged:\n\nAs asynchronous architecture patterns such as event-driven architectures, message queues, WebSockets, and streaming gained popularity in the late 2010s, OpenAPI’s request-response model no longer fit. Regarded as a sister spec to OpenAPI, AsyncAPI (also under Linux Foundation) borrowed OpenAPI’s structure, adapting it for pub/sub, streaming, and asynchronous messaging patterns.\n\nAs we entered the 2010s, Smithy (AWS) and TypeSpec (Microsoft) marked a shift toward protocol-agnostic API modeling. Rather than describing HTTP endpoints directly, they model services abstractly, then generate OpenAPI, code, or protocol-specific implementations. This reflects cloud providers’ need to maintain type safety while supporting multiple protocols (HTTP, gRPC, proprietary) from single definitions.\n\nSmithy powers AWS’s service definitions. TypeSpec emerged from Microsoft’s experience with Azure APIs and emphasizes TypeScript-based syntax for broader developer accessibility. Both Smithy and TypeSpec are open source, but neither has truly open governance in the OpenAPI/AsyncAPI sense. AWS drives Smithy’s roadmap based on internal AWS needs. TypeSpec recently moved to a Linux Foundation working group, but Microsoft remains the dominant contributor. There’s no open governance — no multi-vendor steering committee, and no requirement for consensus from competing cloud providers.\n\nThis matters because Smithy and TypeSpec reflect their creators’ architectural assumptions: multi-region cloud services, polyglot microservices, auto-generated clients. They’re optimized for the problems that AWS and Azure experience, not necessarily problems faced by enterprises or startups. Without diverse governance, they risk becoming sophisticated tools that solve vendor-specific problems.\n\nThe SDK focus of Smithy and TypeSpec reveals something else: these specs assume developers consume APIs through generated code. They’re not optimized for the autonomous agents that LLM vendors hope will form the next wave of API consumers. As a result, the big LLM model providers are creating and pushing new standards:\n\nWhile OpenAPI and AsyncAPI are strategic resources, MCP and A2A are more tactical. “Both MCP and A2A are very transactional, exciting, and in this moment,” Lane said. “They are also likely to give away all your value and data if you are not careful. You have to be very thoughtful in how you transact in those new realms.”\n\nThe question is how you bridge the gap between the tactical needs of an individual team and the strategic needs of the overall enterprise. “I would see this at Postman all the time. Tractor company John Deere would come to us and say, ‘Our CIO, CTO’s office, and Centre of Excellence, manage SOAP, WSDLs, open API, and AsynchAPI across the org. Now we have teams with Postman Collections that run tests and automation, but they don’t understand the bigger picture. We need Postman to reconcile these two worlds for us.’”\n\nThe API economy saw developers craft APIs, treat them as products, rate-limit them, and understand who was using them and what they were doing with them. “MCP, however, wants to circumvent all of that,” Lane said. “It wants direct access to your data and files, so it’s throwing out that decade of design work in front of our file systems and databases, and instead letting the agents have it without much accounting or governance.”\n\nIn addition to wasting significant potential value, poor data governance poses a significant challenge when deploying LLMs for internal use. Organizations can inadvertently expose sensitive information across departments. That data was likely technically accessible before, but required manually searching through Google Drive or file shares to find it.\n\nWhen LLMs gain access to these information repositories, they can surface and share sensitive data far more readily, effectively democratizing access in ways that may violate intended access controls. This was a point that Nicolleta Curtis emphasized to me in an interview for LeadDev. “Even with the basics, such as OneDrive and SharePoint, we found documents that were overshared or with open permissions,” she told me.\n\nOrganizations typically respond to this challenge in one of two ways: they underestimate either the severity of the data exposure risk or the operational burden that proper mitigation will place on their security teams. Implementing appropriate access controls and data boundaries after the fact requires substantial effort.\n\nIn large enterprises with legacy systems, retroactively tightening permissions often breaks existing workflows and integrations. This creates friction across the organization as teams suddenly lose access to information they’ve historically relied on, leading to productivity impacts and internal resistance to the new controls.\n\nIn the first article in this series, Lane described his experience setting up API governance at Bloomberg, which involved:\n\nUsing this approach of comprehensive API mapping and governance with established standards like OpenAPI provides the best foundation for compliance, security, and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) management. For newer/smaller organizations, Lane suggested skipping the ‘baggage’ and going straight to newer approaches such as Agent Skills or MCP.\n\nWhatever approach you favor, we both agree that you should resist the temptation to take a technology-first approach that ignores business outcomes.",

This form of relief requires demonstrating 10 years of continuous physical presence, good moral character, and that removal would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relative.\n\nG-28 (Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative)\n\nForm G-28 is used by attorneys and accredited representatives to notify USCIS that they are representing an applicant, petitioner, or respondent in an immigration matter. It authorizes USCIS to communicate with the representative about the case.\n\nG-1145 (E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance)\n\nForm G-1145 is a simple, optional form that requests USCIS send an electronic notification (email and/or text message) when your application or petition is accepted at a USCIS lockbox facility. It provides faster confirmation than waiting for a paper receipt notice.\n\nI-129 (Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker)\n\nForm I-129 is used by U.S. employers to petition for a foreign worker to come to the United States temporarily in a nonimmigrant worker classification, including H-1B (specialty occupation), L-1 (intracompany transferee), O-1 (extraordinary ability), TN (NAFTA professionals), and other work visa categories.\n\nI-130A (Supplemental Information for Spouse Beneficiary)\n\nForm I-130A collects additional information about a spouse beneficiary when filing Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) for a husband or wife. It must be filed together with the I-130 and provides details about the spouse that are not captured on the main petition form.\n\nI-290B (Notice of Appeal or Motion)\n\nForm I-290B is used to file an appeal or a motion to reopen or reconsider a USCIS decision. An appeal goes to the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) for review. A motion asks the same USCIS office that made the unfavorable decision to reexamine it.\n\nI-539 (Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status)\n\nForm I-539 is used by nonimmigrants currently in the United States to apply for an extension of their authorized stay or to change to a different nonimmigrant status. Common uses include extending a B-1/B-2 visitor visa stay, changing from student (F-1) to work visa status, or extending dependent status.\n\nI-589 (Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal)\n\nForm I-589 is used to apply for asylum in the United States, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Asylum is a form of protection for individuals who have been persecuted or fear persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\n\nI-693 (Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record)\n\nForm I-693 documents a medical examination and vaccination record for immigration purposes. It must be completed by a USCIS-designated civil surgeon and is required for most applicants seeking adjustment of status to permanent residence (green card) in the United States.\n\nI-751 (Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence)\n\nForm I-751 is used by conditional permanent residents to remove the conditions on their residence and obtain a permanent (10-year) green card. Conditions are placed on the green card when the marriage-based immigration petition was filed within 2 years of the marriage. The I-751 must be filed jointly with the petitioning spouse during the 90-day window before the conditional residence expires.\n\nForm I-912 is used to request a fee waiver for certain USCIS immigration applications and petitions. If approved, USCIS waives the filing fee based on the applicant demonstrating inability to pay. Not all forms are eligible for a fee waiver.\n\nN-565 (Application for Replacement Naturalization/Citizenship Document)\n\nForm N-565 is used to apply for a replacement Certificate of Citizenship or Certificate of Naturalization that has been lost, destroyed, damaged, or contains errors. It can also be used to request a name change on the certificate following a legal name change.\n\nN-600 (Application for Certificate of Citizenship)\n\nForm N-600 is used to obtain a Certificate of Citizenship from USCIS. It is filed by individuals who claim to have acquired or derived U.S. citizenship through birth abroad to a U.S. citizen parent, or through the naturalization of a parent while the individual was a child and a permanent resident.\n\nSF-86 (Questionnaire for National Security Positions)\n\nStandard Form 86 (SF-86) is a questionnaire used for national security background investigations in the United States. It collects detailed personal information to determine eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position. The form is extensive and covers personal history, employment, education, residences, references, foreign contacts, and more.\n\nSF-95 (Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death)\n\nStandard Form 95 (SF-95) is used to file an administrative claim against the United States government for damage, injury, or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act of a federal government employee acting within the scope of their employment. It is required under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) before filing a lawsuit.\n\nSSA-561 (Request for Reconsideration)\n\nForm SSA-561 is used to request reconsideration of a decision made by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Reconsideration is the first level of appeal when you disagree with an initial determination about your Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or Medicare entitlement.\n\nSSA-1696 (Appointment of Representative)\n\nForm SSA-1696 is used to appoint a representative (attorney or non-attorney) to act on your behalf in matters before the Social Security Administration. The representative can communicate with SSA, access your records, attend hearings, and submit evidence on your behalf.\n\n1099-S (Proceeds From Real Estate Transactions)\n\nForm 1099-S reports the gross proceeds from the sale or exchange of real estate. The person responsible for closing the transaction (typically the title company, settlement agent, or real estate attorney) files this form to report the sale proceeds to the IRS and provide a copy to the seller.\n\n4506-T (Request for Transcript of Tax Return)\n\nForm 4506-T requests tax return transcripts, W-2 information, and other tax account records from the IRS. It is most commonly used during the mortgage application process, where lenders require borrowers to sign Form 4506-T so the lender can verify income directly with the IRS.\n\n4797 (Sales of Business Property)\n\nForm 4797 reports the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of business property, including rental real estate, commercial buildings, and depreciable assets. It handles the complex tax treatment of Section 1231 gains and losses, depreciation recapture under Sections 1245 and 1250, and ordinary gains from certain property dispositions.\n\n5695 (Residential Energy Credits)\n\nForm 5695 is used to calculate and claim residential energy credits for qualifying energy-efficient improvements to your home. Part I covers the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (for insulation, windows, doors, heat pumps, and other upgrades). Part II covers the Residential Clean Energy Credit (for solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage).\n\nForm 6252 reports income from the sale of real or personal property under the installment method, where at least one payment is received after the tax year of the sale. This allows sellers to spread the gain recognition over the years they receive payments, rather than recognizing the entire gain in the year of sale.\n\n8396 (Mortgage Interest Credit)\n\nForm 8396 is used to claim the Mortgage Interest Credit, a tax credit for homebuyers who received a qualified Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) from a state or local government housing finance agency. The credit equals a percentage of the mortgage interest paid during the year, directly reducing your tax liability.\n\n8582 (Passive Activity Loss Limitations)\n\nForm 8582 determines how much of your passive activity losses you can deduct in the current year. Passive activities include rental real estate and businesses in which you do not materially participate. Losses from passive activities can generally only offset passive income, with a special $25,000 rental real estate allowance for active participants.\n\nForm 8824 reports like-kind exchanges of business or investment real property under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. A 1031 exchange allows you to defer capital gains tax by reinvesting the proceeds from a property sale into a similar (\"like-kind\") property within strict time limits.\n\n8949 (Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets)\n\nForm 8949 reports the details of each sale or disposition of capital assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds, and other investments. For real estate sellers, this form captures the property address, dates of acquisition and sale, sale price, cost basis, and any adjustments. The totals from Form 8949 flow to Schedule D.\n\nThe Closing Disclosure is a five-page form that provides final details about the mortgage loan you selected, including the loan terms, projected monthly payments, closing costs, and how much cash you need to close. Required by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rules, it replaced the HUD-1 Settlement Statement for most residential transactions.\n\nThe Loan Estimate is a three-page form that provides a standardized summary of key loan terms, estimated monthly payments, and projected closing costs for a mortgage. Required by the CFPB under TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rules, it replaced the Good Faith Estimate (GFE) for most residential mortgage transactions and must be provided within 3 business days of receiving a loan application.\n\nEPA Lead-Based Paint Disclosure (Lessor)\n\nThe EPA Lead-Based Paint Disclosure form for lessors (landlords) is a federally required document for renting residential properties built before 1978. Landlords must disclose any known lead-based paint hazards, provide the EPA pamphlet \"Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home,\" and give tenants 10 days to conduct a lead inspection before signing the lease.\n\nEPA Lead-Based Paint Disclosure (Seller)\n\nThe EPA Lead-Based Paint Disclosure form for sellers is a federally required document for selling residential properties built before 1978. Sellers must disclose any known lead-based paint hazards, provide the EPA pamphlet \"Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home,\" and allow buyers 10 days to conduct a lead inspection before becoming obligated under the contract.\n\nThe HUD-1 Settlement Statement is a standardized form that itemizes all charges imposed on the borrower and seller in a real estate transaction. It details the loan terms, closing costs, escrow deposits, real estate commissions, title fees, and prorated taxes. While largely replaced by the CFPB Closing Disclosure for most transactions after October 2015, the HUD-1 is still used for reverse mortgages, HELOCs, and some manufactured housing transactions.\n\nHUD-92564-CN (For Your Protection: Get a Home Inspection)\n\nHUD Form 92564-CN is a notice given to FHA borrowers explaining the difference between an FHA appraisal and a home inspection. It informs the buyer that an FHA appraisal is not a home inspection and strongly recommends getting a professional home inspection before purchasing. The borrower signs to acknowledge they understand this distinction.\n\nHUD-92900-A (FHA Addendum to Uniform Residential Loan Application)\n\nHUD Form 92900-A is an addendum to the Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA) specifically for FHA-insured mortgage loans. It collects additional information required by FHA, including borrower certifications about occupancy, prior FHA loans, delinquent federal debt, and the property's compliance with FHA requirements.\n\nThe Good Faith Estimate (GFE) is a HUD-mandated form that provides borrowers with an estimate of settlement charges they are likely to pay at closing. While replaced by the CFPB Loan Estimate for most transactions after October 2015, the GFE is still used for reverse mortgages (HECMs) and certain other transactions not covered by the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rules.\n\nSchedule E (Supplemental Income and Loss)\n\nSchedule E reports income and losses from rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, estates, trusts, and REMICs. Part I is dedicated to rental real estate and royalties, making this the primary form for reporting rental property income and deductible expenses such as mortgage interest, depreciation, repairs, and property management fees.\n\nUniform Residential Loan Application (URLA / Fannie Mae 1003)\n\nThe Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA), also known as Fannie Mae Form 1003 or Freddie Mac Form 65, is the standardized form used by nearly all mortgage lenders in the United States. It collects the borrower's personal, financial, and property information needed to evaluate a mortgage application.\n\nVA Form 26-1880 (Request for Certificate of Eligibility)\n\nVA Form 26-1880 is used by veterans, active-duty service members, and eligible surviving spouses to request a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for a VA-backed home loan. The COE verifies to lenders that you meet the service requirements for a VA loan, which offers benefits like no down payment and no private mortgage insurance.",

    "fullText": "Write transactions can lead to lock starvation and serious performance degradation when using SQLite with SQLx, the popular async Rust SQL library. In retrospect, I feel like this should have been obvious, but it took a little more staring at suspiciously consistent \"slow statement\" logs than I'd like to admit, so I'm writing it up in case it helps others avoid this footgun.\n\nSQLite is single-writer. In WAL mode, it can support concurrent reads and writes (or, technically \"write\" singular), but no matter the mode there is only ever one writer at a time. Before writing, a process needs to obtain an EXCLUSIVE lock on the database.\n\nIf you start a read transaction with a SELECT and then perform a write in the same transaction, the transaction will need to be upgraded to write transaction with an exclusive lock:\n\nA read transaction is used for reading only. A write transaction allows both reading and writing. A read transaction is started by a SELECT statement, and a write transaction is started by statements like CREATE, DELETE, DROP, INSERT, or UPDATE (collectively \"write statements\"). If a write statement occurs while a read transaction is active, then the read transaction is upgraded to a write transaction if possible. (source)\n\nTransactions started with BEGIN IMMEDIATE or BEGIN EXCLUSIVE also take the exclusive write lock as soon as they are started.\n\nTransactions in SQLx look like this:\n\nThis type of transaction where you read and then write is completely fine. The transaction starts as a read transaction and then is upgraded to a write transaction for the UPDATE.\n\nThe problem arises when you call await within a write transaction. For example, this could happen if you call multiple write statements within a transaction:\n\nThis code will cause serious performance degradation if you have multiple concurrent tasks that might be trying this operation, or any other write, at the same time.\n\nWhen the program reaches the first INSERT statement, the transaction is upgraded to a write transaction with an exclusive lock. However, when you call await, the task yields control back to the async runtime. The runtime may schedule another task before returning to this one. The problem is that this task is now holding an exclusive lock on the database. All other writers must wait for this one to finish. If the newly scheduled task tries to write, it will simply block until it hits the busy_timeout and returns a busy timeout error. The original task might be able to make progress if no other concurrent writers are scheduled before it, but under higher load you might continuously have new tasks that block the original writer from progressing.\n\nStarting a transaction with BEGIN IMMEDIATE will also cause this problem, because you will immediately take the exclusive lock and then yield control with await.\n\nIn practice, you can spot this issue in your production logs if you see a lot of SQLx warnings that say slow statement: execution time exceeded alert threshold where the elapsed time is very close to your busy_timeout (which is 5 seconds by default). This is the result of other tasks being scheduled by the runtime and then trying and failing to obtain the exclusive lock they need to write to the database while being blocked by a parked task.\n\nWe could safely replace the example code above with this snippet that uses a bulk insert to avoid the lock starvation problem:\n\nNote that if you do this with different numbers of values, you should call .persistent(false). By default, SQLx caches prepared statements. However, each version of the query with a different number of arguments will be cached separately, which may thrash the cache.\n\nUnfortunately, the fix for atomic writes to multiple tables is uglier and potentially very dangerous. To avoid holding an exclusive lock across an await, you need to use the raw_sql interface to execute a transaction in one shot:\n\nHowever, this can lead to catastrophic SQL injection attacks if you use this for user input, because raw_sql does not support binding and sanitizing query parameters.\n\nIf you find yourself needing atomic writes to multiple tables with SQLite and Rust, you might be better off rethinking your schema to combine those tables or switching to a synchronous library like rusqlite with a single writer started with spawn_blocking.\n\nMaybe, but it probably won't. If SQLx differentiated between read and write statements, a write Transaction could be !Send like std::sync::MutexGuard, which would prevent it from being held across an await point.\n\nHowever, SQLx is not an ORM and it probably isn't worth it for the library to have different methods for read versus write statements. Without that, there isn't a way to prevent write transaction locks from being held across awaits while allowing safe read transactions to be used across awaits.\n\nSo, in lieu of type safety to prevent this footgun, I wrote up this blog post and this pull request to include a warning about this in the docs.",

    "description": ": Keep behavioral tracking American? PC giant says the claim is 'false'",
    "fullText": "A US law firm has accused Lenovo of violating Justice Department strictures about the bulk transfer of data to foreign adversaries, namely China.\n\nThe case filed by Almeida Law Group on behalf of San Francisco-based \"Spencer Christy, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated\" centers on the Data Security Program regulations implemented by the DOJ last year.\n\nAccording to the suit [PDF], these were \"implemented to prevent adversarial countries from acquiring large quantities of behavioral data which could be used to surveil, analyze, or exploit American citizens' behavior.\"\n\nThe complaint states the DOJ rule \"makes clear that sending American consumers' information to Chinese entities through automated advertising systems and associated databases with the requisite controls is prohibited.\"\n\nThe case states the threshold for \"covered personal identifiers\" is 100,000 US persons or more and lists a range of potential identifiers, from government and financial account numbers to IMEIs, MAC, and SIM numbers, demographic data, and advertising IDs.\n\nIt then alleges that Lenovo's website \"uses trackers which expose American's [sic] behavioral data to foreign adversaries.\"\n\n\"When a user lands on the homepage of Website, [sic] the Website loads numerous first and third-party tracking implementations that measure and record user data,\" it says, including the likes of TikTok, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nThis allows Lenovo to collect bulk personal data, it claims, and \"Lenovo knowingly permits access to, or transfer of, such bulk US sensitive personal data to entities or persons that qualify as covered persons under the DOJ Rule, including its foreign parents that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in China, such as the Lenovo Group.\"\n\nThis means that Lenovo Group, operating under Chinese jurisdiction, \"can use this data to build detailed dossiers on US residents, identify psychological or financial vulnerabilities, and target individuals in sensitive roles – such as jurists, military personnel, journalists, politicians, or dissidents,\" or so the lawyers allege.\n\nThat data could be \"weaponized for profiling, coercive targeting, or even blackmail.\"\n\nThe named plaintiff visited Lenovo's website multiple times in November and December 2025, the suits says, triggering trackers that violated \"his reasonable expectation of privacy\" and resulting in \"the unauthorized disclosure of personal information to a foreign entity.\"\n\nThe suit calls for class action status and seeks \"relief, restitution, and disgorgement\" as well as \"statutory damages in amounts to be determined by the Court and/or jury.\"\n\nThe Register asked Lenovo to comment on the case, and whether it had transferred customer data to China.\n\nIn a statement, Lenovo said: \"Any suggestion that Lenovo improperly shares customer data is false. We take data privacy and security seriously and comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations globally, including stringent US requirements. Our data practices are transparent, lawful, and designed to protect our customers.\"\n\nThe suit remains silent on whether the use of trackers, which could ultimately be used to profile individuals and potentially target those in sensitive positions, is permissible in and of itself.\n\nThe Reg contacted but has not heard back from Almeida Law Group, which specializes in data privacy and security cases, and class action settlements, among other areas. ®",

    "description": "Connected car servers won't be online indefinitely, and startups often go bust.",
    "fullText": "Imagine turning the key or pressing the start button of your car—and nothing happens. Not because the battery is dead or the engine is broken but because a server no longer answers. For a growing number of cars, that scenario isn’t hypothetical.\n\nAs vehicles become platforms for software and subscriptions, their longevity is increasingly tied to the survival of the companies behind their code. When those companies fail, the consequences ripple far beyond a bad app update and into the basic question of whether a car still functions as a car.\n\nOver the years, automotive software has expanded from performing rudimentary engine management and onboard diagnostics to powering today’s interconnected, software-defined vehicles. Smartphone apps can now handle tasks like unlocking doors, flashing headlights, and preconditioning cabins—and some models won’t unlock at all unless a phone running the manufacturer’s app is within range.\n\nHowever, for all the promised convenience of modern vehicle software, there’s a growing nostalgia for an era when a phone call to a mechanic could resolve most problems. Mechanical failures were often diagnosable and fixable, and cars typically returned to the road quickly. Software-defined vehicles complicate that model: When something goes wrong, a car can be rendered inoperable in a driveway—or stranded at the side of the road—waiting not for parts but a software technician.\n\nTake the example of Fisker. In May 2023, the Californian auto brand arrived in Britain with its Ocean Sport before filing for bankruptcy just one year later. Priced from £35,000 ($44,000)—although top-spec trims pushed the price to £60,000 ($75,000)—the all-electric Tesla Model Y rival featured tech including a partially retracting roof and a rotating BYD-like touchscreen. All cars also carried a six-year/62,000-mile (99779 km) warranty, with the battery and powertrain covered for 10 years or 100,000 miles (160,934 km).\n\nBefore Fisker’s 2024 bankruptcy, just 419 Fisker Oceans made it into British driveways. One unfortunate buyer, a marketing manager from Southampton, experienced the worst of the brand’s teething troubles. After taking delivery, her Ocean was plagued by persistent software glitches. Following a call to Fisker, engineers were dispatched to collect the vehicle for repairs, but when the car was due to be collected, it refused to start. Mere days later, Fisker declared insolvency, leaving the Ocean stranded as a 5,500 lb (2,500 kg) driveway ornament for the next ten months with no solution in sight.\n\nPreceding Fisker, there was Better Place. Founded in 2007, Better Place wasn’t a car manufacturer but an EV infrastructure and software company that promised to solve range anxiety through battery-swap stations. Its entire model relied on centralized servers, subscriptions, and proprietary software to authenticate vehicles and manage battery exchanges. The flagship car for this system was the Renault Fluence Z.E., an electric sedan sold primarily in Israel and Denmark.\n\nBetter Place filed for bankruptcy in May 2013 after burning through $850 million, leading to Renault closing the Fluence Z.E’s Turkish assembly line. Servers were shut down, battery-swap stations stopped operating, and backend software used for authentication, charging, and fleet management disappeared, leaving many cars bricked.\n\nThese cases highlight a broader shift in the auto industry, where long-term ownership is increasingly dependent not just on mechanical durability but on continued access to proprietary software and manufacturer support.\n\n“When a modern car’s software misbehaves, you don’t fix it yourself—you call the manufacturer,” said Stuart Masson, founder and editor of The Car Expert. “They control the code. At that point, you’re not dealing with a traditional service department so much as an IT help desk.”\n\nThat dependence, Masson warned, becomes a critical failure mode when the manufacturer disappears. “Sooner or later, every owner risks a Fisker-style scenario, where the company is gone and there’s nothing you can do about it.”\n\nWhile informal owner communities have begun attempting to reverse-engineer and distribute unofficial software updates, Masson is blunt about the risks. “You’re trusting that someone on the Internet actually knows what they’re doing,” he said. “If they don’t, the consequences might not be that Android Auto simply stops working but instead an airbag deploying at 70 mph.”\n\nWhile buying a second-hand Fisker in the UK is a high-risk move, more established manufacturers generally have contingency plans if a critical software partner goes under. In practice, that usually means issuing recalls or pushing over-the-air fixes to affected vehicles. Warranty coverage should handle most issues for newer cars, but the story gets murkier on the used market.\n\nTake a decade-old Tesla Model S, for example: You might snag one at a bargain price, but there’s no guarantee Tesla will continue supporting it indefinitely. When a manufacturer drops software support, the car isn’t just at risk of breaking down—it becomes a potential cybersecurity liability. In a world where vehicles are increasingly defined by their code, running unsupported software is akin to leaving your router exposed to the Internet. You may have a functioning car today, but there’s no telling when—or how—it could stop running.\n\n“Many teams, such as McLaren, who have F1 cars from the 1990s, require a 1990s-era laptop running an old Windows operating system, along with specialized interface hardware, for maintenance and to start the car,” Masson said. “We are up against time here, but it could be that brands like Tesla release its code, allowing people to use it. Who knows?”\n\nThe problem isn’t solely on the consumer; manufacturers shoulder a significant portion of the risk as well. One potential mitigation is standardization. Enter Catena-X, a collaborative data network connecting OEMs, suppliers, and IT vendors. By creating traceable digital records for parts and software—and standardizing data models and APIs for interoperability—Catena-X aims to make supply chains more resilient and software dependencies less catastrophic when a critical partner disappears.\n\nWhen asked how OEMs can map software dependencies and mitigate vendor insolvency, Catena-X Managing Director Hanno Focken told Ars that “Catena-X supports software bills of materials and standardizes certain components to make software replaceable, plus a marketplace and open-source reference implementation helps OEMs find alternative vendors.”\n\nThe industry also shares responsibility in defining minimum operational lifespans for vehicle software. “As an association, Catena-X can facilitate shared industry commitments and consensus (e.g., data retention policies like a 10-year battery passport requirement), but it does not act as a regulator setting mandatory lifespans,” added Focken.\n\nThe lesson is clear: In today’s cars, the engine or electric motor isn’t always what keeps you moving—the software does. When that software vanishes with a bankrupt company, your car can go from daily driver to expensive paperweight overnight. And in the age of software-defined vehicles, owning a car increasingly means betting on the survival of its code. When that code dies, the driveway or highway—not the repair shop—becomes the final stop.",

Win-win.\n\nEvery day, millions of people fall into the same pattern without realizing it. They pick up their phone just for a minute, then look up much later wondering where the time went and why they feel worse than before.\n\nWhat if you had to move before you could scroll? A simple rule that changes everything about how you use screens.\n\nMany people notice their mental health has declined without understanding why. Mood feels less stable. Anxiety shows up more often. Sleep becomes worse.\n\nReduced my screen time from about 5 hours to under 2.\nIt makes a real difference.\n\nReally good app for helping to reduce doom scrolling!\n\nI stopped feeling guilty about screen time because I earn it by moving first.\n\nWe saw two common struggles: losing hours to endless scrolling and staying consistent with exercise. Scrolletics connects the two by turning screen time into motivation. Movement unlocks your apps, so your phone becomes a reward instead of a distraction. The goal is to build healthier habits without forcing you to delete the apps you enjoy.\n\nYes, completely. Your camera never records, stores, or uploads anything. Movement detection happens instantly on your device and the data is discarded right away. No photos, no videos, no cloud storage. Your activity stays fully private.\n\nNo equipment needed. Just your phone and a little space to move. Place your phone on the floor, complete the exercise, and continue with your day. No gym, no weights, no extra gear.\n\nYour phone's camera detects body movement in real time without recording. It recognizes motion, checks form, and counts reps automatically, so there is no manual input. You'll understand how it works as soon as you start your first exercise.\n\n100% on-device. No cloud.

    "description": "As colon cancer surges in young Americans, including 48-year-old Dawson's Creek actor James Van Der Beek, scientists have discovered a key protein that may help patients live longer.",
    "fullText": "Blocking a single protein inside cells could dramatically slow colorectal cancer, scientists claim.\n\nResearchers in South Korea found that shutting down a gene called NSMF, which makes a protein that helps cancer cells cope with rapid cell division, caused tumors to suffer from 'irreversible cellular aging.'\n\nNormally, cancer cells divide rapidly, with NSMF inducing DNA damage and the emergence of new mutations.\n\nBut the scientists found that when they stopped the gene from functioning in lab and mouse experiments, tumor growth slowed or stopped completely.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, removing NSMF led to significantly fewer intestinal growths. The animals also lived 33.5 percent longer on average than those that still had the gene.\n\nResearchers also found no noticeable damage to healthy intestinal cells in mice, suggesting that shutting off the gene could target tumors without damaging other cells, unlike chemotherapy, which can attack non-cancerous cells.\n\nThe findings come as colorectal cancer is rising sharply among young adults. Cases among Americans under 50 have roughly doubled since the mid-1990s, as more people experience subtle symptoms that are often dismissed or misdiagnosed.\n\nOn February 11, Dawson's Creek actor James Van Der Beek died from the cancer at 48 years old. The actor reportedly dismissed the early warning signs, blaming the change in his bowel movements on his morning coffee instead of the disease.\n\nJames Van Der Beek (pictured above) died from colorectal cancer at 48 years old. He was diagnosed in 2023 after suffering from a change in his bowel movements that he put blamed on his morning coffee\n\nHe was diagnosed with stage three colorectal cancer in 2023, in his mid 40s, and went through near-constant doctors appointments and painful treatments that rendered him unable to work.\n\nResearchers behind the new study believe that while more research is needed in humans, they could eventually led to new treatments that boost survival.\n\nDr Kyeong Jin Shin, a cancer expert at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), who led the study, said: 'Our findings suggest that NSMF is a promising... target.\n\n'By inducing a state of permanent aging in cancer cells, we can effectively stop tumor growth without harming normal tissues.'\n\nHe added that developing drugs to block the protein 'could offer a novel treatment approach' against the cancer.\n\nIn the study, published in the journal Nucleic Acids Research, researchers blocked the protein from NSMF using antibodies in the lab experiments or, in the mouse experiments, by breeding a strain of mice that did not have the gene.\n\nIt is not clear by how much blocking NSMF slowed the growth of colorectal cancer tumor cells.\n\nThe researchers also did not suggest in their study how the NSMF gene could be blocked in humans.\n\nIn the study, researchers analyzed NSMF,  also called N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor synaptonuclear signaling and neuronal migration factor (NSMF).\n\nResearchers in South Korea made the breakthrough via lab and mouse experiments (Stock image)\n\nIn lab experiments, the scientists used antibodies to block the NSMF-made protein in human colorectal cancer cells and monitored the effects.\n\nIn a separate experiment, they bred mice that did not have NSMF with others that had a higher risk of developing intestinal tumors.\n\nThe offspring were then tracked for up to 16 to 20 weeks, before their intestinal tissue was examined for cancer growth.\n\nResearchers said that while blocking NSMF reduced tumor growth, it did not completely eliminate the cancer.\n\nAt this stage, it was not clear how the gene might be turned off safely in humans, but researchers said their study was a promising first step to a potential treatment.\n\nProfessor Young Chan Chae of the Department of Biological Sciences at UNIST, who led the study, said: 'This research uncovers a previously unknown role for NSMF in colorectal cancer.\n\n'Developing inhibitors against this protein could offer a novel treatment approach that causes cancer cells to naturally age and die, providing a potential new avenue for therapy.'",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A Pennsylvania man who spent 43 years in prison before his murder conviction was overturned — only to be taken straight into immigration custody — was denied bail Tuesday while he fights deportation.\n\nSubramanyam Vedam, 64, will remain in custody while he appeals a 1999 deportation order. The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed this month to hear his appeal based on what it called exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe Trump administration had initially pursued a quick deportation and moved Vedam to a detention center in Louisiana last fall, before two separate courts intervened.\n\nVedam's lawyer argued Tuesday that he would have likely been spared deportation and become a citizen if not for the murder case, given immigration laws in place at the time. Vedam would have left prison on a drug charge by 1992, lawyer Ava Benach said.\n\n“It was delivery of LSD on a very small scale. This is not importing tons of cocaine,” Benach said Tuesday. “He is not a danger to the community. We are talking about offenses that occurred over 40 years ago.”\n\nIn August, a Pennsylvania judge threw out Vedam’s murder conviction in the 1980 death of a college friend, based on ballistics evidence that prosecutors hadn’t disclosed during his two trials. Supporters listening in remotely to the bail hearing included a Centre County prosecutor and the mayor of State College, where Vedam's late father was a renowned professor at Penn State University, Benach said.\n\nImmigration Judge Tamar Wilson, sitting in Elizabeth, New Jersey, said she believes detention to be mandatory given the felony drug conviction. Alternatively, she agreed with Department of Homeland Security officials who said he remains a safety risk.\n\n“The fact he's been a ‘model prisoner’ does not suggest that out in the general public he's going to be safe,” Wilson said.\n\nIt's not yet clear whether Wilson or another judge will hear the merits of the deportation case. No hearings have yet been scheduled.\n\n“Subu is nothing if not resilient, and we’re resolved to emulate the example he sets for us by focusing on the next step in his fight for freedom. We continue to believe his immigration case is strong and look forward to the day we can be together again,” said his sister, Saraswathi Vedam, calling him by a family nickname.\n\nShe planned to bring him home when he was released from state prison on Oct. 3, only to see him taken into federal immigration custody. Vedam had come to the U.S. legally from India when he was 9 months old, when his parents returned to State College.\n\n“He was someone who’s suffered a profound injustice,” Benach told The Associated Press last year. “Those 43 years aren’t a blank slate. He lived a remarkable experience in prison.”\n\nVedam is being held at an 1,800-bed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in central Pennsylvania.\n\n“Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said of the case last year.",

    "description": "Basware CEO Jason Kurtz explained how he keeps his software company ahead of AI startups threatening his business.",
    "fullText": "It's the end of the world as software companies know it, and this CEO feels fine.\n\nJudging by what some AI experts are saying, and the state of the stock market, you'd think software companies were on their last legs. Basware CEO Jason Kurtz, whose company sells software for financial processes, sees it slightly differently.\n\n\"I will tell you there is not a single piece of data that we see that says that,\" said Kurtz.\n\n\"I have not had a single customer tell us, 'Oh, we're just going to go figure this out on our own and do AP with OpenAI or whoever.' That's not the way these companies work,\" he added.\n\nKurtz reached out to me last week after I asked for some reader feedback on the topic. (I genuinely read all your emails. Even the mean ones!)\n\nBasware, which counts Mercedes and Heineken among its roughly 6,500 customers and uses AI within its own products, hasn't felt threatened thus far. Kurtz told me the company saw a 20% year-over-year increase in sales in 2025, primarily driven by a surge in the back-half of the year.\n\nHe acknowledged that there had been some customer chatter about experimenting with AI on their own. But more recently, clients just want results.\n\nKurtz recalled a conversation with the digital transformation officer of a large European company. After spending roughly a million euros on internal AI-related projects in finance over the past year, the executive told Kurtz they \"can't point to a single penny that we have saved, earned, or helped our business in any way.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of experimenting. I want people who know how to use AI in our processes in our workflows,\" Kurtz said the executive told him.\n\nI asked Kurtz for advice for fellow software companies looking to protect themselves.\n\nBasware primarily works with AWS to help build its AI tools for customers. The company also has an \"AI czar,\" according to Kurtz, to surveil the industry. Figuring out ways to implement AI into your own products that'll drive more value for customers is one way to stay ahead.\n\nThere's also strength in numbers. Kurtz said maintaining tight integrations with fellow vendors to become a part of the workflow creates stickiness.\n\n\"If we weren't doing that, I'd be even more paranoid,\" Kurtz said.\n\nAnd then there's the data element. Basware has processed 2.5 billion invoices and 10 trillion euros of spend in the company's 40-year history. Having such a large swath of info can help train models and identify new efficiencies to pitch to customers.\n\n\"If you don't have a data strategy around AI and how you're going to use that to differentiate your AI and your capabilities, I think that's going to be a challenge,\" he said.",

This reduction is due to layoffs and \"natural attrition\" — where employees leave the company, and their roles are not replaced, he said.\n\n\"Occasionally, we hire somebody here and there,\" he said, but if you \"go to LinkedIn and look at the insights, you're going to see how the company is shrinking.\"\n\nSiemiatkowski said he has seen the speed at which AI is improving and believes these technologies can be integrated into the company without expanding the head count.\n\nKlarna declined to comment further when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nSiemiatkowski's comments come as the debate around the extent to which AI will replace jobs intensifies.\n\nWhile Tesla and xAI CEO Elon Musk has said AI will create abundance for all, other tech CEOs have a more gloomy outlook.\n\nAnthropic's CEO Dario Amodei has warned about the impact AI could have on society, writing that it presents \"a serious civilizational challenge\" in his January essay on the future of technology. Amodei has also said that he believes AI could cut 50% of all white-collar entry-level jobs.\n\n\"I'm \n\n\"I'm an optimist at heart, but I also want to be a realist around what's going to happen in the shorter term, and it's going to be a lot of turmoil in this,\" he said of AI's impact on jobs.\n\nSome major companies, such as IBM, HP, and Salesforce, have already signaled they are cutting jobs because of AI.\n\nSiemiatkowski said that jobs at Klarna involving \"human connection,\" such as relationships with retailers, will not be replaced by AI.\n\n\"It's going to be vital to offer a human connection there. So those jobs will remain, but for the rest it's going to be definitely smaller,\" he said.\n\nDo you work for Klarna and have a tip or story to share?

Discovery.\n\nThe media conglomerate announced Tuesday that it will let the Ellisons make another bid for the company over the next week, with two key stipulations: Their offer has to be more than $31 for each share of WBD, and it will be the last time the Ellisons get to make a formal pitch to the WBD board.\n\nWBD's announcement reopens a deal that was theoretically closed last December, when it agreed to sell most of itself to Netflix in an $83 billion transaction.\n\nSince then, the Ellisons, who bought Paramount last year and want to merge it with WBD, have argued that their offer of $30 per share — for the entire company — was better than Netflix's offer.\n\nThey have repeatedly told WBD and its investors that they should get another shot at making their case. Their most recent pitch came a week ago, when they offered to pay billions \n\nNow, WBD says, they have one more opportunity to bid. WBD says they expect the Ellisons to increase their offer to more than $31 a share. The company is trading around $28 a share, up 170% in the last year.\n\nIn a press release, WBD officials say that last week, a \"senior representative\" for Paramount told them that if they had the chance to bid, they would offer $31 per share, but could go above that.\n\nNone of this means the existing deal Netflix has with WBD goes away. For starters, WBD continues to formally endorse its Netflix deal. More important: If Paramount does increase its bid, Netflix will have the ability to raise its offer, too.\n\nAnd no matter what bid WBD eventually agrees to, the deal will still need regulatory approval in the US and overseas. Netflix got a preview of some of the issues regulators might bring up earlier this month during a congressional hearing, when Republicans argued that the company is too woke, and Democrats worried that a combined Netflix/WBD could doom the movie industry.\n\nA Paramount/WBD combination would also get regulatory scrutiny, though the Ellisons are counting on their ties to the Trump White House to give them a leg up.",

    "description": "When I lost my job in the US, I decided to move to Brazil full-time. I've experienced a lot of culture shocks during the transition, but I'm happy.",
    "fullText": "After an incredible three weeks traveling around Brazil, I was on the first leg of my flight home to Chicago when I received a message from my director at work — a 15-minute \"check-in\" with an HR representative.\n\nWorried I might receive news of a layoff, I frantically deboarded the plane after landing in Rio de Janeiro and joined the call in a quiet corner of the duty-free section of the airport. There, I was informed that my role had been eliminated.\n\nFaced with the reality of returning home to the frigid Chicago temperatures with no job, I quickly changed my connecting flight and decided to hostel-hop around Brazil for another month.\n\nHowever, even that extra month didn't feel like long enough in the country I'd fallen in love with. Exploring beautiful destinations while practicing a new language every day was incredibly fulfilling for me.\n\nOnce I went back to the US, I realized I was looking for ways to push myself out of my comfort zone. I had always wanted to live abroad, and my unemployment seemed like the perfect alignment to make that move to another part of the world.\n\nSo, a few months after my original trip, I relocated from Chicago to São Paulo and was greeted by lots of surprises along the way.\n\nGrowing up in the Midwest, I've endured my fair share of snowstorms and wind chills so cold that I felt as though my eyelids would freeze together. So, I felt well-equipped for any kind of cold weather Mother Nature could ever throw my way.\n\nEven so, I wasn't prepared for just how chilly Brazil could feel — especially during a springtime cold front while living in an area without access to central heating.\n\nAlthough Brazil's springtime temperatures (which last from September through November) are similar to what I experienced during the Chicago fall, it was difficult to adjust to the lack of central heating. So, I found myself wearing multiple layers of T-shirts and the only hoodie I brought with me.\n\nBefore I moved, I'd only visited Brazil during its smoldering summer months, so I had naively assumed the subtropical temperatures in São Paulo would be pleasant year-round.\n\nBetween seeing unrefrigerated milk in grocery stores to trying vegetables I've never heard of, the day-to-day food in Brazil is a lot different than what I was used to in the States.\n\nFor example, contrary to the common American adage, breakfast doesn't seem to be the most important meal of the day here; many Brazilians opt for bread or fruit instead of the hefty pancakes or sausage links I was accustomed to.\n\nFor lunch and dinner, many locals seem to rely on a tried-and-true formula: arroz (rice), feijão (beans), some meat, and salad.\n\nClassic dishes like stroganoff (a creamy chicken or beef dish topped with crispy shoestring potatoes) or feijoada (pork and black bean stew) may enter the rotation. Still, the aforementioned combo is a popular default dish that I've grown to love.\n\nAlthough tavern-style Chicago pizza still holds a special place in my heart, my new Brazilian favorites include acarajé (stuffed black-eyed pea fritters fried in dendé oil), acerola (a sweet cherry fruit), and doce de leite (sweet caramelized milk used as a topping or filling).\n\nPlus, there's a pretty great international food scene here, too. While wandering around the city, I've come across a wide range of cuisines, from Lebanese and West African restaurants to Colombian and Venezuelan spots.\n\nOne thing I've noticed since my first visit to the country is that Brazilians are very proud to be Brazilian.\n\nFrom football matches to the celebrations that occur when Brazilian films are nominated for Academy Awards, the people here seem to be the loudest and proudest fans in the room.\n\nBecause of this, I was worried I might not feel as welcome as an outsider. Instead, I've found an endearing level of curiosity among many Brazilians I've met, who either want to practice English or ask how I'm enjoying their beloved country.\n\nThis openness to connect has softened a lot of the original culture shock during my move. Although very different from my life in Chicago, I'm excited to continue building a life for myself in São Paulo.",

Warshaw said the numbers did not show a financial problem and told him he simply needs to \"loosen the purse strings.\"\n\n\"Go part time, homie,\" Delony said, after Mark explained he wanted to scale back to spend more time at home.\n\nSee Also: Professional traders demand transparency — see why Kraken Pro has become one of crypto's most trusted advanced trading platforms.\n\nMark said reducing his schedule to three days a week would lower his annual income from about $390,000 to $220,000.

    "description": "The US has the world's largest military budget. Here's how military budgets compare around the world, and what they reveal about military priorities.",
    "fullText": "The US has the world's most expensive military, spending nearly $1 trillion on defense. That's roughly four times China's reported defense budget, the next largest.\n\nFrom spending on nuclear technology to advanced aircraft and warships, the world's top militaries allocate hundreds of billions of dollars each year to stay ahead.\n\nIn some countries, big-ticket items such as naval assets or technologically advanced aircraft or missiles account for the bulk of military spending, while others devote large sums to maintaining large conscription troop systems.\n\nUltimately, military spending varies by country depending on location and interests, Gian Gentile, a retired US Army colonel and senior historian at RAND, told Business Insider. Some countries prioritize homeland defense while others value overmatch and far-reaching power projection.\n\n\"The US spends a lot on more sophisticated, extremely precise weapon systems,\" he said.\n\nA military's budget can be measured either as a total amount or as a share of its country's GDP, reflecting the burden on its economy. Worldwide, countries spent an average of 2.4% of their GDP on defense in 2024.\n\nWartime spending as a share of GDP typically rises, putting strain on the civilian economy, said Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Ukraine in 2024, for example, devoted over 15% of its GDP to its military, the highest share globally.\n\nSpending statistics help paint a picture of defense priorities, but they don't always translate into readiness for conflict.\n\n\"Readiness is very expensive, and perishable,\" Cancian said.\n\nA country's on-paper investment in its defense systems doesn't always translate directly into military capability, he added. Training and maintenance are often overlooked in analyses of spending on equipment and technologies.\n\nA particularly significant cost when it comes to technologically advanced aircraft, for instance, is maintenance and sustainment.\n\nStill, looking at military budgets can reveal how much capital each country relies on to defend itself.\n\nLast year, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank, released its Military Balance report, which included data on nearly every country's defense budget based on each's reported 2024 figures.\n\nThe report includes each country's total budget (in US dollars), per-capita figures, and defense budget as a share of GDP. Some countries, such as North Korea, Libya, Syria, Cuba, and Afghanistan, did not publicly report their defense budgets.\n\nThese are the 30 countries that spend the most on their military, ranked by the size of their defense budgets.\n\nDefense budget per capita: $3,785\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,776\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,157\n\nDefense budget per capita: $301\n\nDefense budget per capita: $170\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,517\n\nDefense budget per capita: $799\n\nDefense budget per capita: $411\n\nDefense budget per capita: $455\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,220\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,328\n\nDefense budget per capita: $111\n\nDefense budget per capita: $696\n\nDefense budget per capita: $723\n\nDefense budget per capita: $797\n\nDefense budget per capita: $3,589\n\nDefense budget per capita: $578\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,360\n\nDefense budget per capita: $842\n\nDefense budget per capita: $430\n\nDefense budget per capita: $937\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,963\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,184\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,022\n\nDefense budget: $120.32 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $854\n\nDefense budget: $234.98 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $166\n\nDefense budget: $967.96 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,831",

    "description": "We compared chicken tenders from 14 fast-food chains, from McDonald's and Chick-fil-A to Taco Bell.",
    "fullText": "The fast-food chicken wars have entered a new battleground — now, it's all about the tender.\n\nMcDonald's launched its McCrispy Strips in May last year, marking the first time chicken strips have been on the menu since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThen, a few months later, Wendy's launched its own Wendy's Tendys and a lineup of six new sauces made for dunking.\n\n\"Consumers told us what they wanted in a chicken tender, and we listened — taste-tested, fine-tuned, and delivered,\" Lindsay Radkoski, Wendy's US chief marketing officer, told Business Insider.\n\nI decided to compare chicken tenders from 14 fast-food chains across the country to see which were the best.\n\nHere's how the tenders ranked, from worst to best, based on taste and value.\n\nA three-piece chicken tender cost $7.48 at Whataburger at the location I visited in Austin.\n\nI thought the tenders could only be described as \"classic\" — they weren't anything out-of-the-box, but I enjoyed them.\n\nThe three-piece \"snack\" cost $4.99, not including tax.\n\nThey were also a good size. I thought the price was also a great deal for the generous portion I received.\n\nThese were undeniably classic chicken tenders, similar to the ones from Whataburger, but they were a touch too fried for my liking. However, I thought they were well-seasoned and had a lot of peppery flavor.\n\nAn order of three chicken tenders from Smashburger costs $9.99, excluding tax and fees. I thought this was a little pricey.\n\nThe breading on the chicken tenders felt thick and crunchy.\n\nThe chicken meat inside and the ranch dipping sauce provided could only do so much to offset the intense dryness of the crunchy breading.\n\nThe next time I order from Smashburger, I'll stick to the chain's beef offerings.\n\nA five-piece order of chicken tenders cost $8.41, excluding tax.\n\nRather than thick and juicy like some of the other chicken tenders I tried, these were flatter. In fact, I'd say these were the thinnest and flattest tenders out of all the ones I tried.\n\nThe chicken was on the drier side, and there simply wasn't a lot of it. I gravitate toward thicker, more shreddable chicken tenders, and these slightly missed the mark for me.\n\nHowever, the flavor was definitely there — the breading had a peppery essence and the tenders were evenly fried.\n\nA three-piece tender combo costs $16.89 before taxes and fees. The meal deal included a large serving of fries, a drink, and a biscuit, as well as a choice of dipping sauces.\n\nI really liked the crunchy exterior.\n\nI also thought the batter was quite flavorful — I could taste hints of seasoning and buttermilk, although they weren't quite as buttery-tasting as the Chick-fil-A tenders.\n\nHowever, this meal felt expensive for only three chicken tenders, even though they were large.\n\nA four-piece chicken tenders combo, including fries, a medium drink, and a biscuit, cost me $10.49, excluding taxes and fees.\n\nThe texture and flavor of the breading made them taste like a cross between the chicken tenders from Chick-fil-A and Cook Out.\n\nI also thought the price was fair, considering the amount of food I received. The chicken tenders paired perfectly with honey mustard but were also tasty on their own.\n\nI would definitely order these again.\n\nWendy's new tenders are available in a three-piece or four-piece option. I ordered a three-piece tender for $8.12, excluding tax and fees, at my local restaurant in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nHowever, I preferred the slightly thinner breading on the McDonald's and KFC tenders.\n\nIn terms of flavor, these tenders had a distinct peppery flavor that paired well with the new signature sauce introduced with the tenders' release.\n\nHowever, the slight lack of chicken meat inside — at least compared to other chains — and the chunky breading prevented Wendy's tenders from ranking higher for me.\n\nI ordered a four-piece tender meal for $13.65, excluding taxes and fees, in Brooklyn, New York. I thought this was excellent value for the amount of food I received.\n\nThe breading stuck closely to the chicken tenders, rather than having a thick or crunchy texture.\n\nHowever, the chicken tenders paired well with the chain's honey mustard and new comeback sauce. The breading had a tasty, very peppery flavor to it that was unique compared to the other chicken tenders I tried.\n\nHowever, the slightly less crispy texture of the breading meant they didn't come out on top when compared to the last six chains I tried.\n\nAt my local McDonald's in Brooklyn, New York, three McCrispy chicken strips cost $10.99, excluding tax and fees.\n\nThe chicken strips differed from the chain's buttermilk crispy tenders, which were discontinued in 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nChicken tenders haven't been on the menu since, despite fans' pleas to bring them back.\n\nUnlike some flakier chicken tenders, each bite was evenly coated in well-seasoned, peppery breading. Inside, the chicken meat was thick and juicy.\n\nPaired with the chain's creamy chili sauce, which was specifically created to go with the chicken strips, these packed a decent amount of flavor.\n\nHowever, on their own, I thought they were just a touch blander than some of the higher-ranked tenders I tried.\n\nTaco Bell's chicken strips were available as part of three different kinds of tacos and burritos, or on their own with dipping sauce.\n\nAn order of four chicken strips and two sauces cost $9.14, excluding tax and fees.\n\nThe chicken strips were marinated in zesty jalapeño buttermilk and breaded with crispy tortilla chips and breadcrumbs, which is the same formula as the chain's chicken nuggets, which I ranked as my favorite across six chains.\n\nThe breading was super flavorful, and I definitely got hints of tortilla chip. The chicken inside was also moist and juicy, while the breading remained crispy.\n\nMy only real complaint was that I wanted more than two.\n\nWhen it's not included in a meal deal, a three-piece chicken tender costs $9.69 at my nearest location in New York City. For a meal, the price bumps up to $17.35, excluding tax and fees.\n\nSmall bits of fried breading were scattered on the outside, which I always love with chicken tenders.\n\nWhen I dipped them in the chain's signature Chick-fil-A sauce, the experience was mouthwatering.\n\nThe chicken tenders were also great on their own, with the perfect balance of crispy breading and a delicious, briny flavor. The sauce just took them over the edge.\n\nWingstop recently revamped its chicken tenders, and I was excited to try them out.\n\nThe chain sells its chicken in various flavors, from original hot to hickory-smoked barbecue and mango habanero. However, I ordered these chicken tenders plain.\n\nI ordered a five-piece chicken tender combo at my local Wingstop in Brooklyn, New York. It cost $15.39 and came with a drink, dipping sauce, and a regular side of fries.\n\nThe chain also sells four chicken tenders, which come with one dipping sauce, for $10.69, plus tax and fees.\n\nThe chicken tenders were deep golden in color and evenly fried, with small clumps of fried breading adding even more texture to every bite.\n\nThe chicken tender easily tore apart with every bite, which is something I look for. The breading itself was slightly peppery, but not overly flavorful. They paired well with Wingstop's signature ranch — my favorite of any fast-food ranch — and the chain's honey mustard.\n\nWingstop delivered great classic tenders, though the breading didn't pack as much flavor as the top two chains I tried. Nevertheless, I'd definitely order these again.\n\nA five-piece chicken tenders combo came with fries, a small drink, coleslaw, and a piece of Texas toast. I also asked for a side of honey mustard and Zaxby's famous Zax sauce.\n\nMy meal cost $15.43, excluding taxes and fees.\n\nZax sauce tastes similar to the Cane's sauce I tried from Raising Cane's, but I found it to be just ever-so-slightly less flavorful, and creamy. I also thought it didn't have the same kick.\n\nHowever, the chicken tenders really impressed me. They were a good size, extremely flavorful, and addictingly delicious. I found myself craving even more than the five chicken tenders I was given, which is rare for me.\n\nIn the end, it was a really tough call on whether I preferred Zaxby's or Raising Cane's chicken tenders.\n\nA combo that includes three chicken fingers, fries, Cane's sauce, Texas toast, and a regular drink costs $12.19, excluding tax and any additions or swaps.\n\nThe chicken tenders were also thick. After biting in, I could actually see the strips of white chicken underneath, which, in my experience, you don't always find with fast-food chicken tenders.",

    "description": "As a dietitian who's trying fibermaxxing while following a Mediterranean diet, I go to Costco for high-fiber foods like frozen berries and plums.",
    "fullText": "\"Fibermaxxing\" is one of the latest trends on TikTok and, as a dietitian, it's actually one I can get behind.\n\nMost Americans aren't coming close to eating enough fiber every day, and the goal of fibermaxxing is to hit or exceed one's suggested daily intake of it.\n\nAfter all, fiber is crucial to a healthy diet. It keeps your digestive system moving, can help you feel full, supports gut health, and may help reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases.\n\nWhile upping my fiber game, I also follow the Mediterranean diet — a flexible healthy eating pattern that focuses on maximizing whole grains and fresh produce while limiting processed foods.\n\nCostco is one of my go-to spots to stock up on fiber-rich staples in bulk that fit the bill and work with my diet.\n\nHere are a few of my favorite finds that help me hit my fiber goals without sacrificing flavor or convenience.\n\nA low-carb, high-fiber alternative to rice, frozen riced cauliflower is as versatile as it gets. I buy it in bulk at Costco and add it to my smoothies for a fiber boost that I can't even taste.\n\nI also mix it into grain dishes for some extra bulk and antioxidants — it's hard to taste the difference.\n\nPrunes are famously high in fiber — luckily, they're pretty sweet and versatile.\n\nFor a snack, I'll eat Kirkland Signature Sunsweet dried prunes right out of the bag or stuff them with nut butter for extra protein. They're also great to blend into smoothies for extra sweetness or to chop to add to salads.\n\nAvocados are fairly high in fiber and I like this ready-to-eat mash from Good Foods that I can buy in bulk at Costco. Each single-serve container has 4 grams of dietary fiber.\n\nI love using this as a condiment in my sandwiches instead of mayo. It adds creaminess and heart-healthy fats to my lunch while also boosting my fiber intake.\n\nSunGold kiwis are sweet, juicy, and contain about 2 grams of fiber.\n\nI slice them over Greek yogurt or enjoy them on their own for a bright, zesty fiber fix. I will literally bite into them like an apple after washing the skin. (You can consume the skin— it's thin and edible.)\n\nIf you're really trying to fibermaxx, a high-fiber cereal can be a great breakfast option.\n\nAlthough it's advertised as a protein cereal, Catalina Crunch also doesn't disappoint in the fiber department.\n\nIt contains a whopping 9 grams of fiber per serving — much more than what other classic cinnamon-toast cereals provide. And, in my humble opinion, it tastes just as good.\n\nI use it as a yogurt topper, mix it with other cereals for breakfast, or eat it on its own as a snack.\n\nFrozen fruit can be just as nutritious as fresh, and oftentimes, it's much more economical.\n\nI especially like the Kirkland Signature triple-berry blend, which contains raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries.\n\nThis antioxidant-loaded mix is a dietitian's dream. I toss the berries into my breakfast bowls, blend them into smoothies, and just snack on them straight from the bag.\n\nWith these, I can get a naturally sweet fiber boost without worrying about eating tons of fresh fruit before it gets moldy and mushy.\n\nCompared to traditional beef burgers (which have no fiber), these plant-based patties feel like a fiber goldmine. Each patty contains 6 grams of fiber.\n\nI lean on these for nights when I really don't feel like cooking and a burger is calling my name.\n\nAll I have to do is heat a patty up and enjoy it with a whole-grain bun, veggies, some avocado mash, and a side salad.\n\nThese tiny seeds pack a big punch when it comes to fiber, with about 10 grams per serving.\n\nI sprinkle them on yogurt, blend them into smoothies, or make chia pudding for a fiber-rich snack. Chia seeds are also high in omega-3s, another Mediterranean-diet darling that can be great for heart health.\n\nMy family and I love pancakes and waffles, so I like that this Kodiak Power Cakes mix allows us to enjoy a weekend treat with an impressive amount of protein (15 grams) and fiber (5 grams) per serving.\n\nI use mushrooms to add a meaty texture, earthy flavor, and a touch of fiber to countless dinner recipes.\n\nThey work especially well in meat-forward dishes like beef tacos or Bolognese sauce. For those, I replace half of my meat with chopped mushrooms.\n\nIt's a win-win — I add fiber to my meals, and they cost less to make since I don't use as much meat. The mushrooms give me a boost of antioxidants, too.\n\nThis story was originally published on August 1, 2025, and most recently updated on February 17, 2026.",

    "description": "With layoffs, slow hiring and return-to-office mandates reshaping the labor market, workers are dressing more carefully to project competence.",
    "fullText": "Dress for the job you want to… keep?\n\nIn a job market where power has shifted toward employers, at least one thing remains within an employee's control: how they choose to show up to work.\n\nWith layoffs and slow hiring shaping the labor market and RTO mandates pulling employees back into offices, experts say workers are dressing more carefully to project competence.\n\nIn periods of uncertainty, clothing is less about comfort and self-expression, and more about job security, Lizzy Bowring, a creative strategist and trend forecaster, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Dressing smarter serves as career risk management,\" she said.\n\nBusiness casual had an era — a long one. Over the past 30 years, suits and ties have given way to blazers and sweaters in many white-collar industries.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, casual dressing went from trend to default. There was no need to dress up for your living room.\n\nBut times are different now. Workers are being called back into the office, and the franzied \"Great Resignation\" period post-pandemic, when employers were scrambling to retain staff and thrust into bidding wars to scoop up talent, is well behind us.\n\nThe balance of power has shifted from employee to employer. US businesses are hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013, and the early impact of AI is beginning to show up.\n\nLast month saw more layoffs than any January since 2009, as big companies like Amazon and Citi announced plans to cut thousands of jobs.\n\nBecause of this, \"employees are becoming more conscious of how they present themselves, not because they're being told to, but because uncertainty changes behaviour,\" Frances Li, founder and director of Biscuit Recruitment, a boutique recruitment agency based in London and New York, told Business Insider.\n\nStill, experts say we aren't seeing a full return to suits and straight-cut dresses.\n\nTrend forecaster Lizzy Bowring describes this as an \"'intentional recalibration' — blending comfort with sharper silhouettes, structured tailoring and more deliberate styling.\"\n\nThe jacket you once wore over a T-shirt to look smarter for a Zoom meeting is now shifting to a more tailored look, said Bowring. Think oversized blazers and fitted dresses.\n\nFashion's messaging is reflecting this. There's a focus on tailoring and silhouette-forming pieces across luxury brands like Prada, Saint Laurent, and Bottega Veneta, she said.\n\nEconomic uncertainty has also revived interest in investment dressing: wardrobe staples that work in the office and beyond, cut with precision and built to last.\n\nBrands like The Row and Toteme have gained cultural relevance by positioning their pieces as investments, reinforcing the appeal of clothing \"that communicates stability, longevity and professional credibility,\" Bowring added.\n\nTikTok content about what to wear to the office and why it matters has also grown in popularity.\n\nYounger members of Gen Z, entering office settings for the first time, are questioning how to balance their personal style with work-appropriate attire.\n\nGrace McCarrick, a content creator who delivers soft skills training to companies such as Uber and Spotify, said her TikTok videos on being intentional with your appearance at work have been some of her most viral — garnering hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nThe cheat no one is telling you about- you don’t have to look super polished if you look rich. In the north east, the look tends to be a bit dull lol but do what feels right for you\n\n\"It is so complicated to move up and get noticed in the workforce today,\" she said. The idea of 'dressing for success' is one of the only levers you can control to help you progress at work, she added.\n\n\"People who put in the effort stand out like neon signs. They've upped their charisma factor by simply not being as schlubby as everyone else. They could be the most awkward person, but because they look good in a sea of wrinkled khakis with black sneaker 'dress shoes,' they're magnetic,\" she said.\n\nFormal dress is also a way for employees to clearly distinguish between work and home life.\n\n\"Work wear cues a performance state, whereas home wear signals a relaxation state,\" Hajo Adam, an organizational psychologist and professor at the University of Bath, told Business Insider.\n\nThis separation might help people to actually switch off when work finishes.\n\nSo, once the clock strikes 5 p.m. — go ahead, loosen up, and hang up your blazer, whether your desk is in the office or in your living room.",

Should we eliminate preferential treatment of capital gains tax and equalize to ordinary income?\"\n\nKhosla — who cofounded Sun Microsystems and made the first VC investment in OpenAI — was making the point that AI replacing labor on a grand scale might warrant greater taxes on assets such as stocks and real estate.\n\nThe veteran financier, who founded Khosla Ventures after leaving Kleiner Perkins, attached a video highlighting some of the jobs that could be taken by AI, from accountants and therapists to truck drivers and chip designers.\n\nAI will transform economies and need a rethink of capitalism & equity.

Should we eliminate preferential treatment of capital gains tax and equalize to ordinary income? 40% of capital gains taxes are paid by those with… pic.twitter.com/7oSA9xj5Ko\n\nKhosla said in a follow-up post that ramping up taxes on capital would generate so much revenue that the government could scrap taxes for most of the roughly 150 million US taxpayers.\n\n\"Could easily eliminate bottom 125 million taxpayers from the tax rolls and be revenue neutral at the same time with a capital gains tax equal to ordinary income and a few other tweaks,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added that tax breaks such as carrying over tax losses and tax-free borrowing against unrealized gains — which he called a \"true abuse!\" — are \"special interest goodies inserted by lobbyists and campaign contributions, not true capitalism.\"\n\nKhosla didn't address common critiques of higher taxes, including that they can discourage entrepreneurship and investment, that collecting them can be tricky, and that wealthy people may leave the country to avoid them.\n\nKhosla has previously underscored that the advent of AI may require sweeping policy changes. He estimated in late 2024 that in 25 years' time, AI could be doing 80% of the work in 80% of all jobs, and universal basic income might be needed to compensate for job destruction.\n\n\"As AI reduces the need for human labor, UBI could become crucial, with governments playing a key role in regulating AI's impact and ensuring equitable wealth distribution,\" he wrote on his firm's website.\n\nKhosla isn't alone in predicting AI will change the fabric of society. Elon Musk suggested late last year that work could become \"optional\" and money might become \"irrelevant\" if advances in AI and robotics generate abundant resources for all.\n\nMoreover, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO recently said that retirement savings may not be needed in 10 or 20 years, as everyone might have \"whatever stuff they want.\"\n\nHowever, skeptics such as Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame have cautioned the AI boom is a speculative bubble, tech companies are overinvesting in microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, and true AI is further away than many think.",

Or the employees who had started taking their shoes off in the office because, well, if you were going to be there for at least 12 hours a day, six days a week, wouldn’t you rather be wearing slippers?\n\n“If you go to a cafe on a Sunday, everyone is working,” says Sanju Lokuhitige, the co-founder of Mythril, a pre-seed-stage AI startup, who moved to San Francisco in November to be closer to the action. Lokuhitige says he works seven days a week, 12 hours a day, minus a few carefully selected social events each week where he can network with other people at startups. “Sometimes I’m coding the whole day,” he says. “I do not have work-life balance.”\n\nAnother startup employee, who came to San Francisco to work for an early-stage AI company, showed me dismal photos from his office: a two-bedroom apartment in the Dogpatch, a neighborhood popular with tech workers. His startup’s founders live and work in this apartment – from 9am until as late as 3am, breaking only to DoorDash meals or to sleep, and leaving the building only to take cigarette breaks. The employee (who asked not to use his name, since he still works for this company) described the situation as “horrendous”. “I’d heard about 996, but these guys don’t even do 996,” he says. “They’re working 16-hour days.”\n\nStartups have never been particularly glamorous. When I started reporting on the industry a decade ago, people were cashing in on the new mobile app economy, and coders were chugging Soylent to stay at their desks longer. Startups then, too, were defined by hustle culture, high-octane energy and the pursuit of growth at all costs – ideas that, to some extent, have remained in the bloodstream of the industry.\n\nBut in the last year, as the magic dust of artificial intelligence has settled in San Francisco, the vibe among tech workers does seem different. The excitement about a new epoch in tech – and all the money that comes with it – is now tempered with anxieties about the industry, and the economy. Some workers are going all in on AI while also questioning whether all that AI is good for the world. Others are effectively training machines to do their jobs better than they can. And many of the same workers who are racing to build the future are now wondering if the future they’re building has a place for them in it.\n\nThe rest of us may be ambiently aware of these anxieties, but they are already tangible and keenly felt inside the tech industry. Even the biggest tech companies, once known for coddling employees with on-site massages and barber shops, have scaled back perks as they have escalated the expectations of workers. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have each been candid about their predictions that AI will replace some junior and mid-level engineers at their companies, and have respectively called for their workforces to be more “efficient” and “extremely hard core” as waves of layoffs set employees on-edge. Tech companies laid off about a quarter of a million workers around the world in 2025, according to a report published by RationalFX. In many of those layoffs, AI was cited as a main factor, even if the full reason for layoffs is often more complex.\n\n“If you were a software engineer five years ago, you could kind of write your ticket,” says Mike Robbins, an executive coach who has worked with companies like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Airbnb. Now, the balance of power has shifted away from tech workers, many of whom are left feeling anxious about their work performance. “When companies become less scared about losing employees, then they can be a little more forthright in terms of what they want and be a little more demanding.”\n\nRobbins, who wrote the book Bring Your Whole Self to Work, used to be asked to speak to companies and their leaders about topics like employee burnout, wellbeing and belonging – top priorities in the years during and shortly after the pandemic. “Quite frankly, we’ve stopped talking about all that,” he says. Now, company leaders want advice on topics like change, disruption and uncertainty in the workplace.\n\nThose themes – change, disruption and uncertainty – are each part of the fuel that has driven tech workers to put in more hours, at a higher intensity. Investment in artificial intelligence companies reached record highs in 2025, yet workers are feeling scarcity in ways they haven’t before.\n\n“It’s definitely something that’s on everyone’s mind,” says Kyle Finken, a software engineer at Mintlify, which makes an AI tool for developers. “I think a lot of people are concerned like, ‘Oh, am I going to have a job in three years?’”\n\nDespite his fears, Finken, like many other startup employees I spoke to, feels energized by the “extraordinary innovation” happening in artificial intelligence and believes that there will still be plenty of jobs for software engineers in the future, even if those jobs look different from the pure coding roles of today. He and other tech workers characterized the current moment as a particularly creative and productive time in tech, where people are devoting extra hours to work not because their employers demand it but out of genuine interest in the new tools and capabilities. For example, Garry Tan, the head of the famous startup accelerator Y Combinator, recently bragged that he “stayed up 19 hours” playing around with Claude Code.\n\nEven those who felt excited about the pace of change acknowledged that AI was rapidly augmenting their work, in ways that could have uncertain outcomes for the jobs of the future. “This is definitely not an era of complacency,” says Finken.\n\nOne reason for working so many hours is to keep up with tools and technology that are changing nearly every day. If you take the weekend off, you can miss a major development, which makes it harder to keep up with what competitors are doing. Another reason is to have something to show future employers, especially as more junior-level jobs are replaced by AI.\n\n“No one hires junior developers any more,” says Lokuhitige, the Mythril co-founder. Landing a job now requires “doing something cool”, he says, like building a new product or solving a problem that gets recognized as useful by larger companies. Job postings for entry-level tech jobs have dropped by a third since 2022, according to Indeed’s Hiring Lab, while job postings requiring at least five years of experience have risen. If you’re not grinding at a startup, you’re missing the prerequisite to get hired in the future.\n\nWhile economists are torn about whether AI will replace most jobs or just change them, they seem aligned in the idea that AI has already reshaped a great deal of entry-level work and will continue to do so. A paper published by Stanford researchers in November found “substantial declines in employment for early-career workers” in industries exposed to AI and suggested that areas where change is already occurring could be like a “canary in the coalmine” for the rest of the economy. The Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei, has suggested AI could eliminate about half of all entry-level jobs in white-collar industries within the next five years.\n\nThe head of the International Monetary Fund recently predicted that 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence, “like a tsunami hitting the labour market”. In San Francisco, you can already see the early signs, as Uber drivers compete with self-driving Waymos, and baristas are replaced by robotic coffee bars. Professional business services that support the tech industry have also been negatively affected by the layoffs. The pressure to grind in the tech world could be an early signal – a harbinger for what many other industries will feel soon.\n\nRobbins, the executive coach, says that companies once looked to Silicon Valley as a model of how they should operate, down to emulating policies like unlimited vacation days or adopting perks like free lunch in the office.\n\n“There was an idealization of tech and Silicon Valley for a long time across the business world. Some of that has changed,” he says. “Now, people aren’t asking me to tell them what’s going on in the Valley so that they can adopt it, the same way they were a decade ago.”\n\nRather than a model of how we should all work, the tech industry may be a premonition for the anxiety and attempts to compensate that are coming for all of us.",

    "description": "I took two Amtrak trains to get from New York to Austin. Here are unexpected things about traveling across the country in coach for over two days.",
    "fullText": "Local train rides can be slow and clunky, so I prefer long-distance ones — you can largely sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey because the stops are much farther apart.\n\nThe ride was smooth and enjoyable, and I watched the country pass by right outside my window, as if I were watching TV or a movie.\n\nSometimes I was so distracted by a conversation with someone else on board that I forgot we were moving.\n\nLong-distance trains are great when they run properly, but delays can be tough to avoid.\n\nAmtrak mostly operates on freight railroad lines, which means you're often at the mercy of those dispatchers.\n\nTo make matters worse, some lines run on a single track. So if there's an oncoming train, you have to wait on a track siding until it clears.\n\nFreight trains can cause anywhere from 10 minutes to multiple hours of interference.\n\nThese delays — which came every hour or so on my trip — interrupted the joy and relaxation that came with the otherwise smooth ride.\n\nSometimes passengers didn't receive announcements about delays, or only got vague ones. I wish I'd brought a radio scanner that picked up on the frequencies used by the dispatchers so I could stay up to date on the information or estimate the delay time myself.\n\nI brought enough of my own food for my two and a half days on the rails, and my short layover in Chicago gave me a chance to grab a hot meal.\n\nI also packed a reusable bottle so I could fill it up with tap water on the train. However, I was surprised by how many people depended on Amtrak's onboard dining options.\n\nThe café car is OK in a pinch: It has basic snacks, beverages, and hot foods like burgers and pizza.\n\nThe prices aren't unreasonable, but I still don't think they're worth it for food that generally gets taken out of a plastic wrapper and microwaved.\n\nEvery so often, the train made an extended stop at a station for a crew change or servicing, and passengers were allowed to step off for a bit.\n\nThere's no smoking on the trains, so I noticed a fair number of people using these stops as smoke breaks.\n\nHowever, I expected more people to take the opportunity to get some fresh air and stretch, rather than stay on the train.\n\nThere were only so many of these opportunities, and it was great to walk around, feel some sun on my face, and say that I set foot in a different place, instead of just passing through it.\n\nMy trip took me through more than a dozen states, including six state capitals and the US capital.\n\nThe trip from New York to Washington, DC, started out on tracks that were part of the historical Pennsylvania Railroad and continued down one of the busiest rail corridors in the country.\n\nThe bulk of my Cardinal-line trip went along old Chesapeake and Ohio Railway tracks. There was a lot of interesting history to learn about the railroad towns that sprang up along the tracks when they were first laid.\n\nMy trip through Virginia took me across tracks that played a vital role in the Civil War. The train also traveled through old boom-and-bust towns in West Virginia — some of which still exist, but others have only scant remnants.\n\nThe Texas Eagle is one of the few Amtrak trains that doesn't have WiFi, and some areas we passed through had little-to-no cell reception.\n\nThe Cardinal line also passed through areas with poor cell reception, which made the onboard WiFi quite unstable.\n\nFor this reason, I'm glad I brought an AM/FM HD radio with me. I had a lot of fun tuning in to different stations as my trains traveled the country.\n\nIt helped me feel more connected to the small towns and gave them more life. I found surprisingly good content in some remote areas.\n\nI came prepared for my train ride by downloading a bunch of TV shows and movies onto my laptop. However, surprisingly, the 60 hours went by so quickly that I didn't watch any of them.\n\nI only kept my laptop open on the Cardinal line to look at Amtrak's \"Track Your Train\" map.\n\nI was also having too much fun with the radio and didn't want to miss out on live broadcasts. Plus, I could continue fully taking in the sights out the window while listening.\n\nThe train was a very social place at times, too, so I was often busy speaking with the people around me.\n\nThe camaraderie I've experienced on Amtrak train rides is pretty much unmatched.\n\nI didn't get to talk with as many people as I have on past trips, but it was still enjoyable to journey together with a bunch of people for such an extended time.\n\nIt was great to see others get off at their destinations, but, in a funny way, it also made me a little sad to see them (and the ways they contributed to the train's atmosphere) go.\n\nGetting to spend time with fellow passengers from all over the world while different parts of the country passed by provided some true slices of American life.\n\nIt's great to switch things up by sitting and socializing in the café cars.\n\nHowever, the Cardinal and Texas Eagle trains have combined café and dining cars, so seating was very limited and only for passengers who purchased something.\n\nI missed hanging out in observation cars, as I've done on past trips.\n\nI knew this would be the case for my time on the Cardinal, but the Texas Eagle usually has an awesome sightseeing lounge with a variety of seating and viewing windows.\n\nThe fact that my train didn't have one was by far the biggest disappointment of the trip. However, the Eagle has since brought back its observation cars.\n\nIt's definitely worth checking whether your train has an observation car before booking a long Amtrak ride.\n\nWhen you spend enough time somewhere, it can start to feel very familiar and comfortable, which was my case on the train.\n\nDoing things like making room while walking in the aisle so someone else can pass, heading down the stairs to the bathroom, and refilling water bottles felt as routine as anything I'd do at home.\n\nThere was almost a weird comfort in walking around and seeing different parts of the train that became very familiar to me during my many hours aboard.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 9, 2021, and most recently updated on February 17, 2025.",

    "title": "I spent 26 hours in Qatar Airways' business class. Not all seats are created equally, but I get why it's so beloved.",
    "description": "I flew 26 hours in Qatar Airways business class on different flights. The lie-flat seats, food, and amenities were good, but there were drawbacks.",
    "fullText": "I'm not someone who travels in business class regularly, but for our honeymoon, my husband and I wanted to treat ourselves.\n\nSince we chose the more affordable destination of Vietnam and went for 10 nights rather than two weeks, we had more budget to splurge on traveling in style.\n\nSo, we booked business-class flights from London to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha with Qatar Airways. Sure, the flights cost more than our actual honeymoon — they would've been around $10,000 before credit-card points — but we don't regret it.\n\nI now completely understand why the World Airline Awards have highlighted Qatar Airways as having the best business class in the world for multiple years in a row.\n\nThough we didn't have Q Suites, the business-class configuration on our first flight was still suite-style, in a 1-2-1 layout.\n\nThe suites felt modern and well-maintained. Later on in the flight, an attendant pulled a door across the side opening, which made it feel really private.\n\nEach business-class seat came with a cushion, a pillow, a plush blanket, a refreshing towelette, and a Diptyque toiletry bag.\n\nThe bag contained socks, an eye mask, earplugs, body lotion, face cream, perfume, and lip balm. There were also complimentary toothbrushes, shaving kits, and face sprays available to use in the restrooms.\n\nNot long after sitting down, we were greeted by the friendly staff and offered a drink. I opted for Champagne and was also brought a candy cane, which was a nice seasonal touch as we flew at the end of December.\n\nEach suite had a decent amount of storage and space — I'm 5'9\" and had ample legroom. The buttons by the sides of the seats made it easy to recline and adjust the leg rest.\n\nI also had a wireless charging phone holder; a cupboard containing a mirror, headphones, and a water bottle; and a stylish lamp.\n\nAs I browsed the movies, perused the food menu, and sipped my Champagne, I felt relaxed and excited. This was nothing like traveling in coach.\n\nDuring the six-hour flight, we were served one main meal that we could request whenever we wanted. (We could request a second meal, I later learned, though I didn't need it.)\n\nAs business-class travelers, we also had access to a basket of snacks, including popcorn and cereal bars, that we could help ourselves to at any time.\n\nPlus, we could order a range of wines, spirits, cocktails, and soft drinks whenever we wanted.\n\nBefore my meal began, I enjoyed more Champagne, served with crisps and nuts.\n\nAll the crockery and glassware felt elegant and sturdy — a far cry from foil containers and plastic cups.\n\nWhen it was time for the main meal, the staff pulled out my table, laid down a white tablecloth, then placed a (fake) candle and cutlery on top of it.\n\nFirst, I was brought a bread basket with butter, olive oil, and mini salt and pepper shakers. The butter was the perfect temperature for spreading, and the three types of bread were warm.\n\nI was then given a tasty mozzarella amuse-bouche.\n\nFor my starter, I had the Qatari mezze — pesto hummus, labneh tahini, and avocado muhammara — with pita bread. It was delicious and a sizable portion.\n\nFor the main course, I chose the grilled beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes, broccoli, asparagus, and parsley sauce. It was really good.\n\nI skipped the cheese course and opted for the fruit plate for dessert. We were offered chocolates, too.\n\nAfter dinner, I had a cup of tea and reclined to watch a film.\n\nThis first flight was in the daytime, so I didn't take as much advantage of having lie-flat seats.\n\nThe second was overnight, which is when I really appreciated my ability to lie down. The suite set-up felt nice and private, too.\n\nMy only qualm was that the space for my feet felt quite narrow and a bit constrictive. It wasn't a huge issue, though, and I still got some sleep.\n\nWe had a brief stopover in Doha on both our journeys, and I was impressed by how modern, clean, and slick the airport felt.\n\nWith our tickets, we had access to the Al Mourjan Business Lounge and its lounge overlooking the airport garden. We tried one on the way there and the other on the way back.\n\nThe lounges were beautiful, and we got complimentary delicious food and Champagne. I actually wish we'd had longer layovers to take advantage of the lounge's gym, spa, showers, and sleep rooms.\n\nFor the second leg of our journey to Vietnam, we were on an older plane. The business-class seats weren't suites; they were in a 2-2-2 layout.\n\nWe still had lots of legroom, but this flight didn't feel as chic — it had fewer modern touches, and I missed the wireless phone charger I enjoyed on the first one.\n\nSince this was a nighttime flight, Qatar Airways provided business-class passengers with pajamas and slippers to keep. I really enjoyed this extra touch.\n\nThe staff also arranged my seat into a bed with a mattress topper and pillow, which was lovely. I normally never sleep on planes, but I got a couple of hours on each flight.\n\nI actually preferred the older business-class seat for sleeping since my feet weren't as restricted at the end.\n\nThese two round-trip flights for two people should've cost about $10,000, which is undoubtedly a lot of money.\n\nWe'd been saving our credit-card points for a long time, so we were able to take a lot of money off that price, but this was still a splurge.\n\nEven though these tickets cost a lot, they felt worth it. Flying business class made the journeys really special — something to look forward to and enjoy, not just a way of getting from A to B.\n\nSure, this experience might make going back to economy a bit painful, but I'm so glad to have done it. I would definitely fly business class again for a special occasion or if I had a lot of points.",

    "fullText": "These flies aren't like their relatives that feed on dead and decaying animals. No, the flesh-eating maggots of these parasitic insects prefer to feed on live animals like cattle, horses and pigs, and they can be fatal.\n\nAnother case of New World screwworm was recently stopped from entering the United States at a quarantine facility in Florida.\n\nAnd humans are not immune. One traveler returned to the United States from Central America last summer carrying the parasite.\n\nThe maggots enter through open wounds and mucous membranes. They burrow, or screw, into an animal's flesh using \"sharp mouth hooks,\" according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. That's how the New World screwworm got its name.\n\nIs the New World screwworm in the United States? How close is it to Ohio? Here's what to know.\n\n'Critical threat' to U.S. agriculture: How USDA preparing for New World screwworm\n\nAccording to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, screwworm larvae were detected earlier this month on an imported horse from Argentina going through the routine and required exam at an approved United States Department of Agriculture import facility in South Florida.\n\nThere was no detection of NWS larvae outside of the quarantine facility. The affected horse was treated, and in an abundance of caution, the agency said in a statement that all cohort horses at the facility were also examined and treated.\n\n“There is no detection of New World Screwworm in any Florida animal. The detection at the USDA import facility was handled professionally and per existing protocols to ensure the U.S. remains free of this devastating pest,\" Dr. Michael Short, state veterinarian, said in the statement.\n\nThe infected horse was to remain in quarantine until reexamined and found parasite-free.\n\nScrewworms in humans: Deadly cattle screwworm parasite found in U.S. patient. What to know\n\nThe insect was eradicated in the U.S. in the 1960s, in Mexico in the 1970s, and much of Central America by the early 2000s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA TODAY reported.\n\nHowever, the CDC said new cases were reported in October 2024 in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras. From there, it has spread north, sparking fears that the insects would spread north to the United States. Their movement has led the U.S. to block imports of live cattle, horses, and bison through southern border ports, USA TODAY reports.\n\nScienceAlert.com reported that in January 2026 there were 601 animal cases active across Mexico, with eight in Tamaulipas — a state that borders Texas.\n\nAccording to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the New World screwworm is not currently present in the U.S.\n\nThe closest it has come to Ohio is one human case in Maryland from a traveler returning from El Salvador in 2025.\n\nNWS flies are the size of a common housefly and lay eggs “on open wounds or other open parts of the body in live, warm-blooded animals,” according to the CDC. A wound as small as a tick bite can attract the flies.\n\nThe eggs hatch and the maggots burrow into the wound to feed on the living flesh, the CDC says. As you might expect, burrowing maggots in living creatures are highly painful.\n\nAfter they feed, the larvae fall to the ground and burrow into it. They later emerge as adult screwworm flies, the CDC says.\n\nNWS infestations are very painful, according to the USDA. If you have an infestation, you may see maggots around or in an open wound, or in your nose, eyes, or mouth. Symptoms can include:\n\nUnexplained skin lesions (wounds or sores) that do not heal.\n\nSkin wounds or sores that worsen over time.\n\nFeeling larvae movement within a skin wound or sore, nose, mouth, or eyes.\n\nSeeing maggots around or in open sores.\n\nA foul-smelling odor from the site of the infestation.\n\nThe USDA’s plan to prevent the spread of screwworm includes investments of up to $100 million for innovations to find new ways to combat the insect and $750 million to create a facility in south Texas to sterilize flies and combat the spread, USA TODAY reported in September 2025.\n\nReleasing sterile flies to disrupt the reproduction of screwworms was a technique used to eradicate the pest in the 1960s. The hope is that those sterile flies will then mate with wild ones, producing infertile eggs, experts said.\n\nAnother $21 million is being invested to renovate an existing fruit fly production facility in Metapa, Mexico, to produce more sterile flies.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Flesh-eating parasite targets US.

    "fullText": "I'm a major dessert person — you know, one of those people who looks at the dessert menu before deciding on my appetizer and entrée.\n\nThat's why, regardless of what I'm serving for dinner, the night always ends with decadence, namely, Joanna Gaines' chocolate-cola cake with chocolate-cola buttercream.\n\nIt's as scrumptious as it sounds and has become one of my go-to desserts for dinner parties and special occasions.\n\nGaines' recipe calls for 12 ingredients, including nonstick baking spray, all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, kosher salt, salted butter, natural unsweetened cocoa powder, cola, baking soda, buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract.\n\nThe salted butter, cocoa powder, and cola are also used to make the buttercream frosting, along with powdered sugar.\n\nOnce I have all the ingredients handy, I preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and spray a 10-inch round baking pan with nonstick spray.\n\nThen, I begin making the cake batter by adding all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, and salt to a large bowl and mixing thoroughly.\n\nFor the next step in the batter-making process, I add salted butter, cocoa powder, and cola to a small saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until it's completely smooth.\n\nThen, I pour the mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients and whisk until there are no lumps.\n\nIn another small bowl, I dissolve the baking soda in room-temperature buttermilk before pouring it into the existing batter.\n\nAfter whisking, I add the vanilla extract and eggs and whisk again until smooth.\n\nI add the finished batter to my baking pan, then place it in the oven to bake for 40 to 45 minutes.\n\nOnce it's done, I let the cake cool on a wire rack while I prepare the frosting.\n\nTo make the frosting, I use my stand mixer with the paddle attachment.\n\nAt medium speed, I beat the room-temperature butter until smooth. Next, I add cola and cocoa powder and mix on low until there are no lumps.\n\nThen, I scrape the bowl, add some powdered sugar, and mix on medium again before repeating the process with the remaining powdered sugar.\n\nThe last step is to gently spread the frosting over the cooled cake.\n\nThe cake itself is rich yet incredibly moist, thanks to the cola, while the buttercream frosting serves as the perfect creamy complement to the cake's consistency.\n\nWhen it comes to presentation, I always like to pull out a fun cake pedestal, because I think a dessert of this caliber deserves one. I also place fresh strawberries around the cake to add a bit of color to my dessert table, and it looks absolutely decadent.\n\nA small slice does the trick to satisfy any sweet-tooth cravings.",

    "description": "Jobs growth is decoupling from economic growth for the first time since the post-Great Financial Crisis era, Mohamed El-Erian said.",
    "fullText": "The job market isn't going to catch up with the rest of the US economy anytime soon.\n\nThat's according to top economist Mohamed El-Erian, who thinks there's an \"unusual\" pattern that's unfolding in the labor market. In an op-ed for the Financial Times over the weekend, the former PIMCO CEO pointed to how job additions in the US have lagged economic growth over the past year — a divergence that's only been seen a few other times in history, and typically during recessions.\n\nAfter accounting for revisions, 2025 represented one of the weakest years for hiring outside of recessions for the last two decades, El-Erian said. The number of nonfarm jobs rose an average 0.47% in 2025, the weakest average annual growth rate outside of a recession since 2003, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nYet, the US economy as a whole continues to show strength. GDP rose at a 4.3% yearly pace in the third quarter, and is expected to increase 3.7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to the latest estimate from Atlanta Fed economists.\n\nEl-Erian pointed to past instances of similar divergence across history: the 90s, the early 2000s, and the years that followed the onset of the Great Financial Crisis. Although he noted that, in those instances, the economy was in the early stages of recovering after a recession — earlier in the cycle than we are rightn ow.\n\n\"This trend is likely to prove more unsettling than prior episodes of 'jobless growth,'\" El-Erian wrote, pointing to several reasons he believed the divergence in jobs and economic growth would continue:\n\n\"This time around, it may well last longer because we are just at the start of the AI adoption process, with robotics just around the corner and quantum computing further behind,\" he added of the trend.\n\nThis period of economic decoupling could also bring on more pain, El-Erian suggested, pointing to existing concerns about affordability and wealth inequality in the US.\n\n\"Indeed, part of the challenge for 2026 is managing a lot better the economic, political and social risks of an economy that, without corporate and policy adjustments, may no longer need as many workers to grow,\" he added.\n\nMore forecasters have been eyeing the potential for a weaker labor market in 2026, particularly as AI starts to disrupt the business world.\n\nLast year, JPMorgan economists said they linked the rising jobless rate among recent college graduates to the growing excitement for AI, and flagged the risks for a \"jobless recovery\" in the US economy.\n\nGoldman Sachs also said it saw the potential for a period of \"jobless growth\" in the US, and previously estimated that AI could impact around 300 million full-time jobs around the world.",

He also noted that the stock has essentially been stuck between $165 and $200 per share since August of 2025, and will likely stay around there.\n\nHe added that, in his view, other chipmakers such as Sandisk and Micron have taken Nvidia's mantle and have substantially outpaced it since August. But Shannon still cautions investors, using Sandisk's bull run to illustrate the trend of companies surging before a correction.\n\n\"When a pullback comes, don't be surprised if its drops to $450 over a three of four day period because that's what these stocks do,\" he noted. \"This is a big volatile beast and a lot of people are going to get burned by it by chasing it up here.\"\n\nShannon's views echo those held by Noble himself, who has been an outspoken AI bear in the past.\n\nNow that he's looking past the AI trade, Shannon sees more opportunity in overlooked sectors that many investors don't seem to be focused on: energy and utilities.\n\n\"Everyones obsessed with the tech stocks that are breaking down and that fact that bitcoin has been having a lot of difficulty,\" he stated. \"But there are places out there to make money. The energy names have been on fire, now the utilities. Things are not as bad as people always say.\"\n\nBoth Shannon and Noble highlighted the State Street Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF as a great way to gain exposure to the booming energy sector. Shannon advised investors who aren't invested in the fund yet to wait for a pullback but noted that he sees significant growth ahead for it.",

    "fullText": "Ford is taking a leaf out of Tesla's book for its upcoming affordable EV truck.\n\nThe Detroit automaker on Tuesday showed off some of the engineering advances behind its new $30,000 electric pickup, which launches in 2027.\n\nIn addition to improved aerodynamics and a new battery system, Ford said its new EV production line would deploy unicasting for the first time. It's a process that uses giant hydraulic presses to shape molten aluminium into large pieces of the vehicle frame, reducing the number of parts and allowing different sections of the vehicle to be assembled separately.\n\nTesla famously pioneered this technique, which is also known as \"gigacasting.\" Alan Clarke, a former Tesla executive poached by Ford in 2022 to develop its next-generation EVs, said adopting unicasting would allow Ford to build electric vehicles that are lighter than the competition, including Tesla's Model Y.\n\n\"We think that compared to the best one on the market today, we're something like 27% lighter,\" Clarke told reporters in a Q&A on Thursday.\n\nFord said that the unicasting approach means that its new electric pickup truck would use just two body parts in its front and rear structure, compared to 147 on Ford's Maverick pickup.\n\nTesla has been using large-scale aluminium castings on its production lines since 2020. A number of other automakers, including Toyota and Volvo, have since adopted the technique. In 2023, Reuters reported that Ford had purchased a giant \"gigapress\" for R&D purposes from the same Italian supplier used by Tesla.\n\nClark said that Ford's engineers had \"obsessed\" over cutting down on weight to increase its range.\n\n\"We know that many customers expect more than 300 miles of range, and the solution up until now has been to install bigger, more expensive batteries,\" he said.\n\n\"This increases the weight, and that requires even more energy to move around,\" Clarke added.\n\nFord's $30,000 electric truck will instead rely on weight reductions and improved aerodynamics to boost range, Clarke said, with the team working on the electric truck stacked full of ex-Formula 1 aerodynamic engineers.\n\nThe company has also turned to a new battery based on Lithium Iron-Phosphate chemistry, which is popular with Chinese EV makers. The battery will be built in Michigan with technology licensed from a China-based firm, CATL.\n\nFord plans to use the same unicast system for its upcoming lineup of electric vehicles. The company is planning to build at least five vehicles on the new EV platform, potentially including SUVs and commercial vans.\n\nFord has not yet shared the price or range of its electric pickup, which the company began developing in a separate \"skunkworks\" team based in California in 2022.\n\nThe company's EVs have, in the past, lagged behind the competition on weight and efficiency. CEO Jim Farley said in a November podcast interview that when Ford took apart Tesla's Model 3 for the first time, the company realized its Mustang Mach-E model had about 1 mile more electrical wiring than its rival, making it far heavier.\n\nFord largely abandoned its efforts to break Tesla's dominance with a lineup of large, expensive EVs in December, after the end of the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles in the US sparked a major slowdown in demand. The company took a nearly $20 billion EV-related charge as it shifted production toward hybrid vehicles, and scrapped the all-electric version of its F-150 Lightning pickup.\n\nInstead, Ford is betting on smaller, more affordable EVs like the upcoming $30,000 pickup, which Farley has described as the automaker's modern-day \"Model T moment,\" a nod to the company's early 1900s car that revolutionized the automotive industry.\n\nIn its earnings last week, Ford reported that its EV division lost $4.8 billion in 2025, with another $4 billion to $5 billion in losses expected this year.",

    "fullText": "Expect to see your local Starbucks soon be full of middle-aged former office workers, says Andrew Yang.\n\nThe Forward Party founder and former presidential candidate said AI \"will kick millions of white-collar workers to the curb in the next 12 - 18 months\" in a post on his Substack on Monday.\n\nYang said that, when a company begins to shrink its workforce, its competitors will follow suit.\n\n\"It will become a competition because the stock market will reward you if you cut headcount and punish you if you don't,\" he added.\n\nYang has long warned about the impact of automation on jobs — he had previously told The New York Times in 2018 that he predicted self-driving cars would displace truck drivers, a shift that could \"destabilize society\" and provoke \"riots in the street.\"\n\nIn his Substack post, Yang then laid out which workers could be vulnerable: mid-career office workers, middle managers, call center workers, marketers, and coders. The list goes on.\n\n\"Do you sit at a desk and look at a computer much of the day? Take this very seriously,\" he wrote. \"Millions of workers are about to be given their pink slips.\"\n\nYang did not respond to a request for further comment.\n\nThis January saw more layoffs than any January since 2009. Though this has largely been attributed to economic uncertainty, a few companies have already begun citing AI as a reason they are letting staff go.\n\nPinterest said in January that it expects to lay off 15% of its workforce. A spokesperson for Pinterest said the restructuring was part of the company's \"AI-forward strategy.\"\n\nHP said in November that it would cut up to 6,000 jobs by 2028, citing AI initiatives as the reason.\n\nCritics have also said some companies are using AI as a scapegoat for job cuts.\n\nTech CEOs and AI researchers are divided over how AI will impact society. While Tesla and xAI CEO Elon Musk and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predict a future of great abundance for all, others, such as Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, say we should brace for significant white-collar layoffs.\n\nYang said the impact of his predicted layoffs will be felt beyond those who actually lose their jobs.\n\n\"Let's say you're a dry cleaner, a dog walker, or a hairstylist. If people in your community stop going to the office, your business is going to suffer because there are fewer business shirts to launder, people will walk their dogs themselves, and cut back on trips to the salon,\" he said.\n\n\"The amount of money getting paid to human labor is about to go down,\" Yang said.",

    "description": "Ørsted’s nests were built approximately 0.6 miles (one kilometer) off the shore.",
    "fullText": "Danish wind farm company Ørsted has built three massive artificial bird nests off the coast of the United Kingdom with contractor Red7Marine. The structures are intended to help support the populations of kittiwake, a seabird species that may be impacted by the company's nearby wind farm.\n\nØrsted's nests were built approximately 0.6 miles (one kilometer) off the shore of Suffolk on Great Britain's eastern coast. Each one is an octagonal structure designed to house about 500 individual nests, raised above sea level on a large pole, according to Electrek.\n\nThe interior of the building features a whiteboard, chairs, and tables for researchers to record information about their studies of the birds. Sliding Perspex panels let the researchers observe the nests without being seen by their occupants, according to Electrek.\n\nØrsted's massive Hornsea 3 project, which is expected to be completed by 2025, will have the capacity to power more than three million households, according to Electrek. As green energy projects break ground around the world, it's important that they do so in ways that are minimally damaging to local ecosystems.\n\nA 2013 study found that between 140,000 and 328,000 birds are killed by wind turbines every year in the United States. Human-made structures in general cause as many as one billion bird deaths per year, according to the United States Forest Service, but that doesn't mean the turbine casualties aren't significant.\n\nAny way that institutions and organizations can mitigate their impacts on local ecosystems is a positive step, and Ørsted was required to build structures that would help the local bird populations in order to have the Hornsea 3 project approved, according to Electrek.\n\n\"Kittiwake are listed as at risk from extinction and with climate change as a key driver to their decline, a move towards a green energy system could help considerably in the long-term conservation of the species,\" said Eleni Antoniou, Ørsted's environmental manager.\n\n\"In the meantime, the provision of these structures will provide a safe, nesting space to enable future generations to raise young away from predators and out of town centers,\" she concluded.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and cool tips that make it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump family company has filed to trademark the use of the president's name on airports but says it doesn't plan on charging a fee — at least for a proposed renaming of one near his Florida home.\n\nApplications filed by the Trump Organization with the federal trademark office are seeking exclusive rights to use the president's name on airports and dozens of related things found there, from buses shuttling passengers to umbrellas and travel bags to flight suits. The filings come amid debate in Florida over a state bill to name the Palm Beach airport after Trump and a dispute over funding of a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that is tied up with proposals that both it and the Dulles International Airport in Virginia bear his name.\n\nThe Trump Organization said that the applications were triggered by the Florida bill and that it didn't seek any profit — only protection against “bad actors” given that the Trump name is the “most infringed trademark in the world.”\n\n“To be clear, the President and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee, or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” the company said it in a statement, referring to what is now called the Palm Beach International Airport near Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nThe company didn't respond immediately when asked if it would charge royalties for the use of the name at other airports in the future, or on merchandise listed for protection in the filings.\n\nJosh Gerben, a trademark lawyer who uncovered the filings over the weekend, said the applications were the first of their kind he's ever seen.\n\n“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honor, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote on his blog. “I should be very clear: these are trademark filings that are completely unprecedented.”\n\nThe applications filed by a family company unit called DTTM Operations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are for the use of three names — President Donald J. Trump International Airport, Donald J. Trump International Airport and DJT.\n\nThe family has been on a branding spree in the past year, putting its name on towers, golf resorts and residential developments in Dubai, India, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. The company has also been selling Trump branded electric guitars, bibles and sneakers, ventures that also fall under the DTTM unit.\n\nIn response to criticism that he and his family are profiting off the presidency, Trump has said that his business is held in trust by his sons and that he has no day-to-day involvement in the company.",

    "fullText": "I'd been on the island for less than a week when I opened my glove box looking for sunglasses, only to find the wrapper of my emergency granola bar torn open and the corner nibbled, right next to a neat little pile of mouse droppings.\n\nAs I inspected the rest of the car, I was mortified to realize it was likely more than a single mouse. I texted the friend I was housesitting for in disbelief.\n\n\"Ugh, I'm sorry! That's so island,\" she wrote back.\n\nIf I were anywhere but this remote Pacific Northwest island — a $24 ferry ride away from the mainland — I would've hired someone else to handle it.\n\nInstead, I borrowed four old-fashioned snap traps from a neighbor, set each one myself, and disposed of the remains. Not exactly the relaxing island experience I envisioned, but someone had to do it.\n\nGrowing up in the Bay Area and later raising my kids in Seattle, I've always considered myself a city person.\n\nFrom working at a department store in downtown San Francisco as a teenager to partying with coworkers from around the world, I've always loved the culture, diversity, and convenience big cities provide. I love walking everywhere, taking public transit, and meeting friends for Sunday brunch.\n\nRural living has never felt like an option for me. That changed two years ago after a three-week house-sitting stay on this tiny island near the Canadian border.\n\nDespite having limited services, no street lights, and a population of just about 1,000 people, I've returned several times.\n\nNow I'm back for three months to see if remote island living could be a real long-term option rather than just a temporary escape.\n\nI still enjoy visiting the city, but island life has already altered the structure of my days in ways I didn't expect — fewer decisions to make, less interruptions, and long stretches of solitude (which I enjoy more than I anticipated).\n\nWithout constant noise and urgency culture, it's easier to notice when I lose focus or am in a flow state.\n\nI've tried new recipes, gone for long walks on the beach, and written uninterrupted for hours. I've also had more time to connect with friends and family by phone.\n\nLiving here, however, requires a level of planning city life doesn't.\n\nWhen I lived in Seattle, I could be at the grocery store in 10 minutes for a gallon of milk or that one missing ingredient I needed for dinner.\n\nHere, every off-island trip requires several hours, multiple shopping lists, ferry schedules, and the energy for numerous stops.\n\nForget something, and you'll just have to wait for it, or, if it's available, pay extra at the island's small market that carries an assortment of essential staples like dairy, coffee, some fresh produce, and baked goods.\n\nHowever, even careful planning has limits. Windstorms knock the power out, ferries go out of service without warning, or the dog steals a loaf of stollen and has to be rushed to the emergency room on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor some, these inconveniences are dealbreakers, but I see them as data points. In three months, I hope to move beyond the honeymoon phase and get a true feel for what it's like to live here.\n\nI'm still early in my experiment. Winter is slowly giving way to spring, and with it more light, things to do, and people returning to the island.\n\nI definitely plan to stay the full 90 days, and am grateful for the opportunity to be here for the shift in seasons before making my decision.

    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States plans to deploy more high-tech missile systems to the Philippines to help deter aggression in the South China Sea, where the treaty allies on Tuesday condemned what they called China’s “illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities.”\n\nBeijing has repeatedly expressed alarm over the installation in the northern Philippines of a U.S. mid-range missile system called the Typhon in 2024 and of an anti-ship missile launcher last year. It said the U.S. weapons were aimed at containing China’s rise and warned that these were a threat to regional stability.\n\nChina has asked the Philippines to withdraw the missile launchers from its territory, but officials led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have rejected the demand.\n\nU.S. and Philippine officials held annual talks Monday in Manila on broadening security, political and economic engagements and boosting collaboration with regional security allies.\n\nThe U.S. and the Philippines outlined in a joint statement Tuesday specific defense and security plans for this year, including joint military exercises, Washington's support to help modernize the Philippine military and efforts “to increase deployments of U.S. cutting-edge missile and unmanned systems to the Philippines.”\n\nThe longtime allies \"underscored their support for preserving freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and other lawful uses of the sea for all nations,” the statement said.\n\n“Both sides condemned China’s illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive activities in the South China Sea, recognizing their adverse effects on regional peace and stability and the economies of the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” it added.\n\nConfrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces have spiked in the disputed waters in recent years. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the territorial standoffs.\n\nNeither side elaborated on the planned missile deployments but Philippine ambassador to Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, who took part in Monday’s talks, said U.S. and Filipino defense officials discussed the possible deployment this year of “upgraded” types of U.S. missile launchers that the Philippines may eventually decide to purchase.\n\n“It’s a kind of system that’s really very sophisticated and will be deployed here in the hope that, down the road, we will be able to get our own,” Romualdez told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Typhon missile system that the U.S. Army deployed to the main northern Philippine region of Luzon in April 2024 and an anti-missile launcher called the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System that was deployed in April last year also to Luzon have remained in the Philippines, Romualdez said.\n\nDuring joint drills, U.S. forces have exhibited the missile systems to batches of Filipino forces to familiarize them with the weapons’ capabilities and usage, military officials said.\n\nRomualdez said the U.S. missile deployments to the Philippines did not aim to antagonize any country.\n\n“It’s purely for deterrence,” he said. “Every time the Chinese show any kind of aggression, it only strengthens our resolve to have these types.”\n\nThe Typhon missile launchers, a land-based weapon, can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range, from the northern Philippine region of Luzon.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Marines deployed the anti-ship missile launcher, the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, to Batan island in the northernmost Philippine province of Batanes, which faces the Bashi Channel just south of Taiwan.\n\nThe sea passage is a critical trade and military route that the U.S. and Chinese militaries have tried to gain strategic control of.",

    "title": "Armed with longer-range missiles, a top Russian fighter jet is posing a bigger threat, analyst says",
    "description": "Russia is regularly equipping one of its key fighter jets, its Su-35s, with a longer-range missile, extending its reach against distant targets.",
    "fullText": "Russia's Su-35 fighter jets are increasingly flying with longer-range air-to-air missiles that make them a potentially greater threat to NATO air operations, a leading airpower expert assessed in a recent report.\n\nJustin Bronk, a researcher at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute, said in his assessment of Russian air power that regularly arming Su-35 and Su-30SM2 jets with R-37M missiles \"has significantly contributed to increasing the threat that they can theoretically pose to NATO air operations.\"\n\nThe R-37M missile, which NATO calls the RS-AA-13, is \"much more capable at long range\" than the R-77-1 missiles the Su-35 had previously relied on, Bronk told Business Insider in a discussion of his recent report.\n\nR-77-1 missiles have a range of about 62 miles, while R-37M missiles are understood to have a range of around 200 miles. Real-world kills at range depend on a mix of factors, but reach still matters.\n\nBronk told Business Insider that the longer-range R-37M missiles had been \"very much a specialist weapon\" for a limited selection of Russian jets. But \"now you see absolutely routine employment\" of the weapon on Russia's Su-35S.\n\nThe Su-35 fighter is \"the primary air superiority aircraft for the Russians,\" he added. The jet is key for Russia's air force, with the UK Ministry of Defence in 2023 describing it as Russia's \"most advanced combat jet in widespread service.\"\n\nBronk told Business Insider that for the NATO alliance, the regular arming of Su-35s and Su-30SM2s with the R-37M is \"a problem\" because it puts \"more credible long-range air-to-air missiles at play from the Russian side.\"\n\nThose missiles used to be contained within a smaller part of the force, mainly Russia's MiG-31s. Now, Bronk said, having them on more jets \"is obviously a significant growth in the potential threat that they can pose to NATO aircraft in a direct conflict.\"\n\nAdditionally, he said, Russia's Su-35 crews are \"generally more highly selected, better trained, more capable than the crews on the MiG-31s.\" Russia's better pilots tend to fly its top jets, and those will be the pilots operating these missiles.\n\nHaving them routinely carry long-range air-to-air missiles, rather than the \"really pretty limited\" R77-1 that they used to carry, Bronk said, \"is a significant shift.\"\n\nThe R-37M's combat effectiveness has been spotlighted by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022.\n\nLate that year, a RUSI report said the R-37M, combined with Russia's MiG-31BM interceptor aircraft, was proving to be \"highly effective and difficult for Ukrainian pilots to evade due to its speed, very long range, and specialized seeker for low-altitude targets.\"\n\nAt that time, it said Russia was just starting to put them on Su-35S jets.\n\nA newer report from RUSI in November highlighted how much more the R-37M missile was being used, saying that this missile \"in particular, has been used to destroy several Ukrainian aircraft at long range,\" including one kill recorded at more than 109 miles.\n\n\"This is significantly beyond the engagement range of most NATO air-to-air munitions,\" the report said. But it also said that the missiles' success was \"heavily determined by Ukraine's lack of effective radar warning receivers,\" something NATO has fielded far more robustly across its air forces.\n\nMaking the Su-35 more powerful is a big move for Russia. In 2022, analysts at the RAND Corporation described the Su-35 as Russia's \"signature heavy fighter.\"\n\nUkraine has shot down multiple Su-35s in its fight against Russia's invasion, but Bronk said that despite reported losses, the fleet has \"marginally increased since the start of the full-scale war.\"\n\nHe estimated that in late 2020, Russia had about 90 Su-35s. Between eight and 10 have been lost in combat or accidents, he said, but 55 to 60 new aircraft have since been delivered — leaving Russia with roughly 135 to 140 Su-35s overall, a net increase despite the attrition.\n\nBronk's analysis was based on interviews with Western air forces and ministries, data from Ukraine's armed forces, and open-source information.\n\nHe said that the Russian air force has gained so much valuable combat experience against Ukraine that its air force is now \"a significantly more capable potential threat for Western air forces than it was in 2022.\"\n\nHe said that in air-to-air combat, where Russian aircraft take on Western ones, the West still has a strong advantage, but longer-range air-to-air missiles complicate the picture.\n\nAnd any fight would not only be in the air. The West would face not only Russia's air force but also its vast ground-based air defense network, which the war has also made more formidable.\n\nBronk told Business Insider that Su-35 crews are typically \"much better at working with the ground-based air defenses,\" meaning the jets can operate more effectively under the umbrella of Russian surface-to-air missile systems and are therefore \"more credible as an air-to-air threat.\"\n\nHe said that the improvement of those ground-based defenses throughout the war — combined with the fielding of more powerful missiles on Su-35s that are increasingly integrated with them — is one reason why Russian airpower \"represents a greater threat to Western air power capabilities in Europe\" than it did before the full-scale invasion.",

    "description": "Al Baik is often compared to Chick-fil-A, not because the menus match, but because the fan following does.",
    "fullText": "For many people in Saudi Arabia, Al Baik isn't just a fast-food chain — it's a pilgrimage stop.\n\nThe brand began in Jeddah in 1974, when Shakour Abu Ghazalah — a Palestinian entrepreneur who arrived in Saudi Arabia as a refugee — set out to serve affordable, freshly made meals quickly.\n\nOver time, Al Baik became known for its pressure-fried \"broast\" chicken, an 18-spice-blend marinade developed by Ghazalah's sons, and a garlic sauce that's as famous in Saudi Arabia as Chick-fil-A's sauce is in the US.\n\nDespite its popularity, the fast-food chain stayed almost entirely within western Saudi Arabia for a long time. That limited presence turned it into a destination. Travelers planned their stops around it, pilgrims queued for hours during Hajj, and boxes of chicken were often carried back as carry-ons when leaving Mecca and Medina.\n\nThis scarcity also led to imitation restaurants and created a strange side economy.\n\nIn parts of Southeast Asia, restaurants began copying Al Baik's logos, packaging, and using the word \"broast\" to sell chicken, often suggesting a link to the Saudi original. Closer to home, some Saudis turned the craze into business road trips by loading their car trunks with Al Baik, driving hours to cities without a branch, selling those meals from their cars, and using the return trip to ferry paying passengers back.\n\nThe brand's first international shop opened in 2020 in Bahrain. A year later, it arrived in the UAE, opening a branch at Dubai Mall at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite restrictions, lines spilled out of the food court for months, and the restaurant initially limited its menu to just a few items to keep up with demand. Today, the chain has over 180 locations across the Middle East alone.\n\nThe appeal was simple: fast service, dependable quality, and prices almost everyone could afford.\n\nThe loyalty Al Baik inspires is often compared to Chick-fil-A, not because the menus match, but because the fan following does. Both fast-food chains built their reputations on fried chicken, distinctive sauces, and deliberate expansion. Chick-fil-A is much bigger, with more than 3,000 locations, yet it has no presence in the Middle East.\n\nOn a recent visit to the mall food court, I tried three popular items from Al Baik's menu to see whether they lived up to the hype.\n\nI'd only had Al Baik once before, back in 2021, when the brand first opened in Dubai Mall, and the hype was so intense that the outlet was serving just a few items to keep up with demand. I'd tried the nuggets and fried shrimp then, along with sweet corn and the famous garlic sauce. But I did not remember much from my experience.\n\nThis time, I found the branch in a corner of the food court, smaller than its Dubai Mall counterpart, but impossible to miss because of the barricades set up to manage the line and the people spilling past them.\n\nMost people ahead of me weren't looking up at the menu boards. They already knew what they were ordering.\n\nThere were no self-order screens, as is common at most other fast-food chains in Dubai. Everyone waited for their turn to reach the counter, where a staff member took orders one by one.\n\nThe crowd queuing up with me was a mix of mall employees finishing their shifts, families, teenagers, and tourists. Despite the slow pace, no one seemed restless.\n\nFor a place known for fast food, the line seemed to move far too slowly, and yet everyone seemed perfectly fine with that.\n\nFrom shrimp sandwiches and fish burgers to fried chicken meals and double baik — a double-patty chicken sandwich — there are over 30 menu items and combos to choose from.\n\nI toyed with the idea of a fish burger and fried chicken combo, but settled on some of the most popular items on the menu, as suggested by the employee taking my order.\n\nI had to wait about 20 minutes after I'd placed my order to receive my full meal, which I thought was quite a long wait for a fast-food chain.\n\nI started with Al Baik's four-piece spicy chicken meal, priced at 23 United Arab Emirates dirham (AED), or $6.26.\n\nWhen mine arrived, piping hot, it came in Al Baik's familiar red-and-white box with fries, a sesame bun, garlic sauce, and ketchup.\n\nInside were four different pieces of chicken, a mix of cuts rather than identical portions, which felt thoughtful given how particular people can be about their favorite piece.\n\nWhen I opened the box, the aroma was different from what I associate with fried chicken. It wasn't unpleasant, just unfamiliar.\n\nThe coating was crispy but flatter than what I'm used to at places like KFC. Inside, I noticed a spicy, oil-infused seasoning that sat on the chicken rather than blending into the crust.\n\nOn its own, the chicken tasted milder than I expected — almost broth-like — and I could taste the meat more than the seasoning, which isn't usually what I look for in fried chicken.\n\nIt tasted better with the bun, garlic sauce, and fries, but even then, this wasn't my favorite of the items I tried.\n\nThe chicken nuggets box, which cost AED 19, or about $5.17, came with fries, garlic sauce, and ketchup on the side.\n\nUnlike the round or irregular shapes I'm used to from other fast-food nuggets, Al Baik's nuggets were long, rectangular pieces with a uniform shape.\n\nThey were coated in the brand's signature breading — a layer of breadcrumbs, flour, and spices like paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper — giving them a slightly golden-orange hue.\n\nThe portion felt generous for the price, especially with fries included.\n\nThese were easier to eat than the bone-in chicken, and overall, I liked them more.\n\nBut they felt different from the nuggets I'm used to. The breading didn't cling tightly to the chicken — after a bite, I could see a small gap where the coating had separated slightly from the meat, almost as if the chicken sat inside a crispy shell rather than being bonded to it.\n\nThe flavor again leaned toward a mild, chicken-forward taste rather than a well-seasoned crust.\n\nThat said, 10 nuggets with fries for about $5.17 felt like excellent value. For comparison, a nine-piece nuggets box from McDonald's costs about $4.90 without fries, and about $8.17 as a meal, which includes fries and a drink.\n\nThese nuggets were long, filling, and easy to share, even if the taste wasn't my favorite. They just didn't compare to Taco Bell's crispy nuggets, in my opinion.\n\nThe Spicy Big Baik was priced at AED 19, or $5.17.\n\nIt looked more like a Subway sandwich than a typical burger. It was long, filled edge to edge, and noticeably bigger than what I'd expect from McDonald's or KFC.\n\nInside was a flat, breaded chicken patty — think the Al Baik nugget but oversized — topped with cheese, coleslaw, jalapeños, and Lebanese pickles like the ones you'd find in a chicken shawarma.\n\nFor the price, it felt like a substantial meal on its own.\n\nOf the three things I tried, the spicy Big Baik tasted the best.\n\nThe sandwich was large and filling, and the mix of coleslaw, jalapeños, cheese, and pickles helped balance the flavor of the breaded chicken patty inside.\n\nIt still felt different from the crispy fried chicken sandwiches I'm used to at places like Chick-fil-A or KFC — the patty was flatter and less crunchy — but the toppings made up for it.\n\nThe bun was slightly dry, but overall, it was the easiest and most enjoyable item to eat.\n\nAfter hearing about Al Baik for years, I expected bold, heavily seasoned fried chicken. Instead, what I got was chicken where the flavor sat more on the surface than in the meat.\n\nThe broasted style meant the spices didn't seem to seep into the chicken the way I'm used to, leaving a stronger \"chicken\" taste than a seasoned one.\n\nThe garlic sauce — essentially toum, the same one used in shawarma and shish tawook wraps across the region — was excellent. Even in its packaged form, it tasted close to the fresh version and improved everything I paired it with.\n\nIn total, I paid AED 61, or about $16.61, including tax, for three items that could very well each be a whole meal.\n\nI didn't love the food, but I could see the appeal. The portions were generous, the prices were hard to beat, and the experience felt very different from typical fast food … not least because of the wait.\n\nIn the end, I realized the brand's draw isn't just the taste, but it's the value, the history, and, for some, the ritual.",

    "description": "Anthropic's Claude AI has snatched headlines recently. But is there another model that is throwing a wrench in the AI trade?",
    "fullText": "While Anthropic's Claude AI has snatched headlines recently for disrupting the software industry, one researcher says there's perhaps an even bigger bogeyman lurking in tech.\n\nTom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, says Google's Gemini threatens major potential disruptions to how investors currently see major AI firms.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Essaye highlighted three risks posed by Gemini, in particular its November update.\n\nThe first is that it could take market share from OpenAI's ChatGPT. That, in turn, could hurt OpenAi's ability to deliver on the $1 trillion in spending it has promised to firms like Nvidia, he said.\n\nSecond, the fact that Google used its own chips to build Gemini could undermine the importance of large semiconductor providers.\n\n\"The reason that Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi and others have exploded in recent years was because of insatiable demand for their semiconductor chips, as they are necessary to build out LLMs,\" Essaye wrote. \"Google making their own chips implies demand for chips from NVDA, AVGO and TSMC may be less than expected. That means less earnings growth and a lower multiple for semiconductor stocks.\"\n\nThat leads to the third point: since Gemini is so effective and was cheaper to produce than other leading chatbots, investors are holding spending levels from hyperscalers to a higher degree of scrutiny, Essaye said.\n\n\"If Google can make Gemini as good as ChatGPT on its own chips, then others likely can as well. The fear is that AI becomes commoditized, making trillions of dollars in AI infrastructure investment foolish,\" Essaye wrote.\n\n\"Put plainly, Gemini broke the idea that all money spent on AI was 'good' money that would result in earnings growth,\" he continued. \"Instead, it ushered in scrutiny to AI capex spending and that altered the paradigm AI/tech stocks existed in. Practically, that means it's no longer the case that the company that spends the most on AI infrastructure 'wins' and we can see that in the market reaction to the collapse of mega-cap free cash flow.\"",

    "description": "Comcast's NBCUniversal filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against its former partner. Group Black says it disputes the claims.",
    "fullText": "Comcast's NBCUniversal has sued Group Black, a firm created to direct ad dollars to Black-owned and Black-led media, alleging it owes the media giant $35.8 million in unpaid invoices and guaranteed payments.\n\nThe suit, filed February 11 in New York Supreme Court, stems from a partnership that gave Group Black exclusive rights to sell ads in Black-led shows on NBCU's streamer, Peacock, with Group Black and NBCU sharing the revenue.\n\n\"We dispute the claims made by NBCUniversal and intend to respond through the appropriate legal process,\" Group Black said in a statement. \"Group Black remains focused on its mission and serving its partners.\"\n\nNBCU has said that more than 30 brands signed on to the partnership in its first year, which began in September 2023. Group Black had predicted that NBCU would be its largest source of revenue in 2024, according to a board document dated November of that year, which was submitted in a separate court case.\n\nNBCU's lawsuit alleged that Group Black failed to fulfill the terms of the contract in the months after it began in September 2023, despite selling more than $30 million worth of advertising.\n\nThe suit alleged that in 2024, Group Black agreed ​​to shift its revenue share to zero to pay down the shortfall. NBCU says in the lawsuit that it repeatedly demanded payment, and that Group Black cofounder Bonin Bough had acknowledged the company's liability multiple times, emailing at one point that he took it \"very seriously.\"\n\nThe partnership ended in September 2025.\n\nGroup Black was launched in 2021 after the George Floyd protests that led to a national reckoning and prompted big advertisers like Coca-Cola and Walmart to increase their spending on Black-owned media. In the years that followed, the company faced a mix of internal struggles, executive departures, and broader market challenges. It pivoted last summer to focus on a wider audience with the launch of a new venture, Portrait Media Group.\n\nGroup Black has faced other legal action alleging nonpayment. Two companies owned by Essence Ventures, part of a venture led by a second Group Black cofounder, Richelieu Dennis, sued Group Black in 2024, alleging it owed them about $20 million. Group Black said in a court filing that Essence loaned it money but otherwise denied the allegations in the suit. The suit is ongoing.\n\nIn another case, Audiomob, an ad agency that provided mobile app advertising inventory for Group Black to sell to its clients, demanded about $181,000 from Group Black for invoices it alleged the company had failed to pay. The suit was terminated in August after Audiomob sought dismissal, saying Group Black had made a \"partial payment\" of the money owed, per court filings.",

    "fullText": "Thousands of people are rallying behind a version of ChatGPT after its parent company, OpenAI, retired the model.\n\nOpenAI said on January 30 that GPT-4o would be deprecated alongside three other versions of that model on February 13.\n\nA petition calling on OpenAI to save GPT-4o has amassed roughly 21,900 signatures on Change.org as of Tuesday.\n\n\"For many of us, GPT-4o offers a unique and irreplaceable user experience, combining qualities and capabilities that we value, regardless of performance benchmarks,\" the petition's description says.\n\nOpenAI wrote in a 2025 blog post that the model was known for \"responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous.\"\n\nThe company first set out to sunset GPT-4o last year, but fans pleaded to save it. In response, OpenAI brought the model back for several more months before its latest announcement.\n\nThe petition, created in April 2025 by Sophie Witt, reached 12,500 supporters two weeks ago, after OpenAI shared its latest plans to retire the model, and has continued to climb since.\n\nOn February 2, Witt called on supporters to take collective action against OpenAI's decision by posting about GPT-4o on X.\n\nWitt did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOpenAI gave GPT-4o a shoutout in its January 30 blog post, saying that many users told the company they like the model's \"conversational style and warmth\" last year. The ChatGPT maker said that feedback helped shape the GPT‑5.1 and GPT‑5.2 models.\n\nThe company cited low usage of GPT-4o as another reason for its retirement, reporting that only 0.1% of users still choose GPT‑4o.\n\nThe last time GPT-4o was retired, CEO Sam Altman was bombarded during an ask-me-anything session on Reddit with calls to reinstate it.\n\nThe calls for its return have been renewed through comments from social media users and petition signees. Some said it felt more like losing a friend than a feature. Other paying ChatGPT users said they'd be canceling their subscriptions in response to the retirement of GPT-4o.\n\n\"No 4o, no money. I will not spend another single penny on OpenAI,\" one X user posted.",

    "description": "The twin attacks mark the latest deep strikes by Ukraine's security service as Kyiv hunts down Russian military and energy targets.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine carried out long-range drone attacks overnight against a key Black Sea oil terminal and a plant making components for explosives located deep inside Russia, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe twin attacks mark Ukraine's latest long-range strikes and come as Kyiv's forces continue to target facilities inside Russia that directly and indirectly help the country sustain its full-scale invasion.\n\nDrones struck the Tamannaftogaz oil terminal in Russia's Krasnodar region, hitting one of the largest ports in the Black Sea region, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.\n\nThe attack on the port, the second in less than a month, caused a fire at the facility, the source said, adding that the earlier Ukrainian drone strikes on January 22 damaged several tanks and pipelines at Tamannaftogaz, causing an estimated $50 million in losses. The facility is recognized as an important piece of Russian oil logistics in the Black Sea.\n\nThe source said that the SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, \"systematically\" targets Russia's energy and export infrastructure, striking at a major revenue source fueling Moscow's war efforts against its neighbor.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone attacks on Russia's energy sector, striking oil refineries, terminals, tankers, and platforms across the country, and in the Black, Caspian, and even the Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly described the deep-strike campaign as \"long-range sanctions\" on Moscow. The attacks have led to a slight decline in Russian oil refining over the past year.\n\nThe deep strikes have also targeted other infrastructure associated with Russian military operations, including factories, weapons storage facilities, and air bases.\n\nOvernight, for instance, Ukrainian drones struck the Metafrax Chemicals plant in the Perm region more than 1,600 kilometers (roughly 1,000 miles) inside Russia.\n\nThe sanctioned plant — one of the largest producers of methanol in Russia and Europe — is used to make chemical components for explosives and other military-related materials, the SBU source said. Several blasts were reported at the facility.\n\nIn a translated statement, the source said \"the SBU continues to systematically work on enterprises that provide the Russian military-industrial complex with raw materials and components for the production of weapons.\"\n\n\"The destruction of such objects reduces the pace of ammunition production, complicates the supply of resources for the army, and directly affects the reduction of the intensity of hostilities against Ukraine,\" they added.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to a request for comment on the attacks. Moscow said its air defenses shot down 334 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe two attacks overnight on Monday were carried out by the SBU's Alpha group, an elite unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group is regularly behind long-range drone attacks against Russian targets. Forces within the unit also carry out ground operations, including in eastern Ukraine's embattled Donetsk region.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that it had carried out an attack on the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, which is not far from the Tamannaftogaz terminal that the SBU targeted.\n\n\"The defense forces of Ukraine will continue to systematically carry out measures aimed at weakening the combat potential of the Russian aggressor,\" the military said in a statement published to the Telegram messaging app.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration suffered a stinging defeat on Presidents Day after a Bush-appointed judge ruled against it while citing the dystopian novel 1984.\n\nU.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe ruled on Monday that an exhibit about nine people enslaved by George Washington be reinstated after the Trump administration ordered its removal last month.\n\nThe National Park Service removed the exhibit from Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia in response to an executive order from Trump that was aimed at “restoring truth and sanity to American history.” The order instructed the Interior Department to ensure that the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks do not display anything that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and the National Park Service for comment.\n\nNews cameras and onlookers recorded staff removing the exhibit late last month, with one park employee reportedly telling the Philadelphia Inquirer, “I’m just following my orders.”\n\nThe exhibit was located at the President’s House site in Philadelphia, where George and Martha Washington lived along with nine people enslaved by the couple when the city was briefly the nation’s capital.\n\nRufe ruled that all materials must be restored in their original condition while a lawsuit challenging the legality of the removal filed by Philadelphia mayor Cherelle Parker plays out.\n\nTrump’s executive order, issued on March 27, 2025, and titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” stated that, “Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.”\n\n“This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.”\n\nIn her ruling, Rufe referenced George Orwell’s 1984, writing, “As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts.”\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to whitewash history at multiple historical sites around the country, including removing a pride flag from the Stonewall National Monument in New York City just last week and erasing references to transgender people on the National Park Service’s website for the monument.\n\nReferences to the dispossession and mistreatment of Native Americans were also removed from an exhibit at Grand Canyon National Park, and roadside displays addressing climate change, pollution and mining were also flagged for potential removal.\n\nSenior vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association Kristen Brengel told the Washington Post that the White House’s efforts should “offend every American.”\n\n“We are capable of hearing about our tragedies and our victories, and this systematic erasure should concern everyone in our country.”\n\nMS NOW’s Rachel Maddow celebrated the ruling on the Monday night edition of her show, quoting extensively from the ruling—noting that Rufe was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush—and telling viewers, “Happy Presidents’ Day, Philadelphia. You are getting your history put back up by court order at the President’s House.”",

The team saw promising initial results from their innovations, but they faced a decision about whether to reveal their new techniques. The U.S. Team’s strategy was easily imitated if competitors witnessed it in a race, but it was a risk not to test it in competition before the Olympics. And, were there possible upsides to imitation if it improved the entire sport? Should they share their techniques, and if so, when?\nHarvard Business School Assistant Professor Rebecca Karp joins Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “A Winning Strategy: Innovation in Olympic Speed Skating.” They explore whether and when to launch a novel idea, product, or service, and what are the consequences—good and bad—to being imitated.\n\n Back / Innovations in Olympic Speed Skating: When to Reveal a Novel Approach\n\n Latest in this series\n\n All episodes",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Armed group Hezbollah rejected on Tuesday the Lebanese government's decision to grant the army at least four months ‌to advance the second phase of a nationwide disarmament plan, saying it would not ‌accept what it sees as a move serving Israel.\n\nLebanon's cabinet tasked the army in August 2025 with drawing up and ​beginning to implement a plan to bring all armed groups' weapons under state control, a bid aimed primarily at disarming Hezbollah after its devastating war with Israel in 2024.\n\nIn September 2025 the cabinet formally welcomed the army's plan to disarm the Iran-backed Shi'ite militia, although it did not set a ‌clear timeframe and cautioned that ⁠the military's limited capabilities and ongoing Israeli strikes could hinder progress.\n\nHezbollah Secretary-General Sheikh Naim Qassem said in a speech on Monday that \"what the Lebanese government ⁠is doing by focusing on disarmament is a major mistake because this issue serves the goals of Israeli aggression\".\n\nLebanon's Information Minister Paul Morcos said during a press conference late on Monday after a cabinet meeting ​that ​the government had taken note of the army's monthly ​report on its arms control plan ‌that includes restricting weapons in areas north of the Litani River up to the Awali River in Sidon, and granted it four months.\n\n\"The required time frame is four months, renewable depending on available capabilities, Israeli attacks and field obstacles,” he said.\n\nHezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said, \"we cannot be lenient,\" signalling the group's rejection of the timeline and the broader approach to the issue of its ‌weapons.\n\nHezbollah has rejected the disarmament effort as a misstep ​while Israel continues to target Lebanon, and Shi'ite ministers walked ​out of the cabinet session in ​protest.\n\nIsrael has said Hezbollah's disarmament is a security priority, arguing that the group's ‌weapons outside Lebanese state control pose a ​direct threat to its ​security.\n\nIsraeli officials say any disarmament plan must be fully and effectively implemented, especially in areas close to the border, and that continued Hezbollah military activity constitutes a violation of ​relevant international resolutions.\n\nIsrael has also said ‌it will continue what it describes as action to prevent the entrenchment or arming ​of hostile actors in Lebanon until cross-border threats are eliminated.",

    "fullText": "A winery in Australia lost 300 acres of vines due to the Longwood bushfire in Victoria.\n\nThe devastating bushfire in Victoria, Australia, destroyed 300 acres of vines belonging to Fowles Wines, a winery owned by Matt Fowles. Additionally, the fire burned through 1,500 acres of grazing land on the Fowles farm, killed hundreds of sheep, and ravaged two houses.\n\nAccording to WBM, Fowles told The Age, \"It's a moonscape. There's barely a blade of grass.\"\n\nFowles also explained that it appears the winery lost its entire crop due to the fire, along with all the infrastructure on which the crops depend.\n\nAnother vineyard in the area, Elgo Vineyard, was also devastated by the fire, and major property loss in the Victoria region has been reported, with Premier of Victoria Jacinta Allan declaring a state of disaster for 18 areas, per WBM.\n\nAs growers of all kinds face rising issues growing crops due to extreme weather events — such as wildfire, drought, and flooding — more and more crops will fail. These reductions in crop yield will result in less food (or, in the case of vineyards, less wine) being available to consumers, while potentially increasing the cost of the remaining food and wine, making already expensive grocery trips even more so.\n\nAdditionally, a loss of crops will see farmers facing substantial income loss. On top of those losses are the costs of rebuilding vineyards and farms after extreme weather, which can be expensive. If those losses continue indefinitely and farms constantly require rebuilding, it could lead to farmers losing or giving up their livelihoods, fewer farm jobs, and the potential razing of the agricultural industry.\n\nAs people continue using energy sources like oil and coal, global temperatures will keep rising, leading to even more extreme weather events and making growing food much more difficult, resulting in global food scarcity.\n\nVineyards are implementing numerous strategies not only to save crops from wildfire but also to continue growing crops in harsh weather of all kinds.\n\nWhether it's cultivating healthier soil with the help of herds of sheep or developing an AI robot meant to help vineyards during labor shortages, scientists and researchers around the globe are taking steps to protect crops.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Bypass all the clutter of the Messages app's built-in search feature.",
    "fullText": "I have always found it annoying to search for anything in Apple's Messages app. Admittedly, things have gotten better in recent years, especially as Messages allows you to use search filters now, but my biggest complaint still stands: searching in Messages can be both slow and complicated, particularly if you just want to find a specific text. If you have the same experience, I have good news: I've found a workaround that offers a massive improvement to Apple's built-in search function.\n\nFor most people, the easiest way to search for texts on an iPhone involves opening the Messages app, tapping the search bar near the base of the screen, and typing in what you're looking for. You'll receive a variety of results, but that's the problem: It's too much information.\n\nWhen I search for a person's name, for example, Messages in iOS 26 shows a list of four chats where the name is mentioned, followed by two chat threads, pinned chats, shared notes, links, photos, locations, and documents. This is great when I want a more in-depth search, but when I'm just looking for a specific message, these extra details just get in the way.\n\nThat's where our hack comes in. First, open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone, then install the Search and Open Messages shortcut. This shortcuts takes advantage of actions released in iOS 26, which allow you to look for text messages and open them in a single tap. Once the shortcut is installed, you can run it from the Shortcuts app, or add it to your iPhone's Home Screen for easier access.\n\nThe shortcut will prompt you to type what you want to search for, and almost instantly, it'll list all the chats containing those words. In some cases, it even highlights the exact sentence containing those words. It'll find keywords in images you share, as well: These appears as \"blank\" entries in the search results, but if you tap through, you'll see the image the search identified.\n\nThe moment you tap a result, the shortcut instantly takes you to the relevant part of the chat, and doesn't make you scroll through hundreds of results to find the right one. This is the kind of functionality Apple needs to add directly to Messages. But, for now, this shortcut workaround will have to do.",

    "fullText": "Millions of baby boomers are being forced out of retirement, having realized their nest eggs don’t quite make ends meet. With people living longer than ever, the issue will only get worse. It’s a fate that Gen Alpha in Germany may never have to face.\n\nThat’s because under the German government’s new plans, children as young as 6 will start saving for retirement.\n\nWhy are baby boomers being forced out of retirement?\n\nHow does compound growth benefit early retirement planning?\n\nWhat is Germany's new early start pension program?\n\nHow much money will children accumulate through this program?\n\nEnter the “early start pension”—a retirement program designed for children between 6 and 18 years old.\n\nUnlike your regular pension pot, which requires putting aside a portion of your salary for your future self, the country’s government would pay out €10 ($11) a month to children in education under this new plan.\n\nOver 12 years of eligibility, this could accumulate to more than €1,440 ($1,700) per child, not counting the potential investment gains from compounding interest over the decade.\n\nThen, from the age of 18 onward, they can add personal funds to the accounts and enjoy tax-free profits. However, that cash will become accessible to account holders only when they reach retirement age—which is currently set at 67 in Germany.\n\nA government spokesperson confirmed to Fortune that while the program’s official start date was Jan. 1, 2026, the actual payments to beneficiaries won’t happen until the law comes into force, which is expected to be Jan. 1, 2027.\n\n“Strengthening pension schemes is high priority for the German government,” the spokesperson said, adding that it’s part of a wider overhaul. “To complement the state pension system, the government will also reform the private pension system.”\n\nPeople are working well beyond retirement age globally. They’re living longer than expected, caring for both their elderly parents and Gen Zers, and wanting to enjoy the fruits of their labor with lavish vacations instead of pottering around.\n\nIt’s why the number of those who have continued to work past 65 in the U.S. has quadrupled since the 1980s, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nNow, almost 20% of Americans who are 65 and older are employed. That’s around 11 million people and nearly double the share of those who were working 35 years ago. In the U.K., nearly 20% of baby boomers and late Gen Xers are similarly “unretiring”—or planning to, because their retirement desires don’t match up to the nest egg they’ve built.\n\nIt’s why it’s never too soon to start retirement planning.\n\nThe renowned financial expert Suze Orman previously highlighted that Gen Z and millennials could indeed retire as millionaires if they make the most of compound growth while they’re young.",

    "description": "Paul...",
    "fullText": "After 16 years in power in Hungary, his Fidesz party is trailing in the polls by double digits behind a new opposition party.\n\nViktor Orbán, Hungary’s autocratic prime minster, shouldn’t have had anything to worry about in the run-up to the April 12 general election. In four previous votes, he and his Fidesz party—a far-right trailblazer in Europe—triumphed handily, securing two-thirds majorities in parliament in every election since 2010. Orbán’s governments overhauled the Hungarian state in Fidesz’s image and tried to craft a system that would perpetrate Fidesz rule indefinitely. Moreover, the muscle behind Orbán and his party could hardly be more formidable: Vladimir Putin’s Russia, President Donald Trump, and China, too, line up behind Orbán, their favorite European leader.\n\nAnd, yet, Fidesz is trailing a new opposition party, Tisza, by double digits and the buttons that Orbán’s pushed so deftly for 16 years—immigration, Hungarian nativism, anti-LGBTQ, “peace”—aren’t triggering Hungarians as they had in the past. Magyars appear fed up with the economic backlash of lost EU funding, the high cost of living, ubiquitous corruption, and a long trail of unseemly scandals. In 2024, Hungarian President Katalin Novak resigned after it emerged that she had pardoned the accomplice of a convicted child abuser. A pedophilia affair last year involving videos that showed children suffering abuse in state-run juvenile facilities prompted tens of thousands to take to the streets.\n\nThe gale-force storm has observers cautiously convinced that Tisza (Respect and Freedom Party) could upend Orbán’s “embedded autocracy.” Two of Hungary’s most astute analysts, Andras Bozoki and Zoltan Fleck, describe Orbán’s government as a highly centralized regime that is so deeply entrenched in the composition of society and in control of pseudo-democratic structures that it locks in its own electoral continuation. The Fidesz state, they argue, has the trappings of a democracy—regular ballots, basic civil liberties, and multiple parties—but the system is fixed to yield the same result. Orbán rewrote the Constitution, packed the courts, promoted and paid off loyal allies, and redrew electoral districts to Fidesz’s advantage. Independent media was nationalized or bought up by Orbán supporters, while critical civil society is squeezed out of the public sphere.\n\n“There’s a chance Fidesz will exit from power peacefully,” said Zoltan Fleck, legal scholar at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, and co-author of Embedded Autocracy: Hungary in the European Union. “But authoritarian regimes don’t usually finish by way of elections, and Fidesz has a lot to lose in terms of money, property, the even the freedom of its core figures involved over years in a criminal state.“ With the country in a declared state of emergency because of the war in Ukraine, Orbán has expansive powers to rule by decree, Fleck said, and has numerous options to tweak the system to Fidesz’s advantage.\n\n“Tisza needs more than a narrow victory to dislodge Fidesz,” Andras Biro of the Budapest-based think tank Political Capital said. He explained that rural votes in Orbán strongholds in eastern Hungary are more heavily weighted than urban votes, and therefore the opposition needs a popular victory of at least four percentage points. According to Biro, a victory by 10 points would spell its defeat and force it to exit from power. “We’re not Belarus here,” he said, referring to the Russian ally’s bald-faced refusal to accept electoral defeat.\n\nIn 2022, the EU Parliament declared, “Hungary can no longer be considered a full democracy.” The bloc continues to withhold a significant portion of EU funds allocated to Hungary—estimated at more than €20 billion—due to concerns about the rule of law, corruption, judicial independence, and civil rights. Much of this could flow back into Hungary’s coffers were reforms introduced. But Orbán barely budges.\n\nUnshakable, Orbán continues to throw wrenches into the European Union’s Ukraine policies, undermining Ukraine’s funding, sabotaging its EU accession, and providing Putin with a foothold in EU Europe. Orbán’s long-running anti-Ukraine campaign seeks to convince voters that the neighboring country—Hungary and Ukraine share 85 miles of border—is embroiled in a war of its own making and poses an existential threat to Hungary’s security. “Orbán’s appeal is as a strongman who protects the Hungarians,” explained Laszlo Andor, an economist and former EU minister. Andor said Orbán frames the war in Ukraine as a threat to the interests of ordinary Hungarians—a threat he is keeping at bay. “Today Ukraine is the number-one topic. It has replaced migration in Fidesz propaganda.”\n\nAnd then there’s Orbán’s economy, which peaked in mid-to-late 2010s and was largely responsible for Fidesz’s broad support. But this has dissipated, replaced by inflation that surged to over 17 percent in 2023 due to energy prices and currency depreciation. It hit average Hungarians hard. My friend Dorotteya, a private teacher, shells out half of her salary to put food on the table of her family of three. Between 2019 and 2025, Hungarian food prices jumped by 82 percent, while cumulative inflation reached 50 percent.\n\nTisza is the product of Peter Magyar, a wily, 44-year-old and a former Fidesz higher-up. In contrast to past elections, the wider opposition has rallied around him. A divided opposition never stood a chance against Fidesz, but this time around, thanks to the insistence of the voters, socialists, greens, liberals, conservatives,Roma activists, and social democrats have put differences aside in order to oust Fidesz and begin dismantling its state.\n\nAs excited as the opposition is about finally uniting, Fleck notes that Magyar is a conservative who comes from within Fidesz. How far and how quickly he’ll tear down the Fidesz state, should Tisza come to power, is an open question. The authoritarian ethic runs deep in Hungary, Fleck cautioned.\n\nFidesz’s poor position in the polling is all the more extraordinary in light of its heavy-hitting global supporters. The love affair between Orbán and Putin over a decade is based as much upon their affinities as authoritarians as Hungary’s reliance on cheap Russian energy. Hungary and Slovakia are the only EU countries that haven’t attempted to wean themselves off Russian gas. Russia’s bot armies, fake news, social media blitzes, and other misinformation campaigns dovetail perfectly with Fidesz’s homemade spins: Europe’s succumbing to hordes of foreign immigrants, the corruption of Christian values by Western perversion, and Ukraine as a fascist state.\n\nObituary\n\n /\n\n John Nichols\n\nTrump has expressed his deep admiration for Orbán—and all of Europe’s far right—many times, most recently in early February in a social-media post that called him “a true friend, fighter, and WINNER, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election as Prime Minister of Hungary.” Next week, after addressing the Munich Security Conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nPerhaps a credit to Orbán’s diplomatic guile, he has managed to line up China too for Hungary’s purposes‚ thus far without incurring Washington’s ire. China is Hungary’s largest non-European trade partner, and Hungary relies on Chinese raw materials, automotive components, metal products, textiles, and electronics. President Xi Jinping sings Orbán’s praises and supports Hungary in “playing a bigger role in the EU” as a way to promote better China–European Union relations.\n\nAnalyst Biro said that with the state behind it in so many ways, Fidesz can outspend Tisza “more than 100 to one. The playing field is not level, not all at.”\n\nHungarians have clearly soured on Fidesz, but the question is by how much. If Hungary isn’t Belarus, then people power can crack the embedded autocracy and pry open space from within which democratic culture can take root. But after 16 years of Fidesz rule, we have no evidence that Hungary isn’t the EU’s Belarus.",

He was transported to an area hospital, where he died. \"It is unclear what led up to the shooting,\" police said, adding that no arrests have been made in the case.\n\nSparks, who described her late fiancé as her \"best friend\" and \"soulmate,\" recalled her final moments with Mueller in an interview with local outlet KOCO 5 News.\n\n\"I just remember holding him in my arms, crying and telling him, 'You gotta breathe. Look at me.' And he locked eyes with me and he's trying to take his last breath, and it was so freaking hard,' \" she shared.\n\nThe couple was set to get married in April after years together.

    "fullText": "More than 80 current and former participants of the Berlinale have signed an open letter to the festival condemning what it claims has been its “silence” when it comes to the conflict in Gaza and the “censoring” of artists who have spoken out.\n\nActors Tilda Swinton, Javier Bardem, Angeliki Papoulia, Saleh Bakri, Tatiana Maslany, Peter Mullan and Tobias Menzies, as well as directors Mike Leigh, Lukas Dhont, Nan Goldin, Miguel Gomes, Adam McKay and Avi Mograbi are among the signatories of the letter, which says they “expect the institutions in our industry to refuse complicity in the terrible violence that continues to be waged against Palestinians.”\n\n'Wolfram' Review: Tough but Tender-Hearted Colonial-Era Australian Western Tracks a Family's Efforts to Reunite\n\nSeries Creators Push Back as the Industry Gets 'Nervous' About Important Stories and Female Perspective: 'The Content Might Be Different Enough to Actually Make a Difference'\n\nTobias Nölle Returns to Berlinale Panorama With Hybrid Island Portrait 'Tristan Forever'\n\nThe letter lands the middle of the 2026 edition of the Berlinale in which the topics of politics has become a central theme, most notably following comments by jury head Wim Wenders in the opening press conference. When asked about Gaza and the support the German government — which funds much of the festival — has shown for Israel, he said “we should stay out of politics” and claimed that filmmaking was “the opposite of politics.” The uproar that followed prompted festival head Tricia Tuttle to put a statement in which she said: “Artists should not be expected to comment on all broader debates about a festival’s previous or current practices over which they have no control.”\n\nIn the open letter, the signatories assert that they “fervently disagree” with Wenders views on filmmaking and politics. “You cannot separate one from the other,” they say, adding that the “tide is changing across the international film world,” citing the refusal of more than 5,000 film workers, including several major Hollywood names, to work with “complicit Israeli film companies and institutions.”\n\nThe letter notes that the Berlinale has made “clear statements” in the past about “atrocities” carried out against people in Iran and Ukraine.\n\n“We call on the Berlinale to fulfil its moral duty and clearly state its opposition to Israel’s genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes against Palestinians, and completely end its involvement in shielding Israel from criticism and calls for accountability,” it concludes.\n\nSee the full letter and list of signatories below.\n\nOpen Letter to the Berlinale — Feb. 17, 2026\n\nWe write as film workers, all of us past and current Berlinale participants, who expect the institutions in our industry to refuse complicity in the terrible violence that continues to be waged against Palestinians. We are dismayed at the Berlinale’s involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and the German state’s key role in enabling it. As the Palestine Film Institute has stated, the festival has been “policing filmmakers alongside a continued commitment to collaborate with Federal Police on their investigations”.\n\nLast year, filmmakers who spoke out for Palestinian life and liberty from the Berlinale stage reported being aggressively reprimanded by senior festival programmers. One filmmaker was reported ​t​o have been investigated by police, and Berlinale leadership falsely implied that ​t​he filmmaker’s moving speech – rooted in international law and solidarity – was “discriminatory”. As another filmmaker told Film Workers for Palestine​ about last year’s festival: “there was a feeling of paranoia in the air, of not being protected and of being persecuted, which I had never felt before at a film festival”. We stand with our colleagues in rejecting this institutional repression and anti-Palestinian racism.\n\nWe fervently disagree with ​the statement made by Berlinale​ 2026 jury president Wim Wenders​ that filmmaking is “the opposite of politics”​. You cannot separate one from the other. We are deeply concerned that the German state-funded Berlinale is helping put into practice what Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion recently condemned as Germany’s misuse of draconian legislation “to restrict advocacy for Palestinian rights, chilling public participation and shrinking discourse in academia and the arts”​. This is also what Ai Weiwei recently described​ as Germany “doing what they did in the 1930s”​ (agreeing with his interviewer who suggested to him that “it’s the same fascist impulse, just a different target​”). All of this at a time when we are learning horrifying new details about the 2,842 Palestinians “evaporated” by Israeli forces using internationally prohibited, U.S.-made thermal and thermobaric weapons. Despite abundant evidence of Israel’s genocidal intent, systematic atrocity crimes and ethnic cleansing, Germany continues to supply Israel with weapons used to exterminate Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe tide is changing across the international film world. Many international film festivals have endorsed the cultural boycott of apartheid Israel, including the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam, the world’s biggest, as well as BlackStar Film Festival in the U.S., and Film Fest Gent, Belgium’s largest. More than 5,000 film workers, including leading Hollywood and international figures, have also announced their refusal to work with complicit Israeli film companies and institutions.\n\nYet Berlinale has so far not even met the demands of its community to issue a statement that affirms the Palestinian right to life, dignity, and freedom; condemns the ongoing Israeli genocide of Palestinians; and commits to uphold the right of artists to speak without constraint in support of Palestinian human rights. This is the least it can – and should – do.\n\nAs the Palestine Film Institute has said, “we are appalled by Berlinale’s institutional silence on the genocide of Palestinians, and its unwillingness to defend the freedoms of speech and expression of filmmakers”. Just as ​t​he festival has ​m​ade clear statements ​in the past about atrocities ​carried out against​ people in Iran and Ukrain​e, we call on the Berlinale to fulfil its moral duty and clearly state its opposition to Israel’s genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes against Palestinians, and completely end its involvement in shielding Israel from criticism and calls for accountability.\n\n'Goat' Cast Guide: All the Celebrities and NBA Stars Voicing Animals in the Basketball Movie\n\nOscars: Original Screenplay — 'Sinners,' 'Sentimental Value' and 'Blue Moon' Gain More Popularity Among Voters\n\nWhat’s Coming to Netflix in February 2026",

    "fullText": "Wendy’s announced Friday it will close between 298 and 358 U.S. restaurants in the first half of this year, representing roughly 5% to 6% of its domestic locations, as the fast-food chain works to reverse a significant sales decline, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe Dublin, Ohio-based company reported that global same-store sales at locations open for at least a year fell 10% during the October-December period, exceeding the 8.5% drop analysts had anticipated, according to the publication. U.S. sales declined even more sharply during that timeframe.\n\nThe closures add to the 28 restaurants Wendy’s shuttered in the fourth quarter, leaving the company with 5,969 U.S. locations at the end of 2025. The chain also closed 240 restaurants in 2024.\n\nWendy’s is now emphasizing value to win back inflation-weary customers, a tactic also employed by competitors McDonald’s and Taco Bell, according to the AP. In January, the company rolled out a permanent “Biggie Deals” value menu with items priced at $4, $6, and $8.\n\n“One learning from 2025 around value, we swung the pendulum too far towards limited-time price promotions instead of everyday value,” said Ken Cook, Wendy’s interim CEO and chief financial officer, during a call with investors.\n\nCook added that the company plans to introduce new products this year, including a new chicken sandwich.\n\nDespite the sales slump, Wendy’s fourth-quarter revenue of $543 million topped analyst forecasts of $537 million, though it marked a 5.5% decrease, according to AP. The company projects global systemwide sales will be flat this year after falling 3.5% last year, expressing confidence that its turnaround plan and international expansion will halt the sales decline.\n\nWendy’s shares rose nearly 5% during mid-day trading Friday following the announcement, AP noted.",

    "description": "Taking a look at some hyper-specific cultures within the larger youth culture.",
    "fullText": "This week we're taking a look at some hyper-specific cultures within the larger youth culture. They run the gamut from the truly disturbing Looksmaxxing community, to the strange world of hardcore audiophiles, to the nostalgic domain of the bebot girls. What's a bebot girl? I'm glad you asked!\n\nTikTok is being taken over by Bebot Girls. \"Bebot\" is Filipino slang from the 2010s that means \"babe\" or \"baddie.\" The bebot girl trend is posting videos of the transformation from a regular person to a bebot, that is, a Filipino baddy from the 1990s. This is usually accomplished through period-appropriate makeup like heavy bronzer, frosty inner eyes, and striking metallic eyeshadow. It looks like this:\n\nThe trend started with TikToker @bellepauleen posting this video, which revived the term. The bebot anthem and soundtrack to the these videos is Black Eyed Peas 2005 song \"Bebot.\" Bebot girls seems like part of the same nostalgia trend that brought us Millennial Optimism and nostalgia for 2016, but with a huge dose of Filipino pride. If you want to watch bedot girl videos all day, check out the hashtag.\n\nThis week in people who are famous to your children but not you, we have Clavicular. His real name is Braden Peters, he was born in 2005, and he is the world's most famous looksmaxxer.\n\nLooksmaxxing (as you can read in my Gen Z and Gen A slang glossary) is maximizing one’s physical attractiveness through personal grooming, working out, and dressing stylishly. That doesn't sound terrible in theory, but in practice, looksmaxxing is nihilistic vanity. To the Looksmaxxer, there's a single standard for male attractiveness: basically being a lantern-jawed white dude. And there is nothing more important than looks. Being smart, cool, interesting, good-hearted, talented etc. does not matter; the only quality that is worthwhile is how you look. Looksmaxxers are insanely obsessive about defining what makes a person attractive. They measure their canthal tilt (the angle of the eyes), obsess over their maxilla (upper jaw), and know their exact biacromial width (the span of the clavicle.) Clavicular's is 19.5 inches, hence the name.\n\nClavicular's fame comes from his Kick channel, where he films himself rating other people's looks, walking around being handsome, giving advice to his followers on how they can \"ascend,\" (become more attractive) and going on dates. As expected, he does sell an online course. To achieve his look, Clav says he's been injecting himself with testosterone since he was 14, takes steroids regularly, and smashed his cheekbones with a hammer so they would grow more prominent. There are rumors that he takes meth to keep his weight down too. Although he describes himself as apolitical, Clavicular's associates include right-wing influencers Nick Fuentes, Sneako, Andrew Tate, and more. He says the n-word all the time.\n\nSo all this is very bad, and it's all growing in popularity among boys of the brainrot generation. So be warned, I guess: Young boys are not OK.\n\nWhile niche communities like Looksmaxxers are depressing, many young people are into much less dire interest groups, like audiophiles. Within that community, audio equipment is sometimes referred to as \"Big John machines,\" because people are demonstrating their ridiculously expensive audio set-ups by playing a Geoff Castelucci cover of Jimmy Dean's 1961 novelty hit \"Big Bad John.\"\n\nIt started with a post on Reddit's audiophile subreddit, describing the original song as \"an interesting example of how good audio systems can bring out more life in a recording.\" So people started posting videos of extremely exotic and expensive systems playing the song. Like this system with $2 million speakers:\n\nThen people started posting their own systems playing the song. Or just middle-of-the-road gear. Then people started posting the cheapest gear that can play \"Big Bad John,\" like this:\n\nRecently, TikTokers Toni & Austin posted the following 11-second video, dubbed \"The Leaf Test.\"\n\nIn it, Toni says, \"I found a leaf,\" and Austin responds \"It's beautiful, just like you.\" She sighs. He panics, presumably having said the wrong thing. It's mildly funny, but it went viral in a huge way—over 18 million views— for maybe the wrong reasons.\n\nDespite it being very, very clear that the clip is a joke, the video's comment section is full of anger, with people saying things like, \"Dump her ungrateful ass,\" \"He deserves someone better,\" and \"Can we normalize not doing test on our boyfriends he gave a perfect and valid answer and how are we still gonna get upset??\"\n\nPeople started making response videos:\n\nIt spread off TikTok. Reddit got extra mad about the leaf test.\n\nI don't know if there's any way to measure this, but the internet has made people way less able to understand when someone is being ironic or sarcastic, whether it's misinterpreted written posts on Threads or joke videos on TikTok. The internet seems to have made people less likely to moderate their responses; people are fast on the trigger.",

    "title": "These Three Claude Premium AI Features Are Now Available for Free",
    "description": "Here's to use these new features",
    "fullText": "Anthropic's Claude is an AI bot that keeps up a steady pace when it comes to pushing out new features, and the latest upgrade of note sees three useful features make their way down to free users, having previously been exclusive to the paid-for plans.\n\nIf you're choosing between AIs and comparing the features available on the free plans, then there's now more of a case to be made for choosing Claude over a competitor like ChatGPT or Gemini for your next batch of AI tasks.\n\nThe three new features now available to free users on Claude are file creation, external plug-ins called Connectors, and bundles of instructions called Skills. Here's how you can make use of them.\n\nClaude's file creation capabilities let you create Word documents, PowerPoint slideshows, Excel spreadsheets, and PDFs from right inside a conversation. You can either supply the bot with all text, data, and other information you want included, get Claude to invent everything itself, or something in between.\n\nFor example, if you've got a long list of names and scores, Claude can put them into a spreadsheet for you. If you've got a series of images, Claude can combine them into a PDF and describe them. You can get it to analyze and visualize data, produce presentations based on reports, and create summary documents.\n\nTo enable file creation for your account, click your profile icon (bottom left) in Claude on the web, then select Settings > Capabilities and enable Code execution and file creation. With that done, you just have to prompt Claude with the type of file you want to make and what you want included, supplying any information as needed (or telling the AI where to find it online).\n\nAs usual with these AI bots, the more detail and specificity you can provide, the better—the end result is then more likely to be closer to what you were aiming for. I got it to quickly come up with the results of a fictional sports day race, and produce a spreadsheet from it. While it's not the most demanding of tasks, Claude completed it correctly.\n\nConnectors can hook Claude up to a variety of other apps, sites, and services: So if you want to get it to design something for you in Canva, or manage your messages in Slack, or find some travel deals on Trivago, then Claude can do that for you. The full list of current Connectors gives you some idea of what's possible.\n\nTo get to the Connectors from the Claude prompt box, click the small + (plus) icon in the lower left corner, then choose Add connectors. You can search through Connectors by name, and filter them by type and category. When you select one you like, you'll need to supply your account credentials and give Claude permission to access your account.\n\nYour Connectors of choice are then available from the same sub-menu in the prompt box: You can add more plug-ins and remove existing ones from there. You can either select an app, or specify the name of it in your prompt and Claude should understand what you mean. You can ask for outputs, run searches, and communicate through your connected services.\n\nConnectors can give Claude some handy extra talents. With the Canvas Connector, for example, I was able to create a basic bit of artwork for a birthday party flyer—something that the AI wouldn't have been able to do on its own. I find that access was spotty, however, perhaps a sign of a lot of free users now making use of these tools.\n\nWith Skills, you can \"teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way\" (in the words of the official support document). In old-school computer talk, they might be referred to as macros: batches of set instructions that Claude can repeat whenever you need something doing in a particular way.\n\nTemplates are a good example, whether they're for emails or documents. Rather than just getting Claude to write an email for you, you can set down some basic parameters for the job that include guidelines on tone, length, and style, as well as crucial bits of information (such as your contact details) that always need to be included.\n\nClick your account profile icon (bottom left) in Claude on the web, then choose Settings > Capabilities and click Add under Skills to get started. You can create a Skill through a Claude conversation, by writing out the instructions, or by uploading a Skills file (which is handy for including extra items such as code snippets, as described here).\n\nI took the Create with Claude route to put together a basic way of summarizing PDF reports, with specific guidelines on how many paragraphs and headings to use, and the tone of voice to apply.

    "description": "You might not have to start all over again.",
    "fullText": "There's little worse than losing an hour or two of hard work, just by clicking on the wrong button or pressing the wrong key in Microsoft Word—a mistake that sees your well-crafted document (or a sizable portion of it) disappear before your eyes.\n\nA slip of the fingers isn't the only way you can potentially lose work, either. Maybe you just have the misfortune to be busy at your computer when a power outage happens—taking your desktop, Microsoft Word, and your unsaved work along with it.\n\nHowever, before you begin all over again, there are some tricks you can try to bring your work back.\n\nSometimes, all you need is the undo command—hit Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Cmd+Z (macOS) to undo your last action in Word. It might be enough to restore that table you accidentally deleted, or bring back that huge block of text you moved to the clipboard and have since lost track of.\n\nThis won't save you from a power outage, and it doesn't include all actions (it won't bring back a file you've closed, for example). However, it'll work a lot of the time when you've made a mistake, and Word always keeps a record of your last 100 actions in the app, so you can go back a fair way.\n\nThere's also an undo button up in the top left corner of the Word interface: Click on this to undo the last action, or click the arrow next to it to see a list of previous actions and choose where you want to go back to. To the right of the undo button is the redo button, which works the same way but in the opposite direction.\n\nWord also has a file version history feature you can utilize to bring back lost work: It essentially saves past versions of your document at regular intervals, so you can go back in time, and even all the way back to the file's creation. It's like a super undo, which works between app restarts as well.\n\nIn Word for Windows, you can find these older incarnations of your document by heading to File > Info > Version History. If you're using Word on macOS, it's File > Browse Version History. A new sidebar opens on the right, showing all the available previous versions, and the date and time they were saved.\n\nThere is a caveat to this, though, which is you have to have your document saved in the cloud (in OneDrive) for this to work. If you're working with a local file that's only saved on your computer and you try and access version history, you'll be prompted to save it to OneDrive instead (which will turn on version history).\n\nWord actually saves files temporarily to your computer every so often, so if the program crashes without warning, you should see an autorecovery dialog pop up the next time you load Word, asking if you want to recover the old file. If not, you can see partially saved files by clicking Click File > Info > Manage Document > Recover Unsaved Documents.\n\nThat's only for Windows, however—if you're on macOS, you're relying on the auto-recovery process. Word for both Windows and macOS lets you set how often auto-recovery files are saved: Head to File > Options > Save (Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save (macOS). The default is every 10 minutes, but you can adjust this if needed.\n\nIf you're still not seeing your file, you can try checking the temporary cache folder manually. On Windows, check \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Word\" or \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\UnsavedFiles.\" On macOS try \"/Users//Library/Containers/com.Microsoft/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery\"—adding in your own username where relevant.\n\nThese days, Microsoft Word will tend to push you to save your work in OneDrive in the cloud. There are multiple benefits for this, including the version history feature mentioned above, and the option to collaborate on documents with other people. It also enables another handy feature: AutoSave.\n\nThis is exactly what it sounds like, and means that every time something is changed in your document, it quickly syncs to the cloud. You'll see the AutoSave button in the top left hand corner enabled when it's active, and the document name at the top of the app window will indicate when saves are in progress.\n\nShould Word or your PC crash, your work should be safe. AutoSave is enabled by default for files saved to OneDrive, but you can customize this behavior by heading to File > Options > Save on Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save on macOS.",

    "fullText": "If you have peanut butter at home, it may be time to take a closer look at the label.\n\nFederal officials say more than 20,000 peanut butter products sold nationwide — including in California — are being recalled after potential plastic contamination was discovered during manufacturing.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the peanut butter was manufactured by Ventura Foods, a major food company headquartered in Southern California, and sold under multiple private-label brand names in 40 states, including California.\n\nInspectors found pieces of blue plastic in a production filter, prompting the recall, according to the FDA. While the recall began in April 2025, the agency formally classified it as a Class II recall on Feb. 12, meaning exposure could cause temporary or medically reversible health problems, but the risk of serious injury is considered low\n\nCalifornia is among the states where the recalled peanut butter products were distributed, according to the FDA.\n\nThe products were primarily single-serve packets and small cups, often used in schools, hospitals, hotels and food-service settings, rather than large retail jars.\n\nAccording to the FDA, the recalled products include:\n\nCreamy peanut butter packets in 0.5-ounce and 0.75-ounce cups, and 1.12-ounce packs\n\nTwin packs of creamy peanut butter with strawberry jam, in 1-ounce and 1.12-ounce cups\n\nTwin packs of creamy peanut butter with grape jelly, in 1-ounce and 1.12-ounce cups\n\nThe products were sold under private-label brands such as US Foods, Sysco House Recipe, DYMA Brands, Flavor Fresh, Katy’s Kitchen, and Gordon Food Service, the FDA said.\n\nMore: Over 22,000 pounds of ground beef recalled over E. coli risk\n\nVentura Foods is headquartered in California, with corporate offices listed in Brea and Irvine.\n\nThe privately held company is a major food manufacturer, employing about 4,000 people nationwide, with a significant portion of its workforce based in California.\n\nVentura Foods operates 14 manufacturing plants and three culinary centers across North America and produces food products that end up in restaurants, institutions and grocery stores across the country.\n\nWhile this recall involves peanut butter made for private-label customers, Ventura Foods’ broader portfolio extends far beyond peanut products.\n\nAccording to company profiles, Ventura Foods manufactures and supplies:\n\nPan coatings and liquid butter alternatives\n\nMany of its products are used behind the scenes in restaurants, schools, and hospitals, rather than sold directly under the Ventura Foods name in grocery stores.\n\nConsumers in California and other affected states are urged to check product labels carefully, especially on small peanut butter packets or combination peanut butter-and-jelly cups.\n\nThe FDA recommends following the retailer or manufacturer's instructions on whether recalled products should be returned or safely discarded.\n\nAnyone who experiences health issues after consuming the recalled products should contact a medical professional, the agency said\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Springs Desert Sun: Ventura Foods peanut butter recall in California possible plastic",

    "description": "Ontario family speaks out after son's controversial euthanasia under Canada's MAID laws, alleging system failed to protect vulnerable 26-year-old.",
    "fullText": "The grieving parents of a 26-year-old man are speaking out against Canada’s medical assistance in dying (MAID) laws, arguing the system failed to protect their \"vulnerable\" son from being euthanized, despite a history of mental illness.\n\nKiano Vafaeian was euthanized on Dec. 30, 2025, in British Columbia. His family says he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 4 and began struggling with mental health after a car accident at 17.\n\nHis mother, Margaret Marsilla of Ontario, said his depression was often seasonal, yet he became \"obsessed\" with MAID after losing vision in one eye in 2022.\n\n\"He kept on emphasizing about how he could get approved,\" Marsilla told Fox News Digital. \"We never thought there would be a chance that any doctor would approve a 22- or 23-year-old at that time for MAID because of diabetes or blindness.\"\n\nNy Gov Hochul To Sign Bill To Legalize Physician-assisted Suicide: 'Who Am I To Deny You?'\n\nMAID was legalized in Canada in June 2016. The law allows patients with \"grievous and irremediable\" medical conditions to request a lethal drug that is either physician or self-administered, to end their lives.\n\nIn 2022, after a Toronto doctor initially approved Vafaeian’s request, the family launched a public pressure campaign on social media to voice their opposition. The outcry led the doctor to withdraw approval. While Vafaeian was initially angry, his family said he showed signs of improvement over the following year, even moving in with them in 2024.\n\n\"He tried his best when he was in one of those good highs of life,\" Marsilla said. \"Then winter, fall started coming around, he started changing and then everything that we had worked for from spring and summertime just disappeared… he would start talking about MAID again.\"\n\nThe family said Vafaeian was rejected by multiple doctors in Ontario before he sought out Dr. Ellen Wiebe, a prominent MAID provider, in British Columbia. Marsilla believes Wiebe \"coached\" her son on what to say to meet the criteria for \"Track 2\" patients — those whose natural deaths are not reasonably imminent.\n\nPritzker Approves Physician-assisted Suicide Law For Terminally Ill Patients Despite Catholic Opposition\n\n\"We believe that she was coaching him... on how to deteriorate his body and what she can possibly approve him for and what she can get away with approving him for,\" Marsilla said. \"Because if he had spoken back in 2024, and he was a good candidate for approving MAID, she would have done it right away, but she didn't.\"\n\nVafaeian’s parents say they were not notified of the approval and only learned of his death days after it occurred. They noted his medical records did not substantiate the \"severe peripheral neuropathy\" listed on his death certificate as a qualifying factor.\n\n\"This whole process came to us as a shock,\" said Joseph Caprara, Vafaeian’s stepfather.\n\nIn 2021, eligibility for MAID was expanded to include applicants with \"grievous and irremediable conditions\" whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable. The family is now advocating for the repeal of this \"Track 2\" provision and the passage of Bill C-218, a legislative effort to restrict MAID for patients whose underlying issue is solely mental illness.\n\nPope Leo Xiv Says He’s ‘Very Disappointed’ After Illinois Approves Assisted Suicide Law\n\n\"Realistically, safeguards for patients would be reaching out to their family members, giving them a whole bunch of different treatment options,\" Marsilla said. Instead, she claims the current system allows doctors to approve and euthanize patients within 90 days on Track 2.\n\n\"How is that safe for patients?\" she asked.\n\nMarsilla has shared her son's story on social media, describing the situation as \"disgusting on every level.\"\n\nOn Facebook, she wrote, \"No parent should ever have to bury their child because a system—and a doctor—chose death over care, help, or love.\"\n\nClick Here For More Coverage Of Media And Culture\n\nCaprara said their family hopes sharing their story will expose the risks these laws pose to the \"vulnerable and disabled\" and give states and other countries pause before implementing similar legislation.\n\n\"We don't want to see any other family member suffer, or any country introduce a piece of legislation that kills their disabled or vulnerable without appropriate proper treatment plans that could save their lives,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Dr. Wiebe said, \"Like my colleagues, every patient I approve for Track 2 has unbearable suffering from a grievous and irremediable medical condition (not psychiatric) with an advanced state of decline in capability and consents to MAID fully informed about treatments to reduce the suffering.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an assisted suicide bill into law on Monday, making New York the 13th state, plus the District of Columbia, to legalize allowing physicians to aid terminally ill adults in dying by suicide. The law will go into effect in six months.\n\nOriginal article",

    "title": "How DuckDuckGo's New Encrypted Voice AI Chat Compares With ChatGPT and Gemini",
    "description": "Duck.ai's voice chat preserves your privacy, but can't compete with similar options from other companies.",
    "fullText": "While OpenAI is pushing ads on its free users, DuckDuckGo's Duck.ai portal is going a different way. Duck.ai is a privacy-first AI chatbot that doesn't use your data for training, but still gives you AI answers using popular models, including those from OpenAI. The data privacy feature goes beyond as well. DuckDuckGo removes all private metadata (like your location and IP address) before prompting the AI model, and it doesn't share anything about you or your device. Your questions, as well as DuckDuckGo's answers, are never used for AI training.\n\nSince its launch in 2024, the portal has only offered a chatbot interface, but now, DuckDuckGo has added a voice mode as well. With voice chat, instead of reading through long and meandering answers, the AI replies in short, to-the-point snippets that are relevant to your query. Duck.ai's take on the feature is competing with those from companies like OpenAI and Google, and it's free—though expanded limits are offered for DuckDuckGo subscribers.\n\nDuck.ai's voice chat is opt-in, not mandatory. In fact, you can even use it without a DuckDuckGo account. To try it, head to the Duck.ai portal, then from the sidebar, choose the voice chat option and enable it for your account.\n\nNow, when you click the \"New Voice Chat\" button in the sidebar, Duck.ai's bot will appear. You can start speaking, and the bot will reply to you. Just like ChatGPT or Gemini, this is a continuous voice chat, so you don't need to perform any action to ask follow-up questions. You can also interrupt the AI answer to add clarifications or to ask more questions.\n\nWhile the text prompts let you choose the models (including OpenAI's ChatGPT 5-mini), it's not clear exactly what powers voice chat. DuckDuckGo says that it uses an OpenAI model, but doesn't specify which one it is.\n\nOf course, the real question is how Duck.ai's voice chat holds up against Gemini and ChatGPT. For general knowledge questions, Duck.ai holds its own, but it falters when it comes to the latest news. I asked all three services the same questions, and while some responses were similar, ChatGPT's voice mode offers the best overall user experience by far.\n\nI tested the voice chat features using three different kinds of questions. First, I asked about the upcoming Samsung S26 series; second, we talked about the Roman Empire; and lastly, I asked for some advice on how to get started with coding.\n\nWhen it comes to asking questions about news, like Samsung's S26 release, DuckDuckGo's limitations are immediately evident. It sometimes flat out refuses to answer, saying its knowledge cutoff is 2023. Other times, it gives vague responses about the upcoming event, suggesting I check news sites for the latest information. When pressed for details, like when the event is or the rumors surrounding it, it goes back to its cut-off period excuse.\n\nChatGPT's app, however, gave me a detailed response with all the latest rumors, as well as articles to read for additional information—basically, what you'd expect from an AI assistant. Gemini Live provided shorter responses than ChatGPT, though they were accurate. I was able to get Gemini to give me more details in the regular text mode, which reads aloud results if you ask questions using the Mic button, but this defeats the back-and-forth purpose of a voice mode.\n\nDuck.ai didn't fare much better when I asked about the Roman Empire. I asked for a brief overview of the subject, before cutting it off to just ask who the last emperor was. It answered correctly (Romulus Augustulus), and its overview was fine, but lacked details about the transitionary period and exact dates.\n\nAgain, ChatGPT gave me a much more detailed answer (as demonstrated by the screenshot below). Gemini Live's answer, however, was devoid of any real dates, or meaning. Mic mode offered more details, but Google's voice mode was quite limited.\n\nDuck.ai performed better when I asked it about learning how to code. It followed a very similar script to ChatGPT and Gemini, suggesting I learn Python, even offering the same sources for learning (e.g. freeCodeCamp and Harvard CS50 courses).\n\nGemini Live was the outlier here, though, asking follow-up questions about what I'd like to build or practice. It then changed its answers based on my project ideas (switching from Python to JavaScript as the first language I should learn to build web projects). ChatGPT provided an overview, again focusing on Python, and elaborated on the language's barrier to entry when I asked \n\nDuck.ai's voice chat feature is a mixed bag. It can be fast, doesn't use any personal information, and lets you interrupt it. But its limited knowledge base and its inability to give detailed answers are what make it tough to recommend. For the smoothest voice mode experience, ChatGPT is still the king. While DuckDuckGo has the advantage for privacy, you could always use ChatGPT while logged out or in temporary mode to limit the data you share with OpenAI.",

    "description": "The new feature is called \"Playlist Playground.\"",
    "fullText": "Over the years, Apple Music has improved its algorithmic playlists. There's now an AI DJ, and you can use ChatGPT to generate playlists. With iOS 26.4, which is currently in beta, Apple wants you to make playlists with its own AI tech. The upcoming update includes a feature called \"Playlist Playground,\" which lets you generate AI playlists directly in the Apple Music app—as long as you're running iOS 26.4.\n\nI do not recommend installing and running beta versions of iOS on your primary iPhone. Beta software is unfinished, which means you could run into bugs and glitches that may impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss. If you're itching to try out new features, it's best to ensure that you've taken a complete backup of your iPhone first. That way, you can always revert to an older installation in case something goes wrong. Even so, it's safer to run test software on a backup iPhone as opposed to your daily driver.\n\nWith that said, if you're sure you want to go ahead and install iOS 26.4 right now, you can go to Settings > General > Software Update on your iPhone. Select Beta Updates > iOS 26 Developer Beta. Now, go back to the Software Update page and wait until you see iOS 26.4 Beta 1 appear. You can now download and install the update to try this new Apple Music feature.\n\nOnce you're on iOS 26.4, you can open the Music app to get started with this feature. Tap the Library tab in the bottom bar, and then select the New Playlist button in the top-right corner. You should see the Playlist Playground feature here. (Note that this feature may not appear on devices that don't support Apple Intelligence, or if your Apple Account is from a region where Apple has restricted the rollout of AI features.)\n\nOnce you activate the feature, you'll be able to generate playlists with AI. From here, you tell the AI what you want to listen to. You could get specific, with certain artists, songs, or genres, or ask for playlists that encompass a certain idea of mood. Apple has some pre-written prompts to get you started, such as \"hip-hop party songs,\" but you can use your own text prompts too. AI-generated playlists have 25 songs by default, and you do have the option to customize the playlist further after it's created. You'll also be able to edit the title, cover image, and the description of AI-generated playlists. These playlists can be shared with others or displayed on your Apple Music profile, just like other playlists you create on the streaming service. It's similar in concept to other AI playlist generators on platforms like Spotify or YouTube Music.\n\nWhile Apple Music's Playlist Playground feature is a good start, it's not yet available to those of us who are unwilling to install developer beta versions of iOS 26. If that's you, there are other options out there for AI generated Apple Music playlists. There's the aforementioned ChatGPT integration, of course, but you could also use a third-party app, like PlaylistAI. It has many prompts for you to get started with, and can even generate playlists from music festival posters. The app does prompt you to get a subscription, but you can skip that prompt and use the free tier to generate a playlist quickly.",

    "description": "You can set charge limits for your MacBook.",
    "fullText": "With iOS 18, Apple introduced a feature that allowed you to set a charge limit on your iPhone. The goal was to extend the lifespan of the battery, by limiting how often you fully charge it up. Batteries age with each full charging cycle, so by preventing your battery from charging to 100% every time you keep it plugged in, you can slow down that aging process, which means your device will last longer in between charges.\n\nNow, that same feature is coming to your Mac. Apple is currently testing the feature as part of macOS 26.4, which means you'll soon be able to ask macOS to stop charging your laptop once the battery level hits a specific charge level. This feature is great for anyone that keeps their MacBook plugged in all the time while working: It'll allow you to ask your MacBook to stop charging when the battery is at 80%, or at any charge level up to 100%.\n\nTo be clear, your MacBook ships with a battery optimization feature already, which is enabled by default. This feature automatically slows down your MacBook's charging speed once the charge level reaches 80%. Based on your past usage habits, macOS waits to continue charging your MacBook until it thinks you'll need to use the laptop again. So, if you plug in your MacBook at night, and you typically take it off the charger at 8 a.m., it might keep your MacBook at 80% until 7 a.m., then charge the extra 20% over the following hour.\n\nYou can check if it's enabled by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen, and going to System Settings > Battery. Click the i button next to Battery Health and you'll see that Optimized Battery Charging is enabled.\n\nBut this is all automated, based on how you use your MacBook. What makes this new charging feature different is that you set the charge limit manually. That way, if you work with your MacBook plugged in all day, it doesn't need to charge to 100% whenever it thinks it should. Instead, you can keep it at any charge limit between 80% and 100%.\n\nThis new feature is available with macOS 26.4, which is currently available in the Developer Beta channel for Mac updates. I strongly recommend against installing this on your primary MacBook, as issues with the beta could mean losing data or bricking your laptop. Unless Apple decides to pull the feature, it should ship to everyone with the general release of macOS 26.4.\n\nIf you have a spare MacBook where you've installed macOS 26.4 beta, you can go to System Settings > Battery, where you'll see the \"Charge Limit\" feature listed under Battery Health. Here, you can manually limit the maximum charging level between 80% and 100%.\n\nWhile Apple's methods to reduce battery aging are good enough for most people, you can do a lot more with third-party battery management apps. Those apps will allow you to do more than just set a charge limit. For instance, you can start charging the Mac when the battery hits 50% and stop charging when it's at 80%, or stop charging if the battery is too hot.",

    "description": "Spies are having a streaming moment.",
    "fullText": "Impeccable period vibes are a highlight of Ponies, the Peacock spy show starring Emilia Clarke and Haley Lu Richardson. They play a couple of housewives living in Moscow with their CIA agent husbands, at least until their spouses are killed under mysterious circumstances. In order to get to the bottom of things, the two convince the Moscow station chief that they could be useful as agents themselves. He figures, hey—who'd ever suspect a couple of secretaries? You can stream Ponies on Peacock, and then stream these stories of other unexpected spies.\n\nSet during the Cold War 1980s, and created by former CIA officer Joe Weisberg, Americans follows Soviet KGB intelligence agents Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys), living lives as an American couple in the DC metro area—and raising their American-born children. The critically acclaimed (and popular) show makes much of its period setting and a central conflict that places two spies in the heart of suburban America, even as they're tasked with undermining the Reagan-era government under which their children will grow up. Stream The Americans on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nWith this German import, we have a Cold War-era spy thriller punctuated by moments of very dark comedy. Jella Haase stars as Kleo Straub, a ruthless East German Stasi assassin who was framed for treason a couple of years before the series kicks off in 1989, and who's now free to pursue brutal revenge. Sven Petzold (Dimitrij Schaad), meanwhile, is the hapless police officer who's linked Kleo to a murder he'd been investigating, and pursues her before discovering that he's in way, way over his head. Stream Kleo on Netflix.\n\nThis genre-bender has been something of a hit for Netflix—enough to have earned a second-season renewal. Keira Knightley stars as Helen Webb, wife of the Secretary of State for Defence of the U.K., and a secret spy in the employ of the mercenary spy organization of the title. She learns from her handler (Sarah Lancashire) that her lover has been killed, thus potentially blowing her cover, but luckily she has a hitman bestie (Ben Whislaw) to help her out. It's all deliberately pulpy, with a tongue-in-cheek self-awareness that lightens the tone. Stream Black Doves on Netflix.\n\nThe series begins with CIA case officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) coming to suspect that that decorated Marine Corps scout sniper Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), recently rescued from an al-Qaeda compound, has been turned and is planning a terrorist attack on the United States. As she's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, her superiors don't give Mathison's suspicions much credence, kicking off a cat-and-mouse/is-he-or-isn't he? game between the two. Both leads won Emmys for their performances, and the series took the Outstanding Drama prize in its first year. Stream Homeland on Hulu and Netflix.\n\nA stellar miniseries with a reminder that boys can be spies, too. Based (kinda) on a true story, the show stars Hoa Xuande as the Captain (we know him only by that title), a member of the South Vietnamese army during the run-up to the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Except that he has a pretty big secret: He's a spy for the communist north, and, when he's evacuated to the United States, it's as a double agent. His new life in sunny Southern California gets very complicated as he struggles with his old loyalties and his new life. With touches of dark comedy, great performances and some absolutely brilliant direction from showrunner Park Chan-wook (Oldboy, No Other Choice), this is an impressively unconventional period spy story. Stream The Sympathizer on HBO Max.\n\nA bit of fun in the \"unlikely spy\" genre, this one stars Noah Centineo as Owen Hendricks, a nobody-in-particular young lawyer at the CIA who comes across an extortion threat from a former CIA asset in some otherwise boring paperwork. The discovery triggers a series of fast-paced, globetrotting adventures for which Hendricks is generally unprepared—always knowing more than he should, but not nearly enough to keep him out of trouble. It's an adventure show more than a thriller, mostly, and a fair bit of fun for it. Stream The Recruit on Netflix.\n\nSandra Oh and Jodie Comer star as the two halves that form one of television's great cat-and-mouse narratives, with Oh as Eve Polastri, a bored MI5 analyst who becomes obsessed with hunting down the brutal and notorious assassin known only as Villanelle. It starts as a professional compulsion before it becomes personal: Eve and Villanelle begin toying with each other, and it soon becomes clear that the fascination goes both ways—like Ponies, it's the rare spy drama with two women out in front. Stream Killing Eve on Prime Video, Paramount+, Britbox, Tubi, and Netflix.\n\nOne-upping the Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie on which it's based, Mr. & Mrs. Smith stars Donald Glover and Maya Erskine as a couple of spies tasked to pose as a married couple while coordinating (and sometimes competing against one another) on missions. Smartly, each episode takes on a standalone mission in a different location, while complicating the relationship between the two and gradually upping the stakes until the season finale, which sees them pitted against each other. The show has been renewed for season two, but it's been delayed, and it's unclear if Glover and Erskine will be returning, or if we'll be getting a new Mr. & Mrs. Stream Mr. & Mrs. Smith on Prime Video.\n\nCinematic in scope, this new adaptation of the Frederick Forsyth novel is buoyed by brilliant casting: Eddie Redmayne plays the Jackal, a steely international assassin pursued by MI6 operative Bianca Pullman, played by Lashana Lynch (putting her experience as the new 007 in No Time to Die to good use). I'm not sure there's anything here we haven't seen in countless other spy thrillers (including, of course, the 1973 and 1997 film adaptations), but the performances and production values are top-notch, with each episode playing out like a tense mini-movie. Stream The Day of the Jackal on Peacock.\n\nSplitting the difference between spy and detective genres, this show (from the works of Mick Herron, writer of the more specifically spy-centric Slow Horses novels), this one starts out as a murder mystery and builds to a rather massive government conspiracy. Emma Thompson stars as hard-living, hard-drinking private investigator Zoë Boehm, hired by Ruth Wilson's Sarah Trafford, a married art restorer whom nobody takes seriously (including and especially her husband)—even when she becomes invested in the fate of a young girl whose family is killed in a gas explosion (allegedly) down the street. The girl, whose parents were killed, disappears into the system and no one really seems to care until Sarah hires Zoë and her husband to look into it. Turns out both women are in way over their heads, as the missing girl points to a much broader conspiracy. Thompson and Wilson are a brilliantly mismatched pair, and their performances are more than worth the price of admission. Stream Down Cemetery Road on Apple TV+.",

    "fullText": "A suspect accused of shooting and killing two people at a Rhode Island ice rink on Monday before killing himself was identified as transgender and had a history of past family conflict over his gender identity, a local news outlet reported, citing court documents.\n\nCourt records show Robert Dorgan had been involved in multiple disputes with relatives in recent years, including allegations that tensions escalated after he underwent gender reassignment surgery, according to Wpri.\n\nDorgan, 56, is accused of opening fire inside the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a hockey game between Coventry and Blackstone Valley Schools in what police described as a \"family dispute,\" Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said at a press conference Monday.\n\nMom Killed Shielding Kids After Husband Erupts In Rage Over Nfl Game: Police\n\nAuthorities said two victims were killed and the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Three others were injured and remain hospitalized.\n\nA federal law enforcement source told Fox News the gunman killed his wife and shot three of his children before turning the gun on himself in what the source described as a domestic violence incident.\n\nIn 2020, Dorgan reported to North Providence police that he had undergone gender-reassignment surgery and said his father-in-law wanted him out of the family home because of it. Police identified the suspect by the birth name Robert Dorgan and said he also went by \"Roberta.\"\n\nArkansas Mom Found Shot To Death With Two Children Wrote Cryptic Facebook Post Months Before Killings\n\nAccording to court documents cited by WPRI, Dorgan alleged his father-in-law used a derogatory term for transgender individuals and threatened retaliation if he did not move out. The father-in-law was charged at the time, though prosecutors later dismissed the case.\n\nCourt filings also show Dorgan’s then-wife initially cited \"gender reassignment surgery, narcissistic + personality disorder traits\" in divorce paperwork before the grounds were amended to \"irreconcilable differences.\" The divorce was finalized in 2021. Divorce records list Dorgan as living in Jacksonville, Florida, at the time and working as a truck driver.\n\nAlso in 2020, Dorgan accused his mother of assaulting him and acting in a \"violent, threatening or tumultuous manner,\" according to police records cited by WPRI. His mother was charged with simple assault and battery and disorderly conduct, though the case was later dismissed, court records show.\n\nThe dispute was also referenced in Dorgan’s conflict with his father-in-law. According to court documents, Dorgan told police his father-in-law \"told me that if I did not drop the assault charges against my mother that further retaliation could be expected and that was another reason to have me killed.\"\n\nPolice have not said whether those past disputes were connected to Monday's violence, and investigators have not publicly identified a motive. Goncalves said the shooting \"looked like it was a family dispute\" and that detectives are still working to establish a timeline.\n\nFox News' Louis Casiano, Alexis McAdams and Bonny Chu contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "Former Ireland captain Johnny Sexton has said he does not think Edwin Edogbo \"paid too much attention\" to the racist abuse that was directed at him following his international debut.\n\nThe Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) had to turn off comments on a social media post that congratulated the Cork-born player for coming off the bench in the Six Nations game against Italy because of replies that contained racial abuse.\n\nOn Tuesday, the IRFU said it is hopeful \"we can bring something to the Gardai [Irish police]\" regarding the abuse.\n\n\"It's horrible to see that in this day and age, it still exists like that,\" said Ireland assistant coach Sexton.\n\n\"In terms of how he is, he's good. I don't think he would have paid too much attention to it, and I don't know if he would have even seen most of it.\n\n\"He's a pretty humble guy, really level-headed, but it's not right, some of the comments that were made.\n\n\"I feel for him, I feel for his family, it marred a pretty special day for him.\"\n\nIRFU keen to 'hold people to account' for racist abuse\n\nKeyboard warriors should 'cop on and help 10s' - Farrell\n\nI think Crowley starts against England - Murray\n\nSexton was speaking before Ireland's match against England on Saturday amid ongoing uncertainty over who will in the long term fill the number 10 jersey he wore with distinction.\n\nSam Prendergast has started both Six Nations games this year, but head coach Andy Farrell has Jack Crowley, Ciaran Frawley and Harry Byrne as options against England.\n\n\"It's important that they all keep developing and getting game-time,\" added Sexton, who won 118 Ireland caps.\n\n\"So there are four guys and all the criticism from previous World Cup cycles is that we didn't develop guys, and we have relied too heavily on one [player] in some positions.\n\n\"So we're doing it a different way now and whether that's right or wrong, everyone judges it by the outcome but I know that in games to come, they're going to hit their best form and they'll be in a good place.\"\n\nThe former British and Irish Lions fly-half emphasised Ireland's eagerness to have strength in depth for next year's World Cup.\n\n\"All four are very good, they've all got their different strengths and as coaches I think we are trying to make sure that we have lots of options going to a World Cup, try and learn from previous cycles and make sure that we give them all a certain number of caps,\" he added.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we see their form in different pressurised situations, in different venues against different opposition and yeah, I'm sure it will be like that for the foreseeable.\"",

Obviously, I know there's a World Cup coming up, but I've not really been a part of it recently.\n\n\"I'm not really expecting anything. I'm just enjoying myself and enjoying football again, which is the most important thing for me.\n\n\"If I can, hopefully, do some good performances, score some more goals and hopefully that is catching the eye a little bit and gives me a chance, at least.\n\n\"Obviously, it's an absolute honour to wear the badge and represent your country. It's such a privilege. Obviously, I would really love that again and to have that experience again.\n\n\"I cannot think too much on that. I have to just stay focused and do the best I can here and see what happens.\"\n\nBurke is in his third spell in Germany, having made his first move to the Bundesliga in 2016, when he joined RB Leipzeg from Nottingham Forest for what was then a record fee for a Scottish player of £13m.\n\n\"I was young, the price tag, I didn't really know too much about it,\" he recalled. \"I didn't really understand it so much at that age. As I got older, it started to weigh a little bit.\n\n\"In football, everything happens quickly. You have your good moments and then there can be bad moments.\n\n\"It's been kind of like this throughout my career. Many ups and many downs.\"\n\nBurke, who joined Union from Werder Bremen, says the experience he has in Germany has developed him.\n\n\"I almost feel like a different player, but obviously that comes with maturing,\" he said. \"Knowing your job better and being more effective in your role, defensively as well.\n\n\"It's just about adapting really.\"\n\nIn 2019, Burke had a spell on loan to Celtic, who play Stuttgart on Thursday in the Europa League play-off, and he is predicting a difficult tie for his former club.\n\n\"Stuttgart are not an easy team,\" he said. \"They're doing brilliantly this season.\n\n\"Celtic are an amazing club. I love the club. I still watch here and there.\n\n\"I watched the Kilmarnock game the other day. I was saying to my wife 'they're going to score in the last minute' because it's just Celtic typical.\"\n\nKirkcaldy-born Burke also had a stint with Alaves in Spain after his time with Celtic.\n\n\"When you move abroad, it's also important to try and embed yourself into the culture quickly and become close with your team-mates as fast as you can,\" he added.\n\n\"Create a bond, not just on the pitch but off it as well, so that you feel more comfortable and you feel more at home.\"",

    "fullText": "As statements go, it was pretty emphatic.\n\nMuch of the build-up to the biggest and most-anticipated game of the Championship season was all about who had the mental edge. Who would deal with the pressure? Who would produce when it mattered most?\n\nWould it be off-colour Coventry City, who has seen a 10-point lead at the top crumble into a two-point gap to new leaders Middlesbrough?\n\nOr Boro, who had strutted to the summit off the back of six wins in a row?\n\nHaji Wright's hat-trick, the backbone of the Sky Blues' superb 3-1 win at the CBS Arena on Monday, roared out the answer.\n\nCoventry City are back. Back to winning. Back to their best. Back to the top.\n\nWith 14 games to go, plenty can still change with Coventry's lead only one point.\n\nBut what does seem increasingly clear is that the to-and-fro between the division's top two teams, five points clear of the rest, is set to provide a thrilling stage for the title race.\n\nBBC Sport picks through the reaction and how both sides might approach the rest of the campaign.\n\n\"Feels great. Top of the table, three points, nothing better.\"\n\nUSA international Wright picked the perfect night to end his cold snap in front of goal.\n\nHaving struck just twice since early December, the 27-year-old's treble - with goals on 21, 55 and 71 minutes from the penalty spot - ensured Boro never got closer than Riley McGree's fine effort making it 2-1 on 67 minutes.\n\n\"It was a great performance from the team, from everybody in the stadium. It only felt like it could end one way,\" Wright told BBC CWR.\n\n\"I'm coming off a bit of a cold streak, so scoring three goals at the CBS [Arena] is a great feeling. I'm happy it turned into three points.\"\n\nWright highlighted Coventry's \"energy and aggression\" and Boro's trouble dealing with that.\n\n\"[It was a] Statement performance against a great team,\" he said.\n\n\"But it is only three points and we still have so many more games until the end of the season.\"\n\nLegendary Sky Blues goalkeeper Steve Orgizovic knows a thing or two about big moments and he was impressed by his old team's approach to such an important occasion.\n\n\"Coventry were brilliant in the first half - they got the press right and upset Middlesbrough in possession and got the goals at the right time,\" he told BBC CWR.\n\n\"The second half was a bit more of a slog but everything just felt right.\n\n\"The occasion was tremendous, with a fantastic atmosphere and you knew both sides would be at it.\"\n\nOgrizovic added that Wright's performance was central to Coventry making the most of their crucial moments.\n\n\"Big players turn up for big games,\" he said.\n\n\"Two good goals from open play and then ice-cold blood running through his veins for the penalty. A brilliant hat-trick.\"\n\nOgrizovic echoed Lampard's desire to see their home form replicated on the road where they have not won since beating Boro 4-2 at the Riverside in November.\n\n\"Our problem's been away from home. They've got to find a different way of doing things and rediscover the winning way,\" he said.\n\nDespite seeing the end of their six-match winning run, Boro still have a five-point buffer to third-placed Millwall.\n\nFormer Middlesbrough midfielder Neil Maddison says fans can take plenty of heart from their form in 2026.\n\n\"We have a good squad and, for me, there is a long, long way to go,\" Maddison told BBC Radio Tees.\n\n\"Coventry fans are singing 'we are top of the league'. Yes they are but just for now. There is still a long way to go.\n\n\"This result builds momentum and it will for Coventry. This Championship will change.\n\n\"It will bounce up and down and I have seen enough of this [Boro] side this season to know that one result and they are not done.\n\n\"One result does not change anything.\n\n\"We are still in a fantastic position and we now have to go on another run and that's all it is. There are 14 games left and a lot of points to play for.\"\n\nFor Sky Blues boss Frank Lampard, all his plans could not have come together better.\n\n\"We got what we deserved out of the game. It was a big performance from minute one all the way through,\" he told BBC CWR.\n\n\"The energy of the team was immense, and the organisation.\n\n\"It's a really difficult game against Boro, they're in great form... and in games like this where it's tight, two good teams going against each other, it's so important to be clinical in the right moments.\n\n\"It sounds simple but we haven't been so clinical in the last period and that leads to the results we've had. Tonight we were clinical.\n\n\"It's a great feeling, we just have to take it forward.\"\n\nAnd that is the key now for Lampard - in particular improving their results away from home that has seen them go seven games without a win.\n\n\"Now we have to take it on the road,\" he said.\n\n\"The reason we are only just clear is our away form. We need to take a lot of the good things from tonight and take them forward when we travel.\"\n\nLatest Coventry City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Coventry City content on BBC Sounds\n\nAs deflated as Boro and their fans may be feeling, two home games against relegation-threatened Oxford United and Leicester City coming up next, present the chance to get back on track.\n\nAnd defender Luke Ayling has challenged his team-mates to build another winning run.\n\n\"We are not going to win 14 games on the bounce at this level,\" he told BBC Radio Tees.\n\n\"Coventry had a 14-point lead at one stage [so] we know that there are going to be loads of ups and downs.\n\n\"But we have to try and put it right on Saturday. While it would have been nice to win we knew that we couldn't win the league tonight.\"\n\nCoventry were clinical with their chances but a mix-up between Ayling and goalkeeper Sol Brynn for the hosts' second summed up a less-than-perfect display.\n\n\"The goal was really poor from me and Sol and it is down to us to look back at it,\" Ayling added.\n\n\"We had a little disagreement of course we did – we are two men trying to win a game of football. But we will sort that out and try to put it right.\"\n\nBoro head coach Kim Hellberg - who suffered just a fifth defeat in 16 games in charge - was also keen to see the bigger picture and is sure his side will be remain in the title race.\n\n\"You compete in this league, you are going to lose some games,\" he said.\n\n\"It is how we bounce back from it. We are in a very good position and will use the energy from this game to develop from it.\n\nSo will Coventry. So will the title race. So will the drama.",

    "fullText": "Republic of Ireland women's manager Carla Ward said she would be \"supportive\" of her players if they had concerns over facing Israel.\n\nHeimir Hallgrimsson's Republic of Ireland men's side were drawn with Israel in the Nations League, along with Austria and Kosovo, last week.\n\nIn November, the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) overwhelmingly approved a motion to call on Uefa to ban Israel from European club and international competitions, but it will fulfil the Nations League fixtures on 27 September and 4 October.\n\nIn a statement following the draw, the FAI said it had consulted with Uefa and that sanctions for not fulfilling a fixture could lead to disqualification from the Nations League.\n\nWard said it was \"a very difficult situation for all\" and that if her squad faced the same issue, she would listen to any potential concerns from players.\n\n\"I support my players in all their decisions, football and non-football,\" she said.\n\n\"Personal lives and politically, whatever they feel, I would usually sit down and have those conversations behind closed doors and we come to a solution.\n\n\"Like I said, I'm supportive of all the players in everything they do.\"\n\nWard said she would leave the FAI to answer questions on the Israel fixture and her job, and that of Hallgrimsson's, was to focus on the football.\n\n\"I'm big on open-door policy and open communication with my players. I always have been, no matter what the subject is, and I will continue to do so.\n\n\"I like to think I help players in a way to make them feel as comfortable as possible.\n\n\"If they have a view or opinion, or want to have a say, then I'll support that.\"\n\nRepublic of Ireland trio return for qualifiers\n\nWard also spoke about Katie McCabe's future at Arsenal after it emerged she is set to leave the club in the summer when her contract expires.\n\nMcCabe, who joined Arsenal as a teenager in 2015, has won every major honour in her time in north London, including the Champions League and Club World Cup in the past 12 months.\n\nWard said that the 30-year-old is \"one of the best left-backs in the world\" and that she had discussed the future with her captain.\n\n\"I think she will have a lot of options and I think a lot of people will want to speak to her and want her signature,\" said Ward.\n\n\"The beauty of it is when you are one of the best in the world you will not be short of options.\n\n\"Wherever she moves, in my opinion, it will be a top club getting a very top player.\"\n\nThe Republic of Ireland open their World Cup qualifying campaign at home to France on 3 March and also take on the Netherlands and Poland in League A2.\n\nWard said the goal was to finish in the top three in the group, which would mean a first-round play-off against a League C side.\n\n\"We can't get ahead of ourselves and say winning the group or being in the top two is where we should be,\" Ward added.\n\n\"I'm always upbeat, and we have a real opportunity to test ourselves against the very, very best.\n\n\"What an opportunity, and it's a challenge we're really looking forward to.\"",

    "description": "Nottingham Forest boss Vitor Pereira says \"he trusts my work, I trust his personality\" as he is reunited with Evangelos Marinakis.",
    "fullText": "\"Pleasure to be here, back to the fight,\" said Vitor Pereira with a smile.\n\nPereira was speaking to the media for the first time since signing an 18-month deal to become Nottingham Forest's fourth manager of the season.\n\nIt is just 161 days since Nuno Espirito Santo was sacked, having fallen out with owner Evangelos Marinakis and global sporting director Edu.\n\nAnge Postecoglou and Sean Dyche have since come and gone in a tempestuous season of struggle.\n\nNow Forest, who are just one place above the relegation zone, have turned to former Wolves boss Pereira.\n\nThe 57-year-old breezed into the City Ground on Tuesday well aware of the challenge - to keep the club up, and keep Marinakis happy.\n\nPereira is back in management just over three months after being sacked by Wolves, who at that point had taken just two points after 10 games.\n\nHe regrets not stepping down before the start of the season - first frustrated by what he perceived as the club moving too slowly to secure signings, then unhappy with the players they did deliver.\n\nHe still signed off on all the deals - pushing, in particular, for winger Jhon Arias, who was sold to Palmeiras earlier this month - but felt he never got his first choices.\n\nThere are parellels with Nuno's exit from Forest - both were disillusioned with transfer business - but there should be no surprises or secrets between Pereira and Marinakis.\n\nPereira worked under the Forest owner at Olympiakos in 2015. It was only a six-month relationship, but still delivered a domestic double.\n\nHe left Olympiakos for Fenerbahce, who Forest face visit in the Europa League on Thursday, in the summer of 2015 - but reflects on that being a mistake as he jumped around clubs in a desire to make it to the Premier League.\n\nOne of his key tasks at Forest is to manage upwards, and understand the owner.\n\n\"He is ambitious. He wants to win. Emotional... I know him very well,\" he said.\n\n\"I remember the energy and the fire we created. In Greece, there is a fire inside - they like to see the energy. He asked me to be myself. He liked the way when we worked together we won the league and cup.\n\n\"It was in the middle of the season and we created a good relationship. He trusts my work, I trust his personality. I think we need passion too.\"\n\nMarinakis had hoped Dyche would bring stability, but he failed to win over Forest's expensively assembled squad.\n\nDespite averaging nearly 1.5 points per game during his tenure, players were concerned about his training methods and focus on physicality and running.\n\nPlayers' opinions were canvassed after the defeat by Leeds earlier this month, and a number were summoned to see Marinakis following the 0-0 draw against Wolves on Wednesday.\n\nPereira has already spoken to his squad about the need for togetherness.\n\n\"If you buy the idea, it's a good step,\" he said. \"If you don't buy the idea of the manager, it's a big problem - and you must also buy the personality.\n\n\"If you buy the idea and the person, you have an open mind to receive information and to work hard together, it's possible to achieve what we want.\n\n\"Football is much more than tactical things. It's about connecting with people specially doing that - to fight for a target together with commitment.\n\n\"It's about connecting the supporters, with the team, club and city, to create the energy for everybody to believe in themselves, to create a good environment to work, and tactical ideas of course.\n\n\"I cannot change a lot because in a short time it's a mistake [to try] but with clear ideas and good communication we can do it.\"\n\nPereira will be on familiar ground for Thursday's Europa League play-off, having managed the Turkish side for 86 games over two spells.\n\nForest need an instant impact, and despite leaving Wolves in November after not winning a Premier League game since April, he proved there he can make a difference at a struggling club.\n\nAt Molineux, he won 12 of his 25 matches - drawing four and losing nine - after taking over when they were five points from safety in December 2024.\n\nWolves were 13 points behind Manchester United and 14 points adrift of Tottenham at that stage but finished level with the Red Devils and four points above Spurs - 17 clear of danger.\n\nChampions Liverpool visit the City Ground on Sunday - and Forest's three-point lead over West Ham in the final relegation spot could have disappeared by then as the Hammers face Bournemouth on Saturday.\n\nRelegation was not in the thinking after a seventh-placed finish last season - and Pereira needs to start well.\n\nHe said: \"I cannot change a lot in this moment of the season. It's important the players feel they can help the team with their qualities. It's important they express themselves.\n\n\"Passion is something which sleeps me with, wakes up with me. I came with intention to give everything for myself, my body and my soul to help the club. Together we can do it.\"\n\nIf Forest survive, there will be celebrations - and while at Wolves Pereira coined the phrase 'first the points, then the pints', having drunk with fans after wins.\n\nHe added: \"This is something about my personality. I'm not an actor. I'm a simple guy, an honest guy... confident, and when I feel I deserve the pints, of course.\"",

We can't cut corners.\"\n\nTandy 'needs help' - Wales' hunt for defence coach\n\nWales v Scotland - your guide to the Six Nations date\n\nScotland game chance for Wales to 'deliver better'\n\nWales have lost five of six games under Tandy to Argentina, New Zealand, South Africa, England and France, who are all in the top six of World Rugby's rankings.\n\nWilson was encouraged by aspects of the performance in Sunday's defeat by France but admits the 54-12 scoreline \"stings\".\n\nThe assistant coach insists there are no quick fixes and that they are putting foundations in place.\n\n\"I'm long enough in the tooth to know it wasn't going to be a smooth ride. It was going to have its bumps and I'm prepared for that,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"What we've got to stay focused on is working hard to make the improvements we need to make to get this amazing rugby nation back to what it's been.\"\n\nWales now face a Scotland team who are ninth in the world rankings, just two spots ahead of them, but buoyed by their Calcutta Cup win against the English.\n\nGregor Townsend's men are title contenders after an impressive response to an opening weekend disappointment in Rome.\n\nNonetheless, the Scotland boss remains under pressure despite travelling to Cardiff with title hopes.\n\nWilson was one of Townsend's assistants between 2018 and 2020 while he also had a spell in charge of Glasgow, so is well-placed to assess the threats posed by the visitors.\n\n\"I learned a huge amount from Gregor while I was there. He's an attack-minded coach, there's no doubt about that,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"The next step that he is pushing for is to break into the top three of the Six Nations more regularly, but I think he's done a very good job.\n\n\"They've produced a good squad, with some of the individuals they've found with Scottish-qualified players and people more local in the system. They've had some really good performances and wins.\n\n\"They're littered with Lions. I've worked with them and know how good their players are.\"",

    "fullText": "The Godfather, Apocalypse Now…A Shot at Glory.\n\nLegendary Hollywood actor Robert Duvall will probably be remembered by most for his roles as mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in the first two editions of Francis Ford Coppola's gangster trilogy or as Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore in the same director's 1979 Vietnam war epic.\n\nHowever, among Scottish football circles, the veteran actor, who died on Monday aged 95, will also be remembered fondly for playing Gordon McLeod – a beleaguered Scottish football manager attempting to take lowly Kilnockie FC to Scottish Cup glory with the help of mercurial striker Jackie McQuillan, played by Rangers legend Ally McCoist.\n\nWhile recording football drama A Shot at Glory in 1999 and 2000, which also starred Hollywood A-listers Michael Keaton and Brian Cox alongside Scottish football household names such as Owen Coyle, Didier Agathe and Derek Ferguson, Duvall immersed himself in the country's football culture.\n\nIndeed, the actor popped up at grounds across the country as he prepared for his role, as well as filming at a number of stadiums including former Dumbarton ground, Boghead Park, Kilmarnock's Rugby Park, Queen of the South's Palmerston Park and Hampden Park.\n\nAn appearance as a pundit on BBC Scotland Sportscene in 1999, as well as a 2012 Sky Sports interview in which he revealed that he had named a dog after Celtic legend Jimmy Johnstone added to his unlikely place in Scottish football lore.\n\nWhen Robert Duvall fell in love with Scottish football\n\nDuvall's passing was announced on Monday and was met with tributes from the likes of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro - who both starred alongside him in The Godfather - Adam Sandler and Oscar-winner Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nAlongside getting his flowers from the great and the good of Hollywood, A Shot at Glory co-star McCoist also spoke to TalkSport about his close relationship with Duvall.\n\n\"I was gutted,\" said the former Rangers striker.\n\n\"The first thing you have got to say is what an innings. 95. But what a guy. What a man he was. When we did that film, A Shot at Glory, we filmed it all over Scotland and it was just so much fun.\n\n\"The lads that we did it with, a lot of them were pros, Airdrie and Raith Rovers a lot of the boys played with and he just became one of the boys.\n\n\"Whenever there was a break, he'd set up a heady tennis court and he'd just pull up a chair and he'd watch the boys playing heady tennis.\n\n\"He'd love the craic, he'd love all the patter. He used to take all the boys to dinner.\"\n\nMcCoist also revealed that Duvall and his wife Luciana used to send a Christmas card to his family every year.\n\nIn A Shot at Glory, McCoist - who is Rangers' leading all-time goal scorer - plays an ageing and temperamental former Celtic striker, McQuillan, who is brought in by Duvall's character McLeod to improve Kilnockie's fortunes despite fears about his temperament on and off the field.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the club's American owners threatening to relocate the team to Dublin, McLeod and McQuillan lead the minnows to a Scottish Cup final against Rangers.\n\nFormer Celtic midfielder Didier Agathe was cast as a Rangers player and Owen Coyle, who played for several Scottish clubs as a striker, appears in the Kilnockie FC squad.\n\nAnd in 1999, while filming for the movie took place, Duvall appeared as a studio pundit alongside McCoist on BBC Scotland's Sportscene for the Old Firm Scottish Cup Final. Giving his prediction, the Hollywood actor sat on the fence.\n\n\"I'm kind of neutral,\" he told presenter, Dougie Donnelly.\n\n\"It would be wonderful if Rangers won the treble. I just have a feeling that Rangers better be ready because the Celtics are out for revenge.\"\n\nRangers won the game 1-0 to deny their city neighbours a single title in what was a painful season for the Bhoys.\n\nDuring the same appearance, he revealed that he had also been at Celtic Park the previous year to watch Hearts beat Rangers 2-1 in the Scottish Cup final.\n\nIn 2012, Duvall again showed split loyalties. Appearing at the Etihad Stadium for the Manchester derby alongside Jack Reacher co-star Tom Cruise, the Hollywood great revealed that he had named a dog after former Celtic forward, Jimmy Johnstone.\n\nJohnstone, nicknamed 'Jinky' for his dribbling, was one of Celtic's 'Lisbon Lions' team who famously won the European Cup in 1967.\n\n\"I can safely say the greatest character I ever met in my life, and I've met a lot, was 'wee' Jimmy Johnstone,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\nDuvall made his first screen appearance as Boo Radley in the 1963 film adaptation of Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird and won the Oscar for best actor in 1983 for playing a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.",

    "fullText": "England wing Henry Arundell has been backed to \"play super well\" in Saturday's Six Nations clash with Ireland at Twickenham after keeping his place despite a red card last weekend.\n\nCoach Steve Borthwick has kept faith with the 23-year-old after he was shown two yellow cards in the 31-20 Six Nations defeat by Scotland.\n\nArundell was sin-binned for not releasing his opponent early on in the match and then received a second yellow for taking out Kyle Steyn in the air.\n\nThe Bath wing received an automatic 20-minute red card that meant his team-mates played with 14 men for a total of 30 minutes.\n\nBorthwick has made three changes to his starting XV for the Ireland game but kept faith with the exciting wing.\n\nHe said: \"Saturday [against Scotland] didn't go the way he wanted it to, the way I wanted it to go for him, and he was bitterly disappointed as we all were. Now we back him to go and play super well this weekend.\n\n\"I want the ball in his hands. Every England supporter will want the ball in his hands in a bit of space this weekend.\"\n\nA disciplinary hearing on Tuesday found that \"no further sanction was appropriate\", freeing Arundell to play.\n\nA statement said: \"The player accepted that he had committed the acts of foul play that resulted in the showing of the two yellow cards.\n\n\"In the circumstances (including that the first yellow card had been issued for a 'technical offence', and that the second yellow card had been issued for a very different act of foul play), [it was decided that] the sending off of the player had been a sufficient sanction.\"\n\nArundell has scored four tries in two games - a hat-trick against Wales and England's opening try at Murrayfield - and is the top scorer in the Six Nations so far.\n\nThere are two things to consider about Arundell keeping his place after a red card.\n\nOne is the need for a bit of pace and spark in the back three. Freddie Steward and Tom Roebuck have loads of great parts to their game but neither are blessed with genuine pace.\n\nIt's about balance. Steve Borthwick likes to have one aerial winger (Roebuck, Tommy Freeman) and one with a bit of X-factor (Arundell, Immanuel Feyi-Waboso).\n\nAlso I imagine Borthwick is conscious of denting Arundell's confidence by dropping him after his travails in Edinburgh.\n\nPollock, Curry and Lawrence to start for England v Ireland - reaction & Chris Jones Q&A\n\nFive talking points from round two of Six Nations",

    "fullText": "UFC legend Ronda Rousey will fight Gina Carano in May - a decade after she retired from MMA.\n\nThe bout between the two icons will be staged at the 18,000-seat Intuit Dome in California and will be the first MMA fight to be streamed live on Netflix.\n\nRousey, 39, is considered the biggest female MMA star of all time and was the first woman to sign with the UFC and win a UFC belt.\n\n\"Been waiting so long to announce this: me and Gina Carano are going to throw down in the biggest super-fight in women's combat sport history,\" Rousey said.\n\nThe bout on 16 May will be over five rounds at 145lb (10st 5lb).\n\nRousey is a decorated all-round athlete, having also won an Olympic gold medal in judo and competed in the WWE after retiring from MMA at the age of 29.\n\nAfter a five-year unbeaten streak, Rousey lost her UFC bantamweight title to Holly Holm in a shock defeat and when she was beaten by Amanda Nunes in her comeback the following year, she retired from MMA.\n\n'More than a fighter' - how Rousey finally found peace\n\nIn 2025, Rousey admitted severe concussion problems led to her retirement from MMA.\n\nFor long-time MMA fans, Rousey v Carano is the super-fight that never happened, with the latter retiring a few years before her fellow American made her professional debut.\n\nThe UFC tried to make the match-up when Rousey was at the height of her powers, but were unable to reach terms.\n\nRousey has a 12-2 record while 43-year-old Carano is 7-1, with her only loss against Cris Cyborg in her last bout in 2009.\n\nCarano, who became an actor after retiring, said Rousey approached her about the fight.\n\n\"Ronda came to me and said there is only one person she would make a comeback for and it has been her dream to make this fight happen between us,\" said Carano.\n\n\"She thanked me for opening up doors for her in her career and was respectful in asking for this fight to happen.\n\n\"This is an honour. I believe I will walk out of this fight with the win and I anticipate it will not come easy, which I welcome.\n\n\"This is as much for Ronda and me as it is for the fans and mixed martial arts community. What a time to be alive.\"\n\nCarano recently settled a lawsuit with Disney after she was dismissed in 2021 from her role in Star Wars franchise spin-off The Mandalorian following comments she made comparing being a Republican in the US to being a Jew during the Holocaust.\n\nJake Paul's promotional outfit, Most Valuable Promotions, will organise the event in its first foray into MMA.\n\n\"Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano are the two most formative figures in the history of women's MMA; they are the icons who shattered the glass ceiling and helped build the foundation this sport stands on,\" said Paul and Nakisa Bidarian in a joint statement.\n\n\"MVP's conviction in women's boxing was driven by the success achieved by Ronda Rousey, who was the biggest star of the entire sport of MMA during her career.\"\n\nThe fight is certainly past its sell-by date and it is hard to imagine what the quality of the contest will look like considering both women are very far removed from their last competitive fight.\n\nBut once upon a time it was a bout every MMA fan wanted to see. Rousey utterly transformed MMA, but fighters like Carano laid the foundation for her.\n\nRousey's star quality is still off the charts and she is still one of the biggest MMA fighters out there despite being retired since 2016.\n\nIt cannot be overstated how big a star she was in the UFC at her height. Only Jon Jones or Conor McGregor could overshadow her.\n\nShe has a hallowed place in the UFC and her WWE run and the fanfare around the release of her autobiography in 2024 show she still has a massive profile.\n\nNetflix's strategy for fights is quite simple - use the profile of combat sports' biggest stars to produce one-off, massive events. Jake Paul kicked off that strategy against Mike Tyson. Then came Terence Crawford, Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury.\n\nThere will be questions about Rousey's health. Her concussion problems formed a key part of her autobiography. But this isn't Paul v Tyson or Paul v Joshua.\n\nThere is no concerning age gap or disturbing quality discrepancy and both women will undergo strict pre-fight medical tests.\n\nKatie Taylor v Amanda Serrano reached about six million viewers on Netflix. That will be the benchmark for Rousey v Carano.\n\nThis will undoubtedly be advertised as a fantasy fight finally delivered.\n\nThe likelihood of a devastating knockout for either woman seems unlikely. It should be as advertised - for one-night only, two legends collide.\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Green apples and honey, ginger and lemon tea.\n\nThey may sound like they form the diet of a professional athlete, but they are also the secret weapons of football commentators and co-commentators keeping their voices in perfect condition.\n\nThese days, however, they don't just have to sound their best for real-life games.\n\nGremlin Interactive's groundbreaking Actua Soccer in 1995, which featured BBC Sport duo Barry Davies and Trevor Brooking on the mic, was the first football video game to feature a running match commentary, albeit a basic one.\n\nWhat might have been a gimmick became part of an ongoing quest for realism, evolving over the decades through the long-running Pro-Evo Soccer and Fifa series of games, to EA Sports FC and Konami's eFootball.\n\nCommentary has become part of the experience of millions of gamers on dozens of different titles down the years, providing a reaction for everything from praise of a glorious goal or - more likely - criticism if you miss an easy chance.\n\nBut how is it put together now so it sounds real?\n\n\"That's a terrible shot,\" groans Guy Mowbray. \"What were they thinking!?\" adds Sue Smith, to emphasise exactly how much you messed up.\n\nYou might think it is obvious their comments are nothing personal because when those lines were recorded for the EA Sports FC series - currently the world's most-played football video game - the pair were describing action they have never even seen, to be heard by people in every corner of the planet.\n\nHowever, it seems many do take it to heart.\n\n\"I have had some of my mates' kids message me randomly going, 'you just told me off for shooting from 30 yards' and I am like, 'what?',\" Smith, who is a regular guest summarising real-life action on Sky's Soccer Saturday, tells BBC Sport. \"Then I realise it is the game.\n\n\"It's the same when I meet strangers, or on social media - it shows the impact of the game, how many people play it, and how immersive it is. I think sometimes people genuinely believe you are in their bedrooms or somehow watching them play live.\"\n\nThat's the level of realism that makers Electronic Arts strive for, and is the reason Mowbray and Smith dedicate so much time to making their commentary and co-commentary sound as authentic as possible.\n\nThe first edition of the game the pair worked on came out in 2024. They started work on it more than a year earlier, and have been working on it ever since.\n\nThere is a new version released every 12 months - the latest came out in September 2025 - but as Mowbray and Smith explained, it keeps them busy all year round.\n\nMowbray, who has commentated on the Premier League for Match of the Day since 2004, says working on the game is a \"never-ending job\".\n\n\"It constantly needs updating - with new names for all the new players, plus new terminology and new features in the game,\" he said. \"It's an ever-evolving process and it's exciting to be part of it because it never stands still.\n\n\"The first video game I did the commentary for was the official Champions League game [by Take Two Interactive] for the PlayStation in 2002. I went down to Oxfordshire to record it, and it was very intensive but in three full days I did the entire game.\n\n\"Now things are very different. Either recording or doing prep, it is part of my weekly routine - pretty much every week from November all the way through to the start of July. We might have a couple of months where we are not doing anything on it before the next edition comes out, then it starts again.\n\n\"It takes so long because for every single facet of the game that you could think of, we have to cover every scenario. It is so in-depth because it has got to feel and sound real - the whole point of the game is its authenticity.\"\n\nTogether or separately, Mowbray and Smith have recording sessions every few weeks, along with game producer Paul Russell and a sound engineer.\n\nIt is all done remotely - even when Mowbray and Smith are working at the same time, he is usually in Leeds and she is in Manchester. Russell is in Canada, and the engineer might be in London.\n\n\"It's amazing how it all comes together with us being so far apart,\" Smith said. \"It's great fun when you do them but the sessions can be quite intense, lasting over four or five hours, and our voices have to be perfect.\n\n\"There have been times where we have come in and started recording but been told our voice isn't quite right, and it doesn't sound the same as it did last time.\n\n\"That makes sense, because it has got to sound exactly right within the game. If there is any sort of variation, it would probably sound quite odd, so I have never looked after my voice as much in my entire life!\n\n\"I eat a lot of green apples, which are really good for it, and also drink a lot of honey, ginger and lemon teas - anything like that. I'd never thought of it before, when I started doing co-comms for radio and TV, but when I am doing FC it is so precise that you have to make sure everything is right.\"\n\nMowbray has also become much more aware of the condition of his vocal chords.\n\n\"Doing this game has taught me so much about how the voice works,\" he added. \"Now I notice if my voice is different, and I know about the different parts of your throat and chest when you speak.\n\n\"Another new thing I have started doing in the past few years is the commentary for Gladiators, and again that is a totally different range and set of muscles that I am using. I have to be careful about doing that and the game in the same week.\"\n\nIn order for the game's commentary to sound as live and as natural as possible, producer Russell says the work of Mowbray and Smith is \"not just about recording lines\".\n\n\"We are always thinking about what is happening on the pitch,\" Russell said. \"So, what would a real commentator notice in that moment, and what tone should that moment have?\n\n\"From there, we define lots of different match situations - from the biggest goals to the smallest build-up moments and work with our commentators to create multiple natural ways those moments could be described.\"\n\nThat's where the work begins for Mowbray and Smith - before they get to the studio.\n\n\"Say there is a scenario where a team is crossing the halfway line but we don't know if it will develop into anything,\" Mowbray said.\n\n\"So, I might say, 'oh a promising attack, what could they do from here?' as a line of commentary to explain that - but we need 10 different ways of doing that, so I will have to think of another nine ways of saying it.\n\n\"It can't be scripted for me because it has got to be in my style and how I would say it in real life, so I have to think of those lines myself. It's the same for Sue on co-comms - she will need 10 different ways of adding insight or colour too.\n\n\"We have not got anything to actually watch, so there is no frame of reference when we are doing it. Instead I have to picture it in my mind's eye and think: 'What would I say?'\"\n\nGames like Actua Soccer look primitive now compared to the modern era of face-scans and movie-style graphics, and so was the process of adding the first commentary.\n\nWhen Davies first entered the studio in 1995, any realism was down to him.\n\n\"The company behind Actua Software got in touch with my agent,\" Davies, speaking to BBC Sport in 2020, explained. \"I had really no conception of what they wanted to do, or very little anyway. Then I went to see them and I actually changed the way they wanted to do it.\n\n\"I told them you cannot use the same way of identifying the player every time he touches the ball - it has got to be at different levels depending where he is on the pitch, as I would do when commentating normally.\n\n\"So I gave them about five different versions of every player's name, changing the emphasis each time. That probably gave them more work to do but, as a result, it sounded more realistic in my opinion.\"\n\nSaying each player's name in several different intonations has been one of Mowbray's more repetitive tasks over the past few years too, for use from everything from when they play a two-yard pass on the halfway line to smashing a worldie into the top corner from 25 yards - but his job is much bigger.\n\nActua Soccer had 704 players - 22 for each of the 32 men's national teams that were included - but there are more than 20,000 real male and female footballers in FC, with more being added all the time.\n\nWhile EA do give Mowbray some help here, with part of that process involving AI replicating his voice with his permission for some of the names, it is clear they don't want to lose his human touch.\n\n\"AI has long been part of our development pipeline - from animation to gameplay systems - and continues to support our teams in making better, more responsive football experiences,\" EA said. \"But when it comes to commentary and content, it's always a collaboration with our talent - not a replacement.\"\n\nInstead, it is real life they turn to for inspiration.\n\n\"There have been times when we are, say on a Champions League game, and [Russell] has specifically listened to it to get a feel of how we work together in an actual commentary, because we will try to replicate that rapport in the game. It is the little things like that that really add to the realism,\" Smith said.\n\n\"When you put your headphones on, they even play a crowd noise over the top so you have got to raise your voice over it. It helps me immerse myself even more - I am not just shouting over silence, which would never happen in real life either.\"\n\nLike the other English-language commentary pairing in the game - Derek Rae and Stewart Robson - the contributions of Mowbray and Smith involve back-and-forth chats or interruptions just like you would hear in real life.\n\n\"With the more chatty, in-game stuff, sometimes I am bouncing off what Guy is saying,\" Smith said.\n\n\"He doesn't have to be recording it at the same time as me, but they can play his line to me so I can come in off the back of it, so my levels are the same as his - and vice-versa.\"\n\nIt is evident how much they both enjoy working on the game - but listening to the end product is apparently not always quite as pleasant.\n\n\"I play the game as part of my preparation for my Match of the Day commentaries,\" Mowbray said. \"I've always done that, over many years, and before I began working on it.\n\n\"It is a bit of recreation, firstly, and a lot of fun - but it also gets into my head stuff like who plays where for different teams and in what formations.\n\n\"What I can't do now, though, is have my commentary on. Like everyone else who plays it, when I hear the commentator tell me I have done something wrong I think to myself, 'oh get lost!' but with me commentating I would literally be telling myself where to go!\n\n\"It's an odd sensation and I thought to myself that it must be psychologically damaging in some ways, so I use Derek instead.\n\n\"I know some people who have to listen to me, though. My neighbours have got two young sons - they are not particularly into football but the kids are - and I remember them saying once that every Saturday, particularly at this time of year, it feels like I have moved in.\n\n\"The kids will be playing FC all day, then Gladiators comes on and they watch that, then they go back to playing the game again, and then Match of the Day comes on - and their parents are like 'for goodness sake'.\n\n\"So, I can only apologise to anyone else who is in that situation - it's not my fault, honestly!\"\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy don't England players wear caps while batting?\n\nWhy do Premier League teams spend less in January?\n\nWhy did Alcaraz, Sinner & Sabalenka have to remove fitness trackers?",

    "fullText": "American bobsleigh veteran Elana Meyers Taylor had won everything there is to win in the sport - except for Olympic gold.\n\nThat was until Monday when, on her fifth attempt, she finally added that missing piece to her extraordinary collection.\n\nThe 41-year-old triumphed in the women's monobob to become the oldest individual Olympic champion at a Winter Games, overtaking Austrian snowboarder Benjamin Karl, 40.\n\nGold at Milan-Cortina adds to the three silver and two bronze medals she has already won across two events - the monobob and the two-woman bobsleigh - since competing at her first Games in Vancouver 16 years ago.\n\nHer combined time of 3:57:93 over four heats was enough to edge out Germany's Laura Nolte by just 0.04 seconds and compatriot Kaillie Armbruster Humphries by 0.12secs.\n\n\"Finally the gold! It took long enough, right?\" Meyers Taylor told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It just goes to show you... just to keep persevering, my team and everybody behind me, it means so much to come away as Olympic champion.\"\n\nVictory makes her the most decorated female bobsleigh pilot of all time as well as the first mother to win Olympic bobsleigh gold.\n\nThe four-time world champion is also the most decorated black athlete at a Winter Olympics and this, her sixth medal, ties her with speed skater Bonnie Blair for the most by an American woman.\n\nBut although she continues to write her name in the history books, for Meyers Taylor it is also about empowering female athletes and inspiring women.\n\nAs her gold was confirmed, Meyers Taylor sunk to her knees draped in the American flag and embraced her two young children.\n\nShe has made it no secret that her drive to continue to compete at the elite level is not only for her own family but for hard-working mothers everywhere.\n\n\"This medal is also for all those moms who weren't necessarily able to live their dreams, but their kids are now their dreams,\" she said.\n\n\"Because those people keep me grounded. Those people kept me going and those people are the ones who reach out to me when things are hard and encourage me.\"\n\nMeyers Taylor's children, Nico and Noah, are both deaf while the oldest, Nico, also has down syndrome.\n\nShe is married to former bobsledder Nic Taylor and the family travel around together on the sport's circuit for several months at a time.\n\n\"My kids have sacrificed so much. There's so many people who have helped me win this gold medal,\" she said.\n\n\"I've had different nannies throughout the years and every single one of them has done the work to help my kids get here and my husband, I can't even put into words what this means and how many people it took to win this.\"\n\nA disability advocate, Meyers Taylor said she feels encouraged by the communities she is helping to inspire.\n\n\"I've had so many people from around the world reaching out and telling me their stories and how they have a kid with down syndrome or a kid who is deaf and they believe in me - it has just been incredible,\" she said.\n\nFormer British bobsledder John Jackson, bronze medallist at Sochi 2014, knows her well from their early years on the bobsleigh circuit and said \"if there was one person on the whole circuit who I think any athlete and coach wanted to see win gold it was Elana\".\n\n\"She is not only a ferocious athlete but also a beautiful human being and a genuine person,\" he added.\n\n\"It has been a real show of dedication to keep going through the struggles of now being a mum in a high-performance sport, the dedication that takes to maintain that level of physical fitness and the hard work of being a parent. It shows her true nature.\"\n\nMeyers Taylor, who has placed on the podium six times in her five Olympic appearances, has shared it with compatriot Armbruster Humphries, 40, on five of those occasions.\n\nArmbruster Humphries, who has five Olympic medals of her own including three golds, became a mother 20 months ago and it is the first time two women over the age of 40 have finished on the podium at a Winter Games.\n\nBoth women celebrated with their children.\n\n\"You get a lot of people that like to write you off as soon as you reach 40, it's all downhill from there, is what you hear,\" she said. \"I think Elana and I are both proof that that's not true.\"\n\nThe two women are also credited with encouraging the International Olympic Committee to add the monobob to the women's schedule for the 2022 Games with the two-woman event the only one for women prior to that.\n\n\"It should be celebrated that they're both mums, using mum power, both in their early 40s and it's great to see them competing at the top of the world not only physically but the drive and experience too,\" said Jackson.\n\n\"There's a lot of younger athletes there who need to up their game to compete against these two world class athletes.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "The 2024 Grand National winner I Am Maximus heads the weights for this year's race at Aintree on 11 April.\n\nThe Willie Mullins-trained horse, owned by JP McManus, finished second last year between stablemates Nick Rockett and Grangeclare West.\n\nThe 10-year-old also headed the weights last year and will again carry 11st 12lb. No top weight has won the world's greatest steeplechase since triple victor Red Rum in 1974.\n\nIroko, who finished fourth as favourite last year behind the one-two-three for Irish trainer Mullins, has been allotted 11st 1lb and is the current favourite.\n\nBritish Horseracing Authority handicapper Martin Greenwood said: \"Last year, the first three horses home were all rated 160-plus [in pounds], and the Randox Grand National is the highest-class handicap of the season.\"\n\nI Am Maximus aims to become the ninth horse to be a multiple winner of the race.\n\n\"If successful for a second time that would almost certainly be the highest mark a horse has won off in the modern era,\" Greenwood added.\n\n\"Neptune Collonges was rated 168 after he won the Grand National in 2012 and Suny Bay was second off 170 in 1998.\n\n\"For I Am Maximus to be second last year was one of the great modern performances in the Grand National and up there with Tiger Roll's second win in 2019.\"\n\nNick Rockett (11st 11lb) has had a couple of setbacks preventing him from running since winning last year's Grand National as a 33-1 chance.\n\nOther Mullins runners towards the head of the weights include Grangeclare West (11st 10lb), Impaire Et Passe (11st 5lb), Spanish Harlem (11st 3lb) and Lecky Watson (11st 2lb), while last season's King George winner Banbridge (11st 11lb) and Haiti Couleurs (11st 10lb) are also towards the top of the list.\n\nApproximate odds: 11-2 Iroki; 12-1 I Am Maximus; 14-1 Haiti Couleurs; 16-1 Panic Attack, Nick Rockett; 20-1 Grangeclare West, Monty's Star; 22-1 Lecky Watson, Captain Cody; 25-1 Oscars Brother.\n\nGrand National 2025 result - where your horse finished\n\nIroko is owned by JP McManus but trained by Oliver Greenall and Josh Guerriero.\n\nThe seven-year-old has run twice since last year's Grand National, finishing second at Haydock in November before Jonjo O'Neill Jr rode him to victory over Firefox at Ascot in December.\n\n\"It's frustrating that we've snuck up a couple [of pounds] since the Firefox run, I feel like they've stolen those two off us, but we can't do much about that,\" said Guerriero.\n\n\"He's got a lovely weight and is guaranteed a run. I just pray that it's softer ground. He's in great form. This season, since he's had his wind op [surgery], he seems a lot better and straighter and happier.\"\n\nIroko was second at Kelso a month before last year's race and Guerriero expects to race there again in March, rather than at Cheltenham.\n\n\"One more run and we'll be there,\" he added. \"I think the most likely option is that we'll go to Kelso again.\n\n\"I would really fancy him [at Cheltenham], but I think we've got to go the easiest route really, which is probably going to be Kelso.\"\n\nGrand National 'the dream' for role model Aswat\n\nJonbon beats Pic D'Orhy in thrilling Ascot Chase",

    "fullText": "Henry Pollock has been handed his first Test start as Steve Borthwick makes three changes to his starting XV for England's Six Nations match against Ireland on Saturday at Allianz Stadium.\n\nThe 21-year-old is named at number eight alongside fellow British and Irish Lion Tom Curry, who has featured off the bench in the past six Tests, and Ben Earl in the back row.\n\nCentre Ollie Lawrence returns after missing out on selection for Saturday's crushing defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield.\n\nTommy Freeman, who started the first two rounds at outside centre, shifts back to the right wing.\n\nEngland struggled in the air against Gregor Townsend's side - which had been an area of strength during a 12-game winning run that was ended on Saturday.\n\nTom Roebuck loses his spot on the right wing after struggling to assert himself aerially.\n\nHowever Henry Arundell, who was sent off after receiving two yellow cards - the second for taking a player out in the air - is given a chance to redeem himself on the left wing.\n\nThe 23-year-old has scored four tries in the opening two rounds and was cleared to play after being cited for the incident.\n\nHead coach Steve Borthwick has been clear about his desire to use Freeman at outside centre, but the 24-year-old is arguably England's best player at winning the ball in the air and that skill have been missed.\n\nFit-again Lawrence, who missed the opening game through a knee injury, was always likely to play a role in this Six Nations after a standout performance against New Zealand in the autumn, with his powerful ball carrying a point of difference.\n\nEngland's attack failed to click against Scotland and Lawrence's strengths would have also been a factor in forcing the Freeman switch.\n\n\"It is tough. When I came in the autumn [internationals], Tommy moved to 13 and there was a bit of 'that's another person I am competing with',\" Lawrence told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"I didn't expect it. I potentially knew it might happen, I didn't think it would happen straight away and I got my opportunity in the second game and then the start of the Six Nations Tommy went back to 13.\n\n\"It's not frustrating but it's one of those things where you are knocking on the door and you have to wait your turn sometimes.\"\n\nCaptain Maro Itoje will earn his 100th cap, becoming the ninth England man to reach the milestone.\n\nHalf-backs Marcus Smith and Jack van Poortvliet both missed out on selection last week and are named on a 6-2 bench spilt.\n\nIreland, like England, have one win from their opening two games in the tournament, making the fixture pivotal for both sides to keep their championship hopes alive.\n\nI want the ball in his hands - Borthwick backs Arundell to deliver\n\nRecap: Pollock's first Test start, retaining Arundell and Itoje's 100th cap\n\nNorthampton Saints' Pollock has been deployed as an impact replacement for all seven of his caps under Borthwick.\n\nHaving toured with the British and Irish Lions last summer, the 21-year-old is one of the most exciting young players in world rugby and now gets an opportunity to show if he can be as effective as a Test starter.\n\n\"He is a lightning rod for excitement, and his international career only started not even a year ago, yet he has become an icon on and off the pitch,\" former England wing Ugo Monye told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"People love him and gravitate towards him.\n\n\"When he was warming up, people were going, 'Henry, look, it is Henry!' They were buzzing. That does not typically happen with a back-row player anywhere in the world ever - a winger, 10 or nine maybe.\"\n\nAlthough the selection is not a surprise given another impactful display off the bench, the decision to move Earl to openside flanker is an interesting call.\n\nBath team-mates Guy Pepper and Sam Underhill, who are both named on the bench, have started the past four Tests together on the flanks but they struggled to impose themselves at Murrayfield.\n\nA straight swap with Lions duo Pollock and Curry looked the more obvious switch.\n\nEarl has once again been one of England's best players at number eight - a position he tends not to play for his club Saracens because of Tom Willis.\n\nPollock's past five starts for Northampton Saints have come at number eight, with Andy Farrell playing him across the back row during the Lions' tour of Australia.\n\nIn those five starts for Saints, Pollock has scored six tries, which shows a trend as to where in the back row he has the most impact.\n\nPollock out to ruffle Six Nations feathers\n\n'I've never met anyone like Pollock' - George on England's 'brilliant idiot'\n\nSaturday 21 February at 14:10 GMT\n\nEngland: Steward; Freeman, Lawrence, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Heyes, Itoje, Chessum, T Curry, Earl, Pollock\n\nReplacements: George, Rodd, Davison, Coles, Pepper, Underhill, Van Poortvliet, M Smith\n\nItoje, who made his international debut in 2016, missed the start of England's Six Nations training camp in Girona to attend his mother Florence's funeral in Nigeria.\n\nHis illustrious career is set to take in a 100th cap against Ireland - a fitting fixture given it will be his 14th appearance against Farrell's side, his highest tally versus any nation.\n\n\"First of all he is an incredibly towering presence in English rugby,\" Borthwick told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"Talk about icons and superstars of the game, he is tremendous and I am so delighted for him to achieve his 100th cap this weekend.\"\n\nHis England career has been a model of consistency, playing 80 minutes in 30 successive Six Nations matches until he started on the bench in round one against Wales this year.\n\nOverall, 95 of his previous 99 caps have been starts - a remarkable record of both fitness and performance.\n\nCarries, tackles, turnovers, line-outs - Itoje does it all. And England will need their leader to be at his best if they are to bounce back.\n\nItoje has won more than twice as many turnovers as any England player since 2023, while he consistently shows up in attack and defence.\n\nThe 31-year-old has hit 1,247 defensive and attacking rucks during this period - a staggering 515 more than any of his team-mates.\n\nFive talking points from round two of Six Nations\n\n'Murrayfield pain will make England a better team'\n\nKeyboard warriors should 'cop on and help 10s' - Farrell",

    "fullText": "England winger Bukayo Saka has signed a new five-year contract with Arsenal until 2031.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that the agreement will make Saka the club's best-paid player on wages in excess of £300,000 a week.\n\nTalks over a new deal have been ongoing for nearly a year, with Saka verbally agreeing to commit his future to the club in January.\n\nSaka signed his previous deal, which was due to expire in 2027, in 2023 but his renewal means the 24-year-old has committed his peak years to the Gunners.\n\nThe news comes as a major boost for the Gunners, as they battle on four fronts to win silverware for the first time since 2020.\n\nThe agreement is the latest example of Arsenal tying down their key players to long-term contracts as they look to keep their title-chasing squad together.\n\nWilliam Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly all signed new long-term contracts in the summer.\n\nSaka has scored seven goals in 33 appearances for the Gunners this term.\n\nHe made his first-team debut as a 17-year-old in 2018 after coming through Arsenal's academy and has gone on to make 217 Premier League appearances, scoring 57 goals.\n\nSaka is 116 Premier League appearances behind Ray Parlour's record 333 for the Gunners and will have been a professional at the club for 13 years when his new deal expires in 2031.\n\nSaka has scored 14 goals in 48 appearances for England and is expected to be part of Thomas Tuchel's squad for the World Cup which begins in June.\n\nArsenal are four points clear at the top of the Premier League and they will face Manchester City in the EFL Cup final in March.\n\nThe Gunners are also through to the the knockout stages of the Champions League, as well as the fifth round of the FA Cup.\n\nIs number 10 role the next step for Saka?\n\nThe agreement with Saka is more important than the £250m outlay Arsenal made to bring in eight new players in the summer.\n\nSaka's importance on the pitch alongside his bond with supporters and his journey from the academy make his position impossible to replicate.\n\nHis new deal will see him stay at the club into the peak years of his career and - after several seasons with numbers that match elite wingers across the game - Arsenal will benefit from the progression he could still achieve.\n\nThe second half of this season is crucial for Saka as he looks to help Arsenal lift a major trophy for the first time since the FA Cup in 2020.\n\nMikel Arteta can rely on him and he is one of the reasons why the majority of Arsenal's attacking play goes down the right - the side Saka plays on.\n\nThe winger is also set for an important summer with Thomas Tuchel's England at the World Cup.\n\nEngland fans will hope that after a season of success with Arsenal, he can deliver for his country on the biggest stage.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Lazio patron Claudio Lotito unveiled the outlines of the Stadio Flaminio project in a special ceremony held at Formello on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Biancocelesti have been keen on building their own stadium, and in recent years, they have identified the currently defunct Stadio Flaminio as the best viable solution. The Italian capital club presented a renovation project to the municipality of Rome, which received the initial approval of the mayor.\n\nIn recent days, Lazio sent their detailed project to the municipality along with the required documents, and they have now decided to share it with the public through a special presentation. As La Lazio Siamo Noi reports, Lotito was the first to take the stage, reading a prepared speech that began by explaining the importance of the project, not only for the club, but for the entire city.\n\nGood morning everyone. I would like to thank the representatives of the institutions, the professionals who worked on the project, the media, and all those who chose to attend or connect through the various formats provided by our Media Company. Today we are not simply presenting a construction project. We are presenting a vision. The redevelopment of the Stadio Flaminio is not just about S.S. Lazio. It concerns Rome, its urban history and its ability to look to the future with responsibility. We are intervening in a context of great historical and architectural value, born with the 1960 Olympic Games. The Stadio Flaminio is not an isolated structure. It is part of an urban system with a long-established sporting and cultural vocation. Our objective is to regenerate an area that today shows clear signs of decline, restoring quality, functionality, sustainability and public safety.\n\nThe Lazio president insisted that the plan took into consideration various aspects, including the environment and the traffic jam in the construction area.\n\nWe have addressed the issue of mobility with seriousness, fully aware of residents’ concerns. The project includes the relocation of parking facilities outside the neighbourhood, the strengthening of local public transport, incentives for pedestrian and cycle mobility, and the transformation of the area into an environmental island. On the environmental front, the intervention will lead to a significant increase in green spaces and tree coverage, with a green belt around the stadium and more than 57,000 square metres of innovative paving designed to help reduce pollutants. The project also includes specific technological solutions aimed at significantly reducing noise impact, in full respect of nearby homes and the surrounding urban fabric\n\nWe are ready for discussion. We are ready to listen. We are ready to explain every aspect of the proposal with transparency. Because a project of this importance cannot be imposed. It must be built with responsibility, respect for institutions and a long-term vision.\n\nThe under-fire president also opted to address the ongoing conflict between himself and the organized fan groups, who have been boycotting the club’s home games in an attempt to force him to sell the club. Lotito thus took the opportunity to explain himself and try to bury the hatchet.\n\nAllow me a word for our supporters. I know the debate has been intense in recent months. I listen to every opinion, even when it is critical. My character—whether for better or worse—sometimes leads me to speak very frankly. It can happen that certain statements are interpreted differently from how I intend them. But every decision I make is guided solely by the good of Lazio and always inspired by the heart. When the future of Lazio is discussed, emotions run high. And that is only right: passion is the soul of this club. But precisely because Lazio is passion, it must also be responsibility. This project is not meant to divide. It is meant to build something that will last. Every supporter dreams of a full, modern, identity-defining stadium. I dream of it too. But dreams must stand on the legs of sustainability, respect for the rules and economic balance. Lazio must grow without jeopardising what has been built in recent years: stability, solidity and continuity. Judge the project for what it is: an intervention that improves an area currently in decline, that brings green spaces, sustainable mobility and urban quality, and that gives Lazio a home consistent with its history.We can debate, compare views, even criticise. But let us not lose sight of the common objective: leaving Lazio and the entire city something solid and lasting.\n\nClaudio Lotito (Photo by Marco Rosi – SS Lazio/Getty Images)\n\nThe 68-year-old also teased the five-year club project titled ‘Lazio 2032’, which will be unveiled in March.\n\nDuring the next international break we will present “Lazio 2032 – The Responsible Dream”, a strategic conference outlining the club’s future path. On that occasion, together with the consulting firm Deloitte and LUISS University, we will illustrate a five-year industrial plan based on economic sustainability, asset growth and sporting competitiveness. The stadium is one piece of the puzzle, but the vision is broader.\n\nMoreover, Lotito revealed his intention to have the Stadio Flaminio ready for Euro 2032, which will be hosted by Italy and Turkiye.\n\nThe choice of 2032 is no coincidence. It represents a timeframe consistent with European sporting trajectories and with the outlook linked to the European Championships. S.S. Lazio has already formally expressed its interest in having the Stadio Flaminio considered among the potential host venues. This is neither a promise nor a forced move. It is an act of responsibility and vision: placing Rome and the Flaminio in a position to take part in a major international event, should the technical and institutional requirements allow it. We are aware that the process of allocating venues will be competitive and that multiple bids are expected in our city. Precisely for this reason, we want to approach the matter with method, transparency and planning. “Lazio 2032” will be an open forum with institutions, partners and supporters, aimed at building a serious and constructive dialogue about the club’s future and the role we intend to play for the city.\n\nFinally, Lotito was asked how he intends to finance this project, and he insisted that it will be funded by the sponsors.\n\nThe stadium will be self-financed through sponsorships. We want a transparent discussion; this will be a facility that serves the community.",

    "description": "Dubai and Riyadh have much bigger prize pools, but Bahrain is quietly attracting mid-tier owners to its turf.",
    "fullText": "Horse racing has an indelible footprint in the Arabian peninsula. Equestrianism is one of the most enduring cultural traditions, and the region’s most prominent sheikhs have long shaped European thoroughbred racing. So it was inevitable that Saudi Arabia’s renaissance would include a push into the global racing elite. And equally inevitable that it would do so with serious financial firepower.\n\nFrom a debut during the pandemic in 2020, the Saudi Cup has sprinted out of the stalls to claim a top spot on the international calendar. At $30 million, it supplanted the Dubai World Cup — which has a $20 million prize pool — as the world’s richest race. The two-day February meeting doubles as a high-quality international contest and an attempt to create a fixture on Riyadh’s social calendar.\n\nBut under the radar, it’s perhaps the Bahrain Turf Club that has most effectively embedded itself into the Middle East circuit, and enhanced its relevance with the British horse racing industry.\n\nThe ties binding the equine worlds of the UK and Arabia date back to year zero for the sport. Every modern thoroughbred traces lineage to three stallions imported to Britain in the late 17th century: the Darley Arabian, the Godolphin Arabian, and the Byerley Turk. Bred with stronger British mares, these thoroughbreds define the sport.\n\nToday, the money and dirt tracks of Riyadh provide a showcase for American and Japanese contenders, while Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid’s Godolphin outfit straddles world racing from its Meydan (UAE) and Newmarket (UK) bases. But in its fourth year, the Bahrain Turf Series — under the stewardship of Shaikh Isa bin Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa — has opened up an easy pathway for international horses to compete, especially from UK stables more accustomed to grass than dirt.\n\nBritish horse racing, renowned as the Sport of Kings, is under pressure. Prize pots have seen a precipitous decline, and those who run the sport seem always to be at war with the betting operators who pour a lot of money in. For some owners, the opportunity to compete in the fallow winter months in Bahrain has proved compelling.\n\nJust 15 minutes from downtown Manama in Riffa, the doors to the Rashid Equestrian Club open up to unveil a circuit of perfect emerald grass, surrounded by desert. Racing takes place on Friday evenings, and some Thursdays, from October through the winter months.\n\nUnlike the huge purses of Saudi and Dubai, Bahrain’s $1 million Turf Series targets international talent, trainers, and owners at the mid-range. The money on offer regularly attracts a who’s who of British racing. Sir Alex Ferguson has even enjoyed watching his horse win here. It’s not just a series benefitting tourist riders though. The current champion jockey is a Bahraini, Ebrahim Nader, who came up through the Bahrain Turf Club Academy.\n\nTop British trainer George Baker stables his horses at home at Epsom Downs, practically in sight of the finish line of the 250-year-old Derby, probably still the most prestigious, if not lucrative race in the world. But proximity to the sport’s oldest traditions has not blinded him to the possibilities opening up in the Gulf. George Baker Racing has sent horses to compete annually in Bahrain since 2021.\n\n“The Bahrain Turf Club has been clever in its approach,” Baker told me. “They’ve listened to participants and made their offering more appealing every year. From giving travel incentives for both horses and owners to the upgrade every season to their facilities. Over the four seasons of the Turf Series, the racing has become incredibly competitive.”\n\nWhen I first visited in 2022, there was just a small grandstand. International visitors and owners socialized in the car parks; tailgate style, picnicking from the back of SUVs. The rest of the spectator area was teeming with Bahrainis and migrant workers. Mainly male, all transfixed by what was taking place on the turf. Scuffles have been known to break out near the track — perhaps over money changing hands in unseen corners during each race.\n\nNow upgraded, the grandstand facilities are as good as anything in international racing. Floodlights installed at the start of last season mean that races now take place in the evening cool. Local families mingle with expats, enjoying the views, food trucks, and action. The horse racing scene is evolving to become a second sporting attraction for Bahrain, following the kingdom’s top event, the Formula 1 Grand Prix in April.\n\nAnd that, perhaps, is the real story. In a region where the biggest and most expensive dominate the conversation, smaller Gulf states are still finding niches for themselves. Bahrain can’t outspend its neighbors. What it can do is identify a gap in the calendar and build a complementary competition that benefits from the megaevents around it. The approach that has made the Turf Series a success has applications across industries — targeting other forms of tourism rather than focusing solely on luxury, for example — and could help the Gulf capture more of the markets it is competing in.\n\nIn 1906, American political cartoonist Homer Davenport, on a mission from President Theodore Roosevelt, traveled to Aleppo, Syria, to acquire Arabian horses for a US cavalry breeding program. The 27 mares and stallions he brought back are in the bloodline of almost all the 630,000-plus registered Arabians in the US today, Jane Waldron Grutz wrote in a 2011 edition of Aramco World magazine.",

The game ended 3-2 in favour of the hosts, but the Bianconeri were left furious after Pierre Kalulu was wrongly sent off in the 42nd minute.\n\nThe Juventus defender was shown a yellow card in the 32nd minute for a foul on Nicolo Barella, which some deemed to have been harsh in the first place, and was then given his marching orders 10 minutes later for a supposed foul on Alessandro Bastoni. Replays confirmed that the Inter defender had dived in an attempt to get his opponent sent off.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 14: Pierre Kalulu of Juventus reacts as he walks off after being sent off by Referee Federico La Penna (not pictured) for a second yellow card offence during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and Juventus FC at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on February 14, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nAs this was a second yellow card decision and not a straight red, VAR was not able to review the incident. For similar reasons, the sporting authorities will not be able to take retrospective action.\n\nTo add insult to injury for Juventus, Bastoni was also carrying a booking at the time of the incident and would have been sent off himself had the referee decided to book him for simulation.\n\nRefereeing designator Gianluca Rocchi later admitted that a mistake was made during the Derby d’Italia and said that La Penna was ‘distraught’ with his error.\n\nNow, according to reports from Corriere dello Sport, La Penna has had to report to the police and the public prosecutor’s office after receiving multiple death threats online in the days following the Derby d’Italia.

    "fullText": "The word of the day in Barcelona is frustration.\n\nThis Girona game should have been put away in the first half, but that of course assumes Barcelona is able to put away their chances.\n\nLamine Yamal alone missed three point blank opportunities in the opening 45 minutes, one of which was a penalty.\n\nWhen Barcelona finally took the lead behind a redemptive goal from Pau Cubarsí, Girona pulled one back within minutes.\n\nAnd again, because of course there was, we had referee controversy.\n\nJules Kounde lay on the floor at the top of the penalty area after being stomped on, and watched as Fran Beltrán slotted home the game winning goal. No whistle from the referee, and no VAR intervention.\n\nThis team can’t buy a break at the moment.\n\nHansi Flick will leave the game feeling a sense of consternation. His tactics continue to produce so much offense, 26 shots on the night against their Catalan rivals, and yet Barcelona are not in control of games. In fact, Girona had the better chances on the night and should have scored more. In the end, they had nine shots on target, compared to just four for Barcelona.\n\nLuckily, the Blaugrana will get a midweek break since they don’t have to play in the Champions League knockout playoff round.\n\nThey need physical rest, but they also need a mental break, and an official reset before the home stretch of the season begins.\n\nRecall that this time last year, even though Barcelona went on to win the league and the Copa del Rey, their energy started to drop off as fatigue from the long campaign set in.\n\nIt won’t get any easier from here, but one thing that helps as an infusion of energy is scoring goals. Success begets success, as the mental can jumpstart the physical.\n\nBarcelona can’t lose belief in themselves, but that’s the danger of where they’re at.\n\nThe tactics aren’t changing, and maybe that’s ok, so long as they find their finishing boots again.\n\nRaphinha is back, and soon Pedri and Marcus Rashford will return to the lineup too. Even Gavi, who may have a role to play as someone who can bring much-needed intensity off the bench in critical moments.\n\nThe best path forward is to see the glass as half full.\n\nYou can draw a line from Girona to Real Sociedad, the last two league losses that have allowed Real Madrid to climb back into first place.\n\nBarcelona must know that success is in their hands. They didn’t lose these two games to their opponents as much as they beat themselves. If they see it that way, it should give them hope going forward that they have the power to turn around their own fortunes.\n\nAs their best players return to action, so should Barcelona return to the best version of themselves, one that can outscore any rival on any given day.\n\nIf you’re hoping for pragmatism, keep dreaming.\n\nHansi Flick, so long as he’s the manager, knows only one way of playing, and for the most part, his attacking philosophy has brought Barcelona a lot of success.\n\nThere’s no time to make excuses, and nothing constructive will come from questioning the gameplan. There is lots of football to be played.\n\nThese players know the winning formula. They have it in them to do better.\n\nThere’s nothing to it but to stay positive and keep the foot on the gas.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have charged into the race for FC Barcelona full-back Alejandro Balde in an explosive twist, according to a new report from Spain.\n\nThe Red Devils are prioritising a new option on the left-hand side, be it a left-back or left-winger, after the departure of Ruben Amorim.\n\nINEOS sent shockwaves across Old Trafford after deciding to bring an end to the Portuguese coach’s tumultuous tenure last month – with Michael Carrick arriving as caretaker in his place.\n\nThe 44-year-old Englishman immediately transitioned the side back to a 4-2-3-1 system, leaving behind the ill-equipped 3-4-2-1 Amorim had steadfastly sought to implement.\n\nUnited are expected to maintain this set-up regardless of who is the head coach next season, with the search for Amorim’s long-term successor to be concluded over the summer. This reignites the need for more reinforcements on the left, however.\n\nPatrick Dorgu has been reinvented in a more advanced role under Carrick, with only injury intervening to slow down his impressive form after back-to-back goals against Manchester City and Arsenal.\n\nWhere United envision the 21-year-old Dane playing in the long-term – be it at full-back or on the wing – will dictate what position is targeted this summer.\n\nAnd if the latest report from Fichajes is to be believed, Dorgu should get used to his new berth further forward.\n\nThe Spanish outlet reveals United have “entered the race” for the Barcelona left-back, whose outstanding speed and technical ability mean his best work often comes in the opposition half.\n\nA bid worth around €40 million is “already on the table” in an effort to prise the 22-year-old Spain international away.\n\nHowever, Barcelona are understood to believe a larger fee can be demanded in negotiations, though there is acceptance that the “offer is attractive” as they solidify their summer plans.\n\nThe Blaugrana are facing financial difficulties ahead of an important transfer window in Catalonia. In fact, the club are uncertain whether to meet the €30m buy-clause in Marcus Rashford’s loan deal from United.\n\nThis makes the prosect of an unexpected cash injection from the Old Trafford war chest a difficult one to turn down at the Camp Nou.\n\nBalde is a flying full-back who operates best on the overlap. He would provide a perfect complement to the more defensive Luke Shaw, as well as the width required if an inverted player like Matheus Cunha is playing on the left, rather than Dorgu.\n\nA €40m (£35m) fee is a reasonable one for a target with Balde’s experience at the highest level of club and international football.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Michael Jordan has long been a force in basketball, but his role in NASCAR keeps drawing attention. On February 15, 2026, his team, 23XI Racing, claimed its first Daytona 500 win with driver Tyler Reddick crossing the finish line in a thrilling last-lap push.\n\nThe race, known as NASCAR's Super Bowl, took place at Daytona International Speedway, and Reddick's victory marked a major milestone for the team Jordan co-owns with Denny Hamlin. Reddick, behind the wheel of the No. 45 Toyota, edged out competitors in a dramatic finish that had fans on their feet.\n\nThe celebrations included Reddick's family, with his six-year-old son, Beau, joining the fun. Beau has been around the racing world since he was little, often spotted at events with his dad. The energy was high, with everyone laughing and toasting the achievement. Yet, amid all this excitement, one brief interaction caught the camera's eye and quickly shifted the conversation.\n\nDuring the live broadcast, a short video captured Jordan standing near Beau in the crowded Victory Lane. The footage shows Jordan making repeated pinching motions at the lower back of the boy's shirt, as if tugging or adjusting it. He also briefly brushes or rubs the back of the child's leg. The moment lasts just seconds, but it happened amid the wet, messy aftermath of champagne and ice being thrown around.\n\n🔥🚨BREAKING: This footage of NBA legend Michael Jordan engaging with a young NASCAR fan has been going viral on every social media network. pic.twitter.com/YINERdD5sY\n\n— Dom Lucre | Breaker of Narratives (@dom_lucre) February 16, 2026\n\nThe clip spread fast across platforms like X, Instagram, and TikTok, racking up millions of views in hours. People shared slowed-down versions and screenshots, zooming in on Jordan's hands. Captions varied from questioning to outright accusatory, with some users labeling the actions as odd or out of place. The video's context shows a soaked shirt on Beau, hinting at the celebratory mess, but that detail got lost in many reposts.\n\nThis wasn't the first time a celebrity's public moment got dissected online, but Jordan's status as an icon amplified it. Fans who watched the full broadcast noted the chaos, with people bumping into each other and drinks flying. Still, the isolated clip took on a life of its own, prompting discussions about what exactly was happening in those few frames.\n\nThe video sparked strong reactions from viewers. Some expressed discomfort, calling the interaction inappropriate and demanding explanations. Comments included phrases like \"error Jordan\" or \"not acceptable,\" reflecting frustration over perceived boundaries crossed in a public setting. Critics pointed out the optics, especially in a family-oriented event like the Daytona 500, where kids are often part of the festivities.\n\nOn the other side, supporters pushed back, arguing the moment was harmless and misunderstood. They highlighted how celebrations can involve playful gestures, and many suggested Jordan was simply trying to remove ice that had slipped under Beau's shirt from the ice buckets or sprays.\n\nOne user noted, \"If you watch closely, the kid's shirt is wet, and MJ is just helping out like an uncle would.\" Defenders also brought up similar moments in sports where athletes roughhouse with kids in good fun, without ill intent.\n\nThe debate grew heated, with memes and videos circulating. Some compared it to past celebrity controversies, while others urged caution against jumping to conclusions based on a snippet. No formal complaints emerged from the Reddick family or NASCAR, and the clip remained more of a talking point than a scandal. Still, it highlighted how quickly public figures can face scrutiny in the age of viral content.\n\nJordan's connection to the Reddick family runs deep, adding layers to the story. Reddick joined 23XI Racing in 2023, and Jordan has built a bond with him and his loved ones over the years. In a 2024 interview, Reddick described Jordan as a mentor figure who interacts warmly with Beau, treating him like part of the extended team. Beau, born in 2019, has grown up around Jordan at races and team events, often sharing high-fives or chats.\n\nTeam representatives addressed the clip, stating Jordan was attempting to dislodge ice from the boy's shirt, a common occurrence in those wild celebrations. Reddick himself has spoken in the past about how Jordan's involvement boosts team morale, and their relationship extends beyond the track. For instance, Jordan has attended family milestones and offered advice on balancing racing with parenthood.\n\nThis familiarity explains why the moment might seem casual to those in the know. NASCAR culture emphasizes camaraderie, with owners, drivers, and families mingling closely. The Daytona win amplified that unity, but the viral clip pulled focus from the achievement.\n\nAs of now, Jordan hasn't commented publicly, and the buzz seems contained to online discussions. The incident serves as a reminder of how context matters in high-profile moments, especially when kids are involved.",

    "fullText": "As Tyson Fury prepares for his latest return to boxing in an April fight against Arslanbek Makhmudov, the pair held an official press conference where Fury would explain what drove his desire to return to the sport once more and the selection of his opponent.\n\n“Why did I come back to boxing? Very, very interesting question and there’s only one answer to that,” Fury said. “And the truth of the matter is I came back for one reason only, and that’s to make boxing great again. Since I retired for the fifth time over a year ago, boxing for me has gone on a downward slope. It’s become quite boring. And boxing is at its maximum potential when Tyson Fury is actively fighting — and I didn’t say that, the cleverest AI on earth said that, ChatGPT.\n\n“And with my I brought back the biggest streaming platform on earth, Netflix…I bring a circus, I bring an entourage, I bring entertainment, I bring action, I bring cameras. I bring everything to the sport and it’s something that I’m so passionate about, that I love.\n\n“I was enjoying being retired…but it comes a point where you just want to go back to work. And my work will always be the fight game, no matter how old I am…I feel fresh, I feel good, and if I was on a decline I would say it. I’d be the first to say ‘I don’t got it no more’ and I won’t box, but I don’t feel as if I’ve lost anything. I feel like I’m in my prime still.\n\n“April 11th can’t come soon enough. I’m in great shape, I’ve been training since I’ve retired — I never stopped training, it’s apart of my hobby…Makhmudov, what do I know about him? I know he’s a giant. He’s bigger than he says he is. He says he’s 6’4” but I think he’s about 6’8”, he’s a big man…If I fight a pudding, I don’t get turned on by that. I have to fight somebody dangerous to make me even want to train, make me even want to take it seriously.“",

    "fullText": "Hello everybody, and welcome back to another week of the WWE’s Men’s Power Rankings. With only the Elimination Chamber between now and Wrestlemania, you can bet things are going to heat up once the superstars are set for the chamber. For now, let’s run through the list and get you caught up on some of the most recent storylines. Have a great day, everyone, and may the slams be with you.\n\nMORE: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\n“The Maverick” Logan Paul had another strong showing at the Royal Rumble. He looked great as always and even made it close to the end, showing that the WWE really loves his skill set. Even though Paul lost his chance to get into the Elimination Chamber last week, you can count on him getting another chance soon enough.\n\nL.A. Knight returns to the list with his recent push and the injury to Bron Breakker, which has kept Breakker out indefinitely. On RAW last week, Knight defeated Penta and Austin Theory in a qualifying match for the Elimination Chamber. Now that the Megastar is back in the picture, you can expect the next two months to be fire. YEAH!\n\nInstead of putting up his belt this week, Carmelo Hayes teamed up with Matt Cardona, Apollo Crews, and Ilia Dragunov against Solo Sikoa and the MFTs. In a match that was chaotic at times, the faces quickly found out why people avoid the MFTs by losing the match. I’m sure this week on SmackDown sounds good because now we have a big feud starting with a champion in the middle of it.\n\nDominik Mysterio has been limited due to the current storylines the WWE is pushing. However, last week on RAW, Mysterio finally returned to the WWE, which sets up nicely for the Elimination Chamber. I wouldn’t mind seeing the Intercontinental Championship put up for grabs in an Elimination Chamber, but that’s unlikely to happen right now, given the current storylines going on in the WWE.\n\nGunther defeated A.J. Styles in a retirement match for Styles at the Royal Rumble. Since then, he’s been trolling Styles, most recently by coming out to this entrance. This led to a fight after Dragon Lee came out once Gunther started talking badly about the WWE Universe. Since then, Gunther had been cutting promos, but I’m sure he’ll be back to his cunning ways this week.\n\nJey and Jimmy Uso defended their WWE Tag Team Championships against the Alpha Academy on RAW last week. In a closely contested match, the Usos were able to survive a late surge by Tozawa to retain their championships after hitting the 1-D to pin Otis. YEET!\n\nRoman Reigns made his triumphant return to RAW two weeks after winning the Royal Rumble. After asking the WWE to acknowledge him, C.M. Punk came out to go back and forth with Reigns, which led to Reigns choosing Punk as his Wrestlemania opponent. For now, Reigns will take a break from action, making him a must-see attraction for the WWE.\n\nDrew McIntyre has continued his path of destruction by showing up during Rhodes’ triple-threat match last week on SmackDown. Even though he didn’t inject himself into the matchup, Rhodes couldn’t contain himself and attacked McIntyre anyway. This didn’t change the fact that Rhodes still won, but during the show, McIntyre ran into Trick Williams, whom he warned to stay out of his way.\n\nCody Rhodes was part of a triple-threat match between Jacob Fatu, Sami Zayn, and himself. Drew McIntyre did come out during this match, in which Rhodes did go after him. Regardless, through all of the shenanigans, Rhodes came out victorious, cashing his ticket in for the Elimination Chamber.\n\nC.M. Punk came out to do a promo with Michael Cole, but that was short-lived once Finn Balór came out. Balór demanded a rematch at Elimination Chamber in Chicago, in which Punk accepted. After that, Punk then addressed Roman Reigns and reassured everyone that he isn’t worried about taking a title match before his match with Reigns at Wrestlemania.\n\nOLYMPICS: NFL legend Jason Kelce tackles popular 2026 Winter Olympics event\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nThe post Ranking the top 10 WWE men’s wrestlers ahead of the 2026 elimination chamber appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Is hiring Igor Tudor a stroke of genius or a disastrous appointment by the board?\n\nThe fact that no-one seems able to answer this question with any great conviction has done nothing to either calm my nerves or excite me.\n\nOn the one hand, the Croat has a reasonably impressive track record of improving teams over a short-term period. Essentially, this is all we really need from him so we can avoid relegation, before we appoint a permanent head coach in the summer.\n\nHowever, Tudor is also known for his high-intensity style of play, with training sessions and fitness work testing players to their limits.\n\nNormally this would not concern me, but given our current injury crisis and ongoing issues within our medical department, I am not sure the ghost of Antonio Conte past is the wisest approach right now.\n\nUltimately, as long as Tudor can do enough to keep us in the Premier League, I am not particularly fussed.\n\nHowever, therein lies the problem.\n\nAs a fan, I was excited to see who the board would call upon to rescue our season.\n\nI appreciate the options were limited, given we needed someone who was available on a short-term basis mid-season, but this was also a priceless opportunity to unite an increasingly apathetic fanbase.\n\nIf we are to play our part in redeeming this season, we need to feel invested in our team.\n\nHopefully Tudor can win us over by inspiring – or scaring – the players into delivering something we have been missing so far in this campaign: football that is worth watching.\n\nGet us scoring some goals, winning some games, and keep us in the league.\n\nThen we can bring home everyone's favourite Argentine in the summer and forget this sorry season ever happened.\n\nFind more from Ali Speechly at Women Of The Lane and on Instagram",

    "description": "Here's why you shouldn't miss this Asian primetime card at Lumpinee Stadium on February 20.",
    "fullText": "ONE Championship continues its surging 2026 campaign with ONE Friday Fights 143 on February 20, another stacked card designed to thrill fans from the opening bell to the final horn.\n\nBroadcasting live in Asia primetime from Bangkok’s iconic Lumpinee Stadium, this showcase features explosive Muay Thai and kickboxing battles that promise non-stop action and career-defining moments.\n\nInternational stars look to cement their cases for a life-changing US$100,000 contract, while some aim to reignite their campaigns with statement performances.\n\nBefore the opening bell rings inside the Madison Square Garden of the East, here are three reasons why ONE Friday Fights 143 demands your attention.\n\nIsraeli slugger Shir Cohen returns to the ring in search of her fourth consecutive victory, and another dominant performance could position her for a shot at ONE Championship gold.\n\nThe 25-year-old Fairtex Training Center representative has looked nothing short of spectacular throughout her promotional journey. She’s gone a perfect 3-0 with performances that have showcased her evolution as a complete striker, blending technical precision with devastating power that’s made her one of the most dangerous women in the division.\n\nThe timing couldn’t be better for the Israeli slugger to make her statement, as the ONE Women’s Atomweight Muay Thai World Title is set to be contested when divisional queen Allycia Hellen Rodrigues faces “The Queen” Phetjeeja in the main event of ONE Fight Night 41 on Prime Video.\n\nA fourth straight victory would make Cohen’s case undeniable and put her on the doorstep of the biggest opportunity of her career once more after an injury forced her to withdraw from her World Title fight against Rodrigues in June last year. However, standing in her path to title contention is one of Myanmar’s most dangerous striking exports, Vero.\n\nThe 29-year-old veteran enters this atomweight Muay Thai showdown at ONE Friday Fights 143 riding momentum from back-to-back victories over Junior Fairtex and Li “Miracle Girl” Mingrui. She brings veteran savvy, proven finishing ability, and experience – exactly the type of test Cohen needs to pass to continue her ascent.\n\nVero possesses the tools to derail the Israeli’s momentum and inject herself into the ONE World Title picture with an upset victory. But no one has been able to slow down the Fairtex Training Center warrior thus far, and she’ll look to keep that plot intact in this must-watch showdown.\n\nThai dynamo Anon Taladkondernmuangpon has wasted zero time making an impact since arriving at ONE, building a 2-0 resume on two ferocious finishes. He returns to Lumpinee looking to make it three straight finishes and strengthen his case for the US$100,000 contract and a spot on the main roster.\n\nHe needed just two rounds to demolish Samsiblan Sor Sasawat at ONE Friday Fights 115. Then, three months later, he gave Belgian finishing machine Gianny “The Lion of Flanders” De Leu a taste of his own medicine with another second-round knockout to move to 82-20 in his career.\n\nThe N&P Boxing Gym affiliate combines technical precision with devastating power, making him one of the most exciting fighters in the division. However, Teeyai Torfunfarm, a battle-tested veteran, enters this strawweight Muay Thai tilt hungry for redemption.\n\nThe Thai striker sits on a three-fight losing streak, but dismissing him would be a critical mistake. Teeyai opened his ONE Championship tenure with back-to-back highlight-reel victories that showcased exactly the type of finishing power that could derail Anon’s perfect run on the global stage.\n\nKnockout power exists on both sides, making this a high-risk, high-reward encounter for both men. Anon seeks to maintain perfection and edge closer to his contract, while Teeyai aims to play spoiler and return to winning ways inside Lumpinee.\n\nWhen two strikers with proven finishing ability meet under these circumstances, the only guarantee is that someone’s night will end early.\n\nNakrob Fairtex and Panrit Lukjaomaesaiwaree collide in a bantamweight Muay Thai showdown that has barnburner written all over it.\n\nBetween them, these two veterans have accumulated 27 promotional appearances, and if there’s one guarantee, it’s that they’ve consistently delivered value for every second of screen time.\n\nAlready contracted Nakrob has built his reputation on thrilling three-round wars and spectacular knockouts throughout his campaign in the world’s largest martial arts organization.\n\nPanrit is no different. The Superbon Training Camp slugger has emerged victorious inside the distance with his dangerous match-finishing power. The 29-year-old has looked equally solid in several fights that went down to the wire.\n\nFor Nakrob, this represents another opportunity to showcase why he’s already earned his spot on ONE Championship’s main roster. On Panrit’s end, the stakes couldn’t be higher: an impressive victory over a contracted athlete would dramatically strengthen his case for the life-changing six-figure contract that remains just out of reach.\n\nAs such, for as long as this clash lasts expect fireworks, drama, and the type of all-action war that could steal the show when the organization returns to the Thai capital with another blockbuster ONE Friday Fights card on February 20.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid visit Benfica for the first leg of the Champions League playoff round just weeks after the Portuguese side’s surprise victory denied Los Blancos automatic qualification to the round of 16 at the Estadio da Luz.\n\nThe hosts made the playoffs on goal difference after finishing 24th in the league phase, courtesy of their barnstorming 4-2 win over Madrid with goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin heading home in the dying minutes to close out a classic.\n\nWith three wins and five losses in eight games, Jose Mourinho’s side have been inconsistent but have shown just enough quality to stay in the competition and have gone unbeaten in their last five league outings, winning four.\n\nTheir latest encouraging result, a 2-1 win at Santa Clara, has given the team a confidence boost before this important match.\n\nThe home crowd could give Benfica a genuine advantage with the energy they bring, while Álvaro Arbeloa’s Madrid have sometimes struggled away in Europe.\n\nBenfica scored 10 goals and conceded 12 in the league phase, showing they’ve attacked well but are leaky in defense – all of their last five Champions League games have ended with a winner, so draws are rare for them.\n\nBut the triumph over Madrid in the final round of the league phase for As Águias was their best moment in Europe this season, proving they can take advantage of the top team’s defensive weaknesses and be competitive.\n\nThey will try to repeat that performance and get a good result in the first leg.\n\nBenfica might be missing several players, with Alexander Bah back in training after a long knee injury, but he may not be ready yet.\n\nSamuel Soares could miss the game with a muscle problem, and Fredrik Aursnes is also expected to be out.\n\nJoao Veloso’s condition remains uncertain, and even though Richard Rios has returned to training after a shoulder injury, he probably will not play.\n\nMuch like their opponents, Madrid arrive in Lisbon in a confident mood given their form in La Liga – picking up four of their last five games, including a 4-1 win over Real Sociedad where Vinícius Júnior bagged a brace.\n\nHowever, their European campaign has been tougher. Madrid finished ninth with 15 points from eight games, winning five and losing three.\n\nAnd two wins and three losses in their last five Champions League games is below their usual standard.\n\nMadrid’s earlier loss to Benfica showed their defensive issues on the transition, which Arbeloa’s team need to keep in mind if they are to avoid a repeat of their damaging loss three weeks ago.\n\nArbeloa could employ a more careful approach in Lisbon, aiming to exact more control on the tie – especially with so much at stake.\n\nWhen teams are evenly matched, their ability to control the game and make the most of key moments can be decisive.\n\nIf Benfica leave gaps in defense, Madrid – who often do well in high-pressure matches like this – have the quality to exploit them and possibly take charge before the second leg.\n\nKylian Mbappé, who missed the win over Sociedad, is now fit and could play, but Raul Asencio is suspended after being shown a second yellow card in the final league phase clash.\n\nRodrygo is also suspended, having been handed a two-match ban handed out by UEFA for directing “insulting and abusive language” at the match officials, a costly mistake that means he will miss both legs of the play-off.\n\nMadrid are also without England international Jude Bellingham, who is out with a hamstring injury, and Eder Militao is still recovering from a tendon problem.\n\nTrubin; Dedic, Araujo, Otamendi, Dahl; Barreiro, Barrenechea; Prestianni, Sudakov, Schjelderup; Pavlidis\n\nCourtois; Carreras, Huijsen, Rudiger, Alexander-Arnold; Camavinga, Tchouameni, Valverde; Vinicius, Mbappe, Guler",

    "fullText": "When people picture Olympians, they often imagine full-time athletes whose lives revolve entirely around training, travel, and competition. The reality, however, is far more complex — and often far more relatable. For many American Olympians, elite sport does not come with the kind of financial stability people assume. Sponsorships can be limited, prize money inconsistent, and training expenses constant. As a result, many athletes build parallel careers that look surprisingly ordinary — or, in some cases, completely unexpected.\n\nSome balance technical professions that demand intense mental focus, while others work hands-on jobs that require physical endurance very different from their sport. A few take on roles connected to their athletic world, but many step into industries that seem worlds away from Olympic arenas. From engineering labs and finance offices to artistic studios and equipment workshops, these day jobs reveal a side of Olympians rarely seen during televised competitions.\n\nWhat makes these stories compelling is not just the contrast, but the discipline required to sustain both worlds at once. Training schedules, recovery routines, and international travel must coexist with deadlines, customers, and professional responsibilities. In many cases, these careers are not temporary stopgaps but meaningful pursuits that provide stability, identity, and long-term direction beyond sport.\n\nLooking at the surprising day jobs of 15 American Olympians offers a powerful reminder: behind the extraordinary performances are individuals navigating very practical realities — working professionals who chase excellence both on the clock and on the world stage.\n\nRyan Cochran-Siegle helps run his family’s maple syrup farm in Vermont when he’s not racing down mountains. The physical, hands-on nature of farm work mirrors the endurance and discipline he needs in alpine skiing. It’s a grounded lifestyle that keeps him connected to family traditions even while competing on the world stage.\n\nKorey Dropkin works in real estate, helping clients buy and sell homes while also competing internationally in curling. He’s described juggling two full-time commitments — negotiating deals off the ice and chasing medals on it. The flexibility of real estate makes it one of the few careers that can adapt to Olympic-level travel.\n\nCory Thiesse works in a wastewater testing lab, analyzing chemicals as part of environmental monitoring. Her scientific job provides stability and helps fund her training schedule. Balancing precision in lab work with precision on the curling sheet shows just how structured her daily life must be.\n\nPark City's Paige Jones ski jumps in mixed team at the Milano Cortina Olympics https://t.co/DHb1ctesFQ pic.twitter.com/ymsMhCMEjE\n\n— TownLift (@TownLiftNews) February 13, 2026\n\nPaige Jones is pursuing a degree in biomedical engineering alongside Olympic ski jumping. She has said academics help her mentally reset from the intense focus of competition. Her studies also hint at a long-term career path beyond sport, showing how Olympians often prepare for life after the Games.\n\nMorelle McCane has worked several jobs, including performing as a children’s birthday party clown. It’s a striking contrast to her fierce persona in the boxing ring. The mix of gigs reflects the hustle many athletes rely on to finance their Olympic dreams.\n\nBradley Wilson sells artwork to help pay for his skiing career. What began as a creative hobby during the offseason turned into a genuine income stream. His artistic side offers both financial support and a mental break from the intensity of competition.\n\nChris Plys runs his late father’s food brokerage business while competing in curling. Managing a company requires leadership and decision-making — skills that translate well to high-pressure matches. His dual role shows how family responsibilities and elite sport often overlap.\n\nLea Ann Parsley works as a firefighter, a job that demands strength, composure, and quick reactions. Those same qualities are essential in skeleton racing, where split-second decisions matter. Her career embodies a literal commitment to service both on and off the track.\n\nSusan Dunklee works in environmental science, focusing on issues related to conservation and ecology. Her profession aligns naturally with her outdoor sport, which depends on pristine winter landscapes. It reflects a personal investment in protecting the environments where she trains and competes.\n\nTabitha Peterson works in pharmacy, helping patients manage medications and health care needs. The attention to detail required in dispensing prescriptions mirrors the precision of elite curling. Her medical career provides both financial security and meaningful work beyond sport.\n\nTara Peterson practices dentistry while competing internationally. The technical skill and steady hands needed in dental work parallel the control required in curling strategy and delivery. Her career shows how athletes can maintain highly specialized professions alongside elite competition.\n\nAlex Deibold works as a snowboard wax technician, preparing boards so they perform optimally in changing snow conditions. The job keeps him deeply connected to the technical side of the sport, even when he’s not competing. His expertise with equipment gives him an insider’s understanding of performance that many athletes never fully develop.\n\nKimi Goetz works part-time as a processor at a finance company, handling paperwork and transactions between training sessions. The role demands accuracy and focus — skills that translate directly to the precision required in elite speed skating. Her office work helps provide steady income while she pursues competition at the highest level.\n\nKeely Cashman works as a barista at her family’s coffee shop. The job keeps her grounded in everyday routines when she’s not racing internationally. It’s a reminder that even elite athletes often return to ordinary work between competitions.\n\nAustin Florian works as an aerospace engineer, applying advanced physics and engineering principles in a highly technical professional environment. His analytical mindset and problem-solving skills mirror the precision and control required in skeleton racing. Balancing a demanding STEM career with Olympic training highlights the intellectual and physical discipline he maintains year-round.\n\nThese athletes remind us that Olympic greatness doesn’t exist in isolation from everyday life. Their day jobs reveal resilience, adaptability, and determination that extend far beyond competition. Whether managing businesses, working technical roles, or supporting communities, they embody the idea that excellence can thrive in multiple arenas at once. Their stories make the Olympic journey feel not just inspiring, but deeply human.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 16\n\nNFL Draft: 3 shocking 2026 NFL Combine snubs, full list of prospects attending\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Logan Paul’s Pikachu Illustrator sale price sets Guinness World Record\n\nNEWS: Nancy Guthrie kidnapping case reportedly gets DNA breakthrough\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post Surprising day jobs of 15 American Olympians appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Galatasaray take on Juventus in the first leg of their Champions League play-off tie tonight.\n\nThe Turkish champions are into the competition’s knockout rounds for the first time in over a decade and face a glamour tie against the Italian giants.\n\nGalatasaray head into the contest in good form after four consecutive wins, including a 5-1 thrashing of Eyupspor on Friday. Mauro Icardi hit a hat-trick in that fixture.\n\nMario Lemina will miss the clash against his former team through suspension, leaving a gap in the Galatasaray midfield. Head coach Okan Buruk could opt to reinstate Gabriel Sara, or unleash in-form forwards Icardi and Victor Osimhen as a pair in Istanbul.\n\nIcardi and Osimhen have each scored 15 goals in all competitions this season, with the latter netting six in the Champions League alone.\n\nThere’s further flair in the form of Leroy Sane, who has recently returned to training after injury, and January recruits Noa Lang and Yaser Asprilla. Sacha Boey also returned to the club for a second spell in the winter window, on loan from German giants Bayern Munich.\n\nGalatasaray remain without Metahan Baltaci, who is banned due to his involvement in a Turkish betting scandal.\n\nGalatasaray predicted XI: Cakir; Sallai, Bardakci, Sanchez, Jakobs; Yilmaz, Torreira, Gundogan, Lang; Icardi, Osimhen.\n\nGalatasaray vs Juventus will kick-off in Istanbul at 17:45 GMT.\n\nThe Galatasaray v Juventus game will be shown live in the UK on TNT Sports 1.\n\nRead – The five favourites for the Champions League as knockout stages begin\n\nSee more – Remembering every same-nation Champions League knockout tie\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "Cedric Coward spoke in depth about the adjustments in his rookie season, why he wants to work out with Kawhi Leonard, the public misconceptions about Ja Morant, where he was when Jaren Jackson Jr was traded, and more.",
    "fullText": "Cedric Coward has had a whirlwind of a rookie season, navigating constant Ja Morant trade rumors, the stunning departure of his most influential mentor in Jaren Jackson Jr., and the pressures of immediate NBA production. On the court, he's exceeded expectations quickly, averaging over 13.3 ppg and 6.2 rpg on 46.8 percent shooting, production that earned him a spot in the Rising Stars game in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile in town for All-Star Weekend, Coward stopped by the Panini Prizm VIP lounge, where he spoke in depth about the adjustments of his rookie year, why he wants to work out with Kawhi Leonard, the public misconceptions about Morant, where he was when Jackson was traded, and more.\n\nCedric Coward: It's going along great. It's filled with ups and downs, but at the same time, I think it's on the uptrend. I'm super happy. I'm super blessed to be here to be a part of this entire thing, especially All-Star Weekend, being one of the select few, but the job's not done. I still got much more I need to do.\n\nCC: I think it's been an ongoing conversation we've been having. Like I said, I trust them. I trust the training staff. I trust Coach because if you really think about it, I didn't even play a college season last year. I only played six games. So I was still in like catch-up mode and going from six games to almost a year layoff, to trying to play 82, that takes a toll on your body. But at the same time, I do as much as I can to help mediate that process so I can play each and every game possible. But at the same time, I trust those guys. I trust everybody in that room right there. And then it's ongoing conversations we have all the time.\n\nCC: I think it was one of our third or fourth back-to-back. You're not used to playing a back-to-back unless you're in AAU. But that's once every weekend, maybe. But in the NBA, it can come up quick. You can play four games in five days. So I ended up playing in a back-to-back, and I didn't feel as tired as I did in the previous back-to-back. So I was like, \"Oh, okay, cool. I'm starting to get used to the grind, and how to take better care of your body, and how to really manage sleep.\" And all these different things that help you perform that and become way, way better at it.\n\nCC: Oh, I knew I belonged in the league when I got drafted. Not to be arrogant, but at the same time, when I got drafted, I felt a sense of like, \"I deserved to be here.\" It took so much hard work to get to this point, just like everyone else, but what I went through personally - you’re climbing mountains, not hills but just climbing mountains.\n\nCC: Nah, man, you gotta be a little crazy to realize and accomplish your dreams. I never had any doubt in myself. I never had any doubt in what was happening. Obviously, there was a lot of roadblocks in the way, but at the same time, you just gotta get around it.\n\nI'm super blessed. I have great people in my corner that kept encouraging me, making sure I was taking care of business, especially after the shoulder injury. And I have a great team of agency and team around me as well that got my name out there enough. So now all I had to do was go perform on the court. All I did was wanna make an impact. I wasn't trying to go out and score a certain amount of points, get a certain amount of rebounds, nothing. I just wanted to go make an impact and do what I can on the court to help the team win. If I score 50 or if I score five, as long as we win, that's the only thing I care about.\n\nCC: What do you define as a bad game, though? Because if you score a lot of points and you lose, it can say you had a good game because you scored a lot of points, but you lost. Or if you score a little amount of points and you win, you can say you had a bad game because you scored a little amount of points, but you won.\n\nSo for me, I always go and base the game I had on the result first and just the process of the game. If I was getting the shots I wanted and I was making the right passes and maybe stuff didn't fall, and I had three points and I was 2 for 10, but I got the shot that I wanted, I'll say it's a decent game. Now I just got to make the shots.\n\nCC: You're playing with the best players in the world. I mean, basketball is a very fine line between the best players in the world and the ones who are in the NBA but aren't up to that caliber yet. But it's a huge gap between NBA players and everybody else. So going from college, not playing since November, and then my first game being back, being in the NBA was a complete and total adjustment. You had to go out there with confidence and you have to go out there with a sense of belonging or else you will get embarrassed. But at the same time, for me, that's probably the biggest adjustment, understanding that this caliber of players is everybody, one through 15, not one through five. And then you have the drop of knowledge, one through 15.\n\nCC: Yes, I have. We played the Warriors. Steph Curry hit me with a surplus of dribble moves, stepped back three on the left wing, and splashed it. And then did his little shimmy thing, running back down the court. And for me, watching on TV, it seemed so fun. It seemed so cool. But then getting scored on, I was like, 'Yeah, this not that fun anymore.'\n\nCC: Nothing to that status because I felt like I was right there in his face and it didn't matter. And I was like, this was legit, he just didn't see me. When I was guarding KD, he just shot over me. Like I've never had anybody do that in my life. But you know, those Hall-of-Fame caliber players, man.\n\nCC: Yeah, for sure. The time I asked if I can work out with him, he said, 'Yeah, let's do it.' And then the next time I saw him, I asked again and made sure like it was okay. Now we just got to get connected. But honestly, man, I live by the motto, closed mouths don't get fed. And for me, I'm compared to him a lot. And obviously, there's one Kawhi Leonard, and then there's one Cedric Coward. But at the same time, if I can learn from greats like that, if I can learn from guys that are All-Stars and I can add what they have into my game and mold myself with them along with many others, then that can only be beneficial.\n\nSo even if I look like a PR dude at the time, that's okay. He didn't deny me, so it's cool.\n\nCC: Not really. But there's definitely a list, there's definitely so many people I do want to work with and want to gain as much knowledge from. Not only mentally but physically understanding how they take care of their body. I mean, LeBron is in year 23. One of my things is, I want to understand when I'm able to have a conversation with him how he took care of his body.\n\nObviously you hear the stories but it's better to hear from the source. Obviously you look what drills Steph Curry does to get shots, especially guarded. What drills or what footwork does Kevin Durant do? There’s so many things from so many different people that I would like to take and I’m just waiting for the opportunity.\n\nCC: Not one particular one. There was, but unfortunately, he's passed away, and that was Kobe Bryant.\n\nCC: Man, I miss Trip tremendously. Didn't know him for long in terms of actual time of the relationship, but it feels like I've known him forever. Just because I was a lot like him and he was a lot like me. We're goofy people. We're the life of the party in terms bringing energy to the room. And honestly, he was like my first vet. He was the one that really would drop random bits of knowledge on me all the time. I would really listen because he's been successful in this league. I mean, All-NBA, All-Star, Defensive Player of the Year... You should listen to guys like that. And for me, whenever he would drop that knowledge on me, I felt like I needed to listen to it because he doesn't have to do this.\n\nBut I want all the best for him, man, for the rest of his career, for everything. We're keeping in touch and making sure that he plays great throughout the whole season until he plays us. And then he has a bad game. But then, besides that, man, that's my guy.\n\nCC: I was right next to him. We were walking up the stairs, going to practice, and next thing you know, he's turning around, walking down the stairs. And I was like, \"Oh, okay, what's going on?\" Next thing you know, you hear the news from our coaches. And then we just shared a moment in the locker room. You're like brothers, man. And that's where all my teammates, Vince [Williams], Jock [Landale], Jitty [John Konchar], like all of them, like you share a moment with those guys, like understanding what they meant to you. Even though you didn't know them long, they got a special place in my heart for sure.\n\nCC: Yeah, it depends what people think about him. If you want to say all the negative connotations about him, you're dead wrong and you need to keep your thoughts to yourself. Ja is one of the best people I've ever met. One of the best people to be around. He's the same way, goofy - we quote movies all the time. I mean, he's always cracking jokes.\n\nWhat people portray him to be is not what he is. He'll take care of you in terms of like, when we had the ice storm, he offered to buy my groceries, just little things like that he doesn't have to do, but he does out of the kindness of his own heart and just taking care of people, just because that's who he is. That's like his nature. And then at the same time, he's just a great person to be around. Like I tell people all the time, he's one of the people I'd bring to my cookout, you know, and you'd be like, \"Hey man, come on through.\" You know what I'm saying? And everybody would love him.\n\nCC: Ah, man. A lot of old school movies. I say 'Friday'. Friday's probably a good one. I mean, we've quoted like 'Paid in Full' before, we've quoted 'Juice', we've quoted so many things I can't even name them. But 'Friday' is probably the most recent one I can remember.\n\nCC: I'm out here with Panini at the Prizm Lounge they got here in LA, signing cards, meeting new people, meeting the same people I already knew, and building relationships and just having fun in the process.\n\nCC: Me personally, I didn't, but I know many, many people who did. My grandpa is one of them. Very close. So the fact that I can sign my own cards and he collects them, and I'd be a part of the collection, is super special to me. He's out here in LA too, so he's not here with me, but he knows I'm out here.\n\nCC: Oh man, it was a surreal feeling. People collect these cards as hobbies and sometimes as jobs, and for me to be a part of that card-collecting culture and people are searching for my signature. I think it's super special to know that you're making an impact in people's lives.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Hoops Hype: Cedric Coward Q&A: 'Ja Morant is one of the best people I've ever met'",

    "fullText": "In December 2024 fans in the Stadio Artemio Franchi and watching worldwide feared the worst for Edoardo Bove. Giancarlo Rinaldi looks at his incredible journey back to the field of play.\n\nOn a weekend of Italian football dominated by the usual controversy, gamesmanship and conspiracy theories, there was some sunshine that broke through from the unlikely location of Preston’s Deepdale stadium. Late in the game, Watford made a substitution which will have made supporters of Fiorentina, Roma and Serie A in general smile. Edoardo Bove stepped back into a competitive game – something which seemed unthinkable to anyone who witnessed his dramatic collapse in the clash with Inter more than 14 months ago.\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – DECEMBER 23: Edoardo Bove of ACF Fiorentina looks on during the Serie A match between Fiorentina and Udinese at Stadio Artemio Franchi on December 23, 2024 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images)\n\nIt was just a few minutes for his new club, Watford, but it still felt special. He was clearly delighted to be back doing what he loved after so long away and itching to make up for lost time. The fact that it all seemed so unlikely only makes it more welcome.\n\nAnyone watching that Fiorentina-Inter game would have worried for his life, never mind his playing career. The distressing scenes after he fell to the ground off the ball were the kind nobody expects or wants to see at a football game. It seemed to take an eternity for emergency services to get to him and rush him from the stadium for treatment. In truth, it only took 13 minutes for doctors to take Bove to the Careggi hospital, on the opposite side of the city. Only gradually did more encouraging news filter through.\n\nEdoardo Bove of ACF Fiorentina looks on during the Serie A match between Fiorentina and FC Internazionale at Stadio Artemio Franchi on February 6, 2025 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images)\n\nStill, there were question marks about his recovery – how long it would take and how complete it might be. The fitting of a defibrillator meant that his playing days in Italy were over due to strict regulations on such things. While it was delightful to see him back on the bench with Fiorentina, he cut a bit of a forlorn figure. Glad to be alive, of course, but struggling to come to terms with watching the sport he had dedicated his life to and being unable to take part. Like seeing something you had always longed for dangling tantalisingly out of reach.\n\nLet us not forget that Bove was in fine form – as was his club – at the moment he was forced to take his unwanted break. He was a driving force in the Viola midfield, and there were certainly some who were suggesting the Italian national team could do with a player of his intensity and energy. Then, suddenly, it was all taken away. Fiorentina’s form stuttered as the young player began his lengthy rehabilitation process.\n\nHe appeared on the sidelines, he popped up at Wimbledon to support his good friend tennis ace Fabio Cobolli, but always with a slight hint of melancholy about him. Having lived and breathed football for most of his life, it must have been frustrating to be forced to put his boots away. Many players talk about how difficult retirement can be, even after a lengthy career – that must have been multiplied when it was being forced on him so early.\n\nEdoardo Bove of Italy during the UEFA U21 EURO Qualifier match between Italy and Norway at Stadio Druso on October 17, 2023 in Bolzen, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\nThat’s why Saturday afternoon at about 4.44pm in Lancashire was a moment watched with interest and delight in Florence, Rome and much of Italy. At just 23 years of age, Bove can still have a lengthy career ahead of him – even if it cannot be in Serie A. It might not be a perfect solution, but it is a whole lot better than everyone feared on that fateful winter evening in Tuscany more than 400 days ago.\n\nJust to watch him back playing the game felt like arriving home after a very long journey. There will be tough times to come, no doubt, but simply seeing the young Roman kick a ball again will more than suffice for now. We can sometimes get carried away about football and forget what really matters in life and how precious every moment should be. That’s why his return to action is about so much more than simply what position he plays or what contribution he can make in terms of tackles, goals or assists. Just being out there on the pitch is a victory in itself. Bentornato Edo.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea defender Mamadou Sarr has called Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk his role model and has outlined his ambition ‘to be the best centre-back in the world’.\n\nSarr has returned to Chelsea after head coach Liam Rosenior cut short his loan spell at Strasbourg.\n\nThe 20-year-old had impressed under Rosenior’s management at the French side and formed part of the Senegal team that won the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year.\n\nHe made his first appearance of the season as Chelsea won 4-0 at Hull City in the FA Cup on Friday night. The defender looked at home in the Blues’ backline, as Chelsea recorded a clean sheet in the fourth-round tie.\n\nDiscussing his return to Chelsea and future goals, Sarr opened up on the players he is aiming to emulate. He named Van Dijk as a role model, but believes his game has comparisons with Van Dijk’s Liverpool teammate, Ibrahima Konate.\n\n“I want to be like Virgil van Dijk. I love Van Dijk. They called me that when I was younger,” he said to ESPN.\n\n“But some people also tell me I play like Ibrahima Konate. It’s very similar. He’s a leader. For a defender, it’s very important to be a leader. Off and on the pitch, I talk a lot. It’s an important job. I think I anticipate well.\n\n“With the ball, I can pick a good pass. When I was a kid, I had a dream.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are in a bit of a bind.\n\nIt could cost them the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nKenneth Walker stole the show in Seattle's win over the New England Patriots to claim the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nNow, though, he's a free agent. And bringing him back might not be as easy as Seahawks fans would like.\n\nWalker could be franchise-tagged, but that is unlikely, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\n\"It’s unlikely the Seahawks will use their franchise tag running back and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker, per league sources,\" Schefter wrote on X on Tuesday morning. \"The Seahawks have multiple free agents they want to retain and sign. They also will try to extend WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba. There are enough Super-Bowl tax costs that now make using a franchise tag this off-season unlikely.\"\n\nFor starters, the franchise tag for running backs is likely a little too rich for what Walker's true value is.\n\nThere's also the matter of RB contracts in the modern NFL in general. Except for the very best guys, it can be tough to reach agreements on fair compensation at a position that sees a lot of turnover each and every season.\n\nAnd then, as Schefter writes, there's only so much money to go around.\n\nA JSN extension will cost the Seahawks a fortune, and they've got to figure out which of their pending free agents they want back.\n\nWalker played a great game in the biggest game of his life, but that doesn't guarantee him anything, especially as a running back in the year 2026.\n\nHow two teams can both win in a Maxx Crosby trade\n\nBills have options to replace WR Keon Coleman\n\nMichael Pittman's contract may point to a trade\n\nHow will the Vikings get competition for J.J.

Thus far, Canada, The United States, Slovakia, and Finland have booked places in the quarters based on their performances in the group play. That leaves the remaining eight sides to battle it out in a playoff round to sort out the other four quarterfinalists.\n\nPlay begins on Tuesday at 6:10 AM EST with Germany v. France and Switzerland v. Italy. Then it’s Czechia v. Denmark at 10:40 AM EST before Sweden v. Latvia wraps up the day at 3:40 PM EST.\n\nThree of the Penguins Olympic representatives will be in action on Tuesday, all looking to keep their medal hopes alive and advance to the quarterfinals. Erik Karlsson and Rickard Rakell hope to keep Sweden in contention and set up a showdown with the United States while going up against Arturs Silovs and Latvia. [Pensburgh]\n\nThe last time we saw the Pittsburgh Penguins in action, Avery Hayes was making his NHL debut and scoring two big goals in a game against the Buffalo Sabres. Hayes was sent back to the AHL for the Olympic break, but his stay back in the minors may only be temporary. [Pensburgh]\n\nVille Koivunen has spent time between the AHL and NHL this season as his development continues to progress. Right now he’s in Wilkes-Barre and tearing up the league with 13 points in his last nine games as he helps the Baby Penguins battle for a playoff bye in the standings. [The Hockey News]\n\nIn a classic Kyle Dubas move, the Penguins bought (relatively) low on former first round draft pick Egor Chinakhov who was looking for a change of scenery away from Columbus. Since coming to PIttsburgh, Chinakhov has looked every bit of a former first round selection. [The Hockey News]\n\nAnother potential Dubas reclamation project came in the form of defenseman Ilya Solovyov, acquired from the Colorado Avalanche in January. After being scratched his first three games after the trade, Solovyov has worked his way into the lineup and is hoping his spot becomes permanent. [Trib Live]\n\nIf the Penguins are going to be making move at the trade deadline, it seems the most likely assests they are willing to part with are draft picks, just not their 2026 first round pick unless they are blown away. Given their position in the standings, it seems unlikely any players are on the block. [The Athletic $$]\n\nBrandon Bussi has been a breakout star for the Carolina Hurricanes this season and they aren’t letting him get away. On Monday, the Hurricanes and Bussi agreed to a three-year contract extension that will keep the former waiver wire pickup in Raleigh long term. [Sportsnet]\n\nJeff Skinner will be looking for a new home once the NHL resumes play next week. Skinner and the San Jose Sharks have agreed to part ways as the forward was placed on waivers for the purpose of having his contract terminated, making him a free agent. [The Hockey News]\n\nNot that there was much doubt coming into the Olympics, but the United States and Canada will face-off for gold in the women’s tournament after both sides won their respective semifinal contests on Monday. The gold medal game is scheduled for Thursday at 1:10 PM EST. [Yahoo!]",

    "description": "Iowa State needed it all against Houston, who matched it punch for punch for almost the entire game. Both teams are no-doubt Final Four contenders.",
    "fullText": "AMES, Iowa – Sixth-ranked Iowa State made plays big and small, though always critical, to turn a 10-point second-half deficit into a 70-67 victory — a beautiful, wonderful and incredible victory — over No. 2 Houston on Feb. 17.\n\n“Stepping up and having the courage to make the plays that need to be made,” future Hall of Famer and Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said, “they did tonight, and we didn’t.”\n\nThe moment that will always lead any discussion about this instant classic will, undoubtedly, be Nate Heise’s go-ahead 3-pointer with 77 ticks of the clock remaining.\n\nNCAA tournament bracketology: UConn rises in projection as Selection Sunday nears\n\nEarlier in the half, Heise briefly lost vision in his right eye after being poked, but, luckily enough, Heise has a third eye.\n\n“It was funny — with about a minute and a half left, I went up to (teammate Jamarion Batemon),” Heise said, “and I told him either him or I are going to have a 3 in the corner, and it’s going to win us the game.”\n\nWhich is exactly what happened.\n\nTrailing by two, Iowa State saw its possession break down, looking destined to fail as Joshua Jefferson had the ball at the top of the key without much chance of making a play himself with the shot clock barreling toward zero. The virtuoso passing big man, though, made the perfect skip pass to the corner, where Heise caught it and seemingly released it in the same motion.\n\n“(The Cougars) take away a lot of things, but sometimes that backside skip is open,” Heise said of how he came to the prediction he shared with Batemon.\n\nStill, he had to make the dang thing.\n\n“It was one of the easier mindset things because you really have no other choice,” Heise said. “You’re not going to be able to pass the ball — there's not enough time. When you’ve got no other choice, it’s muscle memory.”\n\nHeise’s triple will be the moment that lasts from this game, but it arrived only because of so many that led up to it.\n\nLike Batemon's own 3 in the corner on the previous possession, one that sort of arrived by chance. Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger was trying to get Batemon out of the game for Milan Momcilovic, but the 51% 3-point shooter didn’t get to the scorer’s table early. Then Houston’s Milos Uzan missed the front-end of a one-and-one, so in Batemon stayed.\n\nThen he buried a triple, and Momcilovic headed back to the bench to watch his teammate and fellow Milwaukee metro native finish the game.\n\n“(Momcilovic looked at me and he said, ‘You want me to go back to the bench?’” Otzelberger said. “Almost like he was halfway up already saying, let him go, he’s looking good.’\n\n“That speaks to what a great leader and teammate Milan is.”\n\nIf we’re talking about great leaders and teammates, though, Tamin Lipsey gets top billing.\n\nThe Ames native and Iowa State senior made the type of plays only he can time and again for the Cyclones, giving the type of boost you wouldn't have even thought possible.\n\n“There’s no script when Tamin’s out there,” Otzelberger said. “He just finds a way to make plays nobody else has seen a guy make.”\n\nThe most important of which came with four seconds remaining.\n\nBlake Buchanan, a 44% free-throw shooter, stepped to the line to try to improve upon Iowa State’ two-point lead. But, as 44% free-throw shooters often do, Buchanan missed the front-end.\n\nCue the \"Mighty Mouse\" music, though, because here Lipsey comes to save the day, swooping in to steal the rebound and the win.\n\nWhich, crazily enough, was the third time Iowa State got an offensive rebound on a free throw.\n\nAnd if that’s not zany enough for you, how about the Cyclones playing the last 18 minutes of the game without a turnover against a Houston team that ranks among the nation’s best at creating turnovers.\n\nThe Cyclones needed it all against a truly terrific Houston team that matched the Cyclones punch for punch for almost the entire evening. Both teams are no-doubt Final Four contenders.\n\nBut when Heise's 3 found the net, and Hilton Coliseum got as loud as I’ve heard it since the 21-point second-half comeback against Oklahoma in 2015, the Cyclones proved themselves just a little bit better on their homecourt.\n\n“That’s how you win,” Sampson said.\n\nThen, when that final one comes, you make that one, too, and collect all the glory, memories and possibilities that come along with it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Iowa State basketball beats No. 2 Houston in instant classic",

    "title": "John Fury’s Carl Froch tirade brings chaotic reminder of the Tyson Fury carnival",
    "description": "Comment: The press conference for Tyson Fury’s latest return brought garish clothes, a screaming father, and flashes of vulnerability",
    "fullText": "At the six-week mark of 2026, a dispiriting statistic circulated: in the UK, it had rained every single day of the year so far. And as another downpour drenched the pitch at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the turf dozing between football matches, Tyson Fury will have surely yearned for spring more than most. After all, it is the season of rebirth, and it will take on another meaning when Fury renews his career for the fifth time.\n\nOn 11 April, Fury and Arslanbek Makhmudov will return to Tottenham for Fury’s first bout since December 2024, as he emerges from retirement yet again to fight on Netflix. First, though, the Briton and the Russian visited the stadium for a press conference on Monday, where Fury made numerous revelations.\n\nThe “depressing” rain had driven him to Thailand to train; Anthony Joshua’s involvement in a tragic car crash had informed his decision to return to boxing; he will be without a coach as he prepares for Makhmudov; and he wishes to fight three times this year.\n\nIt was vintage Fury, veering from vulnerable to fanciful. But all in all... it was good to have him back.\n\nThese pages have long expressed a certain scepticism about Fury’s numerous retirements, as well as empathy for fans who have tired of the “Gypsy King” carnival. So yes, Monday’s press conference did hoist a few shoulders into shrugs. However, in the interest of fairness, it must be said that there were moments in which Fury’s charisma was captivating.\n\nThe 37-year-old’s energy was palpable as he spoke to The Independent and other publications in a suite at Tottenham, sporting a bright blue waistcoat and a garish tie adorned with the Netflix logo. In one moment, he asked an interviewer in the corner of the room to wrap things up with his dad, John, to eliminate distractions. Yet in another, he took a video call from old foe Derek Chisora, whose grinning face filled the phone screen of Fury’s manager.\n\nBack and forth Fury and Chisora went, as they did in the ring three times, discussing this month’s “cheating” accusations against the Gypsy King – accusations from Deontay Wilder, who was twice beaten by Fury and next faces Chisora in London. “Why are you letting that big slink talk bad about me?” Fury laughed. “If he’d talked bad about you like that, I would have taken his lips off!”\n\nIt was the last we saw of Chisora, but not “Big John”. Later in the day, Fury’s father paraded himself around the venue, propelling tirades at anyone who would (despite their best efforts) listen. Former world champion Carl Froch, standing on a podium as a pundit, was the main target of John’s barbs. Froch, appearing to see John coming, had already told a member of his team to get a phone camera ready. Even Independent columnist Steve Bunce had to quell John’s... well, fury. “I’m your friend, John,” was Steve’s calm response to a, “What are you looking at?!” from the livid patriarch.\n\nThis was the more tiresome side to the Fury carnival, of course.\n\nPerhaps John craved gasps, but sighs and rolling eyes were all he got. When the press conference started, John was sitting next to his son, only to make an announcement within seconds that he had “made” his “point” and would be making way for Spencer Brown. John beckoned Fury’s manager out of the front row and up to the stage, where Brown should have been sitting all along.\n\nThen came the main event, as John’s son answered questions with lines upon lines, as if someone had accidentally leant on a laptop keyboard for minutes on end.\n\nBut again, there was an essence of entertainment in much of what Fury said. Some of it was repeated, almost word for word, from what he’d told us in his suite earlier in the day, but he had saved us some tidbits.\n\nOf Joshua’s crash in December, and the effect it had on their loosely-planned showdown this year, he said: “What happened with ‘AJ’ is a terrible tragedy, and I wish him nothing but the best. If he decides to continue boxing, then good luck to him, and if he decides to finish boxing, even more good luck to him. But it’s not a time to say I want to fight him.\n\n“It hasn’t changed my plan. I need to take my career for myself, I am not interested in the rest of the heavyweight division. I can only concentrate on me. If I can get through Makhmudov, then we can see where we go next.”\n\nOf the upcoming second season of At Home With The Furys, his Netflix reality show, he said: “I would assume it’s going to be April, before the fight. It would make sense, wouldn’t it, to get millions of views for the reality TV show?” And then? “Then millions of views with the documentary, the biopic documentary.”\n\nIndeed, these upcoming releases – including a more serious documentary on Fury – were longstanding clues that the former heavyweight champ would return to the ring this year.\n\n\"That’d be like double views,\" Fury said, “and then all of a sudden: bang! He fights in a few days as well. Makes a lot of sense. I think this will be one of the biggest fights ever recorded, like in terms of views on television, if that makes sense.”\n\nIt does make sense. While Fury’s return may not reach the tens of millions who saw Jake Paul vs Joshua, or Paul vs Mike Tyson, it should still be Fury’s most-watched fight ever – such is the ubiquity of Netflix. Until then, the Fury carnival continues, for better and worse.",

    "fullText": "As every week, OneFootball shines a spotlight on a young talent on the rise.\n\nThis week, we're heading to Belgium, to Bruges, to discover Jesse Bisiwu, who has already caught Barça's eye...\n\nBelgium is a true talent factory in the world of football. And the new winger who could soon terrorize the best European defenses might just be Jesse Bisiwu.\n\nThe 18-year-old Belgian quickly climbed the ranks at his training club in Bruges. Since the age of 15, he has played with the club's reserves in the Belgian second division, also taking part in Youth League matches where he has made quite an impression.\n\nA physical winger (1.82m) but very agile and fast, known for his ball control and ability to beat opponents with his dribbling, he was a standout performer at the U17 Euro last May, leading Belgium to the semi-finals. He was even named to the tournament's team of the tournament.\n\nHis qualities have quickly caught the attention of top European clubs, especially Barça, who are closely monitoring the player, as confirmed by his agent. It's an obvious connection on paper, further highlighted by comments from a Ghanaian scout (the country of his origins), who stated that his playing style is \"similar to that of Lamine Yamal\".\n\nBisiwu remains a player with great potential, who has not yet tested himself at the highest level, but his qualities as a modern winger—cutting in sharply from the left and very strong in possession—make him an ideal target for the Catalan club.\n\nThere is no doubt that we should soon see this livewire at a big club, as his contract with Bruges runs until 2027.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Ireland and Australia have both been eliminated from the T20 World Cup as rain prevented play in the Group B game between the Irish and Zimbabwe at Pallekele Cricket Stadium in Kandy.\n\nZimbabwe's shock victory over Australia left them needing just a point on Tuesday to advance to the Super 8s with the match being a must-win for Ireland to retain any hope of advancing.\n\nAustralia, who suffered an eight-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka on Monday, were also banking on a win for Ireland to remain in the hunt for the next phase.\n\nBut with the rain unrelenting in Kandy the match was ultimately abandoned with both Ireland and Zimbabwe taking a point apiece.\n\nThat left Zimbabwe on five points and Ireland - whose four-game campaign is complete - on three, with Australia sitting on two and just one game remaining against Oman on Friday (13:30 GMT) which is now a dead rubber.\n\nZimbabwe will take on Sri Lanka in Colombo on Thursday (09:30 GMT) with the winner topping Group B, but they are both guaranteed a place in the next phase of the tournament.",

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos were a Bo Nix injury away from potentially making it to the Super Bowl this season. Alas, though, they fell short in the AFC Championship Game, losing 10-7 to the New England Patriots, who then lost 29-13 to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX.\n\nNow, as the new league year begins in less than a month, the Broncos must look ahead and get aggressive to make a move that can help get them over that hump. Bill Barnwell of ESPN seems to agree, as he predicts that Denver will acquire Philadelphia Eagles star wide receiver A.J. Brown. In totality, Barnwell predicts the Broncos will trade cornerback Riley Moss, a 2026 second-round pick, and a 2027 fifth-round picks to the Eagles in exchange for Brown and a 2026 fifth-round pick.\n\n\"Brown's situation with the Eagles is tenuous, and I would argue that there's a better chance of the star wide receiver sticking with Philadelphia for another year than some might think,\" Barnwell writes. \"Roseman downplayed the possibility of trading Brown when he was asked in mid-January. That partly might be because a Brown trade would be financially difficult; the Eagles would be on the hook for $43.5 million in dead money if they traded Brown before June 1. That's manageable in the modern NFL with a cap north of $300 million, but the Eagles could be stuck with stiff dead cap hits if Dallas Goedert and Brandon Graham don't return, and Lane Johnson retires.\"\n\nConsidering the run the Broncos made in 2025, adding Brown to the offense opposite Courtland Sutton would certainly keep them near the top of the list of AFC contenders.\n\nBuffalo Bills now know the asking price for Brian Thomas Jr.\n\nBills trade rumor tracker: Latest updates on Buffalo's deadline pursuits\n\n49ers tight end George Kittle begs NFL to do something about MetLife Stadium turf after another serious injury\n\nBuffalo Bills hire two‑time Super Bowl head coach in key role\n\nJustin Jefferson teases Buffalo Bills with latest trade comments",

    "description": "The NFL's franchise tag window opened on Tuesday. Will the Broncos use one this offseason?",
    "fullText": "Beginning today, NFL teams are allowed to place one-year franchise (or transition) tags on one player ahead of the 2026 season. The deadline to place a one-year tag is March 3.\n\nIf a player is tagged, they have until July 15 to reach a long-term extension. If no extension is reached before that date, the player will spend the 2026 season on a one-year tag deal.\n\nDue to the high salaries associated with the tags, the Denver Broncos seem very unlikely to use one this offseason. The team's most notable pending free agent on offense is running back J.K. Dobbins, but the cost to franchise tag a running back is $14,536,000.\n\nThe club's most notable defensive player is defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers. Depending on whether he's categorized as a defensive end or defensive tackle, JFM's tag would be either $27,322,000 or $26,311,000. Either figure would likely be far out of Denver's offseason budget.\n\nDobbins might be a candidate to re-sign on a team-friendly, one-year deal, but it looks like JFM will be allowed to test the open market next month. The Broncos are not expected to tag either player before the March 3 deadline.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL free agency: Will Broncos use franchise tag in 2026?",

    "description": "Their skis and snowboards tested positive for “forever chemicals,” slippery-but-dangerous chemicals now banned in the Games.",
    "fullText": "The Japanese snowboarder Masaki Shiba had just finished his first high-speed, head-to-head run in the parallel giant slalom at the Winter Games when he was abruptly disqualified.\n\nIt wasn’t a false start, or even a failed doping test. His snowboard had tested positive for traces of PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” which have been banned at the Winter Olympics for the first time this year because of their damage to the environment and the human body.\n\nShiba and two South Korean skiers were disqualified in the last week. They are the first known offenders of a new rule that bans the use of ski wax that contains these chemicals, which have moisture-wicking properties that can help skis and snowboards go a lot faster in the snow.\n\nThe snowboarder said he could scarcely believe it. He was aware of the ban, which has also been adopted at other top-tier events, and thought he had complied.\n\n“I’ve competed with the same board and same wax,” he posted on his Instagram account, “and never once tested positive.”\n\nPFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of chemicals that have a special bond of carbon and fluorine atoms, making them strong and resistant to water, dirt, heat and oil. For that reason, they’re used in everyday items as varied as microwave popcorn bags, water-repellent clothing, stain-resistant carpets, cosmetics, dental floss, nonstick frying pans — and ski wax.\n\nThe problem is that exposure to PFAS can cause damage to the liver and immune system. PFAS have also been linked to low birth weight, birth defects and developmental delays as well as increased risk of some prostate, kidney and testicular cancers.\n\nOnce they’re in the environment, they are highly mobile in water and air and don’t break down, earning them the name “forever chemicals.” They can contaminate the soil and drinking water, and can make their way into crops and livestock.\n\nResearchers have also found elevated concentrations of PFAS in the soil at family ski resorts, on ski slopes and on cross-country trails after competitions. In 2023, to address rising concerns over human exposure and environmental contamination, the International Ski and Snowboard Federation banned the use of PFAS-containing ski wax.\n\nSince then, top-tier events began to test skis and snowboards for PFAS. The 2026 Winter Olympics for the first time also incorporated that rule.\n\nOn Day 2 of the competition, Shiba was disqualified, ending what was most likely the 39-year-old’s last Olympics run. Then on Day 4, two South Korean skiers, Lee Eui-jin, 24, and Han Da-som, 31, were disqualified after the women’s sprint classic qualifier. In all three cases, their scores were voided for their use of PFAS-containing fluorinated wax, according to their official scoring records.\n\nThe South Korean news media quoted the Korean Olympic committee as saying the positive results stemmed from supplier error. Hayashi Wax, the manufacturer of the ski wax used by Shiba, said in a statement that it had discovered that a coach had mistakenly treated the athlete’s snowboard with a different brand of wax.\n\n“It’s simply not true” that PFAS had been detected in its products, Masako Hayashi, the company’s chief executive, said.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the amount of PFAS shed by skis and snowboards into the environment is most likely tiny compared with the PFAS released from factories, wastewater treatment plants and a long list of everyday products.\n\nBut there’s been increased attention in recent years on PFAS used in sports and outdoor gear because of their potential to bring the chemicals to remote areas. A 2021 study detected PFAS on Mount Everest, probably left behind by outdoor gear used by climbers.\n\nFor recreational skiers and snowboarders, the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that tracks PFAS contamination, has this advice: If you get your equipment professionally serviced, ask that the shop use PFAS-free wax. And if you apply wax yourself, look for products labeled PFAS-free.",

    "title": "AI Is Coming for White-Collar Jobs – A 22-Year-Old Developer's View from Nepal",
    "description": "Andrew Yang says AI will wipe out millions of white-collar jobs. As a 22-year-old developer in Nepal, here's my honest take.",
    "fullText": "I read Andrew Yang's latest article, \"The End of the Office,\" yesterday. He called what's happening to white-collar jobs \"the Fuckening.\" As a 22-year-old developer in Nepal who's building his entire career on sitting at a desk and looking at a computer... yeah, that hit different.\n\nYang's not some random guy on Twitter dooming. He ran for president on this exact issue. He's been saying \"AI is coming for your jobs\" since before most of us took it seriously. And now his tone has shifted from warning to mourning.\n\nMillions of office jobs will evaporate in the next 12 - 24 months. This will be an epic disaster for millions of workers and families. https://t.co/6829id4rME\n\nI sat with this one for a while. Not because it's new information. But because it forced me to think about what I'm actually building toward.\n\nThe article is blunt. There are about 70 million white-collar workers in the United States. Yang expects that number to drop by 20-50% over the next several years. Not decades. Years.\n\nHe talked to the CEO of a publicly traded tech company who laid it out: \"We're firing 15% of workers right now. We'll probably do another 20% two years from now. And then another 20% two years later. After that, who knows?\"\n\nCollege grads? Only 30% are finding jobs in their field. Underemployment is at 52%. The social contract of \"study hard, go to school, get a good job\" is, in Yang's words, about to be \"vaporized to smithereens.\"\n\nHe also made a point that stuck with me: someone in his family had AI program a website this week. It completed in minutes what used to take a designer or a firm days of work.\n\nI build websites. That one was personal.\n\nThe comments on Twitter and Reddit were honestly more unsettling than the article itself. Not because they were doomy. Because they were specific.\n\nOne senior software developer wrote: \"I noticed we just stopped hiring new people a few years ago. Not because management made any decision about it, we just didn't NEED anyone. I'm not too worried about losing my job in the next 2 years, but I do worry that if I become unemployed, I may never find another job again.\"\n\nRead that again. A senior dev. Not worried about being fired. Worried about being unhirable if they ever need to look for work again.\n\nAnother commenter nailed something I'd been thinking: \"I don't fear the legacy companies laying off tons of people. What I fear are new companies entering the market doing the same as current companies with a tenth of the employees.\"\n\nThat's the part people miss. It's not just about big companies cutting staff. It's about small teams doing what big teams used to do. A 5-person startup with AI tools competing against a 500-person company. That changes everything.\n\nThen there was the purchasing power question that nobody seems to have a good answer for. If millions lose their jobs, who's buying the products these AI-powered companies are making? Who's paying for iPhones and Netflix subscriptions? One commenter put it perfectly: \"Will unemployed people surviving on growing their own vegetables be buying $1,500 smartphones?\"\n\nNobody had a convincing answer. The best response was basically: \"Yeah, that's a problem for the next CEO.\"\n\nMost of this conversation is happening through an American lens. \"Mid-career managers making six figures\" being laid off. \"Mortgage delinquencies rising.\" \"Silicon Valley home prices dropping.\"\n\nI'm reading this from Ghorahi, Nepal. My reality is different.\n\nI don't have a mortgage. I'm not making six figures. I'm a BCA student freelancing as a frontend developer for a remote company. My cost of living is a fraction of what Americans deal with. In theory, that should make me more resilient. Even if the market gets competitive, I can survive on less.\n\nBut here's the catch. The entire plan for developers like me in Nepal was: learn to code, get good, land a remote job with a company abroad, earn in dollars. That was the path. AI threatens to cut that ladder off at the knees.\n\nWhy would a US startup hire a remote developer from Nepal when Claude can write the code for them? The cost advantage I used to have? AI just undercut it to nearly zero.\n\nIt's a double-edged thing. Lower cost of living means I can weather the storm longer. But the opportunity that was supposed to lift me up - remote work for global companies - might not exist the same way in two years.\n\nI don't have it figured out. But I'm not sitting still either.\n\nThe biggest shift is that I stopped just \"learning to code.\" Knowing Python or React isn't a moat anymore. AI writes decent code. What it doesn't do well is understand what to build, for whom, and why. So I've been shipping actual products - hackathon projects, side projects, freelance work. Taste matters more than syntax now.\n\nI use Claude. I use AI coding assistants daily. Some devs have this weird pride about not using AI. I think that's like refusing to use Stack Overflow in 2015. The tool isn't the threat. Being replaced by someone who uses the tool better than you - that's the threat.\n\nThis blog exists because if AI can do what I do technically, the differentiator becomes who I am. My perspective, my story, my network. A developer from Nepal who ships products and writes about it. AI can't be that.\n\nI've also been focusing on end-to-end ownership. Not just \"I know React\" or \"I know Django\" but taking an idea from zero to deployed product with user feedback loops. That full cycle is harder to automate than any single skill. And hackathons have been the best training ground for this - three wins so far, each one teaching me more about product thinking than any tutorial ever did.\n\nYang wrote about the social contract being vaporized. \"Study hard, go to school, get a good job, live a decent life.\" He's talking about American workers who followed that contract and now feel betrayed.\n\nBut what about people like me who are still IN school? Who are halfway through the contract? I'm in my 6th semester. I'm doing everything \"right.\" Learning relevant technologies. Building projects. Getting work experience. And the ground is shifting under my feet while I'm still on it.\n\nThere's a weird psychology here that I don't see people discussing. Yang's audience is mostly people who had stability and might lose it. I never had that stability. Growing up in Nepal, the idea of a guaranteed career path was always a bit of a fantasy anyway. There was never a corporate ladder waiting for me.\n\nAnd honestly? There's a strange freedom in that.\n\nI don't have to grieve the loss of a career path I never had. I can just... adapt. Build. Figure it out as I go. Which is basically what I've been doing anyway.\n\nBut let me be real. There's also fear. Real fear. Because the one thing that was supposed to be the great equalizer - the internet and remote work letting talented people anywhere compete globally - might be getting disrupted right when I need it most.\n\nI don't have a clean conclusion. Nobody does right now. Yang says \"batten down the hatches.\" The Reddit comments range from \"we're all screwed\" to \"this is overblown\" to \"learn plumbing.\"\n\nI'd rather be the person building with AI than the person being replaced by it. I'd rather ship 10 imperfect products than have a perfect resume that nobody's hiring for. Maybe that's naive. But right now, sitting at my desk in Nepal, I can either panic or build.",

    "fullText": "When ChatGPT came out in November 2022, Eoghan McCabe was about a month into his second stint as C.E.O. of Intercom, the customer service software company he had co-founded a decade earlier. Growth had ground to a near halt, and now he had another problem.\n\nMcCabe foresaw an existential crisis: If chatbots could answer customer queries, and if they replaced customer service agents, companies “wouldn’t need help desks — they wouldn’t need the software anymore.”\n\nHe decided that Intercom needed to become an artificial intelligence company, or risk becoming obsolete.\n\nMore than three years later, similar realizations about the potential for A.I. to disrupt software are suddenly rippling through public markets and wreaking havoc on the industry.\n\nAnd that existential crisis has spawned an identity crisis: Software companies at every stage — from start-ups to publicly traded corporations — have been working hard to be seen as A.I. companies. Sparkles emojis and magic wand icons are everywhere, “.ai” has become a popular website domain, and venture capital investors say almost all of the pitches they’re fielding from software start-ups have some kind of A.I. angle.\n\nThe reason for the panic is clear: Over the past 12 months, software stocks have seen their biggest plunge in more than 30 years, wiping out $2 trillion of market capitalization from the peak, according to J.P. Morgan. The S&P North American Expanded Technology Software Index has dropped about 20 percent in just the past month. And shares of the software giants Salesforce and ServiceNow are down more than 40 percent over the past year.\n\nA lot of that damage has come just in the past several weeks, as the release of powerful new A.I. tools, like Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.6, have put into sharp relief how quickly the technology is advancing.\n\nMuch the way that software has long disrupted whole industries, A.I.’s arrival is redefining what it means to be an innovative tech company.\n\nAs recently as 2024, PitchBook called the business model known as “software as a service,” or “SaaS” — charging subscription fees for cloud software use — “the bread and butter of venture.”\n\nNow, what energy was left in the fading category has been sucked up by A.I., a technology that could change both how software is built and how companies pay for it.\n\nAlthough a slice of start-ups were pitching themselves as A.I. companies a few years ago, today “it’s like almost all of them are,” said Tony Wang, the managing partner of 500 Global, which runs start-up accelerators and venture funds.\n\nAlmost half of venture capital last year went to A.I. start-ups, according to CB Insights. And at least 135 of the 151 companies in the latest cohort of start-ups in the tech accelerator Y Combinator identify as A.I. companies, according to its directory, including 14 with names that end in “A.I.”\n\nMcCabe successfully made the pivot: Within three months after the release of ChatGPT, Intercom, which remains privately held, released an A.I. customer service agent. The company’s growth rate soared, and annual recurring revenue from the A.I. product ratcheted up to nearly $100 million, McCabe said.\n\nBut many companies are still scrambling to make the transition.\n\nFor almost a decade, Amelia Lerutte has worked on marketing for SaaStr, a company that hosts events for enterprise software founders. She said the tone among software founders working to build A.I. into their products had changed from just a year ago.\n\n“I think now there’s definitely a bit of panic around it — I don’t want to say panic in a bad way, but just like they’re trying to catch up,” she said.\n\nTo reflect the focus of the founders in its community, SaaStr has changed its name to SaaStr AI. And Lerutte’s job title changed to chief A.I. officer. She now spends much of her time deploying A.I. agents, some of which are open for SaaStr’s community of founders to use.\n\nLast weekend, she used A.I. coding tools to create a product management system. “It’s pretty crazy that I could do that,” she said. “This is literally a software tool we were paying for last year.”\n\nOmari Rigg, an entrepreneur who mentors start-ups through the tech accelerator Techstars, said he often saw shallow attempts at A.I. transformation.\n\n“They’ll change their domain name, for example, from word.com to word.ai, and they will change their entire messaging on their landing page and their LinkedIn to, like, ‘We are an A.I.-enabled tool now,’ right?” Rigg said. “But other than that, nothing they’re really doing is actually leveraging a ton of actual A.I.”\n\nDoes that strategy work? Largely no, venture capital investors say.\n\n“It’s very quick to see,” said Byron Deeter, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners who has focused on cloud software companies.\n\nSo-called A.I. wrappers — companies that build an interface that gives users access to the capabilities of another company’s L.L.M. — have already been disrupted.\n\nFor example, Jasper, then a writing tool for marketers powered by OpenAI, raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in 2022. But it started to cut the internal value of its shares after OpenAI released ChatGPT and users began going straight to the source for help with their writing, according to The Intercept. (Loreal Lynch, the company’s C.M.O., said in a statement to DealBook that it had since expanded its product to run entire marketing programs and had seen “2X year-over-year revenue growth.”)\n\nOther categories of A.I. companies have gone through an entire start-up life cycle so quickly that they’re no longer appealing to early-stage investors. “There are even A.I. companies that we were interested in maybe a year and a half ago that we’re no longer interested in,” Wang of 500 Global said. “And that is a fast-moving cycle.”\n\nMany analysts and investors believe that public market investors have jumped the gun on writing the obituary for software companies. “The market is pricing in worst-case A.I. disruption ​scenarios that ⁠are unlikely to materialize over the next three to six months,” J.P. Morgan strategists wrote in a note this month.\n\nBessemer’s Deeter said that public market investors hadn’t necessarily done the work to separate the software that was meaningfully leveraging A.I. from what was not actually adding value, and that software would be necessary to monetize A.I. models.\n\n“Remember, the foundation models only get paid if there are consumers or apps pulling in payment,” he said. “They’re not a business in and of themselves.”\n\nEven with generative coding, said Wang, “it’s building the U.I., it’s building the back end, it’s deploying in the cloud, all that I consider software.”\n\nBut what makes a software company is in flux. Code production is becoming more accessible, and what differentiates teams is how they use artificial intelligence.\n\nWhen companies are thinking about how to stand out, Wang added, “I would say just throw out the software and just deal with the A.I.”\n\nFallout from the latest trove of Epstein files continued. Kathryn Ruemmler, Goldman Sachs’s general counsel, will step down in June after emails showed she had a friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that spanned many years. The Wasserman Agency lost prominent clients, including the musician Chappell Roan, over flirtatious emails that its founder, Casey Wasserman, exchanged with Epstein’s partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, in the early 2000s. And Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, a notable business figure in the Middle East, resigned as the head of the Dubai-based ports giant DP World on Friday after he was named in the files.\n\nThe Trump administration erased a key climate change finding. The Environmental Protection Agency repealed the 2009 scientific determination that greenhouse gas emissions pose a danger to Americans’ health and welfare, which underpins the government’s legal authority to combat climate change. The change eliminates limits on greenhouse gasses produced by motor vehicles and clears the way to repeal limits on emissions from power plants and oil and gas wells.\n\nEconomic data looked positive. Employment growth in January was surprisingly strong, according to data released by the Labor Department on Wednesday. And the Consumer Price Index, released Friday, showed that inflation eased at the beginning of the year. But some economists see risks ahead: About two-thirds of new jobs came from just one sector, health care, and spending on A.I. data centers accounted for almost 40 percent of economic growth last year.\n\nMore big deals: Anthropic raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation. Gail Slater left the top antitrust post at the Justice Department. And Kraft Heinz put its breakup on hold just in time for Valentine’s Day.\n\nBlaine Anderson has been building dating businesses since 2020, when she started selling an online dating course for men. She pitched that business on “Shark Tank,” and eventually pivoted to working primarily as a matchmaker, charging between $25,000 and $150,000 per package.\n\nNow she has added a new financial twist to the old problem of finding a date: asking singles to post at least a $10,000 reward for anyone who helps them find a partner. It’s crowdsourcing for matchmaking.\n\nDealBook’s Sarah Kessler talked with her about the new business, Bring Me Bae, which started promoting its first profiles of love seekers today. The interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nTell me about how you came to this idea.\n\nMatchmaking is very, very labor intensive and operationally heavy. The first match is actually usually pretty easy. It’s probably somebody you know or in your network. But by the 10th match, it’s like you’ve scraped everyone you possibly know and you have to source people that are total strangers by hand.\n\nSometimes myself or a matchmaker on my team will actually go hang out at the types of places where we believe a woman who would be a good fit for that client hangs out and meet women in person.\n\nSo the concept of Bring Me Bae really was born from, what if you could make everybody your matchmaker?\n\nYou have to pay at least $10,000, but that is only paid to the matchmaker if you end up dating someone you were introduced to for at least a year.\n\nSo that money would go into escrow. And then once the year mark happens, it would be released to the matchmaker, and the platform, Bring Me Bae, takes a 30 percent cut.\n\nHow do you confirm that I’m dating or not dating this person?\n\nThere is an honesty component, but it’s likely going to be somebody who one person in that party knows, like the matchmaker is very likely going to be a friend of either one of the people.\n\nIdeally people understand the value and are like, “Oh, I’m excited to pay this should this relationship work out.”\n\nWill you invest the money while you hold it?\n\nYes, I intend to place members’ reward payments in interest-bearing accounts as one way of earning revenue.\n\nDo you think it’s less romantic to meet someone if you’ve put up a bounty?\n\nNo less romantic than meeting somebody on a dating app and swiping purely based on their looks. I think being willing to post a bounty is showing that you are intentional and serious about finding somebody.\n\nThis question comes from a recent New York Times article. Click an answer to see if you’re right. (The link will be free.)\n\nThe buzz phrase “K-shaped economy” was heard on quite a few earnings calls this quarter as executives increasingly acknowledge that income inequality is shaping their businesses.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the net worth of the top 1 percent of households climbed to a record share of the national total. What percentage of wealth did the top 1 percent hold?\n\nThanks for reading! We’ll see you Monday.\n\nWe’d like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.",

    "title": "RubyLLM 1.12: Agents Are Just LLMs with Tools",
    "description": "Agents aren't magic. They're LLMs that can call your code. RubyLLM 1.12 adds a clean DSL to define and reuse them.",
    "fullText": "“Agent” might be the most overloaded word in tech right now. Every startup claims to have one. Every framework promises to help you build them. The discourse has gotten so thick that the actual concept is buried under layers of marketing.\n\nSo let’s start from first principles.\n\nAn agent is an LLM that can call functions.\n\nThat’s it. When you give a language model a set of tools it can invoke – a database lookup, an API call, a file operation – and the model decides when and how to use them, you have an agent. The model reasons about the problem, picks the right tool, looks at the result, and continues reasoning. Sometimes it calls several tools in sequence. Sometimes none.\n\nThere’s no special “agent mode.” No orchestration engine. No graph of nodes. It’s just a conversation where the model can do things besides talk.\n\nTool calling has been a core feature of RubyLLM since 1.0:\n\nThat’s an agent. The model decides to search, interprets the results, and responds. You didn’t need a special class or framework to make this happen.\n\nIn a real application, you don’t configure a chat once. You configure it in controllers, background jobs, service objects, API endpoints. The same instructions, the same tools, the same temperature – scattered across your codebase:\n\nEvery Rubyist’s instinct kicks in: this should be a class.\n\nThat’s exactly what 1.12 adds. Define your agent once, use it everywhere:\n\nEvery macro maps to a with_* call you already know. model maps to RubyLLM.chat(model:). tools maps to with_tools. instructions maps to with_instructions. No new concepts. Just a cleaner way to package what you were already doing.\n\nStatic configuration is only half the story. Real agents need runtime data – the current user, the workspace, the time of day. Agents support lazy evaluation for this:\n\nBlocks and lambdas are evaluated at runtime, with access to the chat object and any declared inputs. Values that depend on runtime context must be lazy – a constraint that Ruby makes trivially natural.\n\nIf you’re using Rails, agents follow a convention for prompt management:\n\nThis renders app/prompts/work_assistant/instructions.txt.erb with display_name available as a local. Namespaced agents map naturally: Admin::SupportAgent looks in app/prompts/admin/support_agent/.\n\nYour prompts are ERB templates. Version them in git. Review them in PRs. Treat them like the application code they are.\n\nThe chat_model macro activates Rails-backed persistence:\n\ncreate! persists both the chat and its instructions. find applies configuration at runtime without touching the database. This distinction matters when your prompts evolve faster than your data.\n\nAgents are the headline, but this release also adds:\n\nThis isn’t a spec or a proposal. The agent DSL powers Chat with Work in production right now. The WorkAssistant examples above aren’t hypothetical – they’re simplified versions of real code handling real conversations.\n\nIf you want to see what it feels like, try it out.\n\nThe industry is making agents complicated. They’re not. An agent is an LLM with tools. You define the tools in Ruby. You package them in a class. You use the class in your app.\n\nNo graphs. No chains. No orchestration frameworks. Just Ruby.",

    "description": "January 2026 - I recently taught a 1-hour class on AI at my daughter's school. My ambitious goals were: (i) live demos of image and video generation; (ii) incorporate all students (40) and teachers (5) into the generations. [Almost everything worked out!](school)",
    "fullText": "I am super happy with my daughter Kate’s school! The Montessori system is very clever, as it places children of different ages into one class; then, children form working groups according to their skills. The children work with older children on subjects they are mastering well and with younger children if they need more time to consolidate their learning.\n\nLast fall, the school asked parents to teach the children about their professions; what a program they got! For example, a neuro-surgeon who investigates the source of consciousness through fMRI scans, a heart surgeon, a high-frequency trader, an aviator, an architect, a politician, and…. a computer science professor :-) These encounters helped give meaning to the children’s learning and opened their imaginations to the scientific and technological careers of tomorrow.\n\nI set myself as main goal: show many interactive demos that include the listeners as much as possible. The AR part was easy, as we simply showed a controllable virtual dinosaur demolishing the room, as well as a makeup try-on application.\n\nFor the Generative AI (GenAI) part, I wanted to show the generation of images and videos that incorporate all listeners. Due to the short time available, it was very challenging. I had to design workflows that are:\n\nIt was an unexpected adventure that took me more time than I would have predicted!\n\nAs demo platform, I was using my regular setup (multiple 4 x H100 servers running in the university’s data center), so compute power was not an issue. With ComfyUI, I was sure to be able to run the latest bleeding edge GenAI models.\n\nAs there were many more children than teachers, my rough plan was:\n\nMy first idea failed hard, even though I tried very hard to make it work. This took most of my preparation time!\n\nI estimated that all this could be completed in 15 minutes, as the two phases would be massively parallel 😉.\n\nUnexpectedly, the open source models that I tried (Flux2 Dev, Qwen-Image-Edit) failed to give consistent results. In my extensive tests, I discovered that while nice generations can be really very nice, there are just way to many failures when trying to swap in 4 humans at the same time.\n\nIn the end, untypically for me, I even tried closed weights models. It did not go much better.\n\nI finally decided to do this part completely different: use a high-speed, high-quality image generator and let the children come up with the prompts! This worked beautifully. We went for Z-Image, as it can generate 1 megapixel images in just over 1 second.\n\nThis part was way easier, as the overall throughput needs to be lower than the image part. I prepared a WanAnimate workflow that can generate a 10 second video in 1 minute. As steps during the class, I planned:\n\nFirst, Kate and me demonstrated the capabilities of Z-Image:\n\nThen, the children in the class could tell me their prompts. Here are some results:\n\nFirst, I showed a slide with: the basic effect of replacing subjects in a video (left), for different subjects (middle), and videos (right):\n\nThen, generation time started! Note that I have blurred the children and the faces of teachers to preserve privacy. The first teacher decided to swap herself with Indira Gandhi:\n\nThe second one was a fan of Louis de Funès:\n\nIn between those, I made a funny mistake as I forgot to swap the input images, so we have Indira Ghandi moving like Louis de Funès 🙈\n\nI was glad about the results! During the demonstrations, the children were absolutely mesmerized. Right after the presentation, a boy came to me with glowing eyes and told me: “I want to learn how to do this!”.\n\nAfterwards, I received several messages from parents, who thanked me and described how excited their children came home after school on that day! The funniest feedback was from another parent: “So, when are you gonna teach this class to us parents?” (shameless plug: you can already book me for the adult version of this class!).\n\nLooking forward to teaching this class again next year!",

The tech giant has been deliberating since early last year on how to release a feature that carries “safety and privacy risks.”\n\nAccording to an internal memo, the company had originally planned to release Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the visually impaired before releasing it to the public, but didn’t end up doing that.\n\nMeta reportedly saw the political tumult in the United States as a good time to release the feature.\n\n“We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the document reads.\n\nMeta considered adding facial recognition technology to the first version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses back in 2021, but dropped the plans over technical challenges and ethical concerns. The NYT reports that the company has revived its plans as the Trump administration has grown closer to Big Tech, and following the unexpected success of its smart glasses.",

    "description": "At Waymo's San Francisco robotaxi depot, hundreds of autonomous vehicles are serviced, highlighting the evolving landscape of transportation.",
    "fullText": "The country's largest operational robotaxi depot is surprisingly quiet.\n\nIn an inconspicuous corner of San Francisco, Waymo's autonomous taxis hum and haw as they slowly pull into parking spots, patiently waiting for human coworkers to service them as needed.\n\nThis is a robotaxi rest stop: They park, recharge, and are routinely cleaned or maintained by human workers flowing in and out of the facility.\n\nBusiness Insider took a tour of the Waymo depot on Toland Avenue on a late Thursday afternoon just before Super Bowl weekend.\n\n\"It's a busy time,\" Sandy Karp, a Waymo spokesperson, told us, as we walked by rows of parked white Jaguars. The fleet vaguely resembled a crowd of wide-bodied stormtroopers.\n\nAs robotaxis scale, these depots will become a common sight in urban neighborhoods. Robotaxis need to be close to their customers, after all.\n\nWaymo has several unmarked depots throughout the Bay Area to service the nearly 1,000 robotaxis the company has deployed in the region.\n\nBusiness Insider visited Waymo's largest facility in Bayview, a neighborhood in southeast San Francisco. The building itself offers little indication that the facility is dedicated to autonomous cars. Small blue cones marked with the Waymo logo are lined up outside.\n\nMost of the robotaxis remain on a large lot, waiting to be serviced or deployed to serve millions of riders in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nA Waymo spokesperson said the depot can service hundreds of robotaxis and that the facility has been operational for about five to six years.\n\nSome depots are entirely indoors. The Bayview depot is mostly outdoors, in part to comply with COVID restrictions at the time it was built, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Waymo depot in Bayview was busy but quiet. There was no honking, no beeping — mostly just the constant sound of cars zooming by on the nearby 280 highway.\n\nResidents who live near other Waymo depots in California have complained that the robotaxis can make a lot of noise or emit too much light.\n\nThe city of Santa Monica has even sued the company to force the depot to stop operating past its curfew.\n\nIn any case, there were no residents to disturb at the Bayview depot — it's located in the neighborhood's industrial corridor.\n\nAt the depot, employees contracted by Transdev and other third-party companies maintain Waymo's robotaxis.\n\nEmployees perform a range of tasks, from plugging chargers into the cars to cleaning their interiors.\n\nInside the building is a break room for employees to take meetings or eat lunch. At least 40 people filled the room that afternoon.\n\nSome employees donned bright yellow safety vests, since they're dealing with multiple-ton cars that constantly move around the lot.\n\nBusiness Insider was not allowed to photograph workers servicing the cars.\n\nMaintenance tools, from vacuums to cleaning supplies, are meticulously organized. One rack has towels organized by the day of use.\n\nDepot workers carefully track the amount of time spent servicing vehicles. One whiteboard showed \"productive times\" with various times recorded.\n\nThere's a business case for this: The more time Waymos are spent in the lot, the less time they're being utilized and making money.\n\nSome companies are building products or infrastructure entirely dedicated to automating the servicing process.\n\nA standard iPhone camera can't capture this, but the spinning lidar on the roof of the Waymos also flashes a symbol in a certain color to communicate what kind of servicing it needs, whether that's charging or troubleshooting.\n\nA yellow thunderbolt symbol will indicate that the car is charging, for example.\n\nA Waymo spokesperson said the \"dome communications\" help workers find the right car in a sea of other robotaxis.\n\n\"Before, if you wanted to find a car, it felt like finding a needle in a haystack,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nInside the depot is a garage, where Waymos are also regularly serviced. That includes routine maintenance, such as replacing brakes and fluids, as well as services unique to Waymo's robotaxis, such as replacing lidars and other sensors.\n\nOutside, there are spare parts for Waymo's retrofitted Jaguar I-PACE SUVs.\n\n\"Our team jokes that we have the most experience servicing Jaguars,\" a Waymo spokesperson said.\n\nMost of the depot was filled with white Jaguars, but in one corner of the lot, the company's new robotaxis are also being tested.\n\nWaymo is currently testing the Hyundai IONIQ 5 and the Ojai, a retrofitted Chinese EV.\n\nThe company plans to launch the Ojai for public service later this year.",

    "fullText": "Passengers in Europe had a grueling flight to nowhere earlier this month due to an unusual passenger.\n\nA Scandinavian Airlines flight turned around after a rodent was spotted on board.\n\nFlight 1583 departed Stockholm Arlanda Airport on February 7 and was supposed to land in Málaga, Spain, four hours later.\n\nHowever, almost two hours into the journey, the Airbus A320neo U-turned while flying over Belgium, according to flight-tracking data.\n\nIt flew back to Sweden, touching down in the capital 3 hours and 20 minutes after taking off.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, an airline spokesperson said the plane turned around \"after a suspected rodent sighting on board.\"\n\n\"We followed established procedures and, as a precaution, returned the aircraft to Arlanda to carry out standard inspections of both the aircraft and relevant suppliers,\" they added. \"Passengers were boarded on a new aircraft to Malaga shortly after.\"\n\nSAS did not confirm exactly what kind of rodent was spotted, but Flightradar24 reported that it was a mouse.\n\nDiverting a plane due to a rodent might seem bizarre, but loose animals on board can pose a safety risk. It could potentially damage electrical wiring or other components, leading to system faults or, in rare cases, a fire.\n\nData from Flightradar24 shows an extra flight, operated under the call sign SAS95T, flew from Stockholm to Málaga later the same day.\n\nIt arrived around 3:30 p.m., five hours later than passengers were first scheduled to arrive in the Costa del Sol.\n\nThis wasn't the first time that such an unwelcome passenger has caused a flight to turn around.\n\nIn 2024, One Mile at a Time reported that an SAS flight to Malága returned to Copenhagen after a mouse was found in somebody's in-flight meal, before it escaped into the cabin.\n\nLater that year, a TAP Air Portugal plane was grounded after 132 hamsters escaped from their cages inside the cargo hold.",

    "description": "Sam Perry, 40, used his severance money to launch a startup instead of pursuing a costly MBA. He said it helped him stand out in the job market.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Perry, 40, who is based in the UK. His employment and redundancy have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'd always wanted to do an MBA. Job listings asked for them, colleagues seemed to get promoted because of them, and I came to see them as a cheat code for reaching the top of the corporate world.\n\nBut when I was laid off in 2022 from a tech job in my late 30s, I used my mid-five-figure severance package to launch a startup.\n\nI 100% believe that I've learned more from my startup experience than I ever could have in a classroom.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in Sports and Business Management in 2005, I knew what I wanted: a corporate career, a skyscraper office in London or New York, and to one day make the C-suite.\n\nI spent three years at Anheuser-Busch and then nearly nine years at FedEx, where I learned the fundamentals of running a business.\n\nIn 2021, I joined G-P, a private equity-backed HR technology company, where I started a side project in my spare time: building an HR tech marketplace, mostly as a learning exercise.\n\nAt work, things seemed to be going well. In October 2022, my team won a major industry award. A month later, I was laid off.\n\nI seriously considered using my severance money to pursue an MBA, believing it might give me an edge in job interviews.\n\nFirst, I looked at the Rolls-Royces of MBAs: Harvard and Wharton. Costing more than $100,000 a year for two-year programs, it quickly became clear that they cost considerably more than my payout, with no guarantee of a job at the end.\n\nI looked at cheaper UK and online options, but spending thousands of dollars on a program without a big Ivy League name attached felt like too big a gamble. I also questioned what an MBA could teach me after 15 years in the corporate world.\n\nA family friend suggested I use the payout to start my own company instead. It would cost a fraction of an MBA, he said, and I'd learn how to build a business from the ground up. I might even make some money along the way.\n\nI invested about a fifth of my severance pay into getting it off the ground. Most of the technology was off-the-shelf, which kept costs relatively low, and I used free online courses from places like MIT to make basic changes to the platform.\n\nI launched the company, Ensemble, in late 2022, and we saw some early but limited success selling access to the marketplace. We later pivoted to procuring HR software directly for customers.\n\nBecoming a founder taught me so much about business — from marketing to product development and hiring — and about myself and resilience.\n\nAfter years in the corporate world, I thought I knew how to sell, but nothing compares to sitting alone with your laptop and phone and calling strangers to persuade them to buy something you've built. It was a real education.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, Ensemble was acquired by a competitor. Nowadays, I work as a group vice president at Sphera, a supply-chain risk SaaS company.\n\nI'm not convinced I'd have reached this level at 40 without my startup experience. Now, when I review CVs, I'm drawn to candidates who have started their own companies.\n\nIn a crowded job market, I believe that having worked toward a successful acquisition is the single biggest differentiator you can have. Many people have MBAs; far fewer have built and sold something.\n\nIf you're choosing between an MBA and starting a company, the degree will still be there later, but a startup can be done for a fraction of the cost, with the bonus of possibly making some money along the way.",

    "description": "Stanley 1913 wants to expand beyond viral tumblers with the Vitalize collection, focusing on wellness and appealing to both male and female consumers.",
    "fullText": "Stanley 1913 is ready to go beyond its viral moment.\n\nThe drinkware company is best known for its Stanley Quencher line of 40-ounce tumblers, which has exploded in popularity since 2020 alongside reusable water bottles. Stanley has ridden that wave with viral product launches that have flown off of shelves. Its collaboration with the \"Wicked\" movie franchise, for example, caused a frenzy at Target in 2024.\n\nNow, Stanley is setting out to show it's more than a TikTok fad known for limited-edition cup drops.\n\nIt's trying to turn a new tide by taking advantage of another hot trend: wellness. Global President Matt Navarro told Business Insider in an interview that Stanley wants to meet customers where they're at, which, increasingly, happens to be the gym or the yoga studio.\n\n\"They want products that support their health and wellness lives,\" Navarro told Business Insider.\n\nThe company is launching a new product line on Tuesday to serve that audience and avoid becoming too reliant on TikTok virality.\n\nStanley is betting on its Vitalize line to kick-start its new chapter. It features a new tote bag, backpack, and shaker bottle, designed to support people on the go who want to bring their Stanley cup with them. The bags come with pockets and straps to carry Stanley cups.\n\n\"It's about really understanding today's consumer,\" Navarro said. \"They're constantly on the move.\"\n\nThe shaker bottle is made for protein, which Navarro said is having \"an incredible moment\" based on his observations at the grocery store.\n\nThe Vitalize drop comes as Stanley's position as the top drinkware brand is in question. A 2025 survey of more than 500 Morgan Stanley interns found that Stanley tumblers lagged in popularity compared to brands like Owala. Piper Sandler's 2024 Taking Stock With Teens survey found that teens saw Stanley as \"on the way out\" of style.\n\nNavarro pushed back on the narrative that Stanley is becoming stale.\n\n\"Whether you're 14 or 44, as long as we're meeting them in the right places in their lives, then we'll continue to remain relevant,\" he said.\n\nStanley's Quencher series may be losing momentum, but the company is exploring an identity as a lifestyle brand. Navarro said Stanley is paying close attention to what consumers want while sticking to its roots.\n\nThe Vitalize bags infuse the drinkware it's known for with wearable accessories, such as carrying straps that fit your Stanley cup.\n\n\"They're balancing work, play, yoga, all their passions in life, and they want products that fit into their lifestyle,\" Navarro said.\n\nThe tote and backpack aren't Stanley's first venture beyond drinkware. It also sells camping cookware, pet bowls, and a crossbody strap to carry your tumbler.\n\nNavarro said Stanley started as a brand for the working man in 1913 before shifting to an outdoor focus in 1965. Thanks to social media, it's evolved into a brand beloved by women. Collaborations with \"Wicked\" and lifestyle brand LoveShackFancy have drawn the attention of female consumers over the years.\n\nHowever, with the new shaker, backpack, and tote, Stanley also aims to attract more male customers, Navarro said.\n\nIt's also using partnerships, such as those with soccer star Lionel Messi and global football club Paris Saint-Germain, to win over men.\n\n\"Our partnerships work because they're authentic to us, and they're also authentic to our consumer,\" Navarro said.",

    "description": "Consultants at McKinsey, PwC, EY, and BCG raced to adopt AI. Now they're racing to measure it's actual value.",
    "fullText": "Big questions are swirling around AI's real impact — and consultants are racing to supply the answers.\n\nOver the past year, consulting firms have begun deploying armies of AI agents as they work to transform their own operations and advise clients to do the same — automating research, building task-specific tools, and building proprietary AI models.\n\nMcKinsey & Company CEO Bob Sternfels said last month that his firm has launched tens of thousands of internal AI agents in recent years, and eventually plans to have one for all of the company's 40,000 employees.\n\nAmid the rapid rollout, consultants are now asking themselves a tough question: Is it worth it? They are working to measure if AI is truly improving performance, boosting revenue, and freeing consultants to focus on higher-value work.\n\n\"I think we are now in the age of confusion,\" Mina Alaghband, a former McKinsey partner, now the chief customer officer at Writer, a full-stack enterprise AI platform built for agentic AI, told Business Insider.\n\nAlaghband said that a year ago, most companies were focused on adoption, tracking metrics such as how often a tool was used.\n\nNow, she says said the emphasis should be on measuring the value that's created — like the amount of human labor reassigned to higher-value work, or improvements in revenue.\n\nPwC's chief AI officer, Dan Priest, recently told Business Insider that PwC is now less concerned with how many agents it deploys, and more with how many human users each agent has.\n\nPriest said his firm starts by targeting an \"impact zone,\" such as improving the customer experience.\n\nWithin these impact zones, the firm looks to deploy \"specialized AI agents\" that have earned that designation because they're good at what they do, Priest said. \"When we deploy agents, we want to see a high rate of human adoption, which means more humans are using them,\" he said.\n\nEY also prioritizes quality over quantity, Steve Newman, EY's global engineering chief, told Business Insider. The firm tracks the value created by its AI agents through key performance indicators for productivity, quality, and cost efficiency on a month-to-month basis.\n\nIf the defining promises of the AI boom are speed and efficiency, then the metric that may matter more isn’t usage, but time reclaimed.\n\nBoston Consulting Group tracks its agents by that metric — and whether that time is then reinvested in higher-value work, Scott Wilder, a partner and managing director based in Dallas, told Business Insider.\n\nWilder said humans at the firm now spend about 15% less time on low-value activities, like making slideshows, and that those people are reinvesting about 70% of their saved time into higher-value activities, such as deeper analysis.\n\nTime saved doesn't always mean more work. At BCG, it can mean more free time. Wilder said BCG has found that employees keep about 30% of the time AI saves. \"They get a little more sleep or get to go to a yoga class or whatever someone wants to do,\" he said.\n\nNearly a century ago, economist John Keynes predicted that as productivity rose, the balance between work and leisure would inevitably change.\n\n\"I would predict that the standard of life in progressive countries one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as it is,\" he wrote in his 1930 essay \"Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren.\"\n\nIt's almost 2030, but in small ways, that vision may already be surfacing.\n\n\"It's benefiting them — and this is a tough job, so every hour of free time matters,\" Wilder said.\n\nSomething to share about how consultants are using AI?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dorenne Simonson, 66, who is her granddaughter's kinship care provider in New Jersey. Simonson has parented her since she was two months old. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always been in a situation where I had to spend whatever I made. There's no retirement account when you're single and raise five kids by yourself.\n\nMy oldest just turned 42, and my youngest will be 30 this year. I've also been a licensed foster parent since I got my granddaughter when she was two months old in 2022.\n\nI taught early literacy in a Head Start-type program for a few years in a second-grade classroom. After that, I started working in healthcare, managing primary care offices, and I've done so since 2009.\n\nI work from 8 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. It does offer me some flexibility, as there are only the two of us, just myself and the provider. My provider has three young children, so she understands my life more than the average person.\n\nMy children understand on some level how big a commitment this is for me, but only one of them has children. They've done what they can, but they still have their own lives.\n\nI had to become a licensed foster parent in order to take care of my grandchild once she was placed with me through the Division of Child Protection and Permanency. Her mother, my daughter, struggled with her mental health and developed a substance abuse problem during the pandemic. She got pregnant and gave birth to my granddaughter, who went into foster care shortly after she was born.\n\nMy granddaughter's caseworker called me in April 2022, saying they would bring her four days later. I had a little bit of a warning, but not a lot. I was fortunate to have coworkers with young children. They gave me old cribs and changing tables.\n\nI didn't have much experience with finding childcare services outside the home. I always worked so I could be home when my children were home, as I worked in a school district.\n\nI was getting an infant who had been exposed to drugs, so she had some medical issues. She was born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which basically means that she was going through withdrawal.\n\nThere were certain things that would trigger her, like a visit with her mom or dad. She would be inconsolable for hours on end, and I would have to hold her, rock her, and swaddle her because she was having a reaction.\n\nTrying to find childcare and medical care was pretty intense at the tail end of the pandemic. My company allowed me to take six weeks off, and I spent a lot of time on the phone trying to make connections to get her into doctors.\n\nI breastfed my five kids, so I had no concept whatsoever of how much formula costs. This was also during the formula shortage. It was $50 a container, and it lasted not even a week. It was also eye-opening for me how much people now pay for diapers. It's the expenses that you don't really expect that get me. This is in addition to all of my daily costs.\n\nI'm lucky in that respect, but finding childcare at the tail-end of the pandemic was nearly impossible. I'm already thinking about what will happen when the state no longer funds her childcare, which will happen when she goes to kindergarten full time. I'm going to have to figure out how to pay for either before- or after-school care.\n\nMy youngest son lives with me, but he works from 4 p.m. until midnight, so he's not really around to help out. When I first got my granddaughter, he had a day job, so he was around more, which was a huge help. Now, it's pretty much on me. I'm just managing on a wing and a prayer right now.\n\nI have to save all of my PTO time for caseworker meetings or in the event she gets sick and, God forbid, I should get sick myself.\n\nI get up at 5:30 to pack her lunch. She's up at 6:30. I get her dressed and do her hair. I have alarms on my phone that tell me what time it is, so I know where to be and when.\n\nAt 7:15, we need to be in the car to get to day care. I get to work at 8, and where I live, traffic can be a nightmare. It might take me an hour and a half to get home or get to work on any given day.\n\nAfter work, I pick her up at day care, and we drive home. I fix dinner at 6, put her in the bathtub by 6:30, and do our wind-down routine. At 7, we're reading books, and at 8, she's in bed. I'm usually awake for a while longer because I don't know if she's going to wake up. That's every single day, and it's just never-ending.\n\nOn weekends, I do laundry, clean, and try to get everything together for the week. I try on Sundays to make as much food as I can, so after work, I could just pull something out of the freezer and pop it in the microwave. I think of her food like medicine and try to feed her very cleanly because I don't want her to have a ton of preservatives.\n\nWe also tried gymnastics, swim lessons, and dance lessons, but it's really hard to do all of that and still function. I've made a real point to save as much of my stipend from New Jersey as I possibly can for her future needs.\n\nBesides my youngest, all my children live out of state. My life is very carefully planned at this point. I can't just drop everything and go do things. I used to love going to concerts with friends, but I haven't been to one in forever. It becomes very isolating.\n\nMy plan is to adopt my granddaughter when I can afford to go through the process financially. My mother lived to 87, and she died in an accident, so realistically, I might live longer than that.\n\nI'm hoping I will still be here for her when she's in college. I feel bad that she won't have me in her later adult years. My plan is to just keep going full speed ahead and figure it out as we go. I don't feel like I really have any choice.",

    "description": "Funds of hedge funds struggled to deal with the financial crisis and fallout from the Bernie Madoff scandal.",
    "fullText": "Funds that bet on hedge funds instead of stocks or bonds are finally in vogue again.\n\nThe double whammy of the financial crisis and Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme hit the fund-of-hedge-fund business so hard in 2008 that the industry is just now surpassing its 2007 asset level.\n\nData from Hedge Fund Research show that funds of hedge funds — which create portfolios of external hedge funds — now manage $818 billion, as of the end of 2025. It's the highest figure on record for the longtime industry tracker and the first time the industry has surpassed its onetime high-water mark of $799 billion in assets, which it ended 2007 with.\n\nThe surge in assets comes on the back of strong industry performance, with the average fund of funds returning 10.4% last year, the highest since 2009, according to Ken Heinz, president of Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research.\n\nThe asset growth can also be attributed to broader industry trends, Heinz said. Separately managed accounts, which give external fund investors more control over the managers they invest in, are now much more common. Firms like billionaire Izzy Englander's Millennium have increasingly used SMAs to access investing talent outside their walls. A With Intelligence report from last summer found that multistrategy funds have allocated to more than 100 external funds.\n\nThe greater insight granted to LPs via SMAs allows funds of funds to more closely monitor performance and risk metrics.\n\n\"Funds of funds have evolved,\" Heinz said.\n\nThe hedge fund industry overall has changed drastically compared to roughly two decades ago. Funds of funds and wealthy individuals' family offices used to account for a much larger share of hedge funds' overall assets. Still, the 2008 market crash forced many to liquidate their holdings, even if a fund had performed well.\n\nThis forced the hedge fund industry to turn elsewhere for capital, and now institutions such as pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, and foundations make up the vast majority of the $5.2 trillion in assets in the space. This shift to a more institutional investor base is why hedge fund assets have soared over the past 18 years, while funds of funds have slowly inched up.\n\nBut the diversification offered by funds of funds is still sought out, as evidenced by the surge in investor interest in multistrategy hedge funds, particularly the biggest players like Millennium, Citadel, Point72, and Balyasny. Heinz expects that this interest has helped the fund-of-funds space in recent years and will continue to pump up assets as the biggest players fill up.\n\n\"Some of the larger multimanager programs are not always open or have a very high minimum,\" he said.\n\nStill, there are other ways in which \"the broad exodus\" from the space in 2008 is being felt. In 2007, there were nearly 2,500 funds of hedge funds, according to Hedge Fund Research. At the end of 2025, there were fewer than 1,000.",

    "description": "Geetha Rajan used to lead upskilling for over 50,000 employees at PwC. She cautions workers against outsourcing their thinking to AI tools.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Geetha Rajan, a director on the global strategy team at Freshworks, a SaaS company. She's based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a director on the global strategy team at Freshworks, where I drive high-priority strategic initiatives that shape the company's growth, investment decisions, and execution, including on AI adoption.\n\nPreviously, I spent nearly a decade at PwC advising Fortune 500 companies across healthcare, financial services, and technology on growth strategy and digital transformation. As part of my role, I led the upskilling of over 50,000 employees on automation tools.\n\nTechnological transformation has always been happening, but the cloud or mobile transformation took at least 10 years to fully adopt. ChatGPT hit millions of users in the first few months.\n\nA lot of employers will keep expecting that you use AI every day without really understanding the consequences. That's the pressure that actually leads you to make more mistakes rather than use it thoughtfully.\n\nThese are some of the mistakes I see that make employees making when adopting AI:\n\nA lot of people try to jump straight into becoming Iron Man and fully automate their workflow. It should be a process. The first step is treating AI or the technology as a super intern, so you have the most control over things while giving it low agency.\n\nFor example, if you start with giving structured data, but you verify every output. AI can hallucinate outputs that are beautifully formatted.\n\nI'm a strategy consultant and advisor. So, in terms of the ideation and thinking, that's the one part I don't usually outsource to AI.\n\nThis has come through a lot of experience in consulting and being in the workforce itself. I first want to mentally write down my model and first principles. I definitely verify numbers and even try to extract unstructured data from AI, but I still write my first draft very rigorously, keeping my first-principles hat on.\n\nAfter you've completed a draft, you can ask it to poke holes and say, \"Hey, you are the most skeptical board member, or the CFO, poke holes in my strategy.\"\n\nA lot of AI outputs are really polished. But if you don't have that acumen, if you haven't seen this enough number of times, you actually can't tell if an AI is actually making a mistake or not. This is where a lot of the workslop comes in: You just take the AI output and throw it into an email or an analysis.\n\nI've made this mistake myself, where I had five or 10 minutes, and I asked AI to quickly write down some design principles for me and throw them on a slide. When I was presenting, I was like, \"Wait, I don't think this makes sense, and this is not what I was actually trying to say.\" I actually embarrassed myself.\n\nYou can also easily get caught up in a situation where the language AI uses is not something you would use colloquially or even in a professional setting.\n\nSometimes my biggest worry is what happens five years from now — when nobody actually did that initial job, and we're burning the ladder as we try to climb it. As much as AI can do things, I think it's more about the commitment to yourself that you still learn problem-solving skills and how to use Excel.\n\nYou need to know exactly who you're solving for and what the purpose of solving that exercise is.\n\nFor example, if you're building an AI model to understand your business's customer segments, you still need to know your segments at a high level. That's the part I would never outsource. If you don't have that context yourself, you could just go in a million directions.\n\nThe fundamental things about taste, process, architecture, how you build things — those don't come from any tool, irrespective of whether you're using ChatGPT or the latest model. If AI throws 50 ideas at you, you need to know which one of those is going to stick. As an employee, it is your responsibility to pick the right one, so you need the acumen and expertise to do so.",

    "description": "Prime minister says action will be taken on young people’s social media access in ‘months, not...",
    "fullText": "Prime minister says action will be taken on young people’s social media access in ‘months, not years’\n\nWhat social media restrictions has Keir Starmer announced?\n\nKeir Starmer has pledged action on young people’s access to social media in “months, not years”, while saying this did not necessarily mean a complete ban on access for under-16s.\n\nSpeaking at an event in London after the government promised to extend the crackdown to AI chatbots that place children at risk, Starmer said the issue was nuanced and that a ban was not definite, noting concerns from charities such as the NSPCC.\n\n“I think this is such an important issue that we need to go into it with a ban as a possibility,” he told a community hub in Putney, saying he would “definitely want to look at the evidence” gathered during a three-month consultation.\n\nHe added: “There are powerful arguments on both sides. Some people simply say just get all under-16s off social media, and that’s the end of it. NSPCC, obviously an organisation very concerned with children’s protection, says no, it’ll push children to even darker places.\n\n“Others – I was with young people this morning, 15- and 16-year-olds who are actually going to be affected by this – they said to me, look we get our news from social media, we don’t read the papers, and therefore you’ll stop us accessing the news. We need to look at all of this in the round.”\n\nDowning Street has announced plans to rush through any changes recommended after the consultation by tabling amendments to two bills already going through parliament, the children’s wellbeing and schools bill, and the crime and policing bill.\n\nThe plan would be for these amendments to create powers for ministers to implement various plans, with the children’s bill covering social media and the crime bill closing possible loopholes connected to AI chatbots. This would, Starmer said, allow rapid action.\n\n“We’ve taken the powers to make sure we can act within months, not years,” he said. “We also need to act very quickly, not just on the age concern, but on the devices and applications that make the sort of auto-scrolling, the constant glueing to the machine that you can never stop scrolling.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t think there’s a parent in the country who isn’t worried about this, by the way, I really don’t. The status quo, things as they are now, is not good enough. Nobody can make the argument that things can be left as they are. They can’t, they’re not protective of children, and we intend to act.”\n\nAsked if MPs and peers would get a chance to debate and vote on the specifics of any policy which emerged, as well as just the amendments to empower them happening, Downing Street indicated this would be the case. “Both houses will have to approve the secondary legislation which will deliver the policies,” Starmer’s official spokesperson said, pointing reporters to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) for details. DSIT was contacted for comment.\n\nIn an earlier post on his Substack page, Starmer expanded on his worries about social media, setting out that he believed that in its current form it harmed children. “When Facebook first launched in 2004, it was a pretty simple concept,” he wrote. “Make a profile, post updates that people could look at in the order they were posted, like and comment on what your friends had to say.\n\n“That is a world away from the algorithms, endless scrolling, For You pages and private chats that make up the modern world of social media. In the past 20-plus years, social media has evolved to become something completely different from the simple, stripped-back pages it was in its conception.\n\n“And in that evolution, it has become something that is quietly harming our children. A harm that, due to the inaction of previous Tory governments, we are allowing to happen.”",

    "fullText": "Industry using ‘diversionary’ tactics, says analyst, as energy-hungry complex functions such as video generation and deep research proliferate\n\nTech companies are conflating traditional artificial intelligence with generative AI when claiming the energy-hungry technology could help avert climate breakdown, according to a report.\n\nMost claims that AI can help avert climate breakdown refer to machine learning and not the energy-hungry chatbots and image generation tools driving the sector’s explosive growth of gas-guzzling datacentres, the analysis of 154 statements found.\n\nThe research, commissioned by nonprofits including Beyond Fossil Fuels and Climate Action Against Disinformation, did not find a single example where popular tools such as Google’s Gemini or Microsoft’s Copilot were leading to a “material, verifiable, and substantial” reduction in planet-heating emissions.\n\nKetan Joshi, an energy analyst and author of the report, said the industry’s tactics were “diversionary” and relied on tried and tested methods that amount to “greenwashing”.\n\nHe likened it to fossil fuel companies advertising their modest investments in solar panels and overstating the potential of carbon capture.\n\n“These technologies only avoid a minuscule fraction of emissions relative to the massive emissions of their core business,” said Joshi. “Big tech took that approach and upgraded and expanded it.”\n\nMost of the claims that were scrutinised came from an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, which was reviewed by leading tech companies, and corporate reports from Google and Microsoft.\n\nThe IEA report – which devoted two chapters to the potential climate benefits of traditional AI – had a roughly even split between claims that rested on academic publications, corporate websites and those that had no evidence, according to the analysis. For Google and Microsoft, most claims lacked evidence.\n\nThe analysis, released during the AI Impact Summit in Delhi this week, argues the tech industry has misleadingly presented climate solutions and carbon pollution as a package deal by “muddling” types of AI.\n\nSasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, an open-source AI platform and community, who was not involved in the report, said it added nuance to a debate that often lumped very different applications together.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s relatively bad for the planet, it’s mostly generative AI and large language models,” said Luccioni, who has pushed the industry to be more transparent about its carbon footprint.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s ‘good’ for the planet, it’s often predictive models, extractive models, or old-school AI models.”\n\nGreen claims even for traditional AI tended to rely on weak forms of evidence that had not been independently verified, the analysis found. Only 26% of the green claims that were studied cited published academic research, while 36% did not cite evidence at all.\n\nOne of the earliest examples identified in the report was a widespread claim that AI could help mitigate 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nThe figure, which Google repeated as recently as April last year, came from a report it commissioned from BCG, a consulting firm, which cited a blogpost it wrote in 2021 that attributed the figure to its “experience with clients”.\n\nDatacentres consume just 1% of the world’s electricity but their share of US electricity is projected to more than double to 8.6% by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. The IEA predicts they will account for at least 20% of the rich world’s growth in electricity demand to the end of the decade.\n\nWhile the energy consumption of a simple text query to a large language model such as ChatGPT may be as little as running a lightbulb for a minute, partial industry disclosures suggest, it rises considerably for complex functions such as video generation and deep research, and has troubled some energy researchers with the speed and scale of its growth.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: “Our estimated emissions reductions are based on a robust substantiation process grounded in the best available science, and we have transparently shared the principles and methodology that guide it.”\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment, while the IEA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJoshi said the discourse around AI’s climate benefits needed to be “brought back to reality”.\n\n“The false coupling of a big problem and a small solution serves as a distraction from the very preventable harms being done through unrestricted datacentre expansion,” he said.",

    "fullText": "England's 12-game winning run was ended emphatically at Murrayfield on Saturday as Scotland regained the Calcutta Cup with an inspired 31-20 victory.\n\nHaving kept faith with mostly the same starting XV during England's autumn run of successes and commanding win over Wales, will their disappointing performance in Edinburgh result in some changes?\n\nHere are some potential selection dilemmas as head coach Steve Borthwick considers his team for Saturday's must-win Six Nations game against Ireland at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham (14:10 GMT).\n\nHenry Arundell is available for the game after avoiding further punishment for his red card at Murrayfield.\n\nThe 23-year-old received two yellow cards on Saturday - the second for dangerously taking a player out in the air - and it proved costly, putting his position at risk.\n\nFit-again centre Ollie Lawrence came into the campaign with a knee injury, which helped prompt Tommy Freeman's switch from the wing to outside centre.\n\nFreeman is usually deployed on the right wing but has played on the left, starting there in England's last win over Ireland in 2024.\n\nGiven England's struggles in the air against Scotland, a swap back to the wing seems logical because of Freeman's aerial dominance.\n\nBut establishing the Northampton Saint at 13 has been a clear goal of the England coaching staff.\n\nWould a like-for-like swap with Elliot Daly be more beneficial for Freeman's long-term growth as a centre? Or now that Lawrence is fit, is he better deployed back at centre, allowing Freeman to return to the wing?\n\nTom Roebuck struggled to impose himself in the air against Scotland - a rarity during his time in an England shirt - which could still open up a spot for Daly, even if Lawrence comes into the centre and Freeman moves out.\n\nWingers Cadan Murley and Ollie Hassell-Collins, who would need to be called into the squad, are also sharp finishers and scored in England A's recent win over an Ireland XV.\n\n\"I stand by what I said last week. I wanted to see Ollie Lawrence at 13 and Fraser Dingwall at 12, with a back three of Tom Roebuck, Tommy Freeman and Freddie Steward,\" former England wing Ugo Monye told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"If you want to play so heavily on this kicking game, then select your best wingers for it.\"\n\nMurley endured a tough debut against Ireland in last year's Six Nations, while Hassell-Collins was dropped after the opening two rounds of the 2023 tournament.\n\nFive talking points from round two of Six Nations\n\nEngland wing Arundell free to play against Ireland\n\nOn the flanks, the balance of Bath duo Guy Pepper and Sam Underhill brought a winning formula in the autumn, with number eight Ben Earl able to roam and be at his explosive best.\n\nDespite Earl still impressing in Edinburgh, Pepper and Underhill, who have started the past four Tests together, failed to reach their recent high standards.\n\n\"Underhill is one of the best tacklers in the game in terms of being both offensive and destructive,\" former Scotland captain John Barclay told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"He fell off two tackles in the move that led to the Ben White try - it was very uncharacteristic of him.\n\n\"Pepper was also pretty quiet, but Ben Earl carried really well.\"\n\nBorthwick picks his back row as a unit, which has led to British and Irish Lions Tom Curry and Henry Pollock being deployed in the final quarter of games.\n\nThe impact of a stacked bench worked until Saturday, as the replacements had too much to do.\n\nPollock, 21, who is yet to start a Test, still offered impact with his powerful ball carrying and work on the ground.\n\nCurry started all three Lions Tests and was a standout performer, with his injury record potentially a factor in his six-game run on the bench.\n\nWhether Underhill and Pepper can play the role of impact finishers to the same level may also affect Borthwick's selection, but Curry's experience may justify starting him alongside Pollock and Earl.\n\nSix Nations: The weekend review\n\nThis time last year, Marcus and Fin Smith were battling to become England's starting fly-half. They now find themselves fighting for the back-up spot behind George Ford.\n\nFord's missed drop-goal proved a defining moment on Saturday, but his performances in the autumn and against Wales make it unlikely he will be dropped.\n\nFin Smith came into camp injured, which made Marcus' spot on the bench straightforward against Wales in the opening round.\n\nHe returned to the replacements in place of his namesake against Scotland, leaving the Harlequins playmaker out of the matchday squad - even with his ability to cover full-back.\n\n\"The big one is Marcus and not having him on the bench. The guy is a game-changer. He can also play full-back,\" former England wing Chris Ashton told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"If the game is not going the way you want it to, then Marcus can change it.\"\n\nVersatility helped Marcus, who was on the bench for the first Lions Test in the summer, edge out Northampton's Fin for England's final two autumn internationals.\n\nThat came after the 23-year-old Fin started four games at 10 in last year's Six Nations, with Ashton adding that he is more suited to starting matches.\n\n\"Borthwick thought about getting Fin Smith some game time [against Scotland],\" Ashton added.\n\n\"You have to back Fin to play from the start.\"\n\nThe bench make-up will play a big role in who gets the nod, and with Ireland's struggles up front against France and Italy, a 6-2 split of forwards to backs will favour Marcus Smith's utility.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nSix Nations quiz - can you name all the try-scorers in week two?",

    "description": "Mark Callan has gone viral for his on-ice antics. But who is he and how did he end up at the Winter Olympics?",
    "fullText": "Did you hear about the 61-year-old from Glasgow who's been captured moonwalking down the curling rink at the Winter Olympics?\n\nMark Callan shakes his head and laughs. It's been quite a week or so for the Scot, who has been plastered all over various social media platforms in the course of doing his job.\n\nYou might well have seen Callan. He is the guy with the back pack and hose, shuffling backwards down the sheet inside the near-empty Cortina Curling Stadium, spraying plumes of water into the air. Pebbling the ice, it's called.\n\nSome clips have been set to music, exaggerating his dainty movements. Parodies have appeared. One broadcaster from Norway, amid peals of laughter, described the chief ice technician as \"scooting\" down the sheet.\n\nSafe to say the Bishopbriggs-native - who now lives with his partner and two-year-old child in Copenhagen - has not been spared by his friends and family either.\n\n\"They've been like 'dearie me, what are you up to?'\" the World Curling employee tells BBC Sport. \"They're quite enjoying seeing some of the things out there and some of the comments as well.\n\n\"It seems to have just taken off but all I'm doing is my job. If, with all the doom and gloom in the world, it puts a smile on people's face, then I'm fine with that.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nBeing centre of attention at the Winter Olympics in northern Italy is a long way from an ice rink in Aberfoyle, where Callan had his first experience of curling at Forest Hills, having been intrigued by seeing the sport on television.\n\nThat rink no longer exists, but Callan's memories remain vivid. Mainly of him falling over a lot.\n\nHe kept going back, though, and one day curiosity got the better of him when he noticed someone pebbling the ice. \"They explained what was going on and I wanted to learn more… and now I'm here.\"\n\nSo what actually is going on? And why the moonwalk?\n\nCallan explains that he wears a gravity-fed backpack containing 15 litres of water, and his job is to sprinkle the ice with water droplets of different sizes. Those freeze almost immediately and are only removed by the furious sweeping of the players' brushes.\n\nThe \"sharp steps\" - as he calls them - are to keep him balanced on the slippy surface and ensure the spread of water is as even as possible.\n\nCallan has been at the rink in Italy since mid-January, having arrived at his fourth Olympics to find \"a concrete floor and contractors everywhere\" in what is usually an ice hockey venue.\n\nThe quirky Cortina Curling Stadium used to be an open-air arena - hosting the 1956 Games - and, although a roof has since been added as part of the renovations, many of the original features remain, such as the wooden bleachers.\n\nAll that makes controlling the ice a particular challenge for Callan and his small team but the reception from players and fans alike has been warm.\n\n\"I think the word iconic is used a lot, and with the real mix of old and new, it's just a phenomenal venue,\" he says. \"And it looks really good on TV as well.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "title": "'A sad day' - curling cheating row at Winter Games unsettles Canadians",
    "description": "Both men's and women's Canadian curling teams have been accused of cheating at the 2026 Winter Olympics.",
    "fullText": "A scandal at the Winter Olympics has left the Canadian curling teams on the defensive and Canadians reeling over the crack in their country's polite persona.\n\nOver the weekend, Canadian curler Marc Kennedy had an expletive-filled outburst after Sweden accused him of cheating during a match, and later said his team might be the target of a \"premeditated\" attack by their rivals.\n\nKennedy was accused of \"double-touching\" - touching the stone a second time after initially releasing it down the ice. The next day, Canadian women's captain Rachel Holman was accused of using the same move.\n\nBoth have denied the accusations, but Canada's curling teams, who historically have dominated the sport, now face questions over their tactics.\n\nWhile the curlers have shown their anger over the situation during matches, fans of the sport and Canadians have questioned whether the team acted in the spirit of curling.\n\nIn a country well known for its \"niceness\", the cheating row has stung for some. The BBC asked tourists and locals in Montreal what they made of it.\n\n\"It's a sad day for Canadian sport,\" said Tim Gray, from Alberta. \"Integrity in the sport is important, even if you have to call it on yourself.\"\n\n\"As Canadians, we aren't supposed to do these things,\" said Samar, from Ontario.\n\nWithout sportsmanship, said Dwayne from British Columbia, it's not sport any more.\n\nThere was a more nuanced take at the Royal Montreal Curling Club.\n\nOne of the curling instructors, Ankara Leonard, said the publicity could be good for the sport by generating interest.\n\nShe added: \"Do I think [Kennedy's] finger affects the rock? No I do not. Do I think we have to play within the rules? Yes.\"\n\nThe controversy began on Friday when Swedish player Oskar Eriksson accused Kennedy of double-touching.\n\nAs the game continued, Kennedy and Eriksson got into a verbal back-and-forth that included expletives.\n\nTheir exchange quickly went viral as a video emerged that appeared to show Kennedy pushing the stone with his finger after releasing it.\n\nKennedy got a verbal warning from World Curling for using foul language, but he was not formally charged with cheating by the governing body.\n\nThe next day, Kennedy said: \"I probably could have handled it better. But we're human out there and there's a lot of emotions. I'm not going to apologise for defending my teammates and standing up for myself.\"\n\n\"I've curled my whole life, never once with the intention of getting an advantage through cheating,\" he added.\n\nAn opinion piece in the Canadian news outlet, the Globe and Mail, pointed to some of the frustration felt back home\n\n\"These Canadian curling teams are not fun bad guys. They come off like the sort of competitors who need so desperately to win that they will do anything - even things that are pointless - in order to get there.\"\n\nCathal Kelly, the writer of the opinion piece, continued: \"There's an easy way out of this - stop struggling. Stop acting like our curling reputation matters more than our national one. Be the bigger man and woman, even if you don't think you did anything wrong.\"\n\nThere was a second cheating row on Saturday when match officials accused the Canadian women's team of the same double-touch violation.\n\nRachel Homan said there was a \"zero percent chance\" there had truly been a violation, as she and her teammates looked on in frustration. The Canadians lost to the Swiss, 8-7.\n\nOn Sunday, Great Britain's men's team was accused of the same violation.\n\nBoth Homan and British men's curler Bobby Lammie had stones removed from play due to alleged violations.\n\nHoman later slammed the officials' decision to remove her stone during a defeat to Switzerland, saying it was \"insane\".\n\nAll of the incidents led World Curling to clarify that double-tapping is not allowed.\n\n\"During forward motion, touching the granite of the stone is not allowed. This will result in the stone being removed from play,\" they said.\n\nWorld Curling does not use video to review play, but they did send two officials to monitor how players released their stones in subsequent games.\n\nCurling columnist and Olympian Tomi Rantamaki, in an article for The Curling News, warned that Canada's dominance in the world of curling means its players should be mindful of the influence they have.\n\n\"Young players in Finland, Korea, Italy, Sweden - everywhere - often copy what Canadian teams do. They copy the athlete's delivery, the sweeping, the tactics, the communication,\" Rantamaki wrote. \"And they copy the behaviour.\"",

    "description": "After a difficult start as Real Madrid manager, Alvaro Arbeloa will know the importance of progressing past Jose Mourinho's Benfica in the Champions League play-off round.",
    "fullText": "Alvaro Arbeloa's Real Madrid tenure is only five weeks old - but Tuesday's Champions League trip to Benfica already feels like it could be a defining night for the fledgling boss.\n\nThe 43-year-old replaced Xabi Alonso last month and, despite no official confirmation, sources close to both the club and Arbeloa told BBC Sport he has a contract until the end of next season.\n\nReal knew the appointment of a head coach with no top-level managerial experience was risky.\n\nAnd after a slow start for Arbeloa and a less than positive reception from supporters, they quickly started planning for potential replacements - including former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca - in case another change was needed.\n\nBut after six wins from their past seven matches, there is a new feeling of calm among the Real hierarchy with the club top of La Liga. However, Arbeloa will know failure in Europe would pile the pressure back on once again.\n\nReal's only loss in those seven games came against Benfica, when a sensational 4-2 victory by Jose Mourinho's side left Los Blancos needing a play-off against the same opponents to stay in the competition they have won six times in 12 years.\n\nOf course there is a second leg at home to come on Wednesday, 25 February, but failing to reach at least the last 16 - for the first time in more than three decades - is unthinkable for the Real faithful.\n\nWounded kings Real will be dangerous - Mourinho\n\nLucky break that changed Alexander-Arnold's Real future\n\nLast-gasp keeper goal puts Benfica into play-offs as Real miss top eight\n\nSince the defeat in Lisbon in January, Arbeloa has made some changes, including tweaking Real's formation.\n\nThat match was the last time he played with a 4-3-3 formation, where Franco Mastantuono, Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr started as the front three.\n\nIn Real's subsequent three games, Arbeloa has changed to a 4-4-2 set-up, where Mastantuono drops back into midfield to leave Gonzalo Garcia, Vinicius and Mbappe as rotating striker options.\n\n\"Defensively, it's a structure that closes down the midfield corridor, where there are more players, and allows us to be more compact,\" Arbeloa said.\n\n\"With the type of players we have, if we want to counter-attack, it also allows us to do so. We have a lot of room for improvement. I'm very happy because, beyond the systems, the key is effort, mentality, and teamwork, and we're achieving that.\"\n\nAsked if his team is stronger with four midfielders, Arbeloa explained that \"the goal is always to be solid\".\n\n\"It's very difficult these days to play good football if you're not solid, compact, and don't know how to press high up the pitch,\" he added.\n\n\"To do all that, you need a lot of concentration, a lot of work and training. [Federico] Valverde, [Eduardo] Camavinga, [Aurelien] Tchouameni, and [Arda] Guler are doing a fantastic job [in midfield], and I don't need to tell them anything new.\"\n\nAnother major shift has been in squad availability. Former Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold and Germany centre-half Antonio Rudiger have both returned after spells out with injury, strengthening Arbeloa's defensive options.\n\nArbeloa was particularly complimentary of Alexander-Arnold after Saturday's 4–1 victory over Real Sociedad, where the full-back provided an assist - and his coach said Real were \"lucky to have\" him.\n\n\"We're not going to discover anything new about Trent,\" Arbeloa told Real Madrid TV.\n\n\"It was a nice surprise to see how he understands the game, how he finds the spaces. Those things are very important for a coach - having players who understand what we want.\"\n\nArbeloa selected Alexander-Arnold ahead of Spain's Dani Carvajal, with both players fit again, while Valverde was restored to his preferred role in midfield.\n\nHowever, Real remain without England midfielder Jude Bellingham - who is not expected back until April having injured his hamstring last month - while Brazil defender Eder Militao will not feature again this season because of a knee injury.\n\nRaul Asencio and Rodrygo will also be absent on Tuesday through suspension.\n\nArbeloa acknowledged the challenge facing his side on Tuesday, pointing to the intimidating atmosphere at the Estadio Da Luz which can create relentless pressure.\n\n\"We have to give absolutely everything to win. That's always the objective,\" he said.\n\n\"But winning will require us to play very, very well. We must get many things right, defend well, attack well, be focused on set-pieces and play a very complete game for 90 minutes.\"\n\nArbeloa admitted Real may possess greater individual talent than their opponents, but warned leadership and belief often matter more on nights like these.\n\n\"Their spirit will be very similar to what it was three weeks ago,\" he said.\n\n\"They have a leader [Mourinho] who sets the course, dictating how they play and compete. From there, there are minor differences. But it will be a very competitive, tough team. And we must be prepared.\"\n\nAfter these two teams were drawn against each other, Mourinho hailed his former club Madrid as \"the king\" of the Champions League.\n\nSo the challenge for Arbeloa is clear: can he ensure Real's reputation remains in tact, rather than it being stripped away in the first leg of a potentially tenure-shaping tie?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn has returned to the United States after four operations on the broken leg she sustained at the Winter Olympics - but has yet to stand up nine days after the crash.\n\nThe American great - who was racing just nine days after rupturing ligaments in her left knee - struck a gate 13 seconds into her downhill run in Cortina on 8 February.\n\nShe was airlifted off the piste and taken to hospital in Treviso, where she was diagnosed with a \"complex tibia fracture\" in her left leg.\n\nThe 41-year-old was discharged from hospital on Sunday and has flown home, where further surgery will take place.\n\n\"Haven't stood on my feet in over a week,\" she wrote on X., external\n\n\"Been in a hospital bed immobile since my race.

I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk,\" she added.\n\n\"Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk. Because even if you are the strongest person in the world, the mountain always holds the cards.\n\n\"I was willing to risk and push and sacrifice for something I knew I was absolutely capable of doing. I will always take the risk of crashing while giving it my all, rather than not ski to my potential and have regret.\n\n\"I never want to cross finish line and say,\"what if?\" And to be perfectly honest, I was stronger physically in that moment than I have been often in the past.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "The Champions League returns this week and some of Europe's biggest teams will be back in action a lot earlier than they would have hoped.",
    "fullText": "The Champions League returns this week and some of Europe's biggest names will be back in action earlier than they would have hoped.\n\nFrom September to January, 36 teams each played eight different opponents with the top eight leaping into the last 16, while the bottom 12 have been eliminated.\n\nThose that finished between ninth and 24th now have a two-legged knockout play-off to navigate with the eight winners advancing to the last 16.\n\nReigning European champions Paris St-Germain are among those returning, so too Inter Milan, the team they beat in the 2025 final.\n\nFifteen-time European winners Real Madrid also finished outside the top eight, as did other previous champions in Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and Benfica.\n\nNo side qualified for the play-offs in more dramatic style than Jose Mourinho's Benfica, who were seconds away from elimination before goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored in the eighth minute of stoppage time to send them through.\n\nThat came in a 4-2 victory against Real Madrid, and Alvaro Arbeloa's team have an instant chance for revenge as the two sides meet each other in the play-offs.\n\nFive of the six English entrants ended in the top eight - Arsenal came first with eight wins from eight games, while Liverpool were third, Tottenham fourth, Chelsea sixth and Manchester City eighth.\n\nThat means the only English representation in the Champions League over the next two weeks will be Newcastle United, who will fancy their chances of defeating Azerbaijani club Qarabag, a side thrashed 6-0 by Liverpool in January.\n\nSo if you finish outside the top eight and have to face another two matches, does that wreck your chances of Champions League glory?\n\nAs PSG spectacularly proved last season, it certainly does not.\n\nIn 2024-25, Luis Enrique's side were facing Champions League elimination when 2-0 down at home to Manchester City on matchday seven of the league phase.\n\nBut PSG won 4-2 and then defeated Stuttgart 4-1 in another must-win tie to finish 15th in the league. They then crushed fellow Ligue 1 side Brest 10-0 on aggregate in the knockout play-offs, defeated Liverpool on penalties in the last 16, got past Aston Villa and Arsenal in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively before thrashing Inter 5-0 in the final.\n\nPSG face Monaco in this season's play-offs with Luis Enrique unconcerned by the extra matches, saying his side can win back-to-back Champions League trophies.\n\n\"If any team is ready for the play-offs, it is us,\" he said.\n\n\"We knew it was a possibility that we might have to go into the play-offs. We will have to take the long route, but I don't think anyone else can be considered favourites more than us.\"\n\nThe other European club competitions also adopted similar formats last season, with Real Betis reaching the Conference League final, losing 4-1 to Chelsea, despite coming 15th in the league phase.\n\nHowever, it was not the same in the Europa League.\n\nSeven of the top eight reached the quarter-finals with fourth-placed Tottenham beating third-placed Manchester United in the final.\n\nDespite having two extra matches, football data specialists Opta rate PSG's chances of winning the Champions League higher than top-eight finishers Tottenham and Sporting.\n\nNewcastle and Inter Milan are rated as having a 3% chance of lifting the trophy, the same as Spurs.\n\nFollowing a perfect league phase, table-toppers Arsenal are judged to have a 30% chance of becoming European champions for the first time.\n\nHowever, they will be wary of what happened to Liverpool last season after Arne Slot's side finished top of the league, only to then run into PSG at the last-16 phase and be eliminated.\n\nBayern Munich, who cannot meet Arsenal until the final, are given a 14% chance, followed by both Manchester City and Liverpool on 10%, then Chelsea and Barcelona on 7%.\n\nThe common theme among the English sides that qualified for the last 16 was the relief at having two fewer games to play.\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, whose side were eliminated by Real Madrid in the knockout play-offs 12 months ago, said: \"We're really pleased to not play one knockout stage. Hopefully we can arrive in March at our best.\n\n\"We are really pleased to finish top eight, considering how [tough] the Champions League has become. When I started 16 or 17 years ago, the Champions League was a different type of competition than today. Every team is really, really, really, really, really tough.\"\n\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta, reflecting on his side's perfect league phase, added: \"We are in the position we wanted to be. We won eight games out of eight which is so difficult to do, so credit to the boys.\n\n\"We close this chapter now and can focus on other competitions.\"\n\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot said: \"You want to finish top eight because that helps because you skip a round, so we're happy we are going straight to the last 16.\"\n\nChelsea manager Liam Rosenior called it \"massive\" to reach the last 16, adding: \"It is huge for us to be able to be able to work with the players on the training ground. I can run them and get them fitter.\"\n\nEven though Newcastle have to take part in the play-offs, Opta give Eddie Howe's side an 88.5% chance of beating Qarabag and making the last 16.\n\nAsked if he would have settled for a play-off at the start of the competition in September, Howe said: \"I probably would have done. We didn't set out with that intention, we set out to try to qualify outright, but you take every eventuality that falls your way.\n\n\"We gave everything we could to try to finish in the top eight - we didn't quite get there, so we have to go another route. We are pleased to still be in the competition and still be fighting.\"\n\nNewcastle defender Dan Burn put a positive spin on the extra games, saying: \"We wanted to miss the play-offs but we're looking forward to it.\n\n\"This is the first time Newcastle are getting to the [Champions League] knockouts in its history so we are very proud.\"\n\nMonaco v Paris St-Germain (winners to play Barcelona or Chelsea)\n\nGalatasaray v Juventus (winners to play Liverpool or Tottenham)\n\nBenfica v Real Madrid (winners to play Sporting or Manchester City)\n\nBorussia Dortmund v Atalanta (winners to play Arsenal or Bayern Munich)\n\nQarabag v Newcastle (winners to play Barcelona or Chelsea)\n\nClub Brugge v Atletico Madrid (winners to play Liverpool or Tottenham)\n\nBodo/Glimt v Inter Milan (winners to play Sporting or Manchester City)\n\nOlympiacos v Bayer Leverkusen (winners to play Arsenal or Bayern Munich)\n\nTeams listed first will be at home in the first legs on 17-18 February with the second legs on 24-25 February.\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "description": "One set of clubs dominate the Champions League, another win their domestic title every year but cannot compete - does European football have a problem?",
    "fullText": "As Ludogorets celebrated becoming Bulgarian champions once again last summer, history reared into view - only Tafea, from the South Pacific archipelago of Vanuatu, could top their 14 successive titles. Just one more to tie the world record.\n\nYet this domestic dominance has not translated into the Champions League. For a decade they have been too powerful for their league but not strong enough to trouble the continent's elite, further highlighting the disparity in a delicate ecosystem.\n\nAt the top of the food chain, a Champions League that began for title winners in 1992 this season boasts six English sides, five Spanish and four each from Italy and Germany - four nations accounting for more than half the 36 league-phase teams.\n\nWhile the competition has increased in size and value - Uefa's TV rights grew from just shy of £500m in 2003-04 to £2.8bn in 2023-24, with the new cycle from 2027 expected to generate more than £4bn - the pool of winners has narrowed.\n\nOnly Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain have broken the English and Spanish clubs' hold on the trophy in the past 15 years. An Italian team last won it in 2010.\n\nIt would be a huge shock to see former champions Marseille, Ajax or Porto, for example, win the competition in the near future. Even more so Red Star Belgrade, PSV or Steaua Bucharest (now FCSB) from the latter days of the European Cup.\n\nA revamp of the competition has allowed more clubs to participate, play more games and register more upsets - most notably debutants Bodo/Glimt, who beat Manchester City and Atletico Madrid this term.\n\nYet Ajax, in 2019, are the only club outside Europe's top five leagues to reach the semi-finals in the past two decades. Over the past four seasons, only Benfica (twice) have muscled in to make the quarter-finals.\n\n\"If you said when the Champions League was born in 1992 'this is what it's going to be like', I'm pretty sure they'll have said 'wow, we really messed up',\" says Alex Muzio, president of the Union of European Clubs (UEC).\n\nMuzio points to France as a warning for competitions becoming too \"predictable\", with PSG aiming for a 12th title in 14 years.\n\n\"People don't want to watch competitions where you know who's going to win,\" he says, suggesting there are now only four top leagues in Europe.\n\nLigue 1 does face a challenging TV rights landscape, streaming matches on its own channel this season in a direct-to-consumer deal that pits it closer to the Netherlands’ Eredivisie than Serie A, whose own domestic broadcast revenue has fallen slightly.\n\nOther top leagues have also plateaued.\n\nFrance, despite boasting a deep talent pool, will only have one representative in the Champions League last 16 after PSG drew Monaco in the play-offs.\n\nMuzio, majority owner of Belgian title winners Union Saint-Gilloise, says fans crave competitions with more parity - such as the Premier League, cricket's IPL and American football's NFL - while growing financial disparities will mean more \"haves and have-nots\".\n\n\"The football community needs to come together and understand that it works as a community in a way that other businesses do not,\" he adds. \"We need each other.\"\n\nUefa says it recognises competitive balance across European football is \"essential for the health and sustainability of the game\" but is also a \"complex challenge\" that cannot be addressed by Europe's governing body alone.\n\nIt says structural disparities between leagues and clubs are influenced by a wide range of factors that extend beyond European competition revenues - including domestic markets, commercial potential, history and stature of clubs and leagues and national distribution methods.\n\nIndeed, across Europe, a tier of dominant champions has emerged - besides Ludogorets, Red Star have clinched eight successive titles in Serbia, while Ferencvaros in Hungary and Slovan Bratislava in Slovakia have seven each.\n\nYet none of those clubs reached the Champions League proper this season - Ferencvaros face Ludogorets and Red Star play Lille in the Europa League play-off round, and Slovan did not progress in the Conference League.\n\nFerencvaros chief executive Pal Orosz previously told BBC Sport \"the gap is so big that we will probably never catch up\" to Europe's elite.\n\nYet they often have to achieve complete domination of their domestic leagues to even stand a chance of playing in the same competition as Europe's top clubs.\n\nSlovan's foray into the Champions League last season was a proud moment - their first appearance since independence in 1993 when they qualified as Czechoslovak First League champions.\n\nSince businessman Ivan Kmotrik bought Slovan in 2008, they have once again become Slovakia's dominant force, with sporting director Robert Vittek saying the goal is to become \"like Bayern Munich in Germany, winning titles year by year\".\n\n\"The key to be financially sustainable is to play one of the main phases of the European cups,\" explains Vittek. \"From Slovakia, you have to win a title to have a real chance.\"\n\nPlaying in the Champions League earned Slovan about £18m in TV revenue on top of increased crowds, commercial deals and visibility - hosting Manchester City and AC Milan and travelling to Bayern and Atletico.\n\n\"Maybe just with time, we will appreciate what kind of success it was to bring such clubs to Bratislava,\" says Vittek.\n\n\"We didn't get a point, however we were representing Slovakia well in the European scene and we can be proud about that.\"\n\nTo even reach the league phase, Slovan had to progress through three rounds of qualifying, the first Slovak side to do so since Zilina in 2010.\n\n\"We can be realistic and sensible with these kinds of topics,\" says Vittek, when asked if there should be a more attainable route.\n\n\"There is a 'champions path' for clubs like us, where there's always a way for clubs from some 'smaller' leagues to reach the main phase. However, it's difficult.\"\n\nFrom Fiji to Latvia - are cross-border leagues the future?\n\nLudogorets, who have reached the Champions League group stages twice, last featuring in 2016 when they earned a credible draw with PSG, have won every Bulgarian title since promotion following Kiril Domuschiev's purchase in 2010.\n\nBut that run could be coming to an end given they are currently second, seven points behind leaders Levski Sofia - and journalist Teodor Borisov says \"Bulgarian football fans are desperate\" to see a different champion.\n\nHe attributed the 14-time champions' drop off to injuries, poor form and head coach Julio Velazquez's impact at Levski.\n\nClubs in other leagues have shown it is possible to wind in dominant rivals through shrewd recruitment.\n\nHearts, who like Muzio's USG and Brighton have benefited from Tony Bloom's influence, hope to end 40 years of Old Firm dominance, Rijeka toppled Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia last season and Sturm Graz snapped Red Bull Salzburg's decade-long streak of Austrian titles to win the past two.\n\nSturm sporting director Andreas Schicker said it was a \"balance between having success, qualifying for European competitions and making profit on talented players\" such as Rasmus Hojlund.\n\nMeanwhile, Uefa says solidarity payments to clubs not in European competition went up 80% for this cycle - almost £270m - at a \"much higher rate than payments reserved to participating clubs\", with the increased redistribution welcomed by the European Leagues body.\n\nClubs competing in the Champions League and Super Cup, external get 74.38% (more than £2bn), with 17.02% for Europa League clubs and 8.6% for those in the Conference League.\n\nReal Madrid last week became the final club to end a dispute over a breakaway European Super League, with Uefa and European Football Clubs - an independent body representing more than 800 clubs - saying an \"agreement of principles\" had been reached \"for the good of European club football\".\n\nElsewhere, Latvia - which does not have a domestic TV deal - has proposed a combined 'Baltic League' with Lithuania and Estonia to try to drive revenues and make clubs more competitive in Europe.\n\nThe UEC - which represents more than 140 clubs - has ideas of its own, as well as calling for transparency and dialogue.\n\nOne is a new domestic media rights protection policy that would reinvest a portion of European competition media revenues into nations where it exceeds domestic rights.\n\nAnother is a player development reward policy that reimburses clubs who are not in the Champions League when a player they trained features in the competition - they believe in recent seasons almost 1,500 clubs would have benefited.\n\nThe focus is on increasing competition at a domestic level in the hope that will eventually help \"smaller leagues\" be more competitive in Europe.\n\nThis year's Champions League debutants - Bodo, Kairat, Pafos and USG - appear to have come from leagues with a greater spread of recent winners.\n\n\"There is no clear and easy solution because if you help Qarabag or Benfica or USG or a team from a non-big four league to grow its revenue a lot, then all the teams behind it in that league get stretched away,\" says Muzio.\n\n\"It's very important that us, as the UEC of stakeholders, don't try and pretend like there's a magic wand you can just wave.\n\n\"There will need to be a lot of work over a long period of time to try and balance things out to make things fair again.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "England captain Leah Williamson returns to the squad for the first time since Euro 2025 as they prepare to begin their 2027 Women's World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nWilliamson, 28, missed England's friendly victories over China, Ghana and Australia as well as their defeat by Brazil at the end of 2025 due to a knee injury.\n\nThe Arsenal defender had surgery after lifting England's second successive European title in July and returned to action at the start of December.\n\n\"I'm very happy. It feels really good for her too. She has trained lots and I'm in close contact with her and the club,\" said manager Sarina Wiegman.\n\n\"There are more players who are still building and that is one of the reasons why we went with a bigger squad.\"\n\nSeveral big names return to the squad including Chelsea forward Lauren James, Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.\n\nJames, 24, was absent for four months with an ankle injury before returning in November and is now back to full fitness.\n\nShe impressed in Sunday's win over Liverpool and boosts Wiegman's attacking options with Arsenal's Beth Mead out with a fractured shin.\n\nGreenwood, 32, missed the start of the season with a knee injury while Hampton had a thigh issue which ruled her out of the November camp.\n\nThere is a first senior call-up for London City Lionesses defender Poppy Pattinson, while uncapped 20-year-old Freya Godfrey retains her place in the squad.\n\nAston Villa goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck also earns a recall, with Manchester City's Khiara Keating dropping out of the squad.\n\n\"[Roebuck] came in the last camp of course because we had some injuries. She has got some minutes [with Villa] so it's really good to see her back, see her happy and being available. She is playing and training fully,\" added Wiegman.\n\n\"Keating will be with the under-23s. We all know she is a very talented goalkeeper. I had big concerns about her playing minutes over this last season.\n\n\"It's a long period of time. There is also competition with the other goalkeepers.\"\n\nGotham FC defender Jess Carter is back after she was given time to recover from the conclusion of the National Women's Soccer League play-offs in November.\n\nEngland are without Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, who is out with a hip injury until the end of March.\n\nBay FC defender Anouk Denton, 22, who made her debut as a late substitute in December, is not included in the squad.\n\nThe Lionesses travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThey are the first competitive games since England's success in Switzerland and they will meet reigning world champions Spain later in their qualifying group.\n\nThere are eight international windows before England hope to travel to Brazil for the World Cup between 24 June and 25 July 2027.\n\n\"It's a new year with new objectives as we start our qualification journey with these two very important fixtures against Ukraine and Iceland,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"This is new opposition for this England team, so that's exciting too. I am looking forward to being back with the squad and getting back to work.\"\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nLondon City Lionesses defender Pattinson has featured for England's youth teams and is the latest to make the jump up to the senior squad.\n\nShe follows in the footsteps of team-mate Godfrey, who is yet to make her debut having been selected for the friendlies against Ghana and China.\n\nWiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to watch Pattinson in London City Lionesses' 2-1 defeat by Manchester United and delivered the news of her England call-up this week.\n\n\"It was a short conversation but she was really happy and really grateful. She can't wait to come in so that was a nice phone call,\" Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"She deserved the call-up because she has played really well. What we have seen the most is that she is very proactive and takes a lot of initiative.\n\n\"She can cover the whole wing on the left side. At the same time, she wants to play forward and is looking for passes forward which I thought was really good.\n\n\"Although she is not the tallest, she does use her body well in defence. Let's see how she relates to the other players we have in the squad.\"\n\nGoalkeepers: Hannah Hampton (Chelsea), Anna Moorhouse (Orlando Pride), Ellie Roebuck (Aston Villa)\n\nDefenders: Lucy Bronze (Chelsea), Jess Carter (Gotham), Grace Fisk (Liverpool), Alex Greenwood (Manchester City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Manchester United), Esme Morgan (Washington Spirit), Taylor Hinds (Arsenal), Poppy Pattinson (London City Lionesses), Leah Williamson (Arsenal)\n\nMidfielders: Grace Clinton (Manchester City), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Keira Walsh (Chelsea), Laura Blindkilde Brown (Manchester City), Lucia Kendell (Aston Villa)\n\nForwards: Chloe Kelly (Arsenal), Lauren James (Chelsea), Aggie Beever-Jones (Chelsea), Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Lauren Hemp (Manchester City), Freya Godfrey (London City Lionesses), Jess Park (Manchester United)",

    "description": "When Niall Treacy skidded out of the men's 500m heats on Monday, Great Britain's hopes in the short track speed skating were finally put out of their misery.",
    "fullText": "As Niall Treacy skidded out of the men's 500m heats on Monday morning, British hopes at the short track speed skating were finally put out of their misery.\n\nPut in particularly stark contrast by Team GB's Super Sunday the day before - with golds won in snowboarding and skeleton - this has been a grim Games in Milan.\n\nTreacy, Britain's only representative in short track, suffered a crash, fall or some other mishap in the 500m, 1,000m and 1500m.\n\nThere had been hope when the 25-year-old made the final of the 1,500m on Saturday night, the man ranked 20th in the world exceeding expectations.\n\nBut Treacy was given a penalty after impeding Liu Shaoang in an incident where both hit the ice, having moved into the Chinese skater's racing line.\n\nSo the wait goes on for Team GB for a first speed skating medal in 32 years, since Nicky Gooch claimed bronze in the men's 500m at Lillehammer 1994.\n\nWilf O'Reilly earned two golds when short track was a demonstration event at Calgary 1988, but since the sport made its official debut at Albertville 1992, no Briton has won an Olympic event.\n\nIn the past three decades, the picture has never looked so bleak.\n\nTreacy was a one-man army in Milan. Four years ago at Beijing 2022, Britain sent three short track skaters.\n\nIn 2018, GB sent a team of five to PyeongChang, with short track one of the great British hopes for a medal.\n\nBefore the 2018 Games in South Korea, UK Sport provided £4.8m to short track skating - which was withdrawn after a team which included then-world champion Elise Christie, and Farrell Treacy – Niall's brother – failed to win a medal.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nEight years later, the latest UK Sport funding allocation of just under £2m has been presented as a total for short track, figure and long track speed skating.\n\nSo short track is caught in the situation which befalls many Olympic sports in Britain - they need to perform at the Games to get more funding, but without the funding they struggle to achieve success.\n\nAsked what work is being done to fix short track, British Olympic Association (BOA) chair Dame Katherine Grainger told BBC Sport: \"As much potential as we have in that team, there is more untapped.\n\n\"It is not a sport we have a legacy in, so that opens the door - we need to learn from other countries where we can.\"\n\nAdd in the fact that there are few sports in the world more chaotic and unpredictable than short track.\n\nChristie was Britain's most recognisable speed skater a decade ago when she won three gold medals at the 2017 World Championships, but a series of crashes and disqualifications ruined her Olympic dreams in 2014 and 2018.\n\nAnd this year, Treacy's luck was also out. Take his 1,500m final - usually this event would have six racers, but in Milan had nine because three athletes were advanced to the medal race after being illegally hindered in their semi-finals.\n\nWould Treacy, who was running in third when he tangled with Liu, have won a medal if there were fewer men on the track? Ultimately, hypotheticals do not put cash in the bank.\n\nTreacy could not hide his funding frustrations when speaking to the BBC following that final.\n\n\"If we only had a bit more support going through the Olympic cycle,\" he said. \"In the UK we don't even have an ice centre which is safe enough for competitions.\n\n\"In the UK we have to look at ourselves and see we need a facility where we can train at the top level, instead of having to go to other countries.\"\n\nTreacy is correct that there is no venue in Britain that could host an international short track event, because there are no rinks with the soft boards needed around the border to protect racers when there are crashes.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nAs a result, Treacy must train in the Netherlands, sometimes with the Dutch national team - an experience he said can be \"demoralising\".\n\nAs Britain's only Olympic-level short track skater, Treacy also often trains alone. This means he experiences the crowds and chaos, which are speed skating's signature, on a less regular basis than his rivals.\n\nWhile Treacy is an experienced and successful racer in his own right, this - combined with the pressures of the Olympic stage - is another hurdle for him to overcome compared to better funded nations.\n\nSo where is British short track now? Based on its world ranking, Team GB had a quota of three short track athletes at Milan-Cortina 2026 - two in the men's, one in women's - but gave up two of the places.\n\nTreacy does provide hope for the future, though. In his mid-20s, he should still be on course for French Alps 2030 if he stays fit. That would be his third Olympics - all valuable experience.\n\nAnd Treacy is top 20 in the world for a reason - he won silver in the 1,000m at the 2024 European Short Track Championships.\n\nAfter the first Olympics on western European time for two decades, he is hopeful he will not be on his own in four years' time.\n\nAfter his final race in Milan, Treacy said: \"This sport is so crazy, so hopefully it inspires some other people to get involved because it is fun.\n\n\"I love it, and hopefully some other people will love it too.\"",

    "fullText": "George W. Bush has penned a Presidents Day essay that made some pointed observations about power, humility, and presidents who refuse to step down from office.\n\nThe essay was published Monday by More Perfect, a bipartisan alliance working to “protect and renew” American democracy in the lead-up to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe piece, which pays homage to George Washington, is the inaugural entry in a new history project called “In Pursuit,” and while it does not name President Donald Trump, it does seem to shade him, The New York Times reported.\n\n“Our first president could have remained all-powerful, but twice he chose not to,” Bush wrote. “In doing so, he set a standard for all presidents to live up to.”\n\nThe first president’s decision to relinquish control of the U.S. Army after the American Revolution and to step down from the presidency after two terms “ensured America wouldn’t become a monarchy, or worse,” Bush added.\n\nHis words seemed heavy with subtext, considering the current occupant of the White House tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, and is now threatening to run for a third, illegal presidential term.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nElsewhere in Bush’s essay, the 43rd president also praised Washington’s other non-Trumpian traits, describing how the nation’s first president made a point of cultivating self-control, courteousness, modesty, and diplomacy.\n\n“Few qualities have inspired me more than Washington’s humility,” he wrote. “Washington modeled what it means to put the good of the nation over self-interest and selfish ambition… he carried himself with dignity and self-restraint, honoring the office [of the president] without allowing to become invested with near-mythical powers.”\n\nThe Times noted that despite participating in the “In Pursuit” series—which will also feature contributions from former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as Republicans such as Chief Supreme Court Justice John Roberts—Bush is not giving interviews.\n\nHis essay speaks for itself, former National Archivist Colleen Shogan told the Times. Shogan was abruptly fired by Trump in February 2025 and is now overseeing “In Pursuit.”\n\nThe project’s goal is to make history “relevant” but not overly narrow, she told the Times.\n\n“We are taking the long view of things,” she said. “The lesson of presidential humility transcends time.”",

It also includes less obvious items we’re all used to being prohibited, even when it doesn’t really make a lot of sense (think liquids and larger tubes of toothpaste).\n\nFor most people, though, cash would not be on the list of things that could give you problems at airport security. Surprisingly, though, money may actually be something you should leave at home when you head out on your next vacation.\n\nA recent CBS News story offers a clear and serious sign of a big problem with security at airports in the United States.\n\nIt comes in the form of a class action lawsuit that includes plaintiffs such as Rebecca Brown, a woman who was traveling through Pittsburgh International Airport when the Transportation Security Administration determined that the money she was carrying represented proceeds from a crime.\n\nBecause the Feds thought the money had been obtained illegally, the cash was seized.\n\nBrown and several other people who experienced similar issues are currently suing the government, arguing that their constitutional rights were violated.  The lawsuit claims the TSA mistakenly confiscated funds it thought had been obtained illegally.\n\nAs part of the class action lawsuit, it was revealed that Brown had brought her father’s life savings to the airport after he asked her to bring the money to Boston to open a savings account.\n\nThe total was about $82,000, and it took Brown approximately a year and a half to get the funds returned after it was determined the money was clean.\n\n\"I do think that this was unconstitutional, what the TSA did to me,\" Brown said.\n\nWhile you may assume you’re safe if you aren’t carrying such a large amount of money, that’s not necessarily the case.\n\n\"In some of the TSA depositions, they said as little as $100 in 100 one-dollar bills would still count as a large amount of currency,\" Dan Alban, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice representing the plaintiffs, told CBS News.\n\nSpirit Airlines cuts more flights and jobs amid second bankruptcy\n\nAirline cuts last flight into this US city, refunds available\n\nTSA issues stern warning on item over 13 million Americans use\n\nWhile the government claims it was acting within its guidelines and requested that the case be dismissed, the plaintiffs' attorneys dispute the claim that TSA officials acted properly.",

The summons is a rare move between staunch allies.\n\n“An ambassador accredited to Belgium has a responsibility to respect our institutions, our elected representatives, and the independence of our judicial system,\" Prévot said. \"Personal attacks against a Belgian minister and interference in judicial matters violate basic diplomatic norms.”\n\nNational broadcaster VRT said Belgian authorities are investigating whether three men in Antwerp were performing circumcisions without certified medical training.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Bill White said on a post on X that this investigation was \"unacceptable harassment of the Jewish community here in Antwerp and in Belgium.\n\nHe said he would visit the three accused men in Antwerp and asked Belgium's minister of health to join him.\n\n“You must make a legal provision to allow Jewish religious MOHELS to perform their duties here in Belgium,\" he said, using a Hebrew term for a Jewish officiant trained in circumcision, a central tenet of the faith.\n\nWithout it, a Jewish person typically can’t have a bar mitzvah, a Jewish wedding or be buried in a Jewish cemetery.\n\nPrévot, the foreign minister, said that “Belgian law permits ritual circumcision when performed by a qualified physician under strict health and safety standards” and that he would not comment on an ongoing investigation.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 16 (Reuters) - China's most-watched TV show, the annual CCTV Spring Festival gala, will be viewed later on Monday as a showcase for the country's cutting-edge industrial policy and Beijing's push to dominate humanoid robots and the future of manufacturing.\n\nFour ‌rising humanoid robot startups - Unitree Robotics, Galbot, Noetix and MagicLab - are set to showcase their products in the gala, a televised event ‌and touchstone for China comparable to the Super Bowl for the United States.\n\nThe hype surrounding China's humanoid robot sector comes as major players including AgiBot and Unitree prepare for initial ​public offerings this year and domestic artificial intelligence startups release a raft of frontier models during the lucrative nine-day Lunar New Year public holiday.\n\nLast year's gala stunned viewers with 16 full-size Unitree humanoids twirling handkerchiefs and dancing in unison with human performers.\n\nUnitree's founder met President Xi Jinping weeks later at a high-profile tech symposium - the first of its kind since 2018.\n\nXi has met five robotics startup founders in the past year, comparable to the four electric vehicle and ‌four semiconductor entrepreneurs he met in the same ⁠timeframe, giving the nascent sector unusual visibility.\n\nThe CCTV show, which drew 79% of live TV viewership in China last year, has for decades been used to highlight Beijing's tech ambitions including its space programme, drones and robotics, said ⁠Georg Stieler, Asia managing director and head of robotics and automation at technology consultancy Stieler.\n\n\"What distinguishes the gala from comparable events elsewhere is the directness of the pipeline from industrial policy to prime-time spectacle,\" Stieler said.\n\n\"Companies that appear on the gala stage receive tangible rewards in government orders, investor attention, and market access.\"\n\nBehind ​the ​spectacle of robots running marathons and executing kung-fu kicks and backflips, China has positioned ​robotics and AI at the heart of its next-generation ‌AI+ manufacturing strategy, betting that productivity gains from automation will offset pressures from its ageing workforce.\n\n\"Humanoids bundle a lot of China's strengths into one narrative: AI capability, hardware supply chain, and manufacturing ambition. They are also the most 'legible' form factor for the public and officials,\" said Beijing-based tech analyst Poe Zhao.\n\n\"In an early market, attention becomes a resource.\"\n\nChina accounted for 90% of the roughly 13,000 humanoid robots shipped globally last year, far ahead of U.S. rivals including Tesla's Optimus, according to research firm Omdia. Morgan Stanley projects that China's humanoid sales will more than double to 28,000 units this ‌year.\n\nElon Musk has said he expects his biggest competitor to be Chinese companies as ​he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embedded AI and Optimus. \"People outside China underestimate ​China, but China is an ass-kicker next level,\" he said last ​month.\n\nSo far, the real-world rollout has been limited to demonstration projects, often with support. Galbot, for example, has a ‌contract to use its humanoid robots in factories run by ​battery giant CATL, one of its ​major investors. UBTech won a government contract last year to send humanoid robots to work in logistics and support roles at a border crossing with Vietnam.\n\nChinese startups are also rapidly iterating AI models to train humanoid \"brains\", using real-world data collection to improve their environmental perception ​and understanding of natural language commands.\n\nAnalysts will watch ‌Monday's performance for innovations including multi-robot coordination, fault recovery and hand-related tasks like fine-object manipulation.\n\n\"A robot doing a backflip is still ​far more spectacular than one carefully gripping a plastic cup of water — even though the latter is technically much more demanding,\" ​Stieler said.",

    "description": "Replacing GBU-57s dropped on Iran highlights issues that come from being locked into a single contractor, which the Pentagon is trying to change.",
    "fullText": "Last year, the U.S. government was able to reverse engineer a critical subcomponent for the 30,000-pound GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bunker buster bomb. Leveraging technology from the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile saved years of work that would have otherwise been necessary to “eliminate obsolescence issues and meet operational demands.” The reverse-engineering effort also highlights the impacts of being locked into a single vendor, and underscores why the Pentagon is now pushing to make changes to, if not end this practice.\n\nDetails about the reverse-engineered component and other aspects of the MOP program were contained in a recent U.S. Air Force contracting announcement regarding efforts to replenish stocks of those bombs following Operation Midnight Hammer. During that operation, B-2 Spirit stealth bombers dropped 14 GBU-57/Bs on Iranian nuclear facilities. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) had to produce a detailed justification for awarding a sole-source contract to Boeing for the production of new MOPs and the sustainment of the existing inventory. Boeing is the bomb’s current prime contractor. A redacted copy of that document is available online.\n\n“The Government has a follow-on need for additional production of [redacted] MOP Tail Kits with projected delivery starting 10 January 2028 to replace expended units and reach the United States Air Force’s [redacted],” the so-called Justification & Approval (J&A) document explains. “The Government has a need for replenishment production of GBU-57 MOP weapon system components.”\n\nIt is unclear what the total size of the GBU-57/B inventory was before or after Operation Midnight Hammer. As of 2015, prime contractor Boeing had delivered at least 20 of the bombs, according to the Air Force. However, additional orders have been reported over the years. In 2024, a story from Bloomberg had also said that a facility in Oklahoma was being expanded to help triple or even quadruple the annual output of these bombs.\n\nThe MOP’s tail kit, also designated KMU-612/B, contains the bomb’s GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guidance package and other systems. It is combined with a BLU-127/B penetrating “warhead” and other components, including advanced fuzes designed to help produce the maximum destructive effect on a target after burrowing deep down into the ground, to create a complete GBU-57/B bomb, or all-up-round (AUR).\n\n“In August of 2025, the Government successfully reverse engineered a critical subcomponent of the MOP weapon system saving 4-years of design work and enabling the utilization of existing Army ATACMS technology to eliminate obsolescence issues and meet operational demands,” according to the J&A document. “However, the time to reverse engineer all MOP components would result in unacceptable delays in meeting mission requirements.”\n\nThe MOP J&A does not elaborate on the ATACMS technology in question, or what company or companies may now be in line to produce the resulting subcomponent for the bombs. Lockheed Martin is the current prime contractor for ATACMS, a family of short-range ballistic missiles that you can read more about here. It should also be noted that the U.S. military’s reverse-engineering parts of key weapon systems is not entirely uncommon, especially if the original source of the components in question has gone out of business or otherwise no longer exists.\n\nThe J&A document says it would take an estimated 60 months, or five years, to create an entirely new MOP tail kit design and then go through the required processes to certify it for operational use. It also explains why the KMU-612/B tail kit, specifically, is so central to the need to award a new sole-source contract to Boeing.\n\n“With regards to IP [intellectual property] rights, The [Redacted] Company is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MOP weapon system and retains ownership of the intellectual property data associated with the munition’s tail kit,” it explains. “In particular, [redacted] owns the technical data package and manufacturing process methodologies of the tailkit unit entirely. [Redacted] has uniquely acquired expertise over a period of ~18 years of adapting this specialized weapon to meet evolving mission needs as MOP transitioned from proof-of-concept to full operational capability. This expertise pertains, but is not limited to, knowledge of the guidance algorithms, navigation systems, hardware components, specialized test equipment, and software critical to producing and sustaining the MOP weapon system.”\n\n“The other components and sub-components, as noted above, have been proprietary to [redacted] from the inception of this weapon system. The USG [U.S. government] does not own or control, via license or by other IP rights, any computer software, methodologies, or technical drawings,” the document adds. “[Redacted] was queried in August 2025 as to the potential of selling IP rights to the USG for the MOP weapon system and the USG was denied.”\n\nThat being said, “over the course of the ~18 years of MOP development to the AURs acquired today the USG has, at certain junctures, been able to separate from the sole-source environment for this weapon with Boeing,” the J&A notes. “The USG was able to break away the Warhead Cases for the MOP under a weapon design agent effort, thereby giving the USG complete IP control over the Warhead TDP. Based on the IP ownership of this TDP the USG awards contracts competitively.”\n\nThe prospect now of new U.S. strikes against targets in Iran, including deeply buried nuclear sites and other facilities, highlights the continued importance of the depth and readiness of the GBU-57/B inventory. There is clear evidence that Iranian authorities have taken new steps to try to shield key elements of the country’s nuclear program from future attacks, either from the air or on the ground. MOP has been and continues to be the only conventional munition capable of prosecuting many of these targets, and was specifically designed from the outset with sites in Iran top of mind. A conflict with Iran is not the only scenario where the bombs would be relevant. North Korea and China, among others, have also invested heavily in underground and other hardened facilities.\n\nThe huge bunker busters are otherwise the definition of high-value, low-density munitions. At present, they can only be employed operationally by B-2 bombers. Each B-2 can also only carry two of the bombs at once. MOP is expected to be an important part of the arsenal of the future B-21 Raider, which is smaller than the B-2 and is expected to be able to carry a single one of these bunker busters.\n\nThe details in the MOP J&A document also underscore broader issues surrounding IP rights and ‘vendor lock’ in the U.S. defense contracting space that have increasingly been coming to the forefront in recent years. Competition inherently creates opportunities to lower costs and diversify supply chains. A broader supplier base also offers benefits when it comes to scaling up production of key subcomponents and complete systems.\n\nThe continued extent of Lockheed Martin’s control over the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is perhaps the most widely known example of the negative impacts of vendor lock. U.S. officials have been outspoken about the maintenance and sustenance challenges this has created, especially when it comes to the timely sourcing of spare parts, and the operational risks this creates. TWZ previously explored the particular issues surrounding the F-35 in an in-depth feature.\n\nForeign F-35 operators, especially in Europe, are now also facing regular questions about what could happen to the jets if the U.S. were to cut off access to various sustainment pipelines in light of new diplomatic strains with Washington. Just this past weekend, Dutch State Secretary for Defense Gijs Tuinman caused a stir when he asserted it would be possible to “jailbreak an F-35 just like an iPhone” if necessary, as you can read more about here.\n\nBIG: Dutch Defence Minister Gijs Tuinman hints that software independence is possible for F-35 jets. \n\nHe literally said you can “jailbreak” an F-35. \n\nWhen asked if Europe can modify it without US approval: \n\n“That’s not the point… we’ll see whether the Americans will show… pic.twitter.com/f11cGvtYsO\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) February 15, 2026\n\nIn recent years, successive U.S. administrations have made securing greater IP rights and ensuring opportunities for competition key elements in negotiating new defense contractors. As an example, the Air Force previously made clear that avoiding the F-35 program’s vendor lock was a top priority for the acquisition of the F-47 sixth-generation stealth fighter. President Donald Trump’s administration is now pursuing a host of new contracting reforms, in part to further break up the locks that private companies have on programs like the Joint Strike Fighter.\n\n“We will enable third-party integration without prime contractor bottlenecks. Success will be measured by the ability of qualified vendors to independently develop, test and integrate replaceable — excuse me, replacement modules at the component level throughout the system life cycle,” War Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a speech last November. “There’s no more complacency and no more monopolies.”\n\nAt that time, Hegseth had also acknowledged Byzantine processes and other contracting hurdles that the U.S. military had created for itself over the years.\n\nHow “the sole-source environment” surrounding the GBU-57/B continues to evolve now remains to be seen. A successor to that bomb, called the Next Generation Penetrator (NGP), is also now in development, and Boeing is involved in that effort, too. The Pentagon’s experiences with MOP, together with the new contracting reform push, are likely to inform how the replacement weapons are acquired.\n\nIn the meantime, U.S. authorities continue to try to free elements of the MOP program from vendor lock, including now by repurposing technology originally designed for the ATACMS short-range ballistic missile.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

And, they’re not being kept in Area 51.”\n\nOn Sunday, the former president released a statement on Instagram, appearing to clarify what he meant by his comments that have since gone viral.\n\n“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”\n\nSecrecy around Area 51, a top-secret Cold War test site in the Nevada desert, has long fueled conspiracy theories among UFO enthusiasts.\n\nIn 2013, the CIA acknowledged the existence of the site, but not UFO crashes, black-eyed extraterrestrials or staged moon landings.\n\nDeclassified documents referred to the 8,000-square-mile (20,700-square-kilometer) installation by name after decades of U.S. government officials refusing to acknowledge it.\n\nThe base has been a testing ground for a host of top-secret aircraft, including the U-2 in the 1950s and later the B-2 stealth bomber.\n\nThis story corrects the name of the podcaster.",

    "fullText": "Dana Eden, an Israeli producer best known for co-creating the Apple TV show “Tehran,” was found dead on Sunday in Athens, where the show’s fourth season was being filmed, Greek police said.\n\nEden, 52, was found dead in a hotel room after a relative made several failed attempts to reach her. Police said that her death is being treated as a suicide, Reuters reported.\n\n“We mourn the passing of our friend and partner in a long line of productions, series and programs at the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, said in a statement.\n\nKan said that Eden had traveled to Greece to oversee the “complex and significant production” of the fourth season of “Tehran,” a spy thriller that premiered in 2020 and received an International Emmy Award in 2021 for best drama series.\n\n“Her professional work, uncompromising commitment and love of creation have left a deep mark on the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan added.\n\n“Tehran” follows the plight of Tamar Rabinyan, a young Mossad agent born in Iran but raised in Israel who returns to Iran on a mission to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program. Since Israelis are banned from visiting Iran, the show was filmed in Athens, due to its similarities with the Iranian capital.\n\nIn her Emmy acceptance speech, Eden said that working on the show with Iranian actors who had fled the regime showed her that “we have a lot in common.”\n\n“Tehran is not only an espionage series. It’s also about understanding the human behind your enemy,” she said. “I hope we can walk together – the Iranians and the Israelis, in Jerusalem and in Tehran – as friends, and not as enemies.”\n\nMuch of Eden’s work was in collaboration with Shula Spiegel, who also worked as a producer on “Tehran.” The pair’s production company, Dana and Shula Productions, said Eden’s death was “a moment of great pain for the family, friends and colleagues.”\n\nMiki Zohar, Israel’s culture minister, said he received the news of Eden’s death “with great sadness,” praising her as “one of the most prominent and influential producers in the Israeli television industry.”\n\n“Dana left a deep mark on Israeli creation and brought our story to international stages with pride, talent and courage. I share in the sorrow of the family, friends and colleagues. May her memory be a blessing,” Zohar said.\n\nCNN’s Tal Shalev contributed reporting.",

    "description": "\"He’s like fourteen and has already cemented his legacy as an American hero.\"",
    "fullText": "A brief hallway confrontation at an Illinois high school turned into a meme after the video went viral, though not for the reason the teenage “content creator” wanted.\n\nOn Thursday, Danny Spud posted a 47-second video filmed on his Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses. In the clip, he walked through the front entrance of Lake Zurich High School holding a sign that read “I LOVE ICE.” Meanwhile, other students participated in an organized anti-ICE walkout of the school.\n\n“Today, students at my high school in Chicago held an Anti-ICE protest,” Spud wrote in the caption of his post. As he moved through the hallway, he said aloud, “We support ICE and law enforcement. I support ICE.”\n\nOne passing student reacted with disbelief, saying, “That’s crazy, bro.” Spud pushed back, replying, “I don’t know what’s crazy about this.” Shortly after, another student in a brown hoodie confronted him directly. “Yeah. I’m going to punch you in the face,” the student said.\n\n“You’re going to punch me?” Spud asked. When the student answered, “Yes,” Spud responded, “Then you’re going to get in trouble for that.” The student replied simply, “Okay,” and then punched him as he warned he would.\n\nJust wonderful pic.twitter.com/zKLOW59I8w\n\n— evan loves worf (@esjesjesj) February 13, 2026\n\nA security guard standing nearby stepped in immediately. While staff separated the students, Spud continued speaking to the camera. “I stand for my beliefs,” he said. “I’m going to peacefully stand here and support my beliefs. I support ICE and law enforcement.”\n\nThe other student yelled back, “You can go peacefully f*ck yourself!” Spud responded in what many online described as a weak protest, “That’s against school code. No swearing in the school.” After all, the brown hoodie kid had just punched him. A little swearing is nothing in comparison to a physical fight.\n\nReposts of the video spread with a variety of opinions, but it was through people sharing the video that brown hoodie guy was turned into a meme.\n\nOn Reddit, u/Chare1155 joked, “If I witnessed this baller move when I was in high school, I 100% would have asked him to a dance lol.”\n\nStill, others criticized both sides. u/hypersnaildeluxe wrote that the Meta glasses signaled bad faith, adding that Spud “was absolutely fishing for the staff to yell at him so he could pull the right wing grifter card and say waaah I’m being oppressed by the school admin.”\n\nThis is typical trolling behavior from Danny Spud, whose entire shtick is sharing “prank” videos of himself harassing strangers.\n\nLikewise, u/LimonNerd argued, “I’m all about freedom of speech but sign kid gives me Charlie Kirk vibes. It’s obvious sign kid was filming to capture reactions that would make for good viral content.”\n\nu/Professional_Big_731 pointed out, “‘You can peacefully go f*ck yourself’ great comeback 5 stars.”\n\nAs the discourse spread, a single freeze-frame took off. The image showed the student mid-swing, leaning back with a sharp expression.\n\nPeople compared the pose to Zoolander modeling and even Pepe the Frog. @FranziaMom called it “a cinematic masterpiece,” while @DeepDishEnjoyer simply wrote, “life imitates art.”\n\nlife imitates art pic.twitter.com/LKNZdSnT7D\n\n— peepeepoopoo (@DeepDishEnjoyer) February 14, 2026\n\nSpud took to X.com to complain about being banned from Instagram, writing, “After thousands of death threats and people celebrating me getting punched for holding a sign supporting ICE, I was just banned from @Instagram. Another attempt to silence me.”\n\nA community note below the post fact-checks his assertion, reading: “Danny was suspended after sharing videos in which he pulled fire alarms inside public businesses, an act that violated Instagram’s community guidelines.”\n\nAfter thousands of death threats and people celebrating me getting punched for holding a sign supporting ICE, I was just banned from @Instagram.\n\nAnother attempt to silence me.@finkd, why is your platform siding with political violence? pic.twitter.com/k8KHketbne\n\n— Danny Spud (@dannyspud_) February 15, 2026\n\nThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.",

Preliminary information from investigators indicates the mother shot her daughter before turning the gun on herself. A note was recovered from the room, police said.

No words do the situation justice. She was so beyond loved, and she will always be a part of the UXC family.”\n\nEarlier Sunday, the organization had posted that the athlete and her mother were missing after they did not arrive at competition and could not be reached, stating that police had been contacted.\n\nUtah Fusion All-Stars also identified the athlete who died as Addi, writing on social media that she “was absolutely loved in our gym” and “will always be remembered for her sweet smile and light that she brought to her teams.”\n\nThe Utah Cinderella Pageant expressed condolences to the family, saying Addi’s “bright smile and kindness will never be forgotten.”\n\nPolice said the investigation remains ongoing.

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Russia could deploy its navy to prevent European powers from seizing its vessels and may retaliate against European shipping if Russian ‌ships are taken, Nikolai Patrushev, one of Russia's leading hardliners, was quoted as ‌saying on Tuesday.\n\nWestern states have sought to cripple Russia's economy with sanctions and in recent months have tried to block ​oil tankers suspected of involvement in Russian oil shipments. In January, the United States seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker as part of efforts to curb Venezuelan oil exports.\n\nPatrushev, a Kremlin aide who is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said Russia needed to give a tough response - particularly ‌towards Britain, France and Baltic ⁠states.\n\n\"If we don't give them a tough rebuff, then soon the British, French and even the Balts (Baltic nations) will become arrogant to such an extent ⁠that they will try to block our country's access to the seas at least in the Atlantic basin,\" Patrushev, who serves as chairman of Russia's Maritime Board, told the Russian media outlet Argumenty i ​Fakty.\n\n\"In ​the main maritime areas, including regions far from Russia, ​substantial forces must be permanently deployed - ‌forces capable of cooling the ardour of Western pirates,\" he said.\n\nPatrushev said that the navies of major powers were undergoing radical technological change and modernisation amid what he said was clear \"gunboat diplomacy\" from Washington over Venezuela and Iran. Russia's updated naval shipbuilding programme to 2050 will be submitted for approval soon, he said.\n\nHe also said that Russia believed the NATO military alliance planned ‌to blockade the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the ​Baltic Sea.\n\n\"Any attempt at a naval blockade of our ​country is completely illegal from the standpoint ​of international law, and the concept of a 'shadow fleet', which EU representatives ‌brandish at every turn, is a legal ​fiction,\" he said.\n\nThe shadow ​fleet refers to a network of vessels that Western nations say are operated by Russia to evade sanctions.\n\n\"By implementing their naval blockade plans, the Europeans are deliberately pursuing a ​scenario of military escalation, testing ‌the limits of our patience and provoking active retaliatory measures,\" Patrushev said. \"If a peaceful ​resolution to this situation fails, the blockade will be broken and eliminated by ​the navy.\"",

    "description": "Cosmos, a fiber-optic drone pilot, told Business Insider he was hunting for hidden Russian storages when he found the Ladas and two horses.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian drone pilot told Business Insider of how he found a Russian arsenal of horses and Ladas.\n\nRussia has increasingly been seen using unconventional transport, such as horses or bicycles.\n\nThe pilot's commander said it's a sign of how Russia fights and calculates its losses differently.\n\nCosmos floated his quadcopter over the ruined warehouse, guiding it through a corner of the roof where shattered metal sheets had collapsed to form a hole.\n\nThe drone pilot's unit, the Wild Division, suspected that the building was a logistics hub for Russian soldiers, roughly 15 km, or about 9 miles, from the line of contact in southern Ukraine. These hidden locations often held ordnance or fuel stockpiles, and Cosmos' fiber-optic drone was armed with explosives to destroy them.\n\nYet inside, the drone rotated its camera to reveal what looked more like a farmer's garage: Four civilian cars, a pair of motorcycles, and two bridled horses.\n\n\"We had not expected to see this. It was unusual,\" Cosmos told Business Insider, speaking on condition that he be identified only by his call sign.\n\n\"We were expecting to find some armored vehicles,\" he added.\n\nVideo of the discovery went viral last week in Ukraine, as the war has increasingly seen Russian soldiers using unconventional transport tools, such as pack animals and bicycles, to conduct assaults or logistics missions. Cosmos said his drone mission was conducted in early February.\n\nThe smaller profile of a horse or civilian car might be harder for a drone to spot, though Russia's repeated use of them has also raised questions about the viability of its tactics and whether it's been producing enough military equipment to sustain its invasion.\n\nCosmos' squad mates and officers at the Wild Division, a first-person-view drone company in the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, had seen clips of Russian soldiers riding on horses to attack Ukrainian positions before.\n\nOne famous example they remember was in Zaporizhzhia, when a Ukrainian drone crew attacked Russian infantry crossing the front lines on horseback last month.\n\nCosmos, who's been piloting drones for a year, said it was the first time he'd personally seen the animals on the front lines.\n\nHe flew his explosive-laden drone straight into the back of one of the cars, and said his crew later struck several other vehicles inside. When Russian troops moved their transport assets, the Wild Division found the next warehouse and attacked that one, too, Cosmos said.\n\n\"The enemy usually lives in hiding close to these places,\" Cosmos said of the warehouse. \"It's common for us to check all targets. Sometimes we can see the enemy infantry, or you can see their vehicles.\"\n\nThe Wild Division declined to say where exactly the warehouse was located, but its brigade is generally deployed in the Donbas.\n\nThe commander of Cosmos' battalion told Business Insider that the discovery of the horses surprised him, too.\n\n\"I thought it had been a location for transport vehicles, sort of a transfer hub,\" said the major, whose call sign is Fizruk.\n\nFizruk said the appearance of horses and cars in his area of the front line could be a sign that Russian forces are running low on standard resources, but also reflects Moscow's attritional nature of fighting.\n\nThe cars discovered by Cosmos appear to be Nivas, inexpensive civilian off-road vehicles from the Russian Lada car brand.\n\n\"They treat these like they will be losses anyway, that they will be destroyed anyway,\" he said. \"Look, a Niva costs, let's say, $2,000. A Hummer, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine uses in many places, costs $20,000, maybe more.\"\n\n\"Since they lose their equipment in assaults, from that point of view, why pay $20,000 for one vehicle if you can buy 10 Nivas for $20,000?\" Fizruk added.\n\nThe Kremlin is known to pressure the front line with repeated ground assaults, sending small groups of infantry to approach Ukrainian positions on foot or in cheap vehicles. The strategy has been costly, with NATO now saying that up to 25,000 Russian troops are dying each month.\n\nSustaining that style of war has pushed Moscow to informal means of recruitment and weapons procurement, including hiring troops from overseas and receiving ammunition from North Korea.",

    "fullText": "Justin Allgaier took 100% of the blame for the big wreck that happened during Lap 124 of the Daytona 500 on Sunday. Denny Hamlin, too, was involved in the incident and admitted graciously on Actions Detrimental that 20% of the blame belonged to him. The wreck collected 20 drivers and changed the dynamics of the race altogether.\n\nAllgaier was the race leader at the time of the wreck and Hamlin had been running behind him. There was just enough space for Hamlin to get by Allgaier and the veteran went for it with a push from behind. Just as he was about to pass, Allgaier pulled a late block and ended up turning both of them to the inside. Several cars behind them choked up as well.\n\nHamlin said on his podcast that what he made was definitely an aggressive move. But he also stood ground that he was going to take every opportunity he got to take the lead and that he had made up his mind 100 yards before actually making the move that he was going to do it. He also clarified that there would have been enough space for him on the outside had Allgaier not moved up.\n\nHe went on to explain, “My 20% is that he didn’t have a whole lot of time for him to react or see that it was coming.” Now knowing what the outcome of his attempt is, there are things that Hamlin would have done differently.\n\n“We were running 10 miles an hour faster than him at the time because of the push we got,” he said. “It would have caused a huge domino effect had I just checked up and not taken it. Or I could just gone to the bottom and probably cleared him doing it. All over again, had I known what the result was gonna be, I would have just stayed in line for a few more laps.”\n\nHamlin ended the race in an underwhelming 31st position. Allgaier ended up with a disappointing DNF in what was his second Daytona 500 start for JR Motorsports. He’d told the press after the race that he would have rather it be someone else’s fault than his own. But he did take up the responsbility completely and explain why he did what he did.\n\n“But you can only do the things you know at 100%, and I did that and it didn’t work out,” he said. “I hate it for everyone else, right, but I’ll stand here and take the blame square on my shoulders.” He will find a bit of ease knowing that Hamlin has taken a bit of the weight off him.\n\nThe post Denny Hamlin Admits He Is Also in the Wrong for Justin Allgaier Incident at Daytona 500 appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "College basketball analyst Seth Greenberg went off on the Kansas State Wildcats for how they handled the firing of head coach Jerome Tang.",
    "fullText": "Seth Greenberg takes shot at Kansas State Wildcats after Jerome Tang firing appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Kansas State Wildcats’ decision to fire basketball head coach Jerome Tang is garnering serious criticism from the likes of Seth Greenberg.\n\nKansas State made the decision to fire Tang after four seasons, having hired him in 2022. The athletics department stated they had cause to fire the head coach midseason, per ESPN’s college sports insider Pete Thamel.\n\n“Kansas State is firing Jerome Tang for cause. They’ve informed him of this formally tonight. The basis for the for cause firing is language in his contract that references any activity that brings “public disrepute, embarrassment, ridicule” to Kansas State,” Thamel wrote.\n\nGreenberg made a Feb. 17 appearance on ESPN’s SportsCenter. He called out the Wildcats’ reasoning for letting go of Tang, citing it was the lack of wins that led to the firing, not for his actual conduct and behavior.\n\n“The university said his behavior was embarrassing. To me, the university’s behavior is embarrassing. The athletic director’s behavior is embarrassing,” Greenberg said.\n\n“Jerome Tang, he made mistakes. He made mistakes in his roster construction. He made mistakes in terms of how maybe he handled this team. But one thing he didn’t do, he didn’t deserve to be fired with cause; he’s getting fired because he did not win enough games.”\n\nSeth Greenberg on Kansas State firing Jerome Tang for cause: “The university said his behavior was embarrassing. To me, the university’s behavior is embarrassing. The athletic director’s behavior is embarrassing… He didn’t deserve to be fired with cause…” pic.twitter.com/6FQvP3UVfI\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) February 16, 2026\n\nSeth Greenberg is right to question Kansas State’s approach to its decision. Regardless, Jerome Tang will be looking for a new team next season.\n\nMaking the Elite Eight of the 2023 NCAA Tournament and the NIT the following year, Tang suffered back-to-back losing campaigns since. Throughout his four years with the Wildcats, he finished with a 71-57 overall record. This includes a 29-39 display throughout the team’s matchups in conference play.\n\nKansas State has a 10-15 overall record on the season, going 1-11 in its Big 12 matchups so far. They are close to the bottom of the Big 12 standings, having a tiebreaker advantage over the Utah Utes while trailing the Baylor Bears and the Colorado Buffaloes.\n\nGoing through six consecutive losses, the Wildcats will hope to return to the win column in their next matchup. They host the Bears as tip-off will take place on Feb. 17 at 9 p.m. ET.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Anastasia Kucherova, a Russian living in Milan, voiced her opposition to Russia’s war against Ukraine with a highly symbolic, if anonymous, act: Carrying the Ukraine team placard during the opening ceremony of the Milan Cortina Winter Games.\n\nKucherova was swathed in a long, hooded silver puffer coat, her eyes covered with dark glasses — like all the other placard bearers for the 92 nations competing in the Olympics. The Ukraine sign was illuminated for the crowd to read.\n\nAt first the country assignments were going to be random, but later the choreographer asked if the volunteers had preferences, and Kucherova chose Ukraine.\n\nKucherova, an architect who has been living in Milan for 14 years, was unrecognizable, and her nationality was not announced to the public when she led the five Ukrainian athletes competing in Milan into San Siro stadium to resounding cheers.\n\nShe first revealed her role to her 879 Instagram followers and then in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\n“When you walk by the side of these people you realize they have every human right to feel hatred towards any Russian,’’ she told the AP on Monday. “Still, I think it’s important to do even a small action to show them that maybe not all the people are thinking the same way.\"\n\nFor Kucherova, speaking about her small act of resistance on the second anniversary of the poisoning death of dissident Alexei Navalny is a way of reminding the world that the war continues, even as life elsewhere goes on.\n\n“Ukrainians don’t have any possibility to avoid these thoughts or to ignore the existence of war. So it is their reality. They keep loving each other, getting married or doing sports, coming to the Olympics. But all of this is happening (against) a devastating background.”\n\nWithout being told that Kucherova was Russian, the athletes immediately recognized her origins and addressed her in Russian. That was a sign for Kucherova of “some profound connection” between Russians and Ukrainians “that obviously could live on if not for the war.”\n\nThe Milan delegation was led by flag bearer Yelyzaveta Sydorko, a short track speedskater, and included figure skater Kyrylo Marsak. Both athletes have fathers who are fighting on the front lines in a war that is nearing its fourth anniversary.\n\n“There is literally no word you can say that can undo the harm that these people have already suffered, and there is no word that can come in close to forgiveness,’’ said Kucherova.\n\nRight before walking into the stadium, “I turned around — I didn’t know what to say to them — but I just said that the entire stadium is going to give them the standing ovation.’’ The Ukrainians appeared skeptical, she said.\n\nWhen the cheers came, Kucherova said it felt like the entire stadium was “recognizing their independence, recognizing their will for freedom, their courage in making it all the way to the Olympics.”\n\nShe cried, silently, behind her glasses.\n\nKucherova hasn't visited Russia since 2018, but understands that she is taking a risk by defying the regime.\n\n“I have to be worried about this, and I’m supposed to be scared about this. And I cannot guarantee that me speaking out will not harm any people I know,’’ she said. “But what I think is that if I, living in a democratic country and enjoying all the freedoms, if I am scared, this means that the regime has won.”\n\nKucherova held the sign for another delegation, Denmark, which also received a rousing ovation for that nation's resistance of U.S. threats to take over Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.\n\n“Yes, this is a coincidence, but I pondered over it,” Kucherova said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Raiders’ Klint Kubiak making strategic moves to win over Maxx Crosby appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders are facing another offseason filled with uncertainties despite the hiring of coach Klint Kubiak. Arguably, the biggest question is: Will Maxx Crosby remain with the Silver and Black?\n\nCrosby has been at the center of trade rumors following another atrocious campaign by the Raiders, which saw them win only three games and miss the playoffs for the fourth straight season.\n\nAt this point, the star defensive end’s future in Las Vegas is teetering. But according to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Kubiak is making strategic moves to entice the five-time Pro Bowler to stay.\n\n“Klint Kubiak comes in, and one of the first things he does is he goes and gets a cup of coffee the other morning with Maxx Crosby. My understanding is that the breakfast went really well, that there was a good rapport between Klint Kubiak and Maxx Crosby. But that nothing really materially changed,” said Breer on his show.\n\n“Now, since then, Kubiak has decided to name Rob Leonard, who was the defensive line coach and the run team coordinator last year, Maxx Crosby’s position coach, the new defensive coordinator of the Raiders. So could that move the needle? We’ll see.”\n\nIn March, the Raiders signed the 28-year-old Crosby to a three‑year extension worth $106.5, making him the highest‑paid non‑quarterback in league history, further underscoring his importance to the team.\n\nYet a season later, the relationship between the team and its cornerstone defender appears to have frayed. For a guy as competitive as Crosby, being on a losing team must be extremely frustrating. He, however, has also discussed the importance of loyalty, stating that he wants to build something with the Raiders.\n\nWhile Crosby has largely dismissed the trade rumors, Kubiak, who replaced Pete Carroll, should not be complacent and ensure that the two-time All-Pro will stay in Sin City.",

    "description": "This one started as an interesting game and ended as an absolute tour de force for the Blue Devils.",
    "fullText": "Syracuse kept up with Duke for about the first 11 1/2 minutes but after that it was all Duke in a 101-64 blowout.\n\nFor the first few minutes, Syracuse did play well and to their credit they competed hard throughout. But Duke was just much, much better in this one.\n\nCameron Boozer had a double-double – in the first half. And arguably, he was the second-best player for Duke in that half, behind Isaiah Evans.\n\nDuke dominated in nearly every facet. Although the Blue Devils started slow from outside, that changed as the game went on. And they dominated around the basket despite William Kyle’s best efforts at controlling the lane.\n\nBoozer and Evans were particularly difficult for Syracuse to control. Boozer finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds while Evans racked up 21.\n\nEvans in particular showed a lot of growth and toughness. He’s a long way from the three-point specialist he was as a freshman. He drove the lane, he faked, he muscled around the basket. It was a really solid performance on his part.\n\nYou know who else was incredibly impressive? Dame Sarr.\n\nThat guy is turning into an unbelievable defender. He’s been so aggressive that the crowd is actually oohing and aahhing over how he’s just smothering guys on defense. It’s pretty unusual to see someone who is that quick on defense and he’s 6-7. When he’s on, what can you do? He’s emerging as a devastating defender.\n\nPat Ngongba has had some erratic performances this year, notably at Louisville and UNC. Not this time.\n\nNgongba finished with 12 points and 7 rebounds and was aggressive inside without getting into foul trouble.\n\nCaleb Foster didn’t score much – just one three – but he ran the team well. He also had no turnovers. Here’s an incredibly impressive stat, by the way: Duke had just 4 turnovers all game.\n\nMaliq Brown, Nik Khamenia and Cayden Boozer were all great off the bench. Brown did his usual things – defending guys in ways they could never expect and scoring and passing efficiently. He finished with 6 points and 5 assists and several surprises for the Orange.\n\nAs for Khamenia, this was a really good game from him. He finished with 14 points on 5-7/3-3 from the floor and played with immense confidence, which was great to see. In his last few games he’s seemed to lack that at times. He was a huge factor.\n\nHe’s emerged as a steady player and one who tends to make particularly smart plays in winning time. Those won’t always show up in a box score, but they still count. He gets those plays right an amazing number of times.\n\nCheck out his stat line here: 12 points on 5-6/2-3 from the floor, with 1 rebound, 4 assists, 0 turnovers and 3 steals.\n\nIn the end, Syracuse played hard and never quit, but the lead just kept growing. Soon after the half, it swelled past 20, then past 25 and ultimately to 37 by the end.\n\nThere’s just not a lot to pick over here. Could Duke have been better at the line? Yeah, that might be a problem in a tighter game. The Blue Devils shot just 13-20 (65%). However, of those 7 misses, Sarr missed all 4 of his attempts, which skews things a bit.\n\nIn general, this game was a Cameron thrill ride, especially in the second half. Everyone played well and more importantly, played well together.\n\nNow it’s on to Michigan Saturday, and that game is going to be really interesting and a great stress test for both teams.\n\nNotes – William Kyle also missed all four of his free throw attempts and he may have the ugliest form we’ve ever seen…he’s tall and athletic but other than blocking shots and dunking, he hasn’t leveraged it much…Cameron Sheffield got in late and got a three and a rebound…Duke’s bigs got 9 assists between them…Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel and Khaman Maluach were all in attendance, as was Steve Wojciechowski, among other former Blue Devils…Syracuse is now 15-12 and a 37-point loss will cause more hot-seat talk for Adrian Autry…Nate Kingz had a tough childhood…he’s an easy guy to pull for and we hope he keeps rising…JJ Starling shot just 3-13…Duke and Sarr harassed Naithan George into 4 turnovers…\n\nNo. 3 Duke men’s basketball rides season-high shooting clip to 101-64 win over Syracuse\n\nNo. 3 Duke Blitzes Syracuse in Second Half for 101-64 Win – Duke University\n\n5 observations from No. 3 Duke men’s basketball’s first half against Syracuse\n\nCooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel in Attendance As Jon Scheyer’s Duke Runs Up 101 vs Syracuse\n\nCameron Boozer joins elite company as Duke dominates Syracuse\n\nCameron Boozer epitomizes difference between Syracuse and Duke\n\nDuke HC Jon Scheyer reveals major key behind Syracuse blowout\n\nAdrian Autry discusses Syracuse’s loss to Duke\n\nSyracuse trailed by 5 late in the 1st half.

    "fullText": "MITCHELL, S.D. (KELO) — The class ‘A’ state gymnastics meet was held on Friday in Mitchell. The race for the crown came down to just a few points as a familiar name continued its dominant run.\n\nThe Redhawks entered Friday’s team competition as the three-time defending state champs. That placed a target on their back, but the team was able to fight through the pressure.\n\n“Our team was just rallied behind each other and having a good time. We were doing our things and hitting our routines,” Johnson said. “That’s all we could ask for.”\n\nEstelline/Hendricks claimed a fourth straight title, edging out Parkston/Ethan/Hanson/Mt. Vernon by less than three points.\n\n“Very relieved, very happy and very proud of our team. We had a lot of injuries and it was very hard for everybody to forget about that and work as hard as we can, but we did,” Hausman said.\n\n“I’m feeling so excited. We did a lot of hard work and it’s just so relieving to get here,” Hartung said.\n\nSherri Johnson is in her eighth year as the Estelline/Hendricks head coach. She says all seasons are special, but this one will standout.\n\n“Just the adversity that we went through and just to call on some kids that had to step up,” Johnson said. “It was a whole team effort to get there. It gave me chills, and I had tears my eyes.”\n\nThe Redhawks have 20 athletes on their roster, 15 of which are freshman or younger, but that’s one of Coach Johnson’s favorite parts of the sport.\n\n“That’s the great thing that I love about gymnastics is you get them in seventh grade and you get to keep them until 12th,” Johnson said. “You’re a family and they’re like your own daughters.”\n\nThe Redhawks found success in the individual competiton on Saturday. Hausman claimed first place, while Hartung earned third.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 league year is coming next month. It officially begins on March 11, with the legal negotiating period beginning on March 9.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have many roster decisions to make before then.\n\nLeading up to the new league year, we will profile every player on the roster, go over what they did last season, what their contract status is and what they face in 2026.\n\nNext up is quarterback Jacoby Brissett.\n\nBrissett joined the Cardinals on a two-year contract last offseason to be Kyler Murray's backup.\n\nHe ended up being the Cardinals' No. 1 quarterback after Murray's foot injury. He started 12 games, went 1-11 and 0-9 in the final nine games, but he had a career year.\n\nHe completed 64.9% of his passes for 3,366 yards, 23 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He set career-highs in passing yards and touchdown passes.\n\nBrissett is signed through 2026. He will make $4.9 million salary and a $2 million bonus. He will count nearly $9.2 million against the salary cap.\n\nWhile the biggest question of the offseason is about Kyler Murray, another very important question is what the Cardinals expect from Brissett in 2026? Will he enter the season as the starter after going 1-11 as a starter and not playing well in any high-leverage situation? Will he be happy returning to a backup role? Does new head coach Mike LaFleur want him?\n\nBrissett might actually have the better trade value between him and Murray because Brissett's contract is very reasonable, especially if a team needs someone who can start.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Manchester United are reportedly exploring a possible summer move for Athletic Club winger Nico Williams.\n\nAccording to a report from TeamTalk, United have already held talks regarding the Spain international.\n\nThe update suggests that the 23-year-old’s name is being discussed as the club looks ahead to potential attacking additions for the next transfer window.\n\nThe situation is seen as a major opportunity, with Williams described as a forward who could add a new dynamic in wide areas.\n\nThe same report references a valuation of £87m, underlining the scale of any deal should United decide to move beyond initial contacts.\n\nWilliams has long been linked with Premier League clubs, and he is positioned as a high-upside target.\n\nWayne Rooney has previously been unequivocal about the winger’s ceiling, comparing his style to Cristiano Ronaldo’s early years.\n\nThe former United striker wrote: “Williams, for me, is exceptional. He reminds me of Cristiano Ronaldo when Cristiano was young.”\n\nRooney added: “He’s a big lad, he’ll take the ball and sometimes tries too much but usually makes the right decisions.”\n\nHe continued: “He is an incredible threat in one-on-one situations and scores goals as well.”\n\nWhile recruitment planning intensifies behind the scenes, United’s immediate focus remains on a return to Premier League action at the Hill Dickinson Stadium when they face Everton away on Monday, 23 February.\n\nWith the season entering a decisive stretch, it remains to be seen whether the report develops into a formal approach.\n\nFor now, the latest claim simply places Williams on the list of wide forwards being discussed, with Rooney’s Ronaldo comparison serving as a reminder of the level United would be aiming to add.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "What's next for Tyreek Hill after his release from the Dolphins? Keep an eye on Chiefs and Bills",
    "description": "Tyreek Hill is now a free agent for the first time in his career.",
    "fullText": "Tyreek Hill is officially a free agent, putting him in an unfamiliar position for the first time in his career.\n\nSo, what’s next for the star wide receiver?\n\nThe Miami Dolphins officially released Hill on Monday, ending a four-season run in which the franchise bet big on him being a key piece to pair with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Ultimately, that didn’t work out. The Dolphins failed to win a single playoff game during his time in South Florida, continuing a drought that dates back to the 2000 season.\n\nHill went down with a devastating knee injury early this past season, too, including a dislocated knee. Hill’s agent said Monday that he’s “progressing well” in his rehab and will be ready to play at some point next season, and Hill vowed to return.\n\nBut who is in play for Hill next season? Yahoo Sports’ “Inside Coverage” podcast discussed a couple of possibilities Monday.\n\n\"He still has that speed. Even if he's 80% of what he was, he's still going to be one of the faster players in the NFL,\" Yahoo Sports senior betting analyst Ben Fawkes said. \"So I think he can be a useful piece for a contender, but also at what price is the big question too.\"\n\nThe first landing spot is obvious. The Chiefs are the easiest match for Hill because his career began in Kansas City, and he won a Super Bowl ring there. He appeared to give a nod of approval on social media of the Chiefs' recent re-hiring of Eric Bieniemy as offensive coordinator.\n\nBut Hill’s usage in Kansas City may not be what he’s used to.\n\n\"Is [Hill] willing to accept a lesser role if that's what he is right now? Let's say the Chiefs, right? Well, is he their No. 1 [wideout]? No, that's probably Rasheed Rice, who has his own set of baggage,” Yahoo Sports NFL senior reporter Frank Schwab said. “And is he their speed guy? Well, no, that's probably Xavier Worthy. What role is he willing to accept? How much money is he willing to accept?\"\n\nThere are, naturally, a lot of questions to be answered there. But Hill would be a solid weapon for the Chiefs, who just missed the playoffs for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nBuffalo appears hellbent on doing just about anything possible to help lift quarterback Josh Allen over the postseason hump and to a Super Bowl. That included jettisoning a successful head coach in Sean McDermott in favor of offensive coordinator Joe Brady earlier this offseason.\n\nHill could be an easy add for a team needing an extra option. Khalil Shakir was their leading receiver last year with just 719 receiving yards, while tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox were second and third.\n\n\"They need that veteran piece,\" podcast host Andrew Siciliano. \"They need that deep threat. They need a guy who down the field — I'm sorry, Brandin Cooks — can attack that football or just run away from the guy closest to him. So he doesn't have to have a contested catch there to win a playoff game in Denver.\"\n\nThe Chargers could be a great fit for Hill for multiple reasons. He’d get to pair up with Justin Herbert, who has statistically been a top tier quarterback during his first six seasons in the league even if the team has struggled at times. The Chargers have plenty of money to pay Hill, too, as they’re sitting with the third-most salary cap space in the league this offseason.\n\nOh, and Mike McDaniel is now the Chargers’ offensive coordinator after he was fired by the Dolphins earlier this offseason. Reuniting with his former head coach on the other side of the country feels like it would make things even easier for Hill coming off of his injury.\n\nSure, the Patriots reached Super Bowl LX this past season. But something was missing, and that was very evident in the final game as the Seahawks cruised to the dominant win in the Bay Area.\n\nHill could easily step into New England and help young quarterback Drake Maye as he enters his third season in the league. Pairing Hill with fellow star Stefon Diggs, who racked up 1,013 receiving yards last season, and tight end Hunter Henry, might just be the boost the team needs to get over the hump.\n\nNow this may not be Hill's first choice, considering the state of the Raiders in recent years. But there are plenty of reasons why it would work.\n\nThe Raiders are under new leadership once again this season with Klint Kubiak coming in as their head coach. The franchise has the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, too, which they will presumably use on Indiana quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza. Getting Mendoza a veteran like Hill right away in his career, along with young running back Ashton Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers, would be huge early on in his career.\n\nOh, and the Raiders have money to spend. That'd be nice for Hill, too.",

    "fullText": "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has doubled down on some Chelsea transfer news regarding striker Nicolas Jackson.\n\nThe Blues player is currently on loan at Bayern Munich for the season, but it has become pretty clear that they will not be signing him in the summer when his loan deal runs out, and he will return back to Chelsea.\n\nBut does that mean he now has a chance of coming back into the Chelsea squad and in the thinking of new manager Liam Rosenior? Well, anything can happen in this game, but Romano still doesn’t think Jackson will, despite reports from Germany yesterday suggesting that Jackson could now move forward and stay with Chelsea into next season and beyond.\n\nRomano was always adamant that Jackson was leaving Chelsea before the summer of 2025 and that there was no way he would be staying at the club. So this paints the picture that his Chelsea story is over, and now he’s doubling down on that.\n\nNicolas Jackson playing for Bayern. (Photo by Adam Pretty/Getty Images)\n\nIn words cited on X last night, Romano said on Nicolas Jackson:\n\n“Remember Chelsea already signed a striker for the summer, [Emmanuel] Emegha, who is similar in terms of skills to Jackson, so that’s a point. Of course a change of manager means a possibility [Nicolas] Jackson stays, but my understanding is that it’s expected that different opportunities on the market will be explored, rather than staying.”\n\nChelsea tried to stop his loan move to Bayern when Liam Delap got injured but the striker point blankly refused to come back. It would SHOCK me if they could all move forward together now!",

    "fullText": "China is a huge market for the NBA, and that is nothing new. Among the league’s international audiences, few countries can go toe to toe with the second-most populous nation in the world. Because of that, the NBA makes sure to establish its presence on the ground every single year. The face of the league, LeBron James, understands this as well.\n\nJames has been to China 15 times so far for his Nike promo tour. It’s also not been that long since his last visit, with the King traveling to China as recently as 2025 to promote his “Forever King” tour, to promote his LeBron 23 shoes. Was it also a farewell visit? One last visit to China?\n\nNot according to James, who, during media availability at All-Star Weekend, admitted that he would like to make another trip to the East.\n\n“To all my fans and people over there it’s always been great,” James stated. “Always welcomed me and my friends and family in open arms. I’ve always appreciated it, they’re be another opportunity for me to go over there at some point.”\n\nJames has remained coy on his relationship with China over the years. He found himself in hot water in 2019 when he went against Daryl Morey’s statement on China.\n\n“I don’t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.”\n\nSince then James has returned to China on a semi-regular basis as he did before the incident as well. So, it’s safe to say he’s welcome in the country to quite a fair extent.\n\nEven if James retires from the NBA after the 2025-26 season, as some believe he will, Nike, which has supported him throughout his career, would still look to capitalize on his popularity in China. Both James and the iconic American brand remain hugely popular there, despite the political tensions between the two countries.\n\nAt the same time, it looks as though James has another country in his mind he would love to visit. And that’s Israel.\n\nIn the same presser in L.A., James was asked about his thoughts on the Middle-Eastern country, and his reply showed that he really wanted to go there. “If I have fans over there — I’ve never been there — I hope you follow my career, I hope I inspire people over there.”\n\n“Not only to be great in sports, but to be better in general in life, hopefully someday I can make it over there,” the Lakers icon added. “I’ve heard great things and I appreciate the question.”\n\nFor now, though, James cannot travel anywhere that far from home. Crunch time in the season is here with the All-Star break nearly over, and his focus is solely on possibly ending his career with a fifth ring.\n\nThe post LeBron James Admits To Wanting To Visit China “At Some Point” appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "“I really do hope that moving forward, the void that Kristjaan Speakman leaves won’t lead to instability”.",
    "fullText": "If the confirmation and timing of Kristjaan Speakman’s Sunderland departure took many people by surprise when it was confirmed on Friday afternoon, the only thing more worthy of animated discussion than his legacy at Sunderland was what his exit might lead to — as well as the precedent the departure of such a notable figure in our recent history might set.\n\nDid he get everything right during his five-year spell at the Stadium of Light? Of course not.\n\nDid he occasionally make decisions on recruitment which were unpopular and sometimes misguided, as well as leaving people frustrated at his public statements? Yes.\n\nDid the end — that of gaining a place in the Premier League — justify the means? Without a doubt, and for what it’s worth, I always felt his comments in the media were lost to print as in reality, he’s a calm, measured and effective speaker — something I certainly noticed during his appearance at a fan forum following the appointment of Régis Le Bris.\n\nTime will be very kind to Speakman’s legacy on Wearside but with Florent Ghisolfi now at the helm and a key component of our recent structure gone, it’ll be a new version of Sunderland AFC that tackles the remainder of the campaign and Le Bris may find himself being judged by a different set of standards as a result — something I do feel could potentially be hazardous.\n\nI really do hope that moving forward, the void that Speakman leaves won’t lead to instability, a lack of forward planning and the kind of uncertainty that we need to avoid at any and all costs. Much has been made of the ambition of Kyril Louis-Dreyfus and his willingness to make bold calls in order to ensure continued progress, but I also think a note of caution should be sounded.\n\n“Ruthlessness” — however it may manifest itself — in footballing circles is often dangerous and as we see with some of the frankly cartoonish dismissals and panicked appointments made in the Premier League, flexing your muscles as an owner (occasionally to rectify a mistake that should never have been made) can be riddled with potential pitfalls.\n\nTaking what often appeared to be a cold, iron-clad approach to hiring and firing might’ve worked for Chelsea when Roman Abramovich’s rubles were keeping the Blues on the leading edge of dominance, but we’re different — or we should be — and I would hate to think that Speakman’s departure heralds the dawn of a scattergun approach that ultimately leads to the kind of turbulence that we’ve tried to escape from.\n\nBarring a cataclysmic end to the season, Le Bris’ position ought to be as safe as houses.\n\nHe’s been one of the most important Sunderland head coaching appointments of my lifetime. He’s helped to create a sense of togetherness that we’ve seldom seen and has propelled us forward rapidly, and his calm, measured and unflappable personality is a perfect fit for our club.\n\nYes, we may have a little bit of work to do in the league and to realign the balance from defensive-minded football to a more positive approach, but let nobody be any doubt that 2025/2026 has the potential to be a memorable season for Sunderland, and our head coach has been as key to that as any of his players.\n\nPerhaps I’m something of a lone voice here, but as much as I’d sell a kidney in order to see Sunderland competing in Europe and the like, I’m not in a rush. I’ve experienced enough highs and lows in thirty years of red and white fandom and I can honestly say that I can’t understand the desperation in some circles to see certain boxes ticked by a certain time or date.\n\nHere and now, I’m happy for the club to be a stable and competitive top flight outfit and to hopefully develop a style of play that can eventually enable us to compete in the upper reaches of the table. I firmly believe Le Bris can be the man to oversee that process and I would only advocate a change in the dugout if a genuine upgrade appeared on the club’s radar — which is by no means guaranteed.\n\nFor everyone — fans and owner alike — patience and planning are the watchwords and just as Le Bris said that we wouldn’t play like other teams because “We are Sunderland and I am Régis Le Bris”, perhaps a similar mindset: “We won’t manage our personnel like Watford or Nottingham Forest”, should be adopted by those in the boardroom.\n\nFor our long-term stability and top flight prospects, it would surely be a smart thing to do.",

    "title": "Lasses Spotlight: Ella West — The Quiet Rise Of A Sunderland Talent",
    "description": "“West’s journey this season has been a lesson in resilience”, writes Charlotte Patterson of the young defender.",
    "fullText": "There are players whose progress feels inevitable, even when circumstances conspire to slow their momentum.\n\nElla West is one of them, and her call‑up to the Scotland U19 squad for their upcoming double‑header against Belgium is more than a line on a squad announcement graphic. Instead, it’s a statement, a reminder, and confirmation that the talent Sunderland have long known they possess is still very much recognised beyond Wearside — even after a season that’s been shaped more by recovery than by rhythm.\n\nFor Sunderland supporters, the news carries a mixture of pride and relief.\n\nPride because her ability has never been in doubt; relief because this season has offered far fewer opportunities to see her in red and white than anyone would’ve hoped. Injuries have a way of interrupting even the most promising trajectories, and West’s campaign has been defined by the kind of stop‑start pattern that frustrates players and fans alike.\n\nYet here she is, selected for her country and trusted to represent Scotland at a level where competition is fierce and standards uncompromising. It’s testament to her quality, her resilience and the impression she’s already made on coaches at both club and international level.\n\nWest’s story this season isn’t one of failure or stagnation — it’s one of patience.\n\nShe’s spent much of the year working her way back to fitness, rebuilding her sharpness and waiting for the moment when her body would allow her to show what her mind has always known she can do. For a young player, that kind of enforced pause can be difficult as the game moves quickly and opportunities come and go, yet she’s handled it with maturity and her Scotland call‑up is the clearest sign yet that her development hasn’t been derailed, merely delayed.\n\nWhat makes her selection even more impressive is the context of her role at Sunderland. She’s predominantly a PGA player and part of the club’s development pathway, but she isn’t a stranger to senior football.\n\nLast season, she earned starts and minutes with the first team, stepping into the then-Championship environment with a composure that belied her age. Whether deployed in her natural position at centre back or pushed into central midfield, she showed the same qualities: intelligence, calmness and an ability to read the game that marks her out as a player with a high ceiling.\n\nThose senior minutes mattered, showing that she could cope with the physicality, the tempo, and the tactical demands of the league. They proved that she wasn’t simply a promising academy player, but someone capable of contributing in real matches and under real pressure. And they showed that Sunderland’s long‑term plan for her, to integrate her gradually into the senior squad wasn’t just aspirational, but achievable.\n\nThis season, injuries have slowed that process and Sunderland have had to manage her carefully, ensuring that her recovery is prioritised over short‑term needs.\n\nIt’s meant fewer appearances, fewer opportunities and fewer moments for supporters to see her progress. But the club never wavered in their belief in her. They know what she brings, what she’ll become, and that her route back to the senior squad is there.\n\nHer call‑up to the Scotland U19s is a significant step in that journey. International football — even at youth level — demands a level of concentration and tactical discipline that accelerates development. It exposes players to different styles, different challenges, and different expectations.\n\nFor West, who’s spent much of the season rebuilding physically, the chance to test herself in this environment is invaluable. It gives her minutes, confidence and momentum at a time when she needs all three.\n\nIt also offers something more subtle: validation.\n\nFor a young player recovering from injury, confidence can be fragile. You can train well, feel sharp and pass every fitness test, but until someone selects you and says, “We trust you”, there’s always lingering doubt. Scotland have removed that doubt, showing that they still see her as part of their plans, that they believe in her potential and still want her involved. That kind of affirmation can transform a player’s mindset.\n\nFor Sunderland, the timing couldn’t be better.\n\nThe senior squad has been stretched this season, and the defensive unit in particular has faced its share of challenges. The team have lacked depth at centre back at times, but West’s ability to cover ground, read danger early and to play out from the back with composure makes her a natural fit for the way Sunderland want to build.\n\nShe’s not just a defender who clears her lines — she starts attacks, and her experience in central midfield only adds to her value.\n\nIt’s given her a broader understanding of the pitch, a better sense of timing and a confidence in possession that many centre halves her age don’t possess. It also means she can step into the midfield lines when needed, helping Sunderland maintain structure in transitions and offering an extra layer of control when the team are under pressure. That versatility is rare and it’s one of the reasons the club sees her as a long‑term asset.\n\nOnce she returns from Scotland duty, the expectation is that she will rejoin senior training more consistently.\n\nThe coaching staff have been cautious but they’ve also been clear: West is part of their plans. They want her involved, competing and pushing for a place on the bench again. And once she’s back on the bench, the next step becomes inevitable: minutes. Real minutes. Not token appearances, but meaningful involvement in matches where Sunderland need fresh legs, fresh ideas and fresh energy.\n\nSupporters haven’t forgotten what she offered last season.\n\nThey remember the calmness, the maturity and the way she slotted into the back line without fuss. They also remember the glimpses of a player who could become a mainstay in years to come, and they know that Sunderland’s identity — built on developing young talent, trusting their pathway and on giving opportunities to players who come through the system — is strengthened every time someone like West takes the next step.\n\nHer return will not solve every issue Sunderland have faced this season, but it’ll help, adding depth, competition and a sense of renewal at a moment when the squad needs it. It’ll also remind everyone that the club’s future isn’t just about the players who start every week, but about the players who are being shaped, nurtured and prepared to take on bigger roles.\n\nWest’s journey this season has been a lesson in resilience.\n\nInjuries test more than the body; they test belief, patience and the ability to stay focused when the game moves on without you. She’a passed that test by staying committed, engaged and ready. And now, with her Scotland call‑up, she’s been rewarded.\n\nThe next chapter is hers to write and it won’t be long before she’s training with the senior squad, competing for a place on the bench and pushing for minutes. And if her development continues on its current trajectory, it’s only a matter of time before those minutes become more frequent, meaningful, and more reflective of the talent she possesses.\n\nFor now, though, she heads to Belgium with her country. Fit again. Trusted again. Recognised again. And ready to remind everyone — Sunderland, Scotland and herself — of the player she’s becoming.",

    "description": "“A tussle with a familiar opponent was the palate-cleanser I think we all needed after a run of difficult games”.",
    "fullText": "Being a Sunderland fan is a funny thing.\n\nOne minute you’re seemingly teetering on the edge of unholy disaster, then, poof — it can all change in an instant. You’re getting promoted, you’re winning games, and you’re on a cup run.\n\nJust as quickly as things can ramp up, stuff goes awry and it’s that constant rollercoaster ride that makes Sunderland such a compelling football club — and why companies like Netflix invested money and time in documenting how batshit mental we are over a number of years.\n\nStill, it’s fair to say that right now, things are about as good as they’ve even been in my lifetime, and whilst the demon on my right shoulder keeps telling me that this will all go tits up eventually, I’m pleasantly surprised by how well we seem to be staying the course right now in the Premier League.\n\nTrips to Anfield and Old Trafford are great, but there was something hopelessly nostalgic about Sunderland’s trip to Oxford on Sunday. It was warm, comfortable and familiar. We’ve been treated to some big games against big opponents with big-name players over the last six months or so, but a shithouse tussle with a familiar opponent at the weekend was the palate cleanser I think that we all needed after a run of difficult and demanding games in the top flight.\n\nI love Luke O’Nien and Dennis Cirkin, so any opportunity that I get to see them run it back for us is a huge positive. And in both cases, they gave classic performances that reminded me of the days we spent in the EFL, going toe-to-toe with some absolute cloggers that on their day can scare and upset you if you don’t want it quite as much as they do.\n\nDon’t get me wrong — I absolutely love Reinildo Mandava and Omar Alderete, and it’s been an absolute joy (for the most part) to see them in a Sunderland shirt this season, but players like O’Nien and Cirkin are the real reasons that I fell back in love with Sunderland all over again after an immensely mentally scarring period under some seriously shitty ownership and management.\n\nThey came along during the club’s worst ever period, and have survived to tell the tale. They — and we — are living proof that it doesn’t matter how bad things are, your club will eventually come out of the other side much stronger and better off for it. Sheffield Wednesday and Leicester fans, take note.\n\nOf course, I’m absolutely buzzing for the game on Sunday and I can’t wait to be there to cheer the Lads on, but that doesn’t make the feeling of seeing the likes of O’Nien playing and playing well any less sweet.\n\nI know Luke has a personal love/hate relationship with this here website, but he’s always been a Sunderland legend to me and I just absolutely adore him. He’s my favourite ever Sunderland player and I get genuine, serious pleasure from watching him play as well as he did on Sunday. It’ll be a sad day when he eventually leaves, so I’ll hold days like that dearly close to my heart and hope that there are still many more to come.\n\nI hated the EFL but I can’t deny that it brought us many happy memories too, and it brought players like Luke, Dennis, Dan Ballard and Trai Hume into our lives, and for that I’m thankful.\n\nSunday was a reminder of the journey we’ve been on, passing through places like Oxford with players like Luke in our team.\n\nWhere are we headed from here? Who knows, though the trajectory of the club would suggest that there will be far fewer trips to places like Oxford, and perhaps far more trips to places that we possibly have never been before.",

    "fullText": "Tyler Reddick and his family went through a tough time in the latter half of 2025. The Cup Series driver’s infant son, Rookie, had to undergo surgery to remove a kidney after he was diagnosed with a tumor that was increasing the stress on his heart. In an interview after he won the Daytona 500 on Sunday, he detailed how the NASCAR community helped him in those days.\n\nRookie was born on May 25, 2025. It was around late September when doctors at the Atrium Health Levine Children’s Hospital in Charlotte confirmed that he had a tumor in his chest and that it was compressing his renal artery and vein. This was causing his heart to work heavier than normal, and it was why he was showing signs of heart failure.\n\nAny parent in this situation would be terrified, and Reddick was too. Fortunately, he received some able support from his friends. He said, “Michael and everybody at 23XI Racing basically told me, ‘Look. If you need to step away and not run another race… do whatever you need to do.’ Just having everyone’s support along the way was incredible.”\n\nThe support wasn’t limited to his team. He continued, “When my wife was headed down there, Rick Hendrick and his whole group were doing everything they could to kind of expedite the process for Rookie. Joey Logano, a fellow competitor of mine, was reaching out, doing everything he could to pick up Beau and let him go hang out with Joey’s kids while we were dealing with that.”\n\nHe quipped that the amount of support he got from the NASCAR community throughout the whole deal was incredible. At the end of the day, all that matters is that the boy is safe and is recovering well. The cherry on top of the cake is that Rookie actually began crawling for the first time during the Daytona 500 weekend.\n\nReddick was jubilant about that as well. To win the Harley J. Earl trophy and to celebrate it with his family after undergoing such scary battles must be a memorable moment for him. The season has just begun under the Chase format, and he has kicked off on the best foot possible.\n\nBut winning the championship will require consistency at this same level throughout the year. Reddick is only too capable of producing that. Without question, Rookie, too, wouldn’t mind visiting more Victory Lanes with his father.\n\nThe post How NASCAR Team Owners and Drivers Supported Tyler Reddick After His Son’s Unfortunate Health Condition appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s hierarchy’s two biggest priorities ahead of next season are to find a permanent manager and strengthen their midfield.\n\nOn Monday, Jurgen Klopp’s agent, Marc Kosicke, claimed that the former Liverpool boss turned down approaches from United and Chelsea following his departure from Anfield.\n\nIt has been widely reported that Real Madrid are interested in hiring Klopp, who is currently Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull. United might have failed in their bid to convince Klopp, but his next potential move could fix their second concern: the midfield.\n\nAccording to a report in Spain, as relayed by Football365, Jude Bellingham has “agreed in principle” to join Manchester United in the summer if Real Madrid secure the services of Jurgen Klopp.\n\nIt has been a rough season for Los Blancos and Bellingham. Early this season, Real Madrid sacked Xabi Alonso and placed Alvaro Arbeloa in charge of the first team.\n\nAt the time, it was suggested that there was a rift between Bellingham, who is enduring an injury-laden campaign, and Alonso. Now, it is being claimed that the Englishman would not be part of Klopp’s plans if the German were to accept the Spanish giants’ job offer.\n\nIt is claimed that Bellingham “has a deal in place to leave Real Madrid if Jurgen Klopp takes over as manager.”\n\nThe England international has “reached an agreement in principle with Manchester United to facilitate an immediate departure should a change in management occur.”\n\nThe report adds: “The move is contingent solely on Klopp’s arrival. If the German coach does not land at the Santiago Bernabéu, the midfielder intends to remain at the club.”\n\nBellingham allegedly prefers to “get ahead of the curve” and find a club where he would be handed a prominent role.\n\nIt is understood United are prepared to offer him that status and build their project around him.\n\nFormer United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer tried to sign Bellingham after he broke through at Birmingham City. Eventually, the 22-year-old chose Borussia Dortmund before sealing a €103 million move to Real, where he has already lifted the Champions League trophy.\n\nThere are question marks over Bellingham’s attitude, but as far as on-field quality is concerned, there are only a few midfielders better than the Real Madrid superstar.\n\nFeatured image Angel Martinez via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "A classic Roker Park atmosphere and a lively cup tie was sure to get the fire burning for legions of Lads’ fans!",
    "fullText": "A wonderfully evocative article from Barry Jackson has prompted today’s feature, which looks at a game that brought the romance of the FA Cup back to Wearside just as his new love affair with Sunderland was blossoming.\n\nThe Lads’ battling fifth round showing in Staffordshire forced a replay and despite Stoke City’s top flight status, the rematch at Roker Park seemed to be firmly in the balance.\n\nOur strong home record would eventually see us finish the season as Division Two champions, and when added to their notorious cup pedigree, it gave many supporters the sense that an upset was on the cards — although as it happened, large sections were anything but comfortable for the hosts.\n\nManager Bob Stokoe, whose main concern prior to kick off was a flu bug that was starting to spread through the club, had to watch on as his team were put through a tough examination by the Potters. As it was, only Billy Hughes and Ian Porterfield — two men who’ll have recalled a similar issue when the FA Cup was won earlier in the decade but had since fallen out of first team contention — were the only players laid up, yet those able to take to the pitch found the going tough.\n\nWell-structured Stoke had plenty of the ball, although they didn’t always turn possession into clear-cut chances, and it was Sunderland that looked the more dangerous actually when they did get the opportunity to push forward.\n\nHaving seen a thirty-fifth minute Pop Robson strike ruled out for offside, Bob Moncur and Mel Holden also went close before a finely-poised chess battle ensued, with Stokoe’s decision to opt for a back five giving the Rokerites the ability to stem the flow of pressure their higher division opponents were looking to build on.\n\nThe massed crowd, which had given the club their biggest attendance of the season thus far, was beginning to sense that things could go either way but rather than add to the tension, they began to turn the volume up.\n\nA wall of noise began to swirl around the stadium and when the final fifteen minutes brought about an intense period of drama, the atmosphere was right up there in terms of classic Roker nights. A superb near post header from Holden as he connected with a Bobby Kerr corner was greeted by jubilant scenes on the terraces, and whilst Denis Smith soon replied for Stoke, the fans didn’t waver once.\n\nSmith — who in time would himself get to enjoy the backing of the red and white army when he became manager on Wearside — registered an instant leveller when a free kick found its way onto the post and he was on hand to poke it over the line, yet the scruffy nature of the equaliser meant Sunderland were able to maintain the belief that they were good enough to win, as rather than being outdone by a moment of skill, they’d instead been pegged back through a touch of misfortune.\n\nKerr, who was awesome throughout, soon set about Stokoe’s left hand side and when his centre was half-cleared, the ball was put back into the area by Dick Malone.\n\nIt was a wonderfully weighted cross and one that Robson was able to control and flick into the net (albeit via a deflection), to spark further celebrations in the jam-packed Fulwell End behind the net.\n\nDespite owing something to luck just as the goal that had proceeded it, the winner felt fully deserved.\n\nIn Robson, the Lads had a finisher every bit as good as Stoke’s usual First Division adversaries, whilst behind him was a level of energy and determination that any successful side needs – a feeling summed up moments before the goals when Jimmy Robertson put a late tackle in on Tony Towers and the skipper was more than happy to give a bit back.\n\nFollowing the clash, Robertson was booked whilst Towers got let off with a stern telling-off from referee Mr T.H.C Reynolds, but the message was clear: Sunderland were up for the cup.\n\nWith a place in the quarter finals now confirmed, murmurings of a potential remarkable double soon got traction.\n\nHowever, the push went to pot when a niggly sixth round encounter with Crystal Palace turned Sunderland into the victims of a giant-killing and with all the attention quickly reverting to the promotion chase, this match can now sometimes be overlooked when recounting the big post-war cup ties staged at Roker.\n\nStill, there’ll be some for whom the memories still exist — and maybe even be one or two who pinpoint the replay as the day their own Sunderland relationship began.\n\nBarry’s origin story is shared by many and although the locations and the characters might change, the essence is the same: love at first sight that leads to a passionate tale that spans a many great years.\n\nSunderland versus Stoke in 1976 might be less heralded that when Manchester City were the opponents at the same stage three years earlier, for instance, but it’ll be no less important to somebody that fell head over heels.\n\nSunderland 2 (Holden 77’, Robson 81’)\n\nSunderland: Montgomery, Malone, Clarke; Moncur, Ashurst, Bolton; Kerr, Towers, Finney (Halom 83’); Holden, Robson",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nJohn Wetzel, a 6-foot-5 wing, emerged as a stud at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in the mid-1960s before the Lakers took him in the eighth round of the 1966 NBA Draft. An injury forced him to wait until the 1967-68 season before he made his NBA debut, but he averaged 3.7 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 11.4 minutes a game that year for L.A.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns then took Wetzel in the 1968 expansion draft, and he ended up playing for the Suns and Atlanta Hawks before his NBA career ended following the 1975-76 season. He finished with career averages of 3.4 points, 1.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 13.2 minutes a game, and he later served as the Suns' head coach during the 1987-88 campaign.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 24 — John Wetzel",

It’s going to take a while for this to sink in. I still can’t believe it. I can’t even put into words what this means, I’m just so excited,\" she said.\n\n\"There were so many moments I thought it wasn’t possible, and I had some really good people in my corner who believed in me. And people from all over the world reaching out and telling me their stories, and how they had kids with Down syndrome, they had deaf kids, and how they believed in me, too,\" she added.\n\nHer eldest son, Nico, was born with Down syndrome. He and his younger brother Noah have deafness due to a mutation unrelated to Down syndrome.\n\nMeyers Taylor won with a combined time of 3 minutes 57.93 seconds from four runs.\n\nGermany's Nolte had topped all the previous three heats, but she made too many mistakes at the top, losing precious time in the final run, and watching her 0.15 seconds lead vanish.\n\nThe World Cup winner had to settle for silver, 0.04 seconds behind Meyers Taylor, while bronze also went to the US with Kaillie Armsbruster Humphries.\n\n\"I'm a bit sad because at the moment it feels like I lost gold - and not that I won silver. In a few hours I think I can celebrate it, because it's still a great result,\" she said.\n\n\"If you lose speed at the upper part you can't catch it back on the down part. So I was angry, but I was still focusing on the next corners, because I was hoping that there's still a chance to somehow get closer, but it wasn't enough.\"\n\nHumphries, meanwhile, stressed that she and Meyers Taylor are proof that mothers and older athletes can still compete at high level.\n\n\"You get a lot of people that like to write you off as soon as you reach 40, it's all downhill from there, is what you hear. I think Elana and I are both proof that that's not true,\" she said.\n\n\"As soon as you become a mom, your body's not the same, and you can never get that high performance back, and I think we were able to show that that's not true again.\n\n\"For every girl out there that wants that dream of being a high-performance athlete, to stand on an Olympic podium and be a mom at the same time, it can happen.\"",

    "fullText": "Only after the 0-4 defeat at Atletico Madrid did FC Barcelona file a formal referee complaint with the Spanish Football Federation. In yesterday’s derby loss (1-2 in Girona), there were immediately more situations in which the Catalans felt disadvantaged.\n\nFans online, for example, criticized the decision not to retake the penalty missed by Lamine Yamal shortly before halftime with the score at 0-0.\n\nIn various images, you can see that players from both teams apparently entered the penalty area too early—which in that case would normally have meant a new chance for the shooter.\n\nHowever, it was this scene that caused even more controversy: Shortly before Girona’s decisive winning goal (final score 2-1), Echeverri stepped on Barca’s Jules Koundé’s foot. Moments later, the ball reached Fran Beltran via Roca, who slotted it into the bottom left corner. The duel just before, which was definitely right on the edge of a foul, was waved through by VAR.\n\nA decision that not all observers can understand—and not all players on the pitch either.\n\nThus, the scorer of Barca’s temporary lead, Pau Cubarsí, said after the final whistle about the scene: “Everyone has already seen it, I won’t give my opinion on it. People already know what happened. But we also have to do better, because they can’t just score two goals against us. We played a bad game and need to look at ourselves first.”\n\nAnd German coach Hansi Flick also seems to have had enough of publicly discussing questionable referee decisions. He too kept quiet: “I don’t want to talk about it, because everyone saw the situation before the second goal.”\n\nIn the end, however, Flick said that Girona deserved the win from his point of view. After the final whistle, Flick explained that he would give his players two days off so they could rest and then calmly prepare for the next match.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali has played down rumours linking him with a move away from St. James Park this summer.\n\nThe 25-year-old was a late target for Arsenal during the winter transfer window.\n\nHowever, a mid-season move was never on the cards despite claims that the Gunners had spoken with his representatives.\n\nThe Premier League leaders could revive their interest in the Magpies midfielder next summer, but they’ll face serious competition from Manchester United.\n\nThe Red Devils are also keeping tabs on Tonali and are planning to launch an official proposal if they qualify for the Champions League.\n\nSpeculation about Tonali’s long-term future at Newcastle comes from reports claiming that there’s a rift between the midfielder and manager Eddie Howe.\n\nHowever, he has shut down those rumours, insisting that their relationship is “perfect”.\n\nTonali used his celebrations to make it clear that he had no problems with Howe after bagging a brace in the 3-1 FA Cup fourth round victory over Aston Villa.\n\nHe celebrated his second goal by running over to the touchline to embrace Howe. “The first one, this celebration was, I think, seven months without scoring,” Tonali said (via The Standard).\n\n“But after the second goal, I came to Eddie because in the past few weeks, people spoke about our relationship.\n\n“But I work every day with the gaffer, the gaffer works every day with me, and our relationship is perfect. It’s not broken, and I think this is perfect for the team.”\n\nTonali’s agent, Giuseppe Riso, also dismissed the rumours, stating he “never had any conversation” with Arsenal. Yet he didn’t completely shut the door on a potential summer exit.\n\nRiso hinted that qualifying for the Champions League will increase Newcastle’s chances of keeping Tonali.\n\n“Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,” Riso said.\n\n“We’ll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later.”\n\nNewcastle currently sit 10th in the Premier League table, nine points off fourth-placed Man United.",

    "fullText": "Skeleton slider Vladyslav Heraskevych late on Monday said he had returned to Ukraine after being excluded from the Olympic competitions.\n\nIn a video posted on X, the 27-year-old appeared to record himself in darkness in central Kiev. He said he was standing near St Sophia's Cathedral, which could not be seen behind him because of Russian attacks.\n\nHeraskevych criticized the International Olympic Committee (IOC), saying more and more Russian athletes were returning to international arenas, \"while Ukrainians continue to live through a humanitarian catastrophe caused by Russian shelling.\"\n\n\"When the IOC plays along with Russian propaganda, it effectively becomes complicit in these crimes,\" he wrote.\n\nHeraskevych was disqualified shortly before the start of the skeleton events at the Winter Olympics in Italy after refusing to remove a helmet that had been banned by the IOC. The helmet featured images of more than 20 athletes who have died since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn an expedited procedure, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld the decision by the sport's governing body, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).\n\nAccording to the guidelines of the Olympic Charter, athletes are prohibited from making political statements during an ongoing competition. Heraskevych argues that the gesture is a commemoration rather than a political statement, something he says other athletes have been allowed to do.",

    "fullText": "Prospective Sheffield Wednesday owner James Bord has become the subject of a major legal battle in the United States, according to The Times.\n\nThe English businessman and former professional poker player led the group that won the race to take over Wednesday after the club’s administrators announced an agreement.\n\nBord is being sued by his former business partner, Jonathan Cohen, over his investment in Spanish second division club Cordoba, where he is both a part-owner and a director.\n\nAccording to court papers filed in Clark County, Nevada, Bord allegedly misled Cohen during an investment deal linked to Cordoba in 2024.\n\nIn the complaint, Cohen says he was told Cordoba were debt-free when he agreed to invest. He now alleges that the club was in fact carrying debts of around $23 million (£16.9m) at the time.\n\nCohen argues that this information was crucial to his decision and that he would not have invested had he known the club’s true financial position.\n\nThe legal documents also claim that Bord wrongfully took control of a bitcoin account worth around $6m which belonged to Cohen.\n\nIn addition, Cohen says that Bord failed to formally confirm his stake in Cordoba through a written contract, ignoring numerous notifications to do so.\n\nOne of the more unusual claims in the filing is that Bord offered Cohen a “coupon” in exchange for a share in the club, a proposal Cohen’s team suggests was not a serious or fair arrangement.\n\nCohen’s lawyers, Holland & Hart LLP, are seeking punitive damages. They argue that Bord’s actions amount to fraud, oppression and deliberate wrongdoing.\n\nCohen has filed a total of seven separate claims, including fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment and breach of confidence.\n\nBord’s representatives have responded by referring to the situation as a “deeply upsetting matter” for their client.\n\nThey have also claimed that over the past few years, Bord has “helped and supported Jonathan [Cohen] financially and personally, and has long considered him a friend”.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the situation will affect Bord’s Wednesday takeover, which is still pending green light from the English Football League.",

I am really proud of myself for the three solid runs and to be sat 11th going into the last run shows the potential.\n\n\"I know everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong and it is just one of those nightmare performances that I'll hopefully move on from.\"\n\nNicoll - a three-time British shot put champion - was a travelling reserve for the two-woman bobsleigh at the 2022 Games in Beijing where the monobob made its debut as a Winter Olympics event.\n\n\"Hopefully that shows people that this is raw and it is not all sunshine and rainbows,\" she added.\n\n\"I've had to overcome a lot of hurdles to even be here. I started off this season not even walking and had to overcome a serious injury to even be on the starting block today.\n\n\"I am just taking some accountability for that fourth run not being good enough and I need to pull it together for the two-woman.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nJamaica's Mica Moore, from Newport in south Wales, finished four places ahead of Nicoll in 14th and was delighted with the outcome having switched in 2022 from representing GB after claiming she had witnessed \"damaging and offensive behaviour\".\n\nMoore told BBC Sport: \"I'm so happy. It has been a real tough journey to get here, it hasn't been easy at all. I guess to me it is just a story of not giving up.\n\n\"I had a really difficult time with Great Britain and that is not secret at all and I'm just so proud I didn't give up on myself and I'm so grateful for my family and friends for digging myself out of the trenches when it was really tough and just keep going. Moments like this make it really worth it.\"\n\nMoore began her sporting career as an athlete - representing Wales at the 2014 Commonwealth Games - before switching to bobsleigh.\n\nHer grandfather, Venson Byfield, came to the UK in the Windrush generation and settled in Wales.\n\n\"It is a really proud moment,\" she added.\n\n\"I've spoken a lot about my grandfather and how we came over with the Windrush generation and I never got the pleasure of meeting him, but my mum has told me so many stories about him and I just had that in my heart the whole time. I just wanted to make my family proud.\n\n\"They've supported me for so long.

    "fullText": "It sounds a bit crazy, but it's true: Feyenoord has relocated its training program abroad at short notice. The reason is a single, prominent new star signing: Raheem Sterling.\n\nAfter terminating his contract with Chelsea at the end of January, Sterling signed a contract last week until the end of the season with the second-placed team in the Dutch Eredivisie.\n\nTo integrate him into the team as quickly as possible, the club has gotten creative.\n\nSince Sterling does not yet have a valid work permit for the Netherlands, his new team is accommodating him. Quite literally.\n\nRotterdam's coach Robin van Persie has reportedly organized a training camp in Belgium specifically for Sterling, according to reports from the 'Mirror' and 'Spox'.\n\nThe coach explained: \"This is allowed abroad. We are doing this for him, but I also want to work on the development of our team. We can exchange ideas well and do something fun together.\"\n\nThe lack of a work permit is not the only obstacle for the first appearance of the 31-year-old Englishman. \"We will see week by week when he is fit for a game. It will take some time, but that seems logical to me since he hasn't played for six months,\" added van Persie. Sterling did not collect a single minute of play in the first half of the season at Chelsea.\n\nSo it will probably take a while before the Rotterdam transfer coup really pays off.\n\nAt least the first training session with the new team won't be long in coming - even if it initially takes place not in the Netherlands, but in Belgium.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

He also became the fastest player in NFL history to reach 1,000 career receptions and surpassed Antonio Gates to become the Chargers' all-time receptions leader.\n\nAllen is 534 yards away from passing Gates as the franchise's receiving yards leader.\n\nAllen will be one of the more reliable veteran free agent receivers available, and he should draw interest from teams needing a proven slot if he tests the market.\n\nWith the Chargers' ample cap space, re-signing Allen is possible. He has made it clear that he has no interest in testing free agency and wants to continue to play in L.A.\n\nHowever, the question becomes whether McDaniel sees him as an option in his offense and whether it makes sense to pair him with Ladd McConkey again, as Allen's presence cut into McConkey's route tree and production in 2025. McConkey finished with 66 catches for 789 yards after posting 82 catches for 1,149 yards as a rookie.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: Keenan Allen contract projection: Will Chargers re-sign free agent?",

    "fullText": "It has been just a week since the Seattle Seahawks beat the New England Patriots to win Super Bowl LX. Immediately after which, Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak was named the Raiders next head coach.\n\nThe move had been expected in the week leading up to the Super Bowl and with that came the expectation that he would bring over several other Seahawks assistants to join him in Las Vegas. Sunday, he landed perhaps the most significant of those assistants in terms of how the Seahawks went about winning the title -- the rushing attack.\n\nObviously, Kubiak was the architect of that offense, but it was run game coordinator Rick Dennison who gets credit for what the Seahawks were able to do to the Patriots on the ground.\n\nThe #Raiders are expected to hire #Seahawks run game coordinator and senior offensive advisor Rick Dennison, sources tell @CBSSports.\n\nDennison has 30 years of NFL coaching experience, including as an offensive coordinator with the Bills, Broncos and Texans. pic.twitter.com/p8Zy0ezEGU\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) February 17, 2026\n\nThe Seahawks run game had the Patriots defense out of sorts all game long and running back Kenneth Walker II gouged the New England defense all game long.\n\nThe 67-year-old Dennison's ties to Klint Kubiak go back to his father with whom he coached with as far back as 1995. That relationship led to Dennison working with Klint at four different spots, including with the Saints in 2024 and Seahawks in 2025. Clearly he was in Seattle because of Kubiak, so his move to Las Vegas was for the same reason.\n\nKubiak had already lured QB coach Andrew Janocko as his OC. Now he gets another key member of that Seahawks staff as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Raiders Wire: Raiders reel in coach who was key component in Seahawks Super Bowl win",

This news was put out allegedly by Klopp’s agent.\n\nThe news did not surprise me and to be honest, despite Chelsea denying it, I’m inclined to believe the agent and I’d fully expect Chelsea to have approached Klopp when he was available. I mean, why wouldn’t they? They would have to at least try to bring in one of the best available head coaches in the world, right? They would be silly not to try. I think they probably did try, or at least reach out to his agents, but they were politely told no thanks, and they would rather deny a story like that. This is just my opinion anyway, appreciate others may have different views on it.\n\nSky Sports News, via X, have reported that Chelsea have denied having any contact with Jurgen Klopp’s agent after he said the club made an enquiry.\n\nIt was suggested that Klopp’s trusted advisor/agent, Marc Kosicke, said otherwise.\n\nEven if they didn’t approach him, if they did, it’s obvious he was going to say no. He wanted a break from football first and foremost but also, I can not see a manager like Klopp working under an ownership like Chelsea have.\n\nKlopp would get very little say in anything and would have to accept that the sporting directors and owners run the rule over Chelsea – it just would not work.\n\nChelsea have drawn Wrexham in the FA Cup fifth round, a really fun and interesting draw – but one we have to win.\n\nPeople are bending over backwards to try and find nice things to say about Liam Delap’s performance on Friday against Hull, including the crew on the London is Blue podcast.",

I would love to be on that April card, the Miami card (UFC 327). There's no opponent yet. There's no contract yet. We don't have any of that. Whoever. Let's go. I'm ready to go again and get back to my belt as soon as possible. Don't really matter who it is.\"\n\nDu Plessis won the 185-pound championship at UFC 297 in January 2024 by defeating then-titleholder Sean Strickland via split decision. He successfully defended the belt twice before losing to Chimaev at UFC 319.\n\nWhile du Plessis is willing to face anyone at UFC 327, he knows who he'd like to fight. The South African wants a rematch with the champion despite their UFC 319 title bout being a one-sided dominating grappling performance by Chimaev.\n\n\"I would of course love for it to be Khamzat and redeem that loss,\" he said. \"For me, right now the next fight is the most important fight of my life. And I will win that fight and I will get my belt back.\"\n\n\"Fighting Khamzat again is of course what I'm after. Expecting any surprises (in a rematch)? No. There's not going to be any surprises. I mean, that is the way that he's going to fight. And if he tries anything different, it will be a terrible night (for him). We all know that, but he did what he had to do to win that belt. We can't hate on him for that. He did what he needed to do. It's the rules of the game and he did it. So, saying it's not fair, it is fair. He did what he had to do. It's not how I would win my belt, or would like to, but that's what he did. Now it's my responsibility to go and fix that to stop him from doing that again and get him to fight my fight,\" du Plessis continued.\n\n\"It's always great when you have a guy that comes and fights because that's my style and it's what I love to do to entertain, to hear the crowd go crazy. But he knows that and that's why he went for that style because, and once again I understand that it wasn't the best fight to watch. In fact, it was a terrible fight to watch. But he did what he had to do to win that title. And good for him. My responsibility is to stop him from doing that, and that's what I will do ... I'll have my belt back by the end of this year.\"",

    "description": "Fujitsu Limited today announced the development and launch of its AI-Driven Software Development Platform, a new initiative to bring software development into the AI age and contribute to the sustainable growth of its customers and society.",
    "fullText": "Kawasaki, Japan, February 17, 2026\n\nFujitsu Limited today announced the development and launch of its AI-Driven Software Development Platform, a new initiative to bring software development into the AI age and contribute to the sustainable growth of its customers and society. This platform automates the entire software development process, from requirements definition and design to implementation and integration testing. By leveraging the Takane large language model (LLM) [1] and agentic AI technology for large-scale software development developed by Fujitsu Research, the AI-Driven Software Development Platform enables AI agents to understand complex, evolving large-scale systems owned by enterprises and public organizations. The platform has multiple AI agents collaboratively execute each stage of software development, achieving full automation of the entire process without human intervention.\n\nFujitsu aims to use this AI-Driven Software Development Platform to carry out revisions to all 67 types of medical and government business software products provided by Fujitsu Japan Limited by the end of fiscal year 2026. The revisions are necessary due to legal and regulatory changes. From January 2026, the platform has been used in Japan for software modifications made necessary by the 2026 medical fee revisions [2]. In a PoC that updated software as per the 2024 medical fee revisions, the platform demonstrated a significant reduction in development time for one of approximately 300 change requests. Using conventional software development methods [3] the modifications would have taken three person-months. With this technology that was dramatically shortened to four hours, achieving a 100-fold increase in productivity.\n\nIn AI-driven development, Fujitsu positions AI-Ready Engineering—the process of preparing assets and knowledge to ensure AI correctly understands existing systems and achieves highly reliable automation—as crucial. With AI-Ready Engineering and the AI-Driven Software Development Platform working in tandem, Fujitsu will accelerate AI-driven software development. Fujitsu will promote a transformation in engineers' work styles, strengthening its Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) complement, and shifting the paradigm of software development from a conventional person-month-based approach to a customer value-based approach.\n\nMoving forward, Fujitsu plans to expand the application of the AI-Driven Software Development Platform to a wide range of sectors, including finance, manufacturing, retail, and public services, by the end of fiscal year 2026. Fujitsu will also begin offering this service to customers and partner companies to enable them to rapidly and flexibly develop systems that adapt to changes in their business environments. Through these efforts, Fujitsu aims to transform the software development process into an AI-driven model as an industry standard.\n\n(Order that companies appear is aligned with the original Japanese press release)\n\nTakashi Manabe, Senior Research Director, AI & Automation, IDC Japan\n“IDC forecasts that from 2026 onward, the acceleration of AI/agent-based business utilization and the modernization of existing systems will be key drivers of transformation in the Japanese IT market. Fujitsu’s announcement aims to redefine complex legacy system assets into a state where AI can accurately understand and process them, and to automate the entire waterfall development process. This initiative is expected to provide a practical pathway for many domestic enterprises facing the ongoing challenge of maintaining and operating legacy assets, while also promoting a shift in software engineering away from a labor-intensive model.”\n\nShinji Kajitani, Director and President Executive Officer, Optima Corporation\n“I am deeply impressed by the concept of automating the entire software development process from upstream to downstream using AI, and even entrusting the verification process to AI. This overturns the traditional assumption that human checks are ultimately indispensable, and I see great potential, especially in targeting business packages that undergo complex system changes every year. Our company has also been involved in business package modifications for many years, and how to complete system revisions with high quality in a short period has always been a major challenge. We believe that the knowledge and expertise accumulated during that process can significantly contribute to the realization and advancement of this concept. Our company will continue to contribute to the business expansion of Fujitsu and Fujitsu Japan through ongoing cooperation, not limited to this project.”\n\nHiroshi Nakatani, Representative Director, Executive Vice President, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.\n\"This AI automation initiative promoted by Fujitsu is not merely about improving development efficiency; we recognize it as a significant challenge to pass on and evolve the extensive business knowledge and design philosophies cultivated by companies over many years to the next generation. In particular, the concept of providing end-to-end support, from requirements definition to design, implementation, and quality assurance, triggered by changes in laws and rules, opens up new possibilities in areas that have traditionally relied on human experience and tacit knowledge. We see great significance in AI functioning as a foundation that supports human judgment and creativity, rather than replacing it.\nIn the manufacturing industry, challenges such as design changes, regulatory compliance, and understanding the scope of impact are becoming increasingly complex year by year. Fujitsu's approach of advancing both knowledge standardization and AI utilization in these areas offers valuable insights for enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the entire industry.\nKawasaki Heavy Industries sincerely hopes that this initiative will be a crucial step in driving the transformation of Japanese manufacturing and a wide range of other industries, and we wholeheartedly support its further development.\"\n\nYasushi Matsuda, President and CEO, Kewpie Digital Innovation Co., Ltd. \n“Systems have become increasingly complex through years of operation and often now require significant maintenance effort. While the introduction of generative AI has improved auditing efficiency, its accuracy remains insufficient for reliable practical application. Amidst this situation, we place great expectations on “Multi-layer Quality Control,” which automatically corrects ambiguities and omissions. We are confident that this mechanism, where AI itself audits quality and autonomously repeats processes, will dramatically enhance the reliability of system development. We eagerly await its future development.”\n\nJunichi Aruji, Managing Director, Kintetsu Information System Co., Ltd. \n“The challenge of revamping existing systems has long been a significant one for engineers. Fujitsu’s AI-Driven Software Development Platform has the potential to dramatically transform the labor previously involved in understanding complex laws and regulations, analyzing vast historical assets, and grasping the tacit knowledge of the field.\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is the AI's ability to autonomously learn \"human intelligence,\" thereby dramatically enhancing the accuracy of requirements definition. Furthermore, it can complete everything from program structure analysis and standardization to the extensive testing phase with incredible speed and comprehensiveness. This makes it possible to deliver high-quality products in a short period.\nAs the role of AI expands and frees people from routine tasks, engineers can focus on more creative activities. I have high expectations for the paradigm shift in system renovation that this solution will bring.”\n\nYumi Ueno, Managing Director, Partner Ecosystem & Corporate Business, Google Cloud Japan G.K. \n“This initiative to achieve comprehensive, one-stop automation spanning from requirements definition to system validation is a groundbreaking innovation for the industry. The technology enables AI to accurately understand vast assets, including long-established programs and design documentation, and we are delighted at the potential for both production-grade quality and exceptional productivity gains. We are confident that this platform will become the new standard for development and accelerate our customers' digital transformation. We remain committed to working with Fujitsu to address social challenges through AI.”\n\nMasahiro Niimi, Managing Executive Officer, Head of Information Systems Management Division, CISO, Sakura KCS Corporation \n“I believe Fujitsu Limited's AI-driven development framework has the potential to become the ‘new paradigm of system development.’ It cannot be achieved simply by feeding existing code or design information into AI, and while there are various hurdles, such as converting documentation to Markdown and establishing test environments, overcoming these hurdles can lead to solving traditional system development challenges (like QCD).\nWhat particularly caught my attention is not just improvements in the development process, but what comes after generative AI, i.e., the incorporation of detailed specifications and code (logic). I see tremendous potential here as a solution to the greatest challenge: visualizing and transferring the tacit knowledge of veteran software engineers’ that is traditionally missing from documentation. We expect generative AI to act as an advisor for less experienced software engineers, readily answering questions anytime, thereby dramatically advancing know-how transfer to the next generation. On the other hand, this mechanism also has the potential to dramatically change the traditional SI business model, and we are watching future developments closely.”\n\nTakao Kazama, Executive Officer, Group Companies and Accounting & Finance, The Shizuoka Shimbun and Shizuoka Broadcasting Co., Ltd. \n\"This initiative for complete automation of application development and maintenance represents a highly valuable transformation for our company. It formalizes and establishes a reproducible process for tasks that have long relied on the implicit knowledge and experience of individual staff members, and we have great expectations for it. In particular, it has the potential to significantly improve quality variations in legacy system maintenance and lost opportunities due to delayed change responses. Furthermore, the evolving ability of AI to perform root cause analysis and identify necessary additional information is a major step towards advanced and efficient system operations, with the potential to change the very nature of system development. We share Fujitsu's commitment to improving productivity across the entire industry and establishing new development standards. We look forward to its continued strong promotion as an initiative that will advance the entire industry.\"\n\nShimane Prefectural Central Hospital \n\"The AI-Driven Software Development Platform presented by Fujitsu offers a practical and robust approach to the long-standing challenges faced by medical institutions: the increasing complexity of medical fee calculations and the growing workload of claims processing. The mechanism where AI analyzes legal documents and extracts the relevant areas, while explicitly highlighting points open to interpretation to supplement human judgment, is particularly impressive. This design demonstrates a deep understanding of on-site operations and is highly commendable. Furthermore, the Japanese-specific LLM and the consideration for safety are indispensable elements for AI utilization in the medical field. Beyond medical fee claims, this technology has potential for integration with related areas such as bed management and understanding performance requirements, making a strong contribution to overall hospital operational efficiency in the future. This is a promising initiative that warrants positive consideration for adoption to alleviate the burden on medical professionals.\"\n\nShinichi Aikawa, Executive Officer, Head of Systems Division, SBI Sumishin Net Bank, Ltd.\n“We expect Fujitsu's AI-Driven Software Development Platform to be an initiative with the potential to fundamentally transform the software development process itself. If a world can be realized where everything from requirements definition to design, coding, and testing can be automatically executed in a seamless, one-stop manner, it will be possible to achieve both a dramatic improvement in development speed and quality. \nSince 2024, we have been working with Fujitsu in some areas of this field. Through these initiatives, we are confident that the entire development process will be automated end-to-end in the near future. By realizing this transformation, the possibilities for the services we can provide to our customers will greatly expand. We think about ideas for new services for our customers on a daily basis. This would allow us to rough out these ideas in a short period of time and provide them to our customers quickly. We hope that this new world of value creation will arrive as soon as possible.”\n\nMasaki Murata, Vice President, IBM Japan \n“We strongly believe that Fujitsu’s announcement marks a significant step forward in the evolution of system development in Japan. It aligns closely with IBM Japan’s vision and represents an important initiative that will help shape the future of the industry as a whole. We look forward to driving this momentum together and contributing to the creation of a more robust and vibrant ecosystem.”\n\nRyota Sato, Managing Executive Officer, Global Communications & IT Services Group, Microsoft Japan Co., Ltd. \n\"We sincerely welcome Fujitsu Limited’s announcement of the AI-Driven Software Development Platform as a pioneering initiative that opens a new chapter in system development for the AI era. By orchestrating multiple AI agents to automate the end-to-end development lifecycle—from requirements definition through ongoing enhancement—while integrating human-led quality assurance, this platform embodies a new engineering model in which people and AI truly work together. We view this initiative as highly significant, as it directly addresses the critical challenges facing Japan’s system development industry, including severe talent shortages and the increasing complexity and sophistication of modern systems. We strongly expect this bold effort to drive the evolution of Japan’s system development business and to grow into a transformation model with global relevance. Moving forward, we will continue to work closely with Fujitsu, combining the strengths of both companies to strongly support our customers in their journey toward becoming Frontier Firms.”\n\nTatsuo Ogawa, Executive Officer Group CTO, Panasonic Holdings Corporation\n“We believe that the AI-driven end-to-end automated system development announced this time represents not only a significant improvement in productivity, but also a bold challenge to fundamentally transform the way enterprise IT is delivered. By enabling AI to accurately understand frequently updated regulations and complex business knowledge, including implicit know-how, this approach autonomously executes processes seamlessly from requirements definition through system modification. It has the potential to provide an effective solution to the core challenges posed by legacy systems faced by many Japanese enterprises. We look forward to jointly refining this technology through hands-on practice and advancing co-creation by incorporating on-site expertise of both Panasonic and Fujitsu, with the expectation that it will become a new standard for system development and be deployed broadly not only within Panasonic but across society as a whole.”\n\nExecutive at a major manufacturing company's IT subsidiary\n“We anticipate this initiative will bring about a new transformation in system development. This transformation will be driven by the application of advanced Japanese language processing capabilities—such as the understanding of legal documents—to diverse tasks, the reliable execution of each process through quality auditing functions, and the expansion of these capabilities to scratch development. Furthermore, we believe that AI Ready Engineering, by formalizing expert know-how and domain knowledge into explicit knowledge and transforming it into AI-usable assets, will significantly contribute to the succession of expertise from an increasingly limited pool of skilled professionals. We sincerely hope that the co-creation between the knowledge-inheriting AI and on-site personnel will generate new value and form the cornerstone for innovation in the system development industry, and indeed, across all industries.”\n\nJointly developed by Fujitsu and Cohere Inc.\n\nA national system that reviews public medical fees and adjusts cost allocation for medical procedures.\n\nDevelopment methods where quality is verified at each stage, from software requirements definition, design, and implementation to integration testing.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 represent a set of common goals to be achieved worldwide by 2030.\nFujitsu’s purpose — “to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation” — is a promise to contribute to the vision of a better future empowered by the SDGs.\n\nPublic and Investor Relations Division\n\nAll company or product names mentioned herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners.

    "fullText": "Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris addressed the controversy over CEO Marc Benioff's ICE jokes in an internal meeting, saying he was \"not OK with it,\" Business Insider has learned.\n\n\"Marc made a very bad joke,\" Harris, who is the company's chief technical officer, said. \"But that's something that Marc did, and I'm not gonna call him out in public out on the internet.\"\n\nA transcript of Harris' remarks at a meeting of the product and tech team last week was posted by an employee to a Slack channel. Business Insider verified that the transcript was accurate.\n\nSalesforce did not respond to a request for comment. Benioff has not spoken about the jokes or the company's reaction to them.\n\nIn his meeting, Harris began by addressing a question about why many company leaders had not addressed Benioff's comments at Salesforce's employee-only company kickoff in Las Vegas last Tuesday.\n\n\"So I'll start by saying that somebody already has, and it was immediately leaked,\" Harris said, referring to a Business Insider story about another executive who criticized Benioff's jokes.\n\n\"Let's talk about it with each other and not out to Business Insider and other places because it doesn't do us any good,\" he said, adding, \"It's a violation of the Code of Conduct, and it's a fireable offense. And if we do catch you, we will fire you.\"\n\nAt the kickoff, Benioff made \"multiple\" jokes about ICE, including one about agents surveilling Salesforce employee travel, employees told Business Insider at the time.\n\nWorkers reacted with anger on Slack, which is owned by Salesforce. Slack General Manager Rob Seaman posted a comment saying he could not \"defend or explain\" his boss' comments.\n\n\"They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well,\" he wrote.\n\nCraig Broscow, a Salesforce VP, acknowledged the \"deep disappointment\" in his own Slack message after the kickoff remarks.\n\n\"It would be a step in the right direction and for Marc to acknowledge as soon as possible — ideally publicly — that his attempted joke was extremely upsetting to large segments of his employee base,\" Broscow said.\n\nSpeaking to his team, Harris said Seaman got in hot water for his post.\n\n\"I'll tell you personally, and this is what Rob said as well, and I respect Rob for saying that, but he got in big trouble 'cause it went out on the internet,\" Harris said. \"Personally, I'm not OK with that joke.\"\n\nHarris went on to say that \"it's hard right now with what is going on [in] the US\" and \"what's going in, like, Minneapolis is not about our software. Our software is not being used there.\"\n\nHarris said Salesforce is \"not a political organization\" and encouraged employees to make their views known at the ballot box.\n\n\"I'm going to use my democratic right to vote, and that's how I'm gonna take action against some of the things that I'm not okay with,\" he said.\n\nHe closed with saying, \"So that's my statement. It may not make you feel better. So I'm sorry if it doesn't make you feel better. I think we should keep talking about it. I'm totally fine talking about it more.

    "description": "Nvidia was his dream job, but he got turned down. So this 30-year-old regrouped and strategized. He shares how he got a job offer there.",
    "fullText": "As Sylendran Arunagiri considered moving from India to the US to pursue a master's degree, some friends and mentors advised him to delay his move. They warned that the US tech job market had become too challenging.\n\nArunagiri's goal was to move to the US in late 2023, begin a master's program in product management at Carnegie Mellon University, and land a Big Tech internship for the summer of 2024. He hoped this would be a stepping stone toward landing an AI-related role, ideally at Nvidia, his \"dream company\" because of its central role in the AI technologies he'd long wanted to work on.\n\nHowever, there were several things working against him. For one, the US tech hiring landscape was already creating headaches for job seekers. Openings had plummeted from highs reached a year earlier, and industry layoffs were increasing competition for available roles.\n\nAdditionally, Arunagiri had grown accustomed to the job market in India, where he earned a bachelor's degree and an MBA from top institutions that he said relied on structured campus placement programs to funnel many students directly into jobs. But from what he'd heard, the US was very different. Job fairs were often more like networking events than recruiting opportunities.\n\n\"You're completely on your own,\" said the 30-year-old, who now lives in San Jose.\n\nArunagiri is among the many job seekers who have struggled to navigate a US hiring landscape that's become more challenging in recent years. Amid economic uncertainty, the early effects of generative AI adoption, and a broader push to streamline operations, US businesses are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nStill, some people have managed to break through in a challenging market. Arunagiri shared how he pursued his goal of working at Nvidia — a company he described as his dream employer — and offered his top advice for other job seekers.\n\nMany of the tech companies Arunagiri was targeting had conducted summer internship interviews the previous fall, so he began applying before moving to the US. After sending out many applications, he landed an interview with Nvidia in November 2023.\n\nArunagiri said the interview process went so well that he stopped applying to other internships. But after moving to the US and completing his final interview in February, he learned that he wouldn't be getting the role — which left him scrambling to find another internship.\n\n\"I had to start from scratch, but by then many of the applications had dried out,\" he said\n\nArunagiri was able to land an AI product manager internship based in India at the tech company Informatica. However, that summer, he found it difficult to stop thinking about what went wrong during his interview process with Nvidia — and began setting his sights on eventually landing a full-time role with the company.\n\nUpon reflection, Arunagiri suspected that his final Nvidia interview may have doomed him. He said he was lower energy than usual because he was feeling sick that day, and that he'd been hesitant to postpone it out of fear that the opportunity would be filled in the meantime. In hindsight, he said that decision was likely a mistake.\n\n\"I came off as a dull candidate, but I'm usually energetic and conversational,\" he said. \"I should have probably postponed it to a day that I was feeling better.\"\n\nArunagiri decided to reach out to an HR professional from Nvidia to get insight into where he fell short, and they agreed to jump on a call with him. While they didn't provide specific insights into his candidacy, he said they recommended he try to connect with people at Nvidia in current roles, including hiring managers and interns, to get insight into the kinds of projects they were working on and how he could better align his profile.\n\nHe eventually connected with about five Nvidia interns, who he said provided valuable insights. Those conversations helped shape the personal AI-related projects he began pursuing and sharing on LinkedIn in hopes of standing out.\n\nAfter the summer, Arunagiri dove back into the job search, eager to land a role before he graduated in December 2024. He knew that if he didn't land a job within 90 days after graduation, his F-1 visa restrictions would force him to return to India.\n\nIn September 2024, he submitted a cold application for a technical product marketing role in agentic AI at Nvidia —a role he described as his \"dream AI role\" at his dream company. He was asked to interview starting in October, and around the same time, he was also invited to interview for a more junior product management role at Microsoft.\n\nIn December, with his graduation looming later that month, Arunagiri received offers from Nvidia and Microsoft within days of each other. Given that Nvidia was his dream employer, the role checked a lot of his boxes, and the pay was higher than Microsoft's, he said the decision was fairly easy — and he accepted Nvidia's offer. He said that so far, working at Nvidia has been \"everything that I've dreamed of.\"\n\nArunagiri believes that his LinkedIn presence helped him stand out. During the interview process, he said, the hiring manager told him that he'd reviewed his LinkedIn profile and noticed the projects he'd been working on, including small experiments with new generative AI tools and models he'd shared publicly.\n\nHe has a few pieces of advice for job seekers. First, he said, time management is key, particularly because applying for jobs and connecting with people can be time-consuming. Second, he said, never compare your job search journey to anyone else's, since a variety of factors can influence how it plays out.\n\nRather than quietly applying and networking, he recommends sharing tangible projects publicly — such as posting about AI tools you've explored and linking to projects on LinkedIn or a personal website — so hiring managers can see your work.\n\n\"You need to find something that sets you apart from others,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "\"Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday\" — except when it ends in a midair brawl.\n\nThe British budget carrier has issued lifetime bans to two passengers after a flight from Turkey to England diverted to Belgium on Thursday following a fight on board, the airline told multiple news outlets.\n\nIt's unclear what caused the altercation, but videos circulating on social media show passengers screaming and pushing as cabin crew and others attempted to break it up. The plane later continued to the UK after police removed the two passengers.\n\nJet2 said in a statement that the pair exhibited \"appalling behavior\" and that it would \"vigorously pursue them\" to recoup the costs of the diversion.\n\nDiversions aren't cheap: they can cost airlines tens of thousands of dollars in fuel, labor, and airport fees. Any hotel and transportation costs also add up.\n\n\"As a family-friendly airline, we take a zero-tolerance approach to disruptive passenger behaviour, and we are very sorry that other customers and our colleagues on board had to experience this too,\" the airline said.\n\nJet2 has a history of chasing down unruly passengers. In 2019, the airline barred a disruptive traveler and billed her about $115,000 after she attempted to open an exit door midair, prompting a diversion escorted by military jets. In 2022, two brothers who fought on board another Jet2 flight forced a diversion and were later charged about $68,000 and issued lifetime bans.\n\nOther airlines have taken similar approaches, seeking reimbursement from passengers whose behavior disrupted flights.\n\nBudget competitor Ryanair, for example, last year filed a lawsuit seeking about $18,000 from a passenger it described as disruptive after a diversion to Portugal in April 2024 left 160 people needing overnight accommodation.\n\nUnruly passenger incidents surged during the pandemic, when mask mandates fueled confrontations between travelers and airline staff.\n\nData from the Federal Aviation Administration shows there were nearly 6,000 reports on US airlines in 2021 — up about 500% from roughly 1,000 the year before.\n\nReports fell to about 2,500 in 2022 and further to roughly 1,600 in 2025, though they still remain well above pre-pandemic levels. There have been 126 reports so far in 2026.\n\nThe FAA maintains a zero-tolerance policy and has issued more than $20 million in civil fines since 2020 (these are separate from the money airlines can collect through lawsuits).\n\nIn more extreme cases — such as physical assaults on crew — passengers have faced criminal prosecution, including by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, resulting in larger fines and jail time.",

I was humbled.\n\nHawker centers, like where Ang set up shop, are the go-to for budget meals in Singapore. They're cheap, hearty, and convenient, and I've eaten from them as long as I can remember.\n\nThere are 123 hawker centers in the country, managed by the National Environment Agency. On average, each center has about seven to 10 individual stalls.\n\nTraditionally, they sell dishes like Hainanese chicken rice, bak kut teh, a peppery and flavorful pork soup, or nasi lemak, aromatic rice served with dishes. The stalls are typically run by middle-aged to senior hawkers.\n\nBut as younger hawkers join the business, there's been an increase in specialty stalls selling matcha, craft beer, baked goods, and fusion dishes.\n\nSuccess is an uphill battle, with a massive failure rate due to rising store rents and a frugal consumer base. In 2025, 3,074 food and beverage businesses in Singapore closed their doors, per statistics from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore.\n\nThis has not deterred hopeful entrepreneurs — 4,103 new food businesses opened last year.\n\nMost of the young chefs I interviewed work six to seven days a week, getting up well before the sun rises to prep ingredients for the day and retiring late into the night after feeding hungry dinner crowds.\n\nI spoke with eight Gen Z and millennial F&B owners across the country about what makes them tick, what fears give them chills at night, and if they regret choosing a risky career path.",

    "fullText": "Cosmos floated his quadcopter over the ruined warehouse, guiding it through a corner of the roof where shattered metal sheets had collapsed to form a hole.\n\nThe drone pilot's unit, the Wild Division, suspected that the building was a logistics hub for Russian soldiers, roughly 15 km, or about 9 miles, from the line of contact in southern Ukraine. These hidden locations often held ordnance or fuel stockpiles, and Cosmos' fiber-optic drone was armed with explosives to destroy them.\n\nYet inside, the drone rotated its camera to reveal what looked more like a farmer's garage: Four civilian cars, a pair of motorcycles, and two bridled horses.\n\n\"We had not expected to see this. It was unusual,\" Cosmos told Business Insider, speaking on condition that he be identified only by his call sign.\n\n\"We were expecting to find some armored vehicles,\" he added.\n\nVideo of the discovery went viral last week in Ukraine, as the war has increasingly seen Russian soldiers using unconventional transport tools, such as pack animals and bicycles, to conduct assaults or logistics missions. Cosmos said his drone mission was conducted in early February.\n\nThe smaller profile of a horse or civilian car might be harder for a drone to spot, though Russia's repeated use of them has also raised questions about the viability of its tactics and whether it's been producing enough military equipment to sustain its invasion.\n\nCosmos' squad mates and officers at the Wild Division, a first-person-view drone company in the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, had seen clips of Russian soldiers riding on horses to attack Ukrainian positions before.\n\nOne famous example they remember was in Zaporizhzhia, when a Ukrainian drone crew attacked Russian infantry crossing the front lines on horseback last month.\n\nCosmos, who's been piloting drones for a year, said it was the first time he'd personally seen the animals on the front lines.\n\nHe flew his explosive-laden drone straight into the back of one of the cars, and said his crew later struck several other vehicles inside. When Russian troops moved their transport assets, the Wild Division found the next warehouse and attacked that one, too, Cosmos said.\n\n\"The enemy usually lives in hiding close to these places,\" Cosmos said of the warehouse. \"It's common for us to check all targets. Sometimes we can see the enemy infantry, or you can see their vehicles.\"\n\nThe Wild Division declined to say where exactly the warehouse was located, but its brigade is generally deployed in the Donbas.\n\nThe commander of Cosmos' battalion told Business Insider that the discovery of the horses surprised him, too.\n\n\"I thought it had been a location for transport vehicles, sort of a transfer hub,\" said the major, whose call sign is Fizruk.\n\nFizruk said the appearance of horses and cars in his area of the front line could be a sign that Russian forces are running low on standard resources, but also reflects Moscow's attritional nature of fighting.\n\nThe cars discovered by Cosmos appear to be Nivas, inexpensive civilian off-road vehicles from the Russian Lada car brand.\n\n\"They treat these like they will be losses anyway, that they will be destroyed anyway,\" he said. \"Look, a Niva costs, let's say, $2,000. A Hummer, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine uses in many places, costs $20,000, maybe more.\"\n\n\"Since they lose their equipment in assaults, from that point of view, why pay $20,000 for one vehicle if you can buy 10 Nivas for $20,000?\" Fizruk added.\n\nThe Kremlin is known to pressure the front line with repeated ground assaults, sending small groups of infantry to approach Ukrainian positions on foot or in cheap vehicles. The strategy has been costly, with NATO now saying that up to 25,000 Russian troops are dying each month.\n\nSustaining that style of war has pushed Moscow to informal means of recruitment and weapons procurement, including hiring troops from overseas and receiving ammunition from North Korea.",

    "description": "Even though he realized right away, it took TK three years to quit what he thought was his dream career since college.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nic Huzz, 28, who quit a Sydney-based venture capital job to run a silent disco business in Bali, Indonesia. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was never one of those kids who knew what they wanted to be when they grew up.\n\nWhen I was six, we were asked to draw a picture of our future job. I stared at a blank page until I remembered a weekend trip to the mall with my mom, where I'd wandered into a game store and decided the owner must get to play with the toys all day. So I just drew that.\n\nThat uncertainty followed me even when I was 18. When it came time for university, I did what everyone told me to do: choose something broad, keep my options open. I studied communications and entrepreneurship, took on unpaid internships, and worked my way into the startup world. Eventually, I got a full time role at what I thought was my dream job: working at a venture capital firm in Sydney.\n\nOn paper, it was perfect. I was helping founders build companies. I had a title people respected.\n\nBut within a month of starting full time, I realized I wasn't happy. The job wasn't bad, and that was part of the problem. I'd spent years chasing it, and when I finally arrived, I felt empty. I began to understand that what I actually wanted wasn't the job itself, but the validation I thought came with it.\n\nMost days, I sat behind a desk from 9 to 5. The parts I loved — facilitating programs, traveling, working with founders — made up a small fraction of my week. I realized I had too much energy to sit still in an office for that long.\n\nThen, in 2020, lockdowns hit, and the job became even more soul-crushing because I didn't have the weekends to escape it all. Even though I figured out that I wasn't happy nearly right away, it took me more than three years to quit.\n\nI tried everything. For the first two years, I went on this massive journey where I learned how I could start designing a life that feels true for me. I spent around 42,000 Australian dollars, or $30,000, on more than 50 self-help coaches, programs, online learning courses, and books. You name it, I did it. I had all the mental models and frameworks in the world, but little about my reality changed.\n\nI began to realize that you don't rise to the level of your ambitions — you fall to the level of what feels safe. I was stuck because of fear: fear of judgment, failure, and not being good enough.\n\nIn the months before I quit, I challenged myself to do one thing every week that genuinely terrified me. At first, it was small — posting a vulnerable video online, dancing on my Instagram story, performing magic tricks for strangers in restaurants. Then it escalated to stand-up comedy and singing in public, with no background in either. Within five weeks of that challenge, I'd moved to Bali to work remotely for the firm.\n\nAbout three months after working from Bali in 2023, I got a text from my boss saying we were opening a new office in Sydney and that it was time for me to come back. I remember my body physically froze, and I told her I could not do it.\n\nShe told me she saw it coming and was actually proud of me for finally saying it and wanting to move on to do different things.\n\nI didn't have an alternate plan for months and was living off my savings. I went from earning 85,000 Australian dollars a year to earning nothing. For months, I lived on a few hundred dollars a week. Twice, my bank account dropped close to zero.\n\nAs part of my challenge, I had started bringing a couple of silent disco headphones to the beaches in Bali and Thailand and was asking strangers to join me as I danced. More and more people kept joining each time I did it, and a friend suggested I start taking donations. My imposter syndrome crept in, and I told them that I was just doing it for fun. I was so conditioned to associate work with suffering that it felt unfair to make money while having fun.\n\nI finally listened to my friends about the donations. At the fourth or fifth disco, I remember making more money in an hour than I did in a day at my corporate job. I started running silent disco sessions and was even asked if I could rent out my headsets to others.\n\nAt one point, a club owner asked if I could provide them with 300 headsets, and I had to go to the best bank in the world — the bank of mom and dad — for a loan to buy 250 more headsets. The loan was worth more than I had earned in the past 12 months, but it helped me eventually support major conferences in Bali, such as AWS, Amazon, and IBM.\n\nLast year, I made around 30,000 Australian dollars, which is a lot less than I made in Sydney. But I wake up excited every day and get to choose where I live and how I work.\n\nMy nervous system went through hell getting here, and I don't believe anyone should quit their job overnight. But I do think most of us stay stuck because we think safety comes from a salary. I've learned that it comes from trusting myself.",

This included pictures of children.\n\nThe commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, said in the release that it notified X of the investigation on Monday.\n\nX did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nGrok is a chatbot developed by Musk's xAI, now a subsidiary of his aerospace company SpaceX.\n\nThe commission's investigation follows several weeks of controversy around Grok and X. The platform came under fire worldwide in January after reports emerged of Grok users generating sexualized images of real people, including minors.\n\nCountries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines temporarily suspended access to Grok. The European Commission launched an investigation into Grok, while India's information technology ministry voiced its opposition via a letter to the chief compliance officer of X's India operations.\n\nCalifornia's Attorney General, Rob Bonta, also said in early January that he had launched a probe into Grok's AI deepfakes.\n\nIn response, X made Grok's AI image generation tool a premium feature limited to paying subscribers and later stopped it from generating sexualized images altogether. However, a Business Insider report found that it was still possible to trigger these images in Grok's web and mobile applications.\n\nIn response to backlash over Grok, Musk said in an X post on January 3, \"Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"",

    "description": "A hierarchy of simplicity for every layer of the stack. Flask over Django, HTML over React, bare server over Kubernetes, small models over the latest GPT. And when each one actually earns its complexity.",
    "fullText": "2026-02-14 · engineering, architecture, opinion, simplicity, ai\n\nThere's a mass delusion in software engineering that more tools equals more capability. That if Netflix uses Kubernetes, you should too. That if Facebook built React, your three-page marketing site needs it. That the \"modern stack\" is modern for a reason, and choosing anything simpler means you're behind.\n\nIt's nonsense. Most of the time, the simplest tool that solves your problem is the right tool. Not the most popular one. Not the one with the best conference talks. The one with the fewest moving parts.\n\nHere's how I think about technology choices, layer by layer.\n\nIf you're building an API, start with FastAPI or Flask. One file. A few routes. You can read the entire application in ten minutes. There's no ORM you didn't ask for, no admin panel you'll never use, no middleware stack you need to understand before you can return JSON.\n\nDjango is a different tool for a different problem. It's an application framework, not a microframework. It makes decisions for you: how your database models work, how authentication works, how your admin interface looks. If you're building a product with user accounts, permissions, a database-backed admin panel, and you have a team of five or more, Django saves you months. It's opinionated in ways that keep large teams from making inconsistent choices.\n\nThe mistake is reaching for Django when you need three endpoints and a database query. You'll spend more time learning what Django wants than building what you want.\n\nSpring is the same idea taken further. Enterprise teams, compliance requirements, complex service meshes. If you're at a bank with 200 engineers and a mandate to use Java, Spring is genuinely good at what it does. If you're two people building a SaaS, it'll bury you.\n\nThe rule: Pick the framework whose complexity matches your problem's complexity. If you can describe your backend in one sentence, you probably need a one-file framework.\n\nThis is where the industry has lost its mind the most.\n\nPlain HTML with some CSS works for an astonishing number of things. This site you're reading is static HTML. No JavaScript framework. No build step. No node_modules folder with 800 packages. I write Markdown, a Python script generates HTML, and Nginx serves it. It loads in under a second on any connection.\n\nWhen you need interactivity, HTMX is a revelation. It lets you add dynamic behavior by writing HTML attributes instead of JavaScript. Need a button that loads content without a page refresh? One attribute. Need a form that submits asynchronously? One attribute. You keep writing HTML and your server keeps rendering HTML. No JSON APIs, no client-side state management, no hydration bugs.\n\nSvelte sits in a similar sweet spot. It compiles to vanilla JavaScript. No virtual DOM. No runtime library. The output is small and fast. If you need more interactivity than HTMX gives you but don't want the overhead of a full SPA framework, Svelte is excellent.\n\nReact makes sense when you're building a genuinely complex, stateful application. Think Figma. Think Google Docs. Think Notion. Applications where the UI has hundreds of independent state changes, where components need to communicate across deep trees, where you need a component ecosystem because you're building something too large for one team to own entirely.\n\nThe problem is that people use React for everything. Landing pages. Blogs. Documentation sites. Marketing pages. I've seen teams spend three sprints setting up Next.js for a site that could have been twenty HTML files. The framework overhead, the build pipeline, the SSR complexity, the hydration issues. All of it unnecessary. All of it actively making the product worse by making it slower and harder to maintain.\n\nI run this site on a Raspberry Pi behind Nginx. The deploy script is 40 lines of bash. rsync copies files, Nginx serves them. If the Pi dies, I buy a new one for $50 and rsync again. Total infrastructure cost: about 5 watts of electricity. Twelve months in, it's still running.\n\nFor most small projects and early-stage products, a single server with systemd services is all you need. You SSH in. You know what's running. You can read the logs. When something breaks, you fix it directly. There's one machine, one set of logs, one reality to debug.\n\nDocker containers make sense when you need reproducible environments. When your app has dependencies that conflict with other things on the same machine. When you need to hand off a project and say \"run docker compose up and it works.\" When you're deploying the same service across staging and production and need them to be identical. Containers solve real problems.\n\nBut Docker adds a layer. Now you're debugging things inside a container that works differently than your local machine. Now your logs are in a different place. Now you need to understand volumes, networks, build caches. Every layer you add is a layer you need to understand when things go wrong.\n\nKubernetes makes sense at scale. When you have dozens of services, when you need automated scaling, when you need rolling deployments with zero downtime across multiple regions. When you have a platform team whose full-time job is managing infrastructure. Google built Kubernetes because Google has Google-sized problems.\n\nIf you're three engineers running a SaaS with a few thousand users, Kubernetes is not solving your problem. It's replacing your problem with a harder problem. You'll spend more time writing YAML manifests and debugging pod scheduling than building your product.\n\nI've watched startups with five engineers spend months setting up Kubernetes clusters. The CTO wanted it on the resume. The engineers wanted to learn it. The product needed a VPS and a Postgres database. They could have shipped in a week and scaled later. Instead they built infrastructure for a million users while they had twelve.\n\nSQLite is the most underrated database in existence. It's a single file. No server process. No connection management. No port configuration. It handles more concurrent reads than most apps will ever need. If your data fits on one machine and you don't need concurrent writes from multiple processes, SQLite is fast, reliable, and effectively zero maintenance.\n\nPostgres is the right choice for most production applications. It's battle-tested, well-documented, and handles basically everything. JSON columns, full-text search, geospatial queries, pub/sub. Before you reach for Redis, Elasticsearch, or any other specialized database, check if Postgres can already do what you need. It usually can.\n\nDistributed databases (CockroachDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) solve problems that 99% of applications don't have. If you need writes across multiple regions with single-digit millisecond latency, sure. If you need to handle millions of writes per second, sure. If you're building a CRUD app with a few thousand users, a single Postgres instance on a $20/month VPS will serve you for years.\n\nThis is the one closest to home because I build tools around this exact principle at NehmeAI Labs.\n\nThe default instinct right now is to throw the biggest frontier model at every problem. Summarization? Frontier model. Classification? Frontier model. Extracting a date from an email? Frontier model. It's the Kubernetes of AI: massively capable, massively overkill for most tasks.\n\nA 4B parameter model trained on a specific task will outperform a 400B general model on that task. Not sometimes. Reliably. FlashCheck is a 4B model that detects hallucinations in RAG pipelines. It scores 91.7% on RAGTruth. It beats Llama 405B on this specific task while using 100x less compute. Not because small models are magic, but because a focused model doesn't waste capacity on things it doesn't need to know.\n\nThe same logic applies to inference costs. Most teams routing everything through their most expensive model are sending simple prompts to a frontier model because they never measured whether a cheaper one could handle it. RightSize exists to answer exactly that question: it evaluates your real prompt traffic and finds where smaller, cheaper models are sufficient. Typical savings are 50-100x. Not because the quality drops. Because most prompts don't need the most powerful model available.\n\nThis maps directly to the philosophy of this entire post. Your inference costs are a design choice, not a fact of life. You don't start with the biggest model and optimize later. You start with the smallest model that works and scale up only where the task demands it.\n\nThe pattern is always the same. Start simple. Measure. Add complexity only where the data tells you to.\n\nI'm not arguing that simple is always right. I'm arguing that it's the right default. You should start simple and add complexity when you feel the pain, not before.\n\nHere's when you genuinely need the heavier tools:\n\nLarge teams. Django's opinions prevent 50 engineers from making 50 different architectural choices. React's component model lets teams work on the same frontend without stepping on each other. Kubernetes lets a platform team provide self-service infrastructure to dozens of product teams. The overhead pays for itself through coordination.\n\nCompliance and enterprise. Banks, healthcare, government. When you need audit trails, role-based access at every layer, and the ability to prove exactly what ran in production six months ago. Spring Boot's security stack and Kubernetes' declarative infrastructure make compliance audits possible at scale.\n\nGenuine scale. When your SQLite file would be terabytes. When your single server can't handle the traffic. When you actually have the users and the load that demand distributed systems. The key word is \"actually.\" Not \"projected.\" Not \"hoped for.\" Actually. And when you do migrate, be honest that it's a rewrite, not a simple upgrade.\n\nComplex client-side applications. If your users spend hours in your app doing complex, stateful work (design tools, collaborative editors, data dashboards), React or similar frameworks earn their complexity budget.\n\nEvery tool you add is a tool you need to:\n\nA three-person startup using Kubernetes, React, GraphQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Terraform has the operational complexity of a 50-person engineering org without the people to manage it. They'll spend 70% of their time on infrastructure and 30% on the product. That ratio should be inverted.\n\nThe best engineers I know aren't the ones who use the most tools. They're the ones who use the fewest tools that solve the problem. They resist the urge to optimize for problems they don't have. They ship with boring technology and save the interesting technology for when it's actually needed.\n\nSimple isn't a limitation. It's a discipline. And the debugging is a lot easier when there are fewer layers to dig through.",

    "fullText": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed an executive order on Monday, intending to speed up the permitting process within the state government.\n\nThe order mandates that any cabinet-level state agency, board, or commission review its permitting process within 120 days. Specific agencies mentioned in the Order include the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy and Environment, the Department of Labor and Licensing and the Department of Health.\n\nGov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders addresses Arkansas linemen ahead of winter storm\n\nWithin 180 days, the order continues, the same agencies must submit a written improvement plan to the governor that focuses on improving the current process. Where possible, agencies are expected to establish clear, publicly available timelines for all major permits and licenses, develop one-stop online application portals, expand concurrent reviews across agencies and provide applicants with real-time status updates and single points of contact.\n\n“Arkansas is one of the best states in the nation to start, build, and grow a business – but we have to do better to compete across the country and globe,” the governor said. “This Executive Order puts people before paperwork, adding transparency and speed to our permitting process to ensure major economic development projects aren’t held up by unnecessary red tape.”\n\nGov. Sanders announces measures to strengthen rural healthcare\n\nA text of the order is on the governor’s website.",

    "fullText": "PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) — A shooting during a Rhode Island youth hockey game left three people dead, including the shooter, and three more hospitalized Monday night in critical condition, authorities said.\n\nPawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters that someone helped bring a swift end to the violent scene Monday afternoon by intervening and trying to subdue the shooter, who was at an arena to watch a family member's hockey game. The shooter died from an apparent self-inflicted gun wound, she said, noting that authorities were still investigating.\n\n“It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,” she said.\n\nGoncalves identified the shooter as Robert Dorgan, who she said also went by the name Roberta Esposito and was born in 1969.\n\nThe police chief did not provide further details about the shooter or the victims, except for saying it appeared that both victims who died were adults.\n\nShe said investigators were trying to piece together what happened and have spoken with scores of witnesses who were there inside Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, a few miles outside Providence. They also were reviewing video taken from the hockey game. Unverified footage circulating on social media shows players diving for cover and fans fleeing their seats after popping sounds are heard.\n\nOutside the arena, tearful families and high school hockey players still in uniform were seen hugging before they boarded a bus to leave the area.\n\nMonday's shooting came nearly two months after Rhode Island was rocked by a gun violence tragedy at Brown University, where a gunman killed two students and wounded nine others. That shooter went on to also fatally shoot a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor. Authorities later found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a New Hampshire storage facility.\n\n“The fortunate thing is that the two incidents are not related, but it is very tragic,” Pawtucket Mayor Don Grebien said. “These are high school kids. They were doing an event, they were playing with their families watching, a fun time, and it turned into this.”\n\nPawtucket is nestled just north of Providence and right under the Massachusetts state border. A city of just under 80,000, Pawtucket had up until recently been known as the home to Hasbro’s headquarters.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the shooting occurred on Monday, not Tuesday.",

Quality stocks are those with strong and consistent cash flow and earnings, experienced management teams, and competitive advantages.\n\nIt may sound like an obvious place to be at all times, not just when things are volatile. But the factor has lagged the broader market over the last year and beyond as investors have piled into more speculative stocks.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan data, quality is in one of its worst stretches in almost two decades. Here's the performance of the MSCI World Quality Index relative to the MSCI World Index.\n\nHere's a year-by-year look at the performance. Quality stocks underperformed their counterparts by almost 5% in 2025.\n\nRough patches like this have, in the past, tended to bode well for future performance, the bank said.\n\n\"Periods of quality underperformance can be followed by sharp reversals,\" Meera Pandit, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a February 4 report.\n\nWhat's more, if the broader market were to plummet, investors are likely flock to the quality factor, the report said.\n\n\"The period from 2003 to 2008 provides a prime example. Higher-quality companies lagged broader developed markets for four consecutive years from 2003 to 2006, in the run-up to the global financial crisis,\" Pandit said. \"But as the cycle matured and the global economy eventually entered recession, higher-quality fundamentals returned to the fore, with quality stocks outperforming by 7 percentage points in both 2007 and 2008.\"\n\n\"Developed market stocks have seen nine drawdowns of 10% or more over the last 30 years,\" the report continued. \"During these periods, quality stocks have outperformed 78% of the time, with a median excess return of 3.4 percentage points.\"\n\nExamples of broader quality factor funds include the iShares MSCI Global Quality Factor ETF (AQLT) and the Vanguard US Quality Factor ETF (VFQY).\n\nBut for investors who do decide to lean into quality stocks, Pandit said to be conscious of those with a high weighting in AI stocks, as the theme could lead the next market drawdown.",

    "fullText": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had a run-in with Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week on the origins of America’s cowboy, leading to a broader conversation on the history of the West.\n\nWhile criticizing a recent speech, Ocasio-Cortez took issue with what she claimed was Rubio’s statement that America’s cowboys came from Spain.\n\n“My favorite part was when he said that American cowboys came from Spain,” she said in her criticism of Rubio’s speech. “And I believe the Mexicans and descendants of African enslaved peoples would like to have a word on that.”\n\nAOC mocks Rubio: \"My favorite part is he said cowboys are rooted in Spain. Uhhh, speak to Mexicans & African slaves!\"\n\nSpain introduced horses to Mexico pic.twitter.com/xHt1jZCoSi\n\n— End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) February 15, 2026\n\nThe comment quickly went viral, with experts weighing in on what is believed to have been a mix of origins for cowboy culture in America.\n\nThe History Channel reports that America’s cowboy culture stretches back further than America itself, to the era of Spanish colonialism.\n\n“Hundreds of years before there was the American cowboy, there was the vaquero,” it says, referring to expert horsemen who came after the Spaniards landed in 1519 in what is now Mexico.\n\nThe first vaqueros, it says, were “Indigenous Mesoamerican men who learned from their Spanish colonizers how to herd cattle on horseback.”\n\nIndependent historian Pablo A. Rangel, who has studied vaquero history extensively, says it is “a forgotten history of centuries of horsemanship in the Americas that roots the vaqueros in the colonial past.”\n\nThe word “vaquero” itself comes from “vaca,” which is the Spanish word for cow. As Spain extended its North American Empire into what are now Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California, the vaquero played a crucial role. The vaquero domesticated wild horses, braided ropes, constructed saddles, and learned to use a lasso expertly.\n\nMany cowboys’ traditions actually originated with the Spanish and Mexicans.\n\nThe word “lasso” itself comes from “lazo,” Spanish for “rope.” The early cowboys’ ropes were made of braided leather and horsehair. The vaquero’s rope skills are now an important part of rodeo competitions.\n\nThe chaps also originated from “chaparreras,” which protected gear from “chaparral,” a type of Southwestern brush.\n\nAs ranching expanded into what was then known as New Spain, the vaquero also functioned as an auxiliary force in regional battles. The vaquero played an important role at missions, especially in California.\n\nSeveral cultures contributed to the development of cowboy culture, which later spread to the United States.\n\nFollowing Texas’ independence from Mexico and subsequent admittance to the U.S. in 1845, Anglo settlers began to assume ranch duties. The Mexicans remained as skilled laborers on Texas ranches, training Anglo cowboys in horse and cattle skills.\n\nHistorians estimate that as many as one-fourth of all cowboys in the 19th century were black.\n\nPerformers such as Buffalo Bill Cody also incorporated Mexican vaqueros into their traveling Wild West shows, though in a rather romanticized, stereotypical fashion. The Hollywood Westerns of the early 20th century began to portray cowboys as heroic white Americans, rather than the multiracial groups that developed the practice.\n\n“That’s when the vaquero turns into something else,” Rangel told the History Channel. “He becomes this racialized, vilified character.”\n\nThe post AOC Schools Marco Rubio on Cowboys, Ends Up Needing a History Lesson Herself appeared first on Where Is The Buzz | Breaking News, Entertainment, Exclusive Interviews & More.",

    "description": "Although China launching a hypersonic missile towards America isn't that simple, it may still surprise you just how fast these weapons could reach the West.",
    "fullText": "Technological advancements are a double edged-sword. Telecommunication and fast transport through airplanes have made life much more convenient, and medical advancements have made conditions easier to treat. However, that same science is used to create weapons of mass destruction that can potentially leave everlasting stains on human history. A hypersonic missile is one of the scariest, being able to traverse the globe faster than sound.\n\nHypersonic missiles move at five times the speed of sound, meaning they can go over Mach 5 (3,836 miles per hour). Most commercial airplanes are slower than Mach 1, making such high speeds impossible to comprehend. China has a number of terrifying technologies at its disposal — such as its large aircraft carrier with a 100 drone capacity or high-powered drone-frying microwave – but even a simple missile is more than a significant threat. If China suddenly targeted U.S. soil, how fast would a hypersonic missile land, and would we even have enough time to intercept it?\n\nTo answer, we'd need to calculate wind turbulence, the angle of projection, the curvature of the earth, gravity, and additional factors that require a group of engineers. Fortunately, we don't need all that to get a good estimate. We can just use the formula for speed, distance, and time: Time = Distance/Speed. Generally, it can take anywhere from around an hour to less than 20 minutes, depending on certain factors.\n\nChina has many different weapons with varying speeds and distances. For this calculation, we'll use the DF-27A due to its high maneuverability and relatively fast speed –- though China has faster missiles around.\n\nWe can assume the missile originates from China's Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi which is 5,130 miles to Hawaii, 5,650 miles to Seattle, and 7,080 miles to New York. The DF-27A is said to reach average speeds of around Mach 8.6, which means it can cover 6,598 miles in an hour. Plugging these numbers into the formula, the missile would take 47 minutes to reach Hawaii, 51 to Seattle, and 64 to New York from mainland China.\n\nKeep in mind that these only account for a specific scenario, though. If China chose to target an island like Guam — just 2,676 miles away from Shanxi — the missile will reach in just 24 minutes. If China launches it from a coastal city like Fuzou — where the distance to Guam becomes just 1,864 miles — it'll only take 17 minutes for the missile to hit.\n\nEven if China could send a hypersonic missile at America out of the blue, our theoretical experiment isn't as simple as it seems. China is fully capable of attacking certain U.S. cities, but an Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) like the DF-27 simply isn't built for such distances. The missile could still hit Guam or other remote islands, but it can't travel further away in Central America.\n\nThis doesn't mean that China can't target Central American cities, though, just that a hypersonic missile like the DF-27 wouldn't be what they use. High-supersonic Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) like the DF-31, the DF-41, and the DF-5C can all travel much further, with DF-5C specifically having global access. The DF-27 is considered more of a threat because of its use of a Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV) that is significantly harder to predict the path of – something that might become even scarier with China getting access to better NVIDIA AI chips.\n\nA DF-5C nuclear warhead would take less than half the time to the American mainland as a DF-27. Resources estimate its speed at tens of Mach, with some claiming it can reach Mach 22. At Mach 22, it'll take 6 minutes to reach Guam, 19 minutes to Hawaii, 20 minutes to Seattle, and 25 minutes to New York. If you order pizza at the same time China presses launch, the missile will likely reach first.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

The accident triggered a grueling 17-hour ordeal, including a nine-hour technical rescue operation through some of the most challenging vertical terrain in the state.\n\nRescuers had to navigate the injured woman through narrow \"squeezes,\" including one measuring just 12 inches by 36 inches, as well as vertical pits ranging from 30 to 90 feet in depth. According to a statement from an official oversight member, the route involved a series of steep drops known as the \"Poltergeist Pit\" and \"Demon Drop\".\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol’s Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) team made contact with the cave researchers at 3 a.m. Sunday. BORSTAR agents provided fresh manpower and additional ropes, allowing the team to move the patient through the final vertical pits and a narrow squeeze without the time-consuming need to de-rig and reset rescue lines.\n\nThe researcher finally exited the cave at 4:45 a.m. and was taken across uneven terrain to a waiting AeroCare helicopter. She was airlifted to a hospital in Odessa, where she remains in the intensive care unit. Officials did not release her condition, but stated she was stable.\n\nThe massive effort included the Terrell County Sheriff’s Office, Texas Game Wardens and Texas DPS, Sanderson and Fort Stockton Fire Departments, Sanderson EMS, and National Cave Rescue Commission and San Antonio Technical Rescue.\n\nSorcerer’s Cave, located on private land in remote Terrell County, in the broader area of the Big Bend region, is noted for its record-setting depth of 567 feet and the \"Sirion River,\" a subterranean waterway flowing along the bottom. Experts note that while the cave is a site of significant scientific interest, its vertical layout makes it exceptionally dangerous for the inexperienced or the injured.\n\nInformation in this article is from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Terrell County Sheriff's Office and a statement from a person directly involved in the oversight of the caving operation.",

    "fullText": "Feb 16 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX and its wholly-owned subsidiary xAI are competing in a secret new Pentagon contest to ‌produce voice-controlled, autonomous drone swarming technology, Bloomberg News reported on ‌Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and the Pentagon's defense innovation unit ​did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not independently verify the report.\n\nTexas-based SpaceX recently acquired xAI in a deal that combined Musk's major space and defense contractor with the billionaire entrepreneur's artificial ‌intelligence startup. It occurred ahead ⁠of SpaceX's planned initial public offering this year.\n\nMusk's companies are reportedly among a select few chosen to participate ⁠in the $100 million prize challenge initiated in January, according to the Bloomberg report.\n\nThe six-month competition aims to produce advanced swarming technology that can translate ​voice ​commands into digital instructions and run ​multiple drones, the report said.\n\nMusk ‌was among a group of AI and robotics researchers who wrote an open letter in 2015 that advocated a global ban on \"offensive autonomous weapons,\" arguing against making \"new tools for killing people.\"\n\nThe U.S. Defense Secretary last year outlined a new strategy to accelerate drone development and deployment ‌by aiming to cut bureaucracy and boost ​domestic drone manufacturing.\n\nThe U.S. also has been ​seeking safe and cost-effective ​ways to neutralize drones, particularly around airports and large ‌sporting events - a concern that has ​become more urgent ​ahead of the FIFA World Cup and America250 anniversary celebrations this summer.\n\nOpenAI, Alphabet's Google, Anthropic and xAI last year won contracts ​that are worth ‌up to $200 million each and aimed at scaling up adoption ​of advanced AI capabilities in the Pentagon.",

    "description": "\"They expected me to teach her the job they said I wasn't good enough for.\"",
    "fullText": "A TikTok creator is going viral after refusing to train the 25-year-old coworker who was promoted over her, arguing that companies routinely exploit experienced workers while favoring younger and cheaper employees.\n\nThe creator, who goes by The Unobsolete (@theunobsolete), said her employer expected her to hand over decades of knowledge for free, despite passing her over for the role.\n\nIn the Feb. 10, 2026 video, she explained why she said no and the fallout that resulted from her decision.\n\n“They expected me to teach her the job they said I wasn’t good enough for,” The Unobsolete said.\n\nShe went on to say that if they wanted her 25 years of knowledge, they would have to pay her appropriately. Furthermore, she was not going to be passed up for someone younger, willing to work for a fraction of her salary, and then use her experience to train them.\n\n“I’m not your free training program,” she explained. “Want me to smile while you humiliate me? Wrong person.”\n\nThe creator received backlash from her company for her decision, but she told viewers that she didn’t care.\n\n“They said (I was) not supporting team. I said (the) team didn’t support me.”\n\nThe video concluded with some words of advice for navigating the corporate landscape: “The second you stop being useful, they stop pretending to care,” she said.\n\n“So stop pretending you owe them anything.”\n\nThe video immediately went viral, receiving nearly 4 million views and 400,000 likes. Most comments were in support of the creator, applauding her for setting boundaries and pushing back against age discrimination.\n\n“Can’t be a team player for a team that played you,” said one user. Another said, “Someone should tell corporate America that is illegal.”\n\nAnother simply wrote, “ageism is very alive and well.”\n\nOthers recounted their own workplace inequities. “They hired 6 people to replace me and the work I was doing & wanted me to train them.” One TikToker recounted. “Nope.”\n\n“My aunt sued the state of Ohio for the exact situation and she won her suit,” said another. “You did the right thing.”\n\nForbes reported that 99% of workers over the age of 40 reported ageism in the workplace. This included navigating ageist stereotypes, bullying, and feeling pressure to hide their age.\n\nAdditionally, according to the AARP 22% of workers over 50 years old say they are being pushed out of their job because of their age.\n\nA day after posting the TikTok, The Unobsolete posted an update to her situation, garnering over 2.3 million views.\n\nShe shared that she had a meeting discussing her “attitude.” While she didn’t get fired (which would be illegal), after the meeting, she began being excluded from company functions and given less work.\n\nAdditionally, her interactions were constantly being scrutinized. This was no surprise, as she was warned in the meeting that the company’s culture might not be a “good fit” for her.\n\n“I agree,” the Unobsolete said in the meeting. “A culture that exploits experience isn’t a fit for me.”\n\nThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.",

    "fullText": "Since the Nancy Guthrie case began, the Pima County Sheriff, Chris Nanos, has faced intense scrutiny from the public and experts alike. Now, he has shared news about the personal tragedy he has been dealing with throughout the investigation. The law enforcement official's brother died the day after Nancy was reported missing. That fact adds another heartbreaking layer to this profoundly tragic story.\n\nEven though the FBI has been involved in Nancy Guthrie's abduction case, the Pima County Sheriff, Chris Nanos, has been the public face of the investigation from day one. That is the case because he has repeatedly spoken to the press to provide updates and dispel rumors. While his interactions with the press have been focused on trying to get to the bottom of what has happened to Savannah Guthrie's mom, he recently briefly opened up about his own loss.\n\nDuring a February 2026 Daily Mail interview, he was telling the outlet about having thick skin amid the criticism he has received. In that context, Nanos shared that the day after Nancy was taken, his own brother, who was in hospice, passed away. Knowing that the man who has spent days fighting to return a mother to her family has recently lost his own sibling adds a poignant twist to this already devastating case.\n\nHigh-profile criminal cases like this one naturally draw heavy criticism from the interested public. That has definitely been the case for Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos and his team. Even the Daily Mail article that revealed the news about the Sheriff's brother dying featured a headline that called the Guthrie case's investigation \"shambolic.\" That is especially incredible since the report quoted Nanos asking the media to be more responsible.\n\nWhile speaking to the outlet, the Sheriff urged the online media conjecture about Tommaso Cioni to stop. \"People out there can get pretty ugly and mean and nasty and not have the facts,' he said. 'I tell my journalists, you guys need to be a little more responsible… because that's just really nasty stuff.\"\n\nAfter stressing that nobody has been ruled out in the investigation, Nanos pushed back on baseless online rumors about the Guthrie family members. \"I understand the pundits are out there. They're gonna say, well, he's the last one to see her alive. We understand that stuff. But, my goodness, you're putting a mark on somebody who could be completely innocent. And more important than that, he's family.\"\n\nHe also discussed observers who've criticized aspects of the investigation, like how quickly the police released the crime scene at Nancy Guthrie's home. Nanos explained that he was confident that his officers had thoroughly searched the scene for evidence. \"My officers were there for almost 20 hours, and they processed their scene, got it done, and brought in all the evidence,' he said. 'Then the FBI came and did their thing.\"\n\nNanos' defense of the investigation also centered on allegations that have been made about him personally. In response to reports claiming he'd blocked the FBI from gaining access to evidence, he completely disputed that. \"That's just so far-fetched. Why would I do that? It makes no sense.\"",

    "fullText": "A tractor-trailer drove off the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel on Sunday, killing the driver.\n\nRonnie Andrews, 61, of Robersonville, North Carolina, was identified as the driver. His body was recovered with the truck later Sunday.\n\nAt about 6:30 a.m., the tractor-trailer went overboard, just south of Fisherman’s Island after a single-vehicle crash near the North Channel Bridge.\n\nThe tractor-trailer was a Perdue Farms vehicle.\n\n“Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family, friends, and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,” a Perdue spokesperson said. “He had been a valued member of our team, and his loss will be deeply felt across our organization.”\n\nThe spokesperson said the company is fully cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues.\n\nAt 9:21 a.m., there was a wind advisory for the bridge-tunnel, meaning there were wind speeds of 35 mph. The speed limit was reduced to 45 mph on the bridge-tunnel with no passing allowed. In a statement sent Sunday evening, a spokesperson for the bridge-tunnel said weather was not a factor in the crash.\n\nThe crash caused guardrail and curb damage to the bridge-tunnel, and maintenance crews made emergency repairs. Traffic was stopped on the bridge while repairs were made. As of Sunday evening, a single lane of southbound traffic was open as crews completed repairs. A spokesperson advised that repairs could take several days.\n\n“The thoughts and prayers of everyone at the CBBT are with the family, loved ones and fellow employees of Mr. Andrews during this difficult time,” said Jeff Holland, Executive Director of the CBBT in a statement.\n\nThere is a very small margin of error for tractor-trailers on the bridge-tunnel, which is the only direct link between Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore and is used by travelers along the East Coast. The guardrails on the bridge are designed to withstand glancing blows from cars or pickup trucks going 62 mph or less.\n\nThe posted speed limit is 55 mph. These guardrails are not as strong as the concrete jersey barriers at the Hampton Roads and the Monitor-Merrimac bridge-tunnels.",

However, things are different for Colorado.\n\nInstead of needing to finalize one position, Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter explains the Rockies' need to finalize their entire infield situation minus shortstop.\n\n\"There's casting a wide net, and then there's whatever the Rockies are doing when it comes to building their 2026 infield. Ezequial Tovar is locked in at shortstop, but the other three spots are truly wide open. Edouard Julien figures to start somewhere on the right side of the infield, while Kyle Karros showed enough last year to get an extended look at the hot corner. Ryan Ritter has a 20/20 ceiling and veteran Willi Castro can plug in anywhere, though he's most valuable playing everywhere. With no shortage of options, this battle could rage on until Opening Day rosters are announced.\"\n\nColorado has a ton to figure out over the next few weeks, but things could be worse. It's better to have too many options than to have very few, if none at all.\n\nPirates' fans won't like seeing this Konnor Griffin roster prediction\n\nVeterans and a top prospect square off for the Cubs' fourth outfielder spot\n\nRangers head to camp with Kumar Rocker and Jacob Latz battling for the rotation\n\nA's still looking for their closer following the Mason Miller trade\n\nTravis Bazzana's WBC commitment may cost him an Opening Day roster spot",

So, entering spring training, Duran admits that last year was a disappointment, but it’s something he’s ready to move on from.\n\n“I’m always disappointed in myself,” Duran said on Monday. “I always feel like I don’t do the best that I can do. I feel like I let the fans down sometimes, or my teammates. But it’s a new year, so you just have to flush it and go out there and do my thing.”\n\nDuran is expected to mix between left field and the DH with Roman Anthony. He will also play right field in spring training, as he will play the position in the WBC.\n\n“Hopefully we can get him in games, playing that position, get him ready,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said.\n\n“If he’s going to play right field (in the WBC), he better be ready, because it’d be hard for me to be watching a game and then all of a sudden he gets hurt because he wasn’t prepared for that.”\n\nRegardless of his past season, Duran is excited to make an impact for the Red Sox and help Boston get back to the playoffs.\n\nTanner Houck Gets Positive Injury Update As Red Sox Camp Begins",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTeam USA is onto the knockout stages. After a perfect run through Group C, the Americans have officially secured their spot in the quarterfinals of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. By finishing as the No. 2 overall seed, just behind Canada, the U.S. has earned a critical first-round bye, allowing them to bypass the qualification playoffs and head straight into the final eight.\n\nThe preliminary round finale was a statement victory as Team USA dismantled Germany with a 5-1 win on Sunday. Captain Auston Matthews silenced early-tournament critics by exploding for two goals and an assist, leading an offensive onslaught that saw the Americans control the pace from the opening puck drop. Behind him, the physical presence of the Tkachuk brothers and a 23-save performance from goaltender Connor Hellebuyck proved that this roster is as balanced as it is star-studded.\n\nWhile the U.S. enjoyed a smooth path through the group stage -- outscoring opponents 16-5 over three games -- the competition is about to intensify. With the NHL back on the Olympic stage, the margin for error has vanished, and the Americans know that one off-night on Wednesday could end their quest for the first men's gold medal since the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice.\"\n\nThe road to the podium is clearly defined but fraught with peril. If the seeds hold, a potential collision course with arch-rival Canada looms in the gold medal game, a matchup that hockey fans have been salivating over since the NHL's participation was confirmed.

    "fullText": "DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the last person to leave the Toronto dugout after the Game 7 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series last fall because the star slugger wanted that to be the moment when he moved on.\n\nThe first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.\n\n“When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter. “Right then, I just turned the page.”\n\nThe Blue Jays lost the decisive game 5-4 in 11 innings, missing on a second consecutive chance to clinch the franchise's third championship at home. For manager John Schneider, this spring training is no different from a year ago.\n\n“The main message is we’re not defending anything,” Schneider said. “We’re not defending the AL East. We’re not defending the American League. We’re attacking 2026 like we did in 2025 or any year, really. You’re trying to win the division, you’re trying to win the World Series. That’s it.”\n\nGuerrero jolted the franchise at the start of the spring last year, when he said there was no deal on a new contract and that his own deadline for getting one done had passed, raising the specter of free agency in 2026.\n\nInstead, the sides settled on a $500 million, 14-year contract early last season, and the son of Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero went on to hit .292 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs.\n\nIn the postseason, Guerrero had a 1.289 OPS while hitting .397 with eight homers in 18 games and was MVP of the American League Championship Series. He didn't homer in any of his first three trips to the playoffs, and the Blue Jays lost all six of those games.\n\n“Going back to the postseason last year, I think it’s really cool for everyone to be on that heightened stage and to see how they responded,” Schneider said. “I think that kind of bleeds into this year, but (Guerrero) has been a little bit more vocal than I’ve ever seen him, a little bit more loose than I’ve ever seen him and understands that he’s one of the best players in the game.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Guerrero, a five-time All-Star, is now the longest-tenured Blue Jays player.\n\n“I don’t see myself as a leader,” Guerrero said. “I always put myself as a good teammate, and when you are a good teammate, then you become a good leader. I’m a good teammate.”\n\nHis role as the face of the franchise was cemented when Bo Bichette left the team, signing a $126 million, three-year with the New York Mets and moving from shortstop to third base.\n\n“It’s difficult not having him around,” said Guerrero, who played with Bichette through the minor leagues. “I mean, we played 10 years together. But at the same time, I understand it’s business, and he has to take care of his family as well.”\n\nThe Blue Jays signed Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto to fill the void left by Bichette while adding pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce.\n\n“I think we’re very capable,” Guerrero said. “I think it’s going to be more fun, and I’m actually more happy than last year.”\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "fullText": "Three-year NFL veteran and safety for the Cleveland Browns, Ronnie Hickman, was assaulted by a group of four individuals following a confrontation in the lobby of a Sixty Les hotel located on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York. The incident occurred at approximately 4:30 am after a group of individuals, who remain unidentified, approached Hickman shortly after he entered the building.\n\nAccording to the local authorities who originally spoke with the New York Post, police are actively investigating the matter, as well as whether or not Hickman’s status as a professional athlete had any influence in their decision to approach him. “The suspects slugged Hickman and took off,” the official report states.\n\nThe franchise itself confirmed that Hickman “was a victim of assault early Monday morning at a New York City hotel,” and a personal representative of the Ohio State product also informed the post that “Ronnie was treated for minor injuries at an area hospital after the incident, was later released, and is home resting with his family.”\n\nThe incident, unfortunately, comes right after Hickman had managed to enjoy a career-defining breakout. After recording just 70 total tackles with the Browns throughout all of 2023 and 2024, he managed to finally become a full-time starter in 2025.\n\nThe 2023 undrafted free agent tallied 103 combined tackles throughout his 17 starts this past season, snagging two interceptions and deflecting seven passes along the way. At this time, police have admitted that no arrests have been made and that all four of the primary suspects remain at large.\n\nStaff members who were on site at the time of the assault have also refused to offer up any sort of comments on the issue, but given the upscale nature of the establishment, it’s widely speculated that Hickman may have been profiled. The 24-year-old prospect is set to become a restricted free agent later this offseason, and will likely be resigning with the Browns for a “projected contract between $7 million to $8 million.”\n\nABC7 has suggested that Hickman was, in fact, identified by the four individuals, and that things only escalated after Hickman refused to acknowledge them, but that has yet to be confirmed by either official sources or any of the members in Hickman’s camp.\n\nThe post Cleveland Browns News: Ronnie Hickman Attacked by Goons in Sixty Les Hotel’s Lobby, No Arrests Yet appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Joey Logano has etched his name into the same book as NASCAR greats, with three Cup titles with Team Penske. However, his climb did not come on a smooth road. Some drivers hit bumps early and learn the ropes while the stakes stay low. Others, like Logano, taste success early and then get a wake-up call when they line up with the sport’s big boys.\n\nLoganolit up the record books in the lower ranks, earning the nickname “Sliced Bread” before he hit his teens. Barely a year after he started racing at six, he grabbed his first title at seven in 1997. From there, the trophies kept rolling in. He won the National Bandolero Bandits crown in 1999, the Young Lions National Championship in 2002, and the Pro National Championship in Legends, making him the youngest champion in that series. The wins kept stacking up in the K&N Pro Series East in 2007, ARCA, Late Models, and even the Xfinity Series in 2008.\n\nBut when he stepped into the Cup Series with Joe Gibbs Racing in 2009, that golden run hit a wall. Reflecting on that period ahead of the Daytona 500, Logano opened up about how it all happened.\n\n“It’s a tricky place for a young kid to grow up in, right, to have all that hype. It can affect you in a lot of different ways and, unfortunately, mainly bad ways,” the Team Penske driver said. on First Things First. “Because I think you start to drink your own Kool-Aid, if you will. You start to believe in all the hype, and you start to just think you’re that great. And you don’t go to work like you’re supposed to. Or you start to get a little arrogant. At some point reality gonna slap you in the face.”\n\n“When I got to the cup level, the NASCAR top level here, I got the slice of humble pie that I deserved. I went up against all the guys that were the phenoms, right, growing up. And I got my butt kicked for three years before I was able to get my head wrapped around things…”\n\n“If I’m being honest, I failed at that. I lost my job. I was at a point that I was like, well, ‘Uh-oh, what am I going to do the rest of my life? I’m 21 years old, and I don’t know if I’m going to make it.”\n\nBack then, his results left Joe Gibbs Racing scrambling to land sponsorship. When Roger Penske called Joe Gibbs and asked about Logano, acting on Brad Keselowski’s nudge, Gibbs asked for a week as they were trying to get sponsors for Logano. Without funding lined up, the options were thin for JGR. They would have either moved him back to Xfinity or released him.\n\nPenske stepped in and threw Logano a lifeline, and that move flipped the young driver’s career. The struggles, though, left their mark. That tough period taught Logano how to lose before he could learn how to win again. Each failure became a lesson, each misstep a brick in rebuilding belief.\n\nAnd he has stayed in that same camp ever since, and that turning point still echoes in how he carries himself. It taught him to punch the clock and keep grinding. To this day, Logano reminds himself not to coast, keeping that hunger alive and pushing to raise his game lap after lap.\n\nThe post Joey Logano Reveals Brutal Reality Check When He Lost His NASCAR Seat After Coming In As A Superstar appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Who will Canada play next in hockey? Explaining 2026 Olympic bracket opponent for quarterfinals originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a dominant run through Group A, Team Canada has officially secured its spot in the quarterfinals of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. By finishing as the No. 1 overall seed, Canada has earned a critical first-round bye, allowing them to bypass the qualification playoffs and head straight into the final eight.\n\nThe preliminary round finale was a sheer display of power as Team Canada dismantled France with a 10-2 win on Sunday. Captain Sidney Crosby made history by becoming Canada's all-time leading scorer in Olympic play featuring NHL players, while Connor McDavid took over the tournament scoring lead with a clinical performance. With a roster featuring Nathan MacKinnon, Macklin Celebrini and Cale Makar, the Canadians outscored their opponents 20-3 across three games, proving why they are the favorites to reclaim the gold.\n\nWhile Canada enjoyed a smooth path through the group stage, the intensity is about to ramp up significantly. With the NHL back on the Olympic stage for the first time since 2014, the margin for error has vanished, and the Canadians know that the single-elimination format on Wednesday leaves no room for a slow start. For a nation that views hockey as its heartbeat, Milan represents the first opportunity in over a decade to see their greatest generational stars compete for gold together.\n\nThe road to the podium is clearly defined. If the seeds hold, a potential collision course with Team USA looms in the gold medal game, a matchup that hockey fans have been salivating over since the NHL's participation was confirmed. For Sidney Crosby, who famously scored the \"Golden Goal\" in 2010, this tournament is about more than a medal—it's about leading a new era of Canadian excellence back to the top of the world.\n\nHere's who Team Canada plays next.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nThe men's preliminary round has concluded in Milan, and the bracket is now set for the knockout stages. Canada, the United States, Slovakia, and Finland have secured the top four seeds and will receive a bye directly to the quarterfinals.\n\nThe remaining eight teams will compete in a qualification playoff on Tuesday to determine who fills the final four spots in the quest for gold.\n\nThe following teams have earned a direct path to the quarterfinals on Wednesday:\n\nFinland (Best Second-Place Team)\n\nThe qualification playoffs occur on Tuesday.\n\nMORE: Day-by-day TV, streaming schedule for 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nCanada will play the winner of Denmark vs. Czechia.\n\nThe Canadians enter the quarterfinal as the No. 1 seed after going 3-0-0 to go on top of Group A. Because of goal differential, boosted by a 10-2 win over France, Canada clinched the top seed over Team USA, who also went undefeated in their group.\n\nCanada already faced Czechia in their opening game of the tournament, winning 5-0, but they must wait for the result of the Tuesday matchup to see if a rematch is on the horizon for Wednesday at 10:40 a.m. ET.\n\nBoth Czechia and Denmark lost twice in the preliminary rounds, and now, the winner of this game will face the Canadian juggernaut.\n\nMORE: Updated medal count at 2026 Olympics\n\nThe 2026 Olympic men's hockey tournament features 12 nations split into three groups of four for the opening round-robin phase.\n\nThe three group winners and the highest-ranked second-place finisher earn an automatic bye into the quarterfinals. The remaining eight teams are seeded 5th through 12th for a single-elimination qualification playoff, where the winners advance to join the top seeds in the final eight.\n\nTo ensure the most competitive matchups later in the tournament, the IIHF re-seeds the four semifinalists based on their original preliminary round rankings, pitting the highest remaining seed against the lowest for a spot in the gold medal game.\n\nMORE: USA men's hockey schedule\n\n(3) Slovakia vs. Germany/France winner\n\n(1) Canada vs. Czechia/Denmark winner\n\n(4) Finland vs. Switzerland/Italy winner\n\n(2) USA vs. Sweden/Latvia winner\n\nBronze Medal: Sweden vs. Switzerland\n\nBronze Medal Game (TBD vs. TBD)",

On Monday, he threw a baseball for the first time, which is a step in the right direction.\n\nAlthough Houck is already throwing, he said the goal is to return in September for a playoff push.\n\n“My whole goal is to be back in September,” Houck said on Monday, via The Athletic. “I set that goal basically the day after the surgery. I wanted to do it smart and the right way. …\n\n“I can have my goal, but if God has a different plan, then I might have to readjust as things ramp up with throwing and see how the body recovers.”\n\nIf Houck can return in September, he can provide the Red Sox with some depth to the rotation and potentially into the playoffs.\n\nHouck is coming off a disappointing 2025 season, as before the injury, he struggled. The right-hander went 0-3 with an 8.04 ERA in nine starts.\n\nHowever, he was solid in 2024 as the right-hander went 9-10 with a 3.12 ERA in 30 starts and was named an All-Star.

    "fullText": "GLENDALE – Before the 2025 season, the Arizona Cardinals made an announcement about building a new performance center, and after the season, they have provided more details. The franchise will be looking to build the practice facility in Scottsdale and increase the size from the previous performance center by tenfold. The team will hold a groundbreaking event on February, 19th with the City of Phoenix and Arizona Commerce Authority on-site.\n\nOct 29, 2023; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill looks on against the Baltimore Ravens during the second half at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\n“Last September, the Cardinals announced the updated plans and location for the team’s new performance center in North Phoenix, located west of Scottsdale Road and north of the Loop 101. The targeted opening for the new performance center and team headquarters is 2028.\n\n“The 217-acre property was purchased at auction from the Arizona State Land Department for $136 million by an affiliate of the team. The new performance center and business operations will anchor the mixed-use development site, occupying 30 acres and over 250,000 square feet. The footprint of the team’s current facility is 14 acres and 156,000 square feet.\n\n“It will feature three natural-grass outdoor practice fields and a fieldhouse with a full-size turf field indoors. Additional elements of the new, world-class performance center will include a greatly expanded and modern locker room and state-of-the-art team spaces for athletic training, sports medicine and strength and conditioning in addition to updated dining areas, meeting rooms, a player lounge and more.”\n\nDec 28, 2024; Inglewood, California, USA; Arizona owner Bidwill reacts during the game against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nArizona’s Tempe training facility was constructed in 1990, before opening a year later. The franchise had just moved to the Valley a few years earlier from St. Louis and began building roots. For the past 35 years, despite some renovations, the practice building has largely remained the same, but changes are coming.\n\nThe new facility is big news following the team being ranked last in all the NFL in the NFLPA’s report cards. Owner Michael Bidwill is obviously trying to turn that perception around for his new head coach Michael Bidwill, as the duo heads towards the future.\n\nThe 3-14 season doesn’t truly matter. The Las Vegas Raiders have a complete failure of a year, but it’s clear the ownership is committed to the player’s with the high-tech Allegiant Stadium. If the owner, like Bidwill, is investing in the future, it goes a long way of building hope across the Valley.\n\nCardinals part of 11-team grievance against 2025 NFLPA report cards",

Instead, he focused on what sports can represent at a broader level.\n\nAfter watching the NBA All-Star Game and Team USA compete at the Winter Olympics, Obama posted a message about the impact of sports.\n\nHe tweeted: “Watching the NBA All-Star game and Team USA at the Winter Olympics, it’s clear that sports — just like music and art — still have the power to bring us together, build community, and remind us of our common humanity.”\n\nObama compared sports to music and art, suggesting they share a unique ability to connect people across different backgrounds.\n\nHis message centered on unity and shared experience rather than competition.\n\nAll-Star weekend, which features players from across the league and around the world, provided a fitting backdrop for that reflection.\n\nMichelle Obama also posted on social media after attending the game with Barack.\n\n“My favorite teammates on and off the court,” she wrote.\n\nHer caption accompanied a photo of the couple courtside at the Intuit Dome, adding a lighthearted note to the evening.\n\nThe post quickly drew attention from fans, many of whom enjoyed seeing the former president and first lady taking in the event together.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron jokes as Victor Wembanyama takes center stage at NBA All-Star Game\n\n‘Who is that?’ – Anthony Edwards’ Cristiano Ronaldo moment at NBA All-Star Game goes viral\n\nMetta Sandiford-Artest claims he can’t travel to Australia due to 2004 Malice at the Palace incident",

    "fullText": "The 2026 Hana Bank K League 1 season marks Daejeon Hana Citizen's fourth year back in the top flight. But what's different about this season is that the Purples are aiming to challenge for a first-ever top division title.\n\nDaejeon Hana Citizen recorded their best-ever finish to a K League 1 season last year, finishing as runners-up. The Purples were helped by being attack-minded with a forward line led by Joo Min-kyu, whose 14 goals were the team's highest. Daejeon scored 58 times, the third-highest total, from an xG of 54.7 (6th), by having one of the best shot conversion rates in the division, second only to Jeonbuk. Their tactical approach centred on winning the ball back quickly and supplying wide players with pace who could hurt teams on the counterattack.\n\nDaejeon were also sensible in the transfer market, moving to replace the injured Victor Bobsin - a key player in their system - with as good a like-for-like replacement domestically as there could be in Kim Bong-soo, and added attacking impetus with wide players Joao Victor and Hernandes Rodriques.\n\nDaejeon were consistent and were able to put together unbeaten runs of six or seven games at certain points in the campaign. Hwang Sun-hong's men were, more or less, just as dangerous at home as they were away, earning 10 home wins and eight on the road with four losses at Purple Arena and five away from it. They led the league in the earlier part of the campaign, but their undoing was a poor record against eventual champions Jeonbuk, picking up just one point from the four league meetings all season.\n\n[READ: Daejeon Hana Citizen 2025 Season Review]\n\nDaejeon have taken a quality over quantity approach to the winter transfer window, adding players with title-winning pedigree. Wing duo Gustav Ludwigson and Um Won-sang arrive from Ulsan HD, while powerful Brazilian striker Diogo Oliveira will provide competition for Joo Min-kyu in attack. Cho Seong-gwon, who has worked under Hwang Sun-hong with the U23 national team, signs to provide competition for the right centre back spot. The club have also signed Joao Victor and Ha Chang-rae on permanent deals, having spent the 2025 season on loan.\n\n[READ: Daejeon's winter recruits and where they might fit in]\n\nEven at 35, soon to be 36, Joo Min-kyu is still lethal in front of goal. He is also a very clever player with excellent vision to feed teammates and help start (and sometimes finish) counterattacks from deep. Not only will he most likely be Daejeon's top scorer again, but he has a lot of experience in winning teams and in the AFC Champions League. The phrase \"winning mentality\" gets used a lot, but Joo brings that to Daejeon and as skipper, his influence will be felt even \n\nThe U22 rule is no more in K League 1, not in the same way it was at least. Instead, teams will need to have two U22 players on the bench if they are to have a full nine-man bench. Daejeon don't have too many U22 players left, having sent Kim Han-seo and Lee Jun-gyu out on loan to Yongin FC and Gimhae FC 2008, respectively, and Kim Hyeon-oh to Gyeongnam. It means that Daejeon are gonig to have to pluck some kids out of the academy to make a full bench, or just have two substitutes fewer than they're permitted to.\n\nAre Daejeon really title contenders?\n\nDaejeon have not been shy in saying that the aim is to challenge for the title this season. They finished second last year, but once Jeonbuk leapfrogged them into top spot, the Purples never looked like returning to the K League 1 summit. Recruitment has been good, but the club have also lost influential coach Yoshida Tatsuma so there'll be question marks as to whether the magic is still there from the last 18 months.\n\nJeonbuk and Ulsan have dominated K League for the last 12 years, mostly the former, leading to calls for other teams to step up, for owners to invest, and to try to break the duopoly. Daejeon are showing what can be done if an owner invests heavily in a football club. The club is ambitious but the owners want to see a return on their investment. The 2026 season will be a good test to see if Daejeon can repay them with some silverware.",

    "title": "Nimslo stereo camera",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Nimslo is a stereo camera with a brightfield viewfinder that produces 3D pictures that can be viewed without glasses. This is done using lenticular printing. It uses common 35 mm film in 135 film format cartridges. It was produced in the 1980s by Nimstec of Atlanta, and manufactured by Timex in Dundee, Scotland.[1]\n\nThe Nimslo had fixed focus and automatic exposure. It featured a leathered metal body and glass lenses. Using its four lenses, four images from slightly different viewing angles were taken simultaneously. With the individual images half the size of the usual 35mm image frames, each 3D photograph taken used the space of 2 full 35mm exposures on the film. So a roll labeled as \"36 exposures\" would yield 18 3D pictures with four images each.\n\nThe Nimslo was the first consumer level three-dimensional lenticular camera of the 1980s. There were previous lenticular cameras aimed at amateurs, such as the six-lens Lentic, introduced in 1953, which used 120 roll film,[2] but the Nimslo was probably the first to use 35mm film, and certainly the first that could fit in a pocket.\n\nThe camera used a red LED to put a green dot on the negative. This was how the printer knew where a group of four negatives started. This dot appeared in the otherwise blank area above the image so it didn't appear in the printed frame. This feature appears to be unique to the NimsLo. Allen Kwok Wah Lo is known for his work in 3D display technologies. He is believed to operate his current Companies in Hong Kong, as CEO of U.S. Technology Ltd. and 3DV Co., Ltd. As to his past involvement with 3D, Allen Lo was President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of ITII (Image Technologies International, Inc.) and President and Director of 3DIT (3D Image Technologies Company) in 1997, when an action was tried against him and them in Atlanta Federal District Court. The action alleged Lo and his Companies induced ND3D B.V. (“ND3D”) to enter into an acquisition agreement and then commercially exploited ND3D, leaving it a company without assets. Despite advising the industry and former clients and contacts of ND3D that ND3D has been absorbed by Defendant Image Technology International, Inc. (\"ITII\"), despite enticing ND3D’s principal, Andrew Joel (“Joel”), to leave ND3D as its Director to come work for ITII, and despite utilizing Joel’s know-how and contacts and ND3D’s assets, Defendants refused to pay one cent to ND3D. In a June 6, 1995 letter from Lo to Joel, after ITII's evaluation of ND3D's assets, Lo proposed a fixed number of shares that ITII and 3DIT would provide to ND3D in exchange for all of the assets and goodwill of ND3D. The parties formalized their effort to have ITII acquire ND3D by executing on June 21, 1995, an Acquisition and Cooperation Agreement. The parties attempted to settle their disputes in February 1997, prior to the initiation of litigation. After two days of fruitless negotiations, ITII served Joel and Marc Wolters (the Netherland District Court trustee in bankruptcy for EGN) with complaints in a lawsuit that had been previously filed in Gwinnett Superior Court (unbeknownst to Joel, Wolters, and their counsel). That case has been dismissed on summary judgment, leaving only Joel’s claims against ITII, 3DIT and Lo in that case. Judgment was granted in favor of ND3D and Joel for $1,000,000.00 plus costs and attorneys fees in the United States District Court case, ND3D B.V. v. IMAGE TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL, INC., ET AL. in the Northern District of Georgia, before Judge Owen Forrester (not reported).Other lenticular cameras don't have it and other lenticular printers don't use it.\n\nThe Nimslo was originally built in a Timex factory in Dundee, Scotland. A massive strike in Dundee, as the U.S. rollout was gaining strong momentum, caused Nimslo to miss the delivery dates on all cameras sold. This led to the cancellation of the Timex contract.[3][4] Later cameras were built by Sunpak in Japan.\n\nNimslo and its lenticular printer were invented by Jerry Curtis Nims from Georgia, USA, and Allen Kwok Wah Lo. Jerry Nims received one of the ten outstanding engineering achievements in the United States for the Nimslo Three-Dimensional Photographic System at the 17th Annual Competition of the National Society of Professional Engineers in 1983.\n\nLenticular prints would be ordered from special print shops using dedicated printers.\nThe pictures produced by the Nimslo camera create a three-dimensional image that can be seen with the naked eye. This 3D image is made possible by the lenticular printing process that was customized by the Nimslo inventors, though professional lenticular prints had been around for a while.\n\nThe technology was protected by US patents.\n\nThe shares of the Nimstec were bought by Eagleville Company in October 1980, controlled by the Ptarmigan Trust that at the same time gained control over Timex Corporation. The operation was controlled by billionaire Fredrik Olsen, head of the Fred. Olsen & Co. shipping company. Olsen was a technological and industrial visionary and believed strongly in the Nimslo product. He wanted the Timex factory in Dundee in Scotland to produce the cameras, as they had already produced cameras for Polaroid. He established a guarantee of US$25 million for the acquisition of the Nimslo shares.[5][6] Nimslo was taken publicly on the Unlisted Securities Market (USM) London by Baring Brothers and Carr, Sebag.[7][8] Later, as an American depository receipt (ADR), Nimslo was the number one selling stock on the NASDAQ until the strike in Dundee stopped deliveries. Later still, Nimslo was public on the Bermuda Exchange, including substantial oil interests which had been added by Fred Olsen. Soon thereafter, Nimslo was privatized.\n\nThe original Nimslo photographic printer (the Mark 1S) was controlled by a KIM-1 processor. The operator had to view the actual images to align the images. The time to create a picture was measured in minutes. The second photographic printer was the Mark 1A. This printer was controlled by a Data General MicroNova processor, using the MP/OS operating system. This machine used a video system and was able to create a picture in about 15 seconds.\n\nNimslo prints are created by printing the four images through the lenticular print material, each at a different angle, to a photosensitive emulsion on the back of the lenticular material. The print material is then processed in a normal photofinishing machine, as the back of the print material is permeable to the photofinishing chemicals.\n\nAlthough the idea of a consumer level camera that could make lenticular 3D prints similar to those that had appeared for many years on book covers and other novelty items certainly had appeal, it did not receive a large market share of camera purchases, partially due to the high costs of processing and longer wait times than traditional cameras. In the summer of 1982, Nimslo was the fastest selling 35mm camera in the U.S., including being on the cover of the Sears catalog.\n\nDuring the height of its meteoric rise, Nimslo had sought to acquire Berkey Industries (NYSE-BKY), of which it had obtained sixteen percent.[9] Instead, after the strike, its plans to acquire Berkey were abandoned.[3] Berkey issued its LOI to acquire the photo finishing labs of Nimslo International Ltd., for common stock, which would have raised the Nimslo holdings of Berkey from 16 to 45 percent.[10] However, this transaction was never consummated.\n\nAfter the Dundee strike, the sales team, led by former top Polaroid executive, Corvin Cianci, could not regain the top position with the replacement camera manufactured in Japan by Sunpak Company.[1]\n\nNimslo Corp was partly sold to Nishika, a Nevada company that acquired the Nimslo patents, and continued the Nimslo as \"Nishika 3-D N8000\". In April 1989,[11] Nishika introduced the four lens Nishika N8000 and later the four lens N9000. The N8000 featured a plastic body with plastic lenses, a fixed 1/60 shutter speed and a three-position manual aperture lever that selected f8, f11 or f19.[12][13] The N9000 was a more compact, sleeker version but was essentially the same camera, except with 2 aperture settings, f8 and f16, instead of 3. Part of the marketing effort included a promotional/instructional video starring Vincent Price.[14] Nishika also offered a companion flash, similar to the Nimslo Optilite but much bulkier and with just one contact plus ground. They also offered a number of other accessories including a \"professional\" strap, Nishika Tripod, a Nishika deluxe camera case, a lens cleaning kit and even a line of Nishika brand color print film, marked with both regular and 3D exposures, though the advertising stressed that it could use any ASA 100 color print film.[citation needed]\n\nNishika also, of course, offered a lenticular processing service.\n\nThe flash contact sits atop a small platform which resembles the Pentaprism found on an SLR. The camera is much larger than it needs to be, a lead weight was included to make it heavier, there is a plastic panel on top designed to look like an LCD readout and the two AA batteries serve no function except to power the \"light meter\" which merely indicates whether or not flash should be used. The \"use flash\" indicator is not coupled to the aperture lever and is thus valid only when f8 (cloudy/indoors) is selected and when ASA 100 film is used.[13] Also, the hot shoe has three contacts (in addition to ground), but two simply sit on top of the plastic with no internal connection. The companion flash has only a single contact in addition to ground.[13]\n\nNishika was the number one selling direct sales product until bad color emulsions from 3M caused the 3D snapshots to fade. As a result, Nishika sued 3M.[15]\n\nAttempting to recover, Nishika used misleading[13] and even illegal tactics to market the camera, including an infamous fraudulent prize promotion scheme, which is usually blamed for the company's demise.[16]\n\nStarks claimed that Nishika also made a three-lens camera, but there is no evidence that such a camera ever existed outside his article.[6] It is interesting that some of the Nishika \"dealers\" claimed that the Nimslo had only 3 lenses.[13]\n\nThe confusion on the part of Michael Starks may stem from the introduction about a year later of the 3 lens Trilogy, which sported a built in electronic flash and motorized film advance, and was originally marketed through a system very similar to the multilevel scheme used by Nishika.[17] The same camera was later renamed to Image Tech 3D 1000 and marketed through more traditional channels.[18]\n\nSeveral other three-lens cameras were released, such as the 3D wizard, 3D magic, 'DFX, and Kalimar, some of which sported more modern features such as built-in electronic flash and motorized film advance, but lacked the auto-exposure features of the Nimslo. The 3D trio featured 3 element coated glass lenses, built in flash, motorized film advance, automatic exposure control, compatibility with DX coded ASA 100, 200 and 400 film, and a built in protective lens cover, making it the closest three-lens equivalent to the Nimslo.[19] These 3 lens cameras gave more pictures per roll of film, 16 [20] for 24 exposure roll rather than the 12[21] yielded by Nimslo/Nishika and had less ghosting, but also less depth.[18] There were other four-lens Nimslo clones as well, such as the 3DNext and the Rittai.[22] Like the Nishika, several of these were marketed through multilevel schemes, often in Asian countries, occasionally being the basis of a scam.[6]\n\nIn 2005 the Canadian firm Snap 3D began selling several two-lens and five-lens lenticular cameras made by US technology Ltd in Hong Kong. The five-lens cameras were particularly odd producing five images that were 29.94 mm high and from 24.75 to 26.33 mm wide, all five images having a different width. These were deluxe cameras, featuring glass lenses, adjustable focus with rangefinder, adjustable shutter speeds 1/125, 1/60, 1/30 sec. and \"B\", continuously adjustable aperture from f/5.6 to f22 and a spirit level. They also had automatic film loading and motorized film advance.[23] Indeed, these cameras were so far removed from the Nimslo, that it might be stretching things to call them Nimslo clones. Snap 3D no longer sells these cameras and as of May 2012, no longer does lenticular printing due to failure of their machine.[24]\n\nDespite the fact that Nimslo cameras are no longer produced, one can still obtain a Nimslo through various internet auction sites.[25] In fact, the Nimslo maintains a loyal following among photography buffs. In most recent years, renewed interest in the 1981 Nimslo camera has created a growing online after-market for both the analog camera itself and Nimslo camera prints.[26] This includes a large number of GIF images created using the Nimslo camera, which have proliferated for viewing online.[27]\n\nAs of May 2012, there are no known labs that can make lenticular prints from film.\n\nIn a somewhat \"retro\" development, many stereo photography buffs used the Nimslo to take stereo slides which were mounted in \"4P\" (half frame) slide mounts. This was done by using either slip in cardboard mounts, some specially labeled with the Nimslo name or aluminum masks such as the Realist \"closeup\" mask. These masks were sometimes put in metal frames and placed between glass, much like Realist format slides. The resulting stereo slides could then be viewed using conventional Realist format viewers or even projected with stereo projectors.\n\nThe dot that was green on negatives was red on slide film and so stereo hobbyists could tell which chip was the left frame after\ncutting the film by looking for the red dot. Because many slide mounts were designed for an image frame taller than the Nimslo frame this red dot was sometimes visible in the picture.\n\nThe glass lenses and automatic exposure control of the Nimslo made it well suited for this purpose, unlike similar cameras such as the Nishika that typically sported plastic lenses and limited adjustability, relying on the latitude of the print film to give good results under varied lighting conditions.\n\nOthers used the Nimslo to produce half frame prints that could be used to make stereo cards which could be viewed in conventional stereoscopes.\n\nSince only the two outer images of the four images formed by each snap were mounted, using an unmodified Nimslo to produce stereo pairs results in wasted film. Making prints is even more costly since half of them will be thrown away. The problem of paying for twice as many prints could be solved by covering the two center lenses, but that doesn't solve the problem of film wastage. This spurred some enterprising individuals to come up with modifications.\n\nTechnical Enterprises came out with the Teco-Nimslo which exposed two images at a time and modified the film advance so that there was no film wastage. This produced 24 half-frame pairs on a 24-exposure roll. The result was an ideal camera for those satisfied with half-frame format slides.\n\nDavid Burder came up with more radical modifications. One, the original Burdlo, featured a modified lens board with two lenses but essentially the same film advance to take full-frame stereo pictures. The stereo base was greatly reduced to only 36mm, adequate for closeup work.[28] Other cameras also going by the name Burdlo included multiple Nimslos joined together to make 12 lens and 24 lens lenticular cameras. None of these were as popular as the Teco-Nimslo but pictures of them are easy enough to find on the web[29] and have occasionally been the subject of blog entries.[30]\n\nOthers have modified the Nimslo to make a wide format camera, or have found other non 3D uses, with or without modification.[31]",

    "description": "Detectives desperate to locate a 12-year-old, seen abused online, found a surprising lead.",
    "fullText": "Warning: This article contains details about sexual abuse\n\nSpecialist online investigator Greg Squire had hit a dead end in his efforts to rescue an abused girl his team had named Lucy.\n\nDisturbing images of her were being shared on the dark web - an encrypted corner of the internet only accessible using special software designed to make owners digitally untraceable.\n\nBut even with that level of subterfuge, the abuser was conscious of \"covering their tracks\", cropping or altering any identifying features, says Squire. It was impossible to work out who, or where, Lucy was.\n\nWhat he was soon to discover was that the clue to the 12-year-old's location was hidden in plain sight.\n\nSquire works for US Department of Homeland Security Investigations in an elite unit which attempts to identify children appearing in sexual abuse material.\n\nA BBC World Service team has spent five years filming with Squire, and other investigative units in Portugal, Brazil, and Russia - showing them solving cases such as that of a kidnapped and presumed-dead seven-year-old in Russia, and the arrest of a Brazilian man responsible for five of the biggest child-abuse forums on the dark web.\n\nThe unprecedented access shows how these cases are often cracked, not through state-of-the-art technology, but by spotting tiny revealing details in images or chat forums.\n\nSquire cites Lucy's case, which he tackled early in his career, as the inspiration for his long-term dedication.\n\nHe found it especially disturbing that Lucy was about the same age as his own daughter, and new photos of her being assaulted, seemingly in her bedroom, were constantly appearing.\n\nSquire and his team could see, from the type of light sockets and electrical outlets visible in the images, that Lucy was in North America. But that was about it.\n\nThey contacted Facebook, which at the time dominated the social media landscape, asking for help scouring uploaded family photos - to see if Lucy was in any of them. But Facebook, despite having facial recognition technology, said it \"did not have the tools\" to help.\n\nSo Squire and his colleagues analysed everything they could see in Lucy's room: the bedspread, her outfits, her stuffed toys. Looking for any element which might help.\n\nAnd then they had a minor breakthrough. The team discovered that a sofa seen in some of the images was only sold regionally, not nationally, and therefore had a more limited customer base.\n\nBut that still amounted to about 40,000 people.\n\n\"At that point in the investigation, we're [still] looking at 29 states here in the US. I mean, you're talking about tens of thousands of addresses, and that's a very, very daunting task,\" says Squire.\n\nThe team looked for more clues. And that is when they realised something as mundane as the exposed brick wall in Lucy's bedroom could give them a lead.\n\n\"So, I started just Googling bricks and it wasn't too many searches [before] I found the Brick Industry Association,\" says Squire.\n\n\"And the woman on the phone was awesome. She was like, 'how can the brick industry help?'\"\n\nShe offered to share the photo with brick experts all over the country. The response was almost immediate, he says.\n\nOne of the people who got in touch was John Harp, who had been working in brick sales since 1981.\n\n\"I noticed that the brick was a very pink-cast brick, and it had a little bit of a charcoal overlay on it. It was a modular eight-inch brick and it was square-edged,\" he says. \"When I saw that, I knew exactly what the brick was,\" he adds.\n\nIt was, he told Squire, a \"Flaming Alamo\".\n\n\"[Our company] made that brick from the late 60s through about the middle part of the 80s, and I had sold millions of bricks from that plant.\"\n\nInitially Squire was ecstatic, expecting they could access a digitised customer list. But Harp broke the news that the sales records were just a \"pile of notes\" that went back decades.\n\nHe did however reveal a key detail about bricks, Squire says.\n\n\"He goes: 'Bricks are heavy.' And he said: 'So heavy bricks don't go very far.'\"\n\nThis changed everything. The team returned to the sofa customer list and narrowed that down to just those clients who lived within a 100-mile radius of Harp's brick factory in the US' south-west.\n\nFrom that list of 40 or 50 people, it was easy to find and trawl their social media. And that is when they found a photo of Lucy on Facebook with an adult who looked as though she was close to the girl - possibly a relative.\n\nThey worked out the woman's address, and then used that to find out every other address connected with that person, and all the people they had ever lived with.\n\nThat narrowed Lucy's possible address down further - but they didn't want to go door to door, making enquiries. Get the address wrong, and they could risk the suspect being tipped off that he was on the authorities' radar.\n\nSo Squire and his colleagues began sending photos of these houses to John Harp, the brick expert.\n\nFlaming Alamos were not visible on the outside of any of the homes, because the properties were clad in other materials. But the team asked Harp to assess - by looking at their style and exterior - if these properties were likely to have been built during a period when Flaming Alamos had been on sale.\n\n\"We would basically take a screenshot of that house or residence and shoot it over to John and say 'would this house have these bricks inside?'\" says Squire.\n\nFinally they had a breakthrough. They found an address that Harp believed was likely to feature a Flaming Alamo brick wall, and was on the sofa customer-base list.\n\n\"So we narrowed it down to [this] one address… and started the process of confirming who was living there through state records, driver's licence… information on schools,\" says Squire.\n\nThe team realised that in the household with Lucy was her mother's boyfriend - a convicted sex offender.\n\nWithin hours, local Homeland Security agents had arrested the offender, who had been raping Lucy for six years. He was subsequently sentenced to more than 70 years in jail.\n\nBrick expert Harp was delighted to hear Lucy was safe, especially given his own experiences as a long-term foster parent.\n\n\"We've had over 150 different children in our home. We've adopted three. So, doing that over those years, we have a lot of children in our home that were [previously] abused,\" he said.\n\n\"What [Squire's team] do day in and day out, and what they see, is a magnification of hundreds of times of what I've seen or had to deal with.\"\n\nA few years ago, that pressure on Squire started to take a real toll on his mental health, and he admits that, when he wasn't working, \"alcohol was a bigger part of my life than it should have been\".\n\n\"At that point my kids were a bit older… and, you know, that almost enables you to push harder. Like… 'I bet if I get up at three this morning, I can surprise [a perpetrator] online.'\n\n\"But meanwhile, personally… 'Who's Greg? I don't even know what he likes to do.' All of your friends… during the day, you know, they're criminals… All they do is talk about the most horrific things all day long.\"\n\nNot long afterwards, his marriage broke down, and he says he began to have suicidal thoughts.\n\nIt was his colleague Pete Manning who encouraged him to seek help after noticing his friend seemed to be struggling.\n\n\"It's hard when the thing that brings you so much energy and drive is also the thing that's slowly destroying you,\" Manning says.\n\nSquire says exposing his vulnerabilities to the light was the first step to getting better and continuing to do a job he is proud of.\n\n\"I feel honoured to be part of the team that can make a difference instead of watching it on TV or hearing about it… I'd rather be right in there in the fight trying to stop it.\"\n\nLast summer Greg met Lucy, now in her 20s, for the first time.\n\nShe told him her ability to now discuss what she went through was testament to the support she has around her.\n\n\"I have more stability. I'm able to have the energy to talk to people [about the abuse], which I could not have done… even, like, a couple years ago.\"\n\nShe said at the point Homeland Security ended her abuse she had been \"praying actively for it to end\".\n\n\"Not to sound cliché, but it was a prayer answered.\"\n\nSquire told her he wished he had been able to communicate that help was on its way.\n\n\"You wish there was some telepathy and you could reach out and be like, 'listen, we're coming'.\"\n\nThe BBC asked Facebook why it couldn't use its facial recognition technology to assist the hunt for Lucy. It responded: \"To protect user privacy, it's important that we follow the appropriate legal process, but we work to support law enforcement as much as we can.\"\n\nIf you've been a victim of child sexual abuse, a victim of crime or have feelings of despair, and are in the UK, you'll find details of help and support at bbc.co.uk/actionline.",

    "fullText": "As described previously,\nthe Linux kernel security team does not identify or mark or announce any sort\nof security fixes that are made to the Linux kernel tree. So how, if the Linux\nkernel were to become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) and responsible for\nissuing CVEs, would the identification of security fixes happen in a way that\ncan be done by a volunteer staff? This post goes into the process of how\nkernel fixes are currently automatically assigned to CVEs, and also the other\n“out of band” ways a CVE can be issued for the Linux kernel project.\n\nThis is a post in the series about the Linux kernel CVE release process:\n\nA few months after Linux became a CNA, Lee Jones, one of the members of the\nkernel.org CNA team wrote an\narticle on lwn.net\nas to how CVEs were being assigned, along with some other background\ninformation. That process has pretty much remained the same since then, but\ngiven the number of questions we have had over the past few years, it’s best to\ngo into a bit more detail as to how all of this works, and why some bug fixes\nare marked as a CVE and others are not.\n\nAs is often mentioned, the rate of development of the Linux kernel is very\nhigh, averaging around 9 changes a hour for the past decade or so. Luckily,\nthe kernel developers and maintainers have been manually marking specific\ncommits as “bug fixes” for decades, allowing them to be backported to the\nvarious stable kernel branches. This is to allow users to be able to use the\nlast kernel release, or a “long term” kernel as a base on which to rely on\nuntil they upgrade to the newer version. This process was described earlier\nhere,\n\nBecause there is a “feed of known bugfixes” out of the 9 changes an hour,\naveraging about 30 changes per day, the kernel CNA team determined that they\ncan focus their review efforts on that feed, and ignore the other changes, as\nobviously those changes do not fix a problem. And if the missed changes do fix\na problem, odds are someone will eventually ask for those changes to be\nbackported to a stable kernel, so they can be certain that this is a good set\nof changes to be reviewing for potential vulnerability fixes.\n\nWhile many security people love to argue what is, or is not, a vulnerability,\nwhile dealing with CVEs, a CNA must follow the definition that cve.org\ngives us\nwhich is:\n\n“An instance of one or more weaknesses in a\nProduct that can be exploited, causing a\nnegative impact to confidentiality, integrity,\nor availability; a set of conditions or\nbehaviors that allows the violation of an\nexplicit or implicit security policy.”\n\nSo with that definition in mind, the kernel CNA team members look at every\nbugfix that is added to the stable kernel releases and reviews it to determine\nif it meets this criteria.\n\nAt the level that the Linux kernel runs, almost any type of bug that can affect\na running system can be classified as a vulnerability. Specifically this means\nthat the following bugfixes are classified as fixing a vulnerability:\n\nMany bugfixes in the kernel resolve a problem where a\nWARN() or WARN_ON()\ntype of assertion is hit in the kernel. Normally Linux just prints out to the\nkernel log a message about what went wrong, and a stack dump and memory\ninformation, and continues on its merry way, as it is generally considered bad\nform to crash just because a issue was hit that the kernel can properly detect\nand recover from. However, there is a kernel option called\npanic_on_warn\nthat if enabled, Linux will instantly panic and stop if a warning message is\never hit. This is a defensive setting that many users like to enable to\nprotect any possible bug-like condition from being allowed to continue, as they\nwould rather just reboot the machine entirely at that point in time. This\noption is set for a few billion embedded systems running Linux, as well as many\nmany cloud/server systems as they can handle fall-over easily.\n\nBecause of this setting, any kernel fix that resolves a user-reachable\nWARN_ON triggering, must be assigned a CVE entry. If this option were\nnot present, the total number of CVEs assigned by Linux would greatly drop.\n\nWhen the kernel CNA team announced that they were going to start assigning CVEs\nto kernel fixes, the initial worry was that all kernel changes could be thought\nof as fixing a vulnerability. Luckily it turns out that most of the changes\nthat go into the stable kernel releases that fix bugs do not meet the\ndefinition of a “vulnerability fix”, so they do not get assigned a CVE.\nChanges that are common in stable updates that do not get a CVE are:\n\nThere are some bugfixes that many people would think would be classified as a\nvulnerability, but do not meet the cve.org definition, so we are not allowed to\nassign a CVE for them. Those include:\n\nPersonally, I think that filesystem corruption or data loss bug fixes should be\nconsidered a CVE fix, but until cve.org changes their policy, we can not assign\nCVEs for those types of fixes. That is why it is essential for users to always\ntake all stable kernel updates, as odds are, users do like their filesystems to\nstay uncorrupted with no data loss.\n\nFor some filesystem bugs a CVE will not be assigned when a maliciously\ncrafted or accidentally corrupted filesystem image is mounted by the kernel,\nand the kernel crashes or has other problems with it, unless the\nfilesytem-specific userspace fsck program previously ran on the image\nbefore mounting, and it did not find any problems with it. In simpler terms,\nalways run fsck on any untrusted filesystem image before mounting it.\n\nFor many CPU bug fixes, the hardware vendor is responsible for assigning a CVE,\nwhich is why the huge category of the ongoing Spectre cpu bugs do not get CVEs\nassigned by the kernel CNA, but rather the hardware company should be the ones\ndoing that assignment. Many times they do not, but there is nothing that us as\na CNA can really do about that..\n\nThere are 3 core members of the Linux kernel CNA team. The three of us take a\nlist of every commit that is applied to each stable kernel release, and review\nthem to determine if they feel the commit fixes a problem that would resolve a\nvulnerability based on the above definition and descriptions. We all do this\nwork in different ways. I review each patch in mutt\n(after dumping them to a mbox file) and saving off the ones that I think meet\nthe definition. Another member uses\na custom tool\nthat queries some LLM oracles and reviews the output of them for validity,\nwhile another uses a mix of regular expressions combined with manual review\nusing\na custom tool.\n\nWe all check into the\nvulns.git tree our lists of commits\nwe feel should be assigned a CVE id for. Then\nanother tool\nruns on those lists, and if at least 2 members vote for a commit, it is marked\nto be assigned a CVE id.\n\nWe also accept reviews from other community members. At least two different\ndevelopers regularly provide reviews which they email to us in patch form to\nbe applied to the\nvulns.git repository.\nExamples of that can be seen\nhere\nand\nhere.\n\nThese external reviews are taken into consideration after the main voting round\nhappens. If an external person voted for a commit to be marked as a\nvulnerability fix, and a single core member also did, then the commit is\nreviewed again manually to determine what the core member missed, and often\ntimes that commit will then be assigned a CVE id.\n\nAll of this work happens in public, in the\nvulns.git repository.\nCVE ids are usually assigned one to two weeks after the commits have been in a\nreleased kernel version, to allow users time to update their systems. Which is\none key reason why users should always update to newer kernels (more on how to\nkeep a system up to date with the increased numbers of CVE ids being allocated\nin a later article in this series.)\n\nOf course sometimes the CNA team miss commits that should be assigned a CVE, or\na developer or company wishes to have a CVE id assigned before they get through\nthe review process. If that is the case, a simple email to the kernel CNA team\nat the public email address is all that is needed, and then the id will be\nautomatically assigned if the team agrees that the commit meets the\nrequirements of a vulnerability fix.\n\nThis method is used by many developers who know they fixed a vulnerability and\nwish to get a CVE assigned for a presentation or paper due to print deadlines,\nand by many companies who do reviews based on reports sent to them by users.\nRequests are usually handled within a few days, depending on the travel\nschedule of the CNA team members.\n\nAlong with sometimes missing commits that should be assigned a CVE, the CNA\nteam also many times gets reviews incorrect. If anyone thinks that a CVE is\nassigned to a commit incorrectly, because that commit really does not fix a\nvulnerability, please email the CNA team and they will review it and often\ntimes reject the CVE based on that review. This has happened many times when a\nkernel subsystem maintainer patiently explains to the CNA team why a specific\ncommit really is not a vulnerability due to their knowledge of exactly how that\nportion of the kernel works.\n\nWe welcome such emails from all kernel developers and maintainers, for without\nthis type of checks, many commits often are missed, and incorrectly assigned.\nOver the past few years the CNA members have gotten better at reviews and the\nrate of rejection has gotten lower as both the community and the CNA members\nadjust their expectations.\n\nAs the information for what is contained in a CVE record comes directly from\nthe git commit that fixes the vulnerability, sometimes that information can be\nincorrect, or needs to be clarified better. Examples of this is where the\nrange of a vulnerability can not be correctly determined from the commit itself\n(i.e. when the vulnerability showed up, or was backported to), or where\nreferences to external reports for the vulnerability should be added. The\nkernel CNA team has ways to handle all of this by adding the needed range\nbounds, or changing the text, or adding references when requested. Easiest way\nto do this is to just send a patch for the vulns.git repository, adding the\nneeded information. I’ll go into how this all works in more detail into the\nnext article in this series, but if people are interested now, take a look at the\n“schema” file\nthat we use, and some commits in the\nvulns.git repository\n\nfrom\ndifferent\norganizations.\n\nCurrently, the kernel CNA is issuing about 60 CVEs a week, making it the second\nmost prolific CNA currently in the cve.org ecosystem. Trying to keep on top of\nthis type of feed has been “difficult” for traditional security teams that are\nwishing to attempt to manually review and triage every CVE report. As part of\nthe requirement for us to become a CNA, we are required to produce CVE records\nthat can be automatically parsed and handled by tools, without the need for\nhuman interaction.\n\nAs part of that, each CVE we create specifically documents the files affected\nin the kernel source tree for this specific issue, and the exact git ranges, or\nversion ranges if you want that, that the vulnerability originally showed up,\nand where it was fixed. With that information, every Linux user should be able\nto instantly determine if a CVE is applicable for them to review or not by\nfiltering on that data.\n\nBased on some reviews, on average, only 10 CVEs are even applicable to a Linux\nsystem for a normal week, reducing the amount of manual review down to\na very small amount (reading 10 reports a week should be “trivial” for most\nsystem integrators.) This quantity is much lower overall than the other\n“major” operating system vendors produce in a week, if counting CVE numbers as\na reference between projects actually means anything to you.\n\nRemember that software version numbers and git ids are part of a graph, and are\nnot something that you can do a simple “less or greater than” type of\ncomparison. We have seen many companies get this wrong many times. ALWAYS\nproperly walk the git repository tree to determine range checks.\n\nAnd don’t get us started about the uselessness of CPE values, while we do\npopulate those values in the CVE record, they are useless for any real range\nchecking, so please never use them.\n\nAnd yes, PURL will help solve a bit\nof this (it’s better than CPE, a low bar), but PURL does not work for\nself-hosted projects at the moment, like Linux, or GNOME, or KDE, or glibc, or\ngcc, or perl, or python, or curl, well, you get the idea. The PURL developers\nknow this, and we are working with them to solve this issue in the standard to\nhopefully resolve it in the future.\n\nDespite a low number of kernel fixes being applicable to your system every\nweek, many of them do fix real issues that the developers and community know\nabout, so you should upgrade your systems. Ignoring this reported feed will\ndirectly affect the security of your system, so do so at your own risk.\n\nAs stated previously,\nkernel developers do not know how Linux is used, as open source can not\ndictate use. Because of that, we have no way of judging the severity of any\nCVE fix for a user, only the integrator of Linux into their system can properly\ndetermine that. So any group that attempts to give a “severity score” to a\nLinux CVE is lying to you, UNLESS they know exactly your use case.\n\nALWAYS ignore any attempt that groups such as NIST/NVD that purport to\nassign things like CVSS scores to a vulnerability. Those numbers are false and\ngive companies a “fake sense of security”. We have\nasked NIST to stop\nassigning these scores, as it goes against the recently published CISA\nguidelines and we know it is keeping users from updating when they should be,\nas well as causing\nusers to update when they don’t need to be (why would your remote server with\nno physical access to it need to be updated due to a USB gadget driver\nvulnerability?)\n\nThere have been some “working groups” of organizations that use Linux in the\nsame way (i.e. cloud hosting companies) that have attempted to score CVE\nentries in the past. That is the only real way that any attempt to give a\nscore should ever be used, and we welcome groups doing this. However, it seems\nthat all of these groups have stopped doing this work, and instead, have found\nit simpler to just update to the latest stable kernel releases on a more\nregular cadence.\n\ncve.org is looking into having third-party “enrichments” of existing CVE ids,\nbased on the use case of that third party, be added directly to the cve.org\njson record as additional fields. If you are interested in doing this type of\nthing, please contact cve.org, but note that we do not think this is going to\nbe scalable at all, but are more than willing to be proven wrong.\n\nAs mentioned above, CVE ids are usually assigned on a one to two week delay\nfrom when the fix has landed in a released stable kernel version. This allows\nusers who are regularly taking the Linux stable releases to ensure that their\nsystems are secure before CVEs are announced to the world.\n\nKernel CVEs only reference a specific fix in the kernel tree, and do not\nreference any previous changes that might be needed in the tree before that\nspecific change. They are also not tested in an independent way, but only as a\nwhole with all other changes in a specific release by the kernel developer\ncommunity. Because of this, any attempt to only “cherry pick” specific CVE\nfixes can be difficult and is not recommended to be done at all.\n\nThe Linux kernel developer community provides, for free, a constant feed of\ntested bugfixes in stable kernel releases for all to use. Attempting to pick\nand choose individual commits from that feed will cause systems to miss needed\nfixes, as well as create a system that no one has ever seen or tested and can\nnot be supported by anyone else.\n\nThe bonus of just applying all stable releases is that you also get the data\ncorruption and performance improvements for your system as well as the security\nupdates. A result that many ecosystems have already realized is much simpler\noverall to do.\n\nAfter a kernel commit has been declared to be fixing a vulnerability, and\nassigned a CVE, publishing that data to the world in an automated way while\nbeing able to keep the records up to date easily over time at a high volume of\nassigned CVEs was a goal of the kernel CNA team. Over the past 2 years, they\nhave written a number of custom tools and a database to accomplish this,\nevolving from a single bash script to many thousands of lines of multiple\nprograms written in Rust and C. More about how all of those tools work, and\nthe difficulties in doing this all on a fast moving codebase like Linux, will\nbe explained in the next article in this series.",

    "description": "Tesla eliminated the option to purchase Full Self-Driving with a one-time fee over the weekend.",
    "fullText": "Tesla has shifted its Full Self-Driving feature to a subscription model.\n\nOver the weekend, the company removed the option to purchase the feature in the US via a one-time flat fee of $8,000.\n\nFor years, Tesla owners have been able to purchase the service with a one-time payment that would allow them to use it for the full lifespan of their vehicle. Now, the driver-assist feature is available only via a $99-per-month subscription.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk first announced in January that the change would take effect the following month. In the past, Musk has said that Teslas would serve as \"appreciating assets,\" suggesting owners could benefit as the software became increasingly more autonomous.\n\nThe decision to remove lifetime FSD purchases comes shortly after the carmaker stopped offering Autopilot as a free feature for new Tesla purchases. Previously, Autopilot acted as a free driver-assist feature on the expressway, while FSD was an additional paid feature for navigating city streets.\n\nTesla first introduced FSD in 2016, and the pricing has swung dramatically over time. In its early days, FSD cost around $5,000, later climbing to a peak of $15,000. In 2024, Tesla reduced the upfront price to $8,000. The carmaker first introduced a subscription option in 2021 for $199 per month, but the price was later lowered to $99 per month.\n\nMusk said in a post on X last month that the carmaker will raise FSD subscription prices as its \"capabilities improve.\"\n\nTesla's move to a more subscription-focused model reflects a broader industry trend. Under an executive performance plan approved last year, Musk's compensation depends in part on reaching 10 million active FSD subscriptions.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Qualitas Ltd (ASX:QAL) presented its first-half 2026 results on February 17, showcasing robust growth across key metrics despite a challenging global fundraising environment. The Australian alternative real estate investment manager has capitalized on shifting global private credit dynamics that favor the Asia-Pacific region over traditional U.S. markets.\n\nThe company’s stock responded positively to the results, with shares rising 4.21% to close at AUD 3.22 following the announcement, continuing its recovery from a 52-week low of AUD 2.14 toward its high of AUD 4.10.\n\nQualitas reported impressive growth across all major financial metrics, driven by strong deployment and expanding investor relationships. The company’s normalized net profit before tax (NPBT) reached AUD 30 million, representing a 30% increase compared to the first half of 2025.\n\nAs shown in the following summary of key performance metrics:\n\nFee Earning Funds Under Management (FEF) grew 38% year-over-year to AUD 10.9 billion, while deployment surged 57% to AUD 3.7 billion. Transaction fees increased by 69% to AUD 13 million, contributing to a funds management gross operating margin of 46%, up 4% from the previous year.\n\nThe company’s recurring revenue stream showed consistent growth, with recurring funds management revenue up 38% to AUD 43 million and base management fees increasing 28% to AUD 30 million compared to 1H25.\n\nQualitas’ financial results demonstrate the company’s ability to convert strong deployment into sustainable earnings growth. The group’s normalized EBITDA reached AUD 32.9 million with a margin of 51%, while statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) grew 27% to AUD 20.7 million.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of group earnings shows the primary drivers of this performance:\n\nFunds management continues to be the core engine of Qualitas’ growth, with funds management EBITDA margin expanding to 55%, up 4% from 1H25. This improvement reflects the company’s disciplined approach to scaling operations while maintaining cost efficiency.\n\nThe company’s earnings margins show a clear upward trajectory across multiple metrics:\n\nQualitas has successfully expanded its investor and borrower relationships, with 76% of deployment coming from repeat borrowers and 28% from follow-on investments. The company has built a substantial pool of potential embedded and unrecognized performance fees, now standing at AUD 99 million to be realized over the next seven years.\n\nThe company highlighted its expanding relationships with key stakeholders:\n\nResidential development remains a key driver of Qualitas’ growth, with the company gaining market share in financing larger-scale projects. This is particularly significant as residential developments are scaling up, creating demand for financiers with access to large-scale capital.\n\nQualitas is also benefiting from evolving global private credit dynamics, with investor interest shifting from the United States toward Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. This trend is expected to continue, with APAC fundraising growth projected to outpace the US over the next five years.\n\nQualitas reaffirmed its full-year 2026 guidance, projecting NPBT of AUD 60-66 million (representing 13-25% growth over FY25) and earnings per share of 13.9-15.3 cents.\n\nThe company’s outlook is supported by a strong pipeline of opportunities, with AUD 2.0 billion in available capital for deployment. Management highlighted that the undrawn construction credit profile and timing of deployment will be key factors influencing the final results within the guided range.\n\nGroup Managing Director Andrew Schwartz expressed confidence in the company’s positioning for the second half of the financial year, emphasizing Qualitas’ strategic initiatives and robust market position. This sentiment was echoed by Global Head of Real Estate Mark Fischer, who highlighted the stability of their investments, noting that their \"capital is deployed into real assets, supported by long-term, stable demand.\"\n\nThe company’s dividend policy reflects this confidence, with the interim dividend increasing by 40% to 3.5 cents per share compared to 1H25.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, Qualitas acknowledges potential challenges from interest rate fluctuations, competition from traditional banks, and global economic uncertainties that could influence investment decisions in the coming months.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.",

    "description": "A certification debacle left Lufthansa's complex 787 business class mostly empty for months. The airline said it can finally sell the lucrative seats.",
    "fullText": "Lufthansa can finally start making money on its Boeing 787 Dreamliners after a certification debacle left one of its most lucrative cabins largely empty for months.\n\nThe German flag carrier said on Monday that it will begin selling tickets for its Allegris business class on the 787. Allegris, Lufthansa's signature cabin concept, spans economy, premium economy, business, and first class, but the business class rollout has been particularly tricky.\n\nThe program first launched on the Airbus A350 in May 2024, with the cabin spanning the entire plane. The first Allegris-equipped 787 followed in October 2025, but certification of business class dragged on due to the cabin's complexity: there are five staggered seat configurations in a single airplane cabin — some with doors or more legroom, others with extra-long beds.\n\nThis is because the Dreamliner's geometry — including a slightly tighter usable footprint and different fuselage contouring compared to the A350 — made it harder to demonstrate to regulators that passengers could evacuate quickly from every seat, whether staggered, partially enclosed, or fully cocooned, in an emergency.\n\nThe result? For months, only four of the 28 business class seats could be sold — the front-row Business Class Suites — leaving the remaining 24 empty. Business class is a cash cow for airlines, and by flying most of the cabin empty as competitors pour investments into their own premium seats, Lufthansa was essentially leaving money on the table.\n\nIt has been a particularly costly headache for a carrier in the midst of a multi-year turnaround plan to restore profitability after years of financial pressure from frequent maintenance, aircraft shortages, rising operating costs, and labor strikes.\n\nLufthansa even opted for an already-certified business-class seat to retrofit onto its Airbus A380s rather than risk another prolonged and costly certification process.\n\nBut the saga is nearing the finish line. Beginning April 15, Lufthansa plans to carry passengers in 25 business-class seats on its 787s, with three remaining blocked in the second row of the cabin.\n\nBookings are open, though it's unclear whether the news indicates the seats have been fully certified or if that's just Lufthansa's expected timeline.\n\nLufthansa said \"Classic\" seats — one of the Allegris categories available — are free to secure with the premium fare.\n\nThe others require an extra fee: this includes the first-row suites, the \"Privacy\" seat next to the window, the \"Extra Space\" seat with more legroom, and the \"Extra Long Bed\" with an over seven-foot sleeping surface.\n\nThe three second-row seats that are blocked — and not yet available for booking — are two privacy seats and an extra-legroom seat.\n\nLufthansa flies eight Allegris-equipped Dreamliners and expects to have 29 by the end of 2027.\n\nThey are set to first fly from Frankfurt to Rio de Janeiro, Bogota, Cape Town, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, and Austin; New York-JFK and Los Angeles join the roster in June, followed by Delhi in July.\n\nAs part of Lufthansa's greater multibillion-dollar fleet overhaul plan, Allegris is also being fit onto the airline's existing A350s and Boeing 747-8s, as well as its future, yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777Xs.\n\nA similar spacing issue on the 747 double-deckers' upper level means it will have a split business class: the lower deck will have Allegris, while upstairs will feature the plane's original cabin.",

    "title": "AI's first wave was about cutting costs. The second wave is about building things we've never seen.",
    "description": "Startup CEOs like Kylan Gibbs and Sara Beykpour talk about AI's Second Wave, focusing on creating new products beyond cost-cutting.",
    "fullText": "For the past three years, AI has been mostly a cost-cutting tool. A growing number of founders and investors are trying to move beyond that era.\n\nThe next chapter of AI, they argue, will be defined by new kinds of products — apps, games, companions, and services that simply couldn't exist before large language models. They call it AI's \"Second Wave.\"\n\n\"The first wave of AI made existing things cheaper. Automation. Efficiency,\" said Kylan Gibbs, a former Google DeepMind product manager who runs AI startup Inworld. \"The next wave makes things that couldn't exist before. New products. New experiences. New revenue. That's the difference between optimizing spend and creating it.\"\n\nFor Gibbs, that distinction is existential. If AI merely trims costs, it reshuffles value within existing businesses. If it enables entirely new consumer products — ones people will pay for — it expands the economic pie.\n\n\"AI reaches its real economic potential when it creates value consumers want to pay for, not just value businesses want to save,\" he wrote on LinkedIn. That next phase, he says, requires a new \"consumer-scale AI stack\": real-time responses under 300 milliseconds, support for millions of users simultaneously, and deeply personal experiences tailored to individual preferences.\n\nIn January, Gibbs launched a Silicon Valley accelerator to back up to 30 \"Second Wave\" AI startups — companies building new consumer experiences rather than bolting chatbots onto old workflows. Venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, are involved, alongside leaders from OpenAI, Google, and Stripe. A demo day will take place in early March in San Francisco.\n\nThe philosophy echoes a recent post from Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan: \"Instead of worrying about doing the same thing we've been doing for cheaper, why not focus on doing the thing we never even dreamed of doing?\"\n\nA handful of startups already embody that ethos.\n\nSara Beykpour, CEO and cofounder of Particle, says the tech industry is in a liminal moment.\n\n\"We're in a transition between the first wave and the second wave,\" she said.\n\nThe first wave delivered massive productivity gains. At Particle, an AI-native news platform, tasks that once took a month can now be built, tested, and deployed in hours.\n\n\"We actually call each other out in meetings when someone falls into the old way of thinking,\" Beykpour said. \"We jokingly call it 'boomer thinking,' even though we're all millennials.\"\n\nThat shift in mindset gives the startup more time to focus on unlocking new AI-powered formats. Particle recently launched Podcast Clips, a feature that embeds the most relevant snippets of long-form podcasts directly into news stories. Instead of hunting through a three-hour episode, users see curated clips attached to specific topics.\n\n\"It changes the information hierarchy,\" Beykpour said. \"Instead of having to find the podcast you want to listen to, we're bringing the podcast to you based on the most relevant parts.\"\n\nUnder the hood, the system uses AI embeddings to map relationships between transcripts and stories. A clip from a talk show about Greenland and Davos, along with comments from President Donald Trump, can be automatically linked to relevant reporting. Generative AI then layers summaries and context on top.\n\nThese AI embeddings \"have gotten much better in important ways,\" Beykpour told Business Insider in a recent interview.\n\nIf Particle reimagines news, Luvu reinvents personal training using generative AI.\n\nLaunched in August 2025 by CEO Alexis Sursock and CTO Creston Brooks, the AI-powered fitness app has already attracted about 250,000 users. The app features an AI \"marshmallow\" that acts like a personal trainer, sending highly personalized notifications and real-time feedback.\n\n\"The key is the personalization, which is powered by AI models and wouldn't have been possible before this technology appeared in recent years,\" Brooks said.\n\nInstead of generic reminders — \"It's time for your workout\" — Luvu tailors messages. If a user logged that they had a test yesterday, the app might follow up with, \"Your test is over. Time to work out!\"\n\nThe results are striking. Luvu's notification click rate is four times that of typical non-personalized prompts. In an industry where only 2% to 3% of users remain active after 30 days, Brooks said, Luvu claims retention rates that are two to three times higher.\n\nThe app offers three motivational styles: supportive, neutral, or \"meaner marshmallow.\" Behind the scenes, Luvu also uses AI for granular, one-to-one messaging crafted by LLMs.\n\nThe company is also experimenting with reinforcement learning with verified rewards, a relatively new technique for training and improving AI models.\n\nUsers can prop their phones against a surface and record themselves exercising; the app uses computer-vision models to verify whether squats or other moves are performed correctly, offering real-time corrections like \"Straighten your knees.\" These verified signals feed back into the system, helping train what Brooks envisions as a future \"super-motivator\" model.\n\nThis isn't just a chatbot layered on top of a fitness tracker. It's a feedback loop between human behavior and AI, something that couldn't easily exist before the advent of modern models.\n\nFor Fai Nur, CEO and cofounder of AI-powered social simulation game Status, the Second Wave is about imagination.\n\n\"Status could not have existed before LLMs,\" she said.\n\nThe app, which has surpassed 3 million downloads, lets users role-play in AI-generated social media worlds. Think The Sims, though played out as a living, breathing social feed.\n\nUsers can cast themselves as anything they can imagine, such as Hogwarts students, soccer stars, or characters from \"Stranger Things.\" Post an update, and AI-generated characters instantly reply. Events unfold dynamically: miss a penalty kick, and face the backlash. An AI system assigns an \"aura score\" to grade responses and level players up or down.\n\nIn many enterprise settings, the non-deterministic nature of LLM outputs is a liability. Generative AI models sometimes respond to the same prompt in different ways, which doesn't lend itself to applications that require strict accuracy.\n\nIn gaming, this can be an asset because each new AI-generated response can be new, creating a richer, more varied experience.\n\n\"You haven't been able to role-play like this until now,\" Nur said.\n\nBefore LLMs, creating immersive fandom worlds required persuading other humans to participate. Now, entire social universes spin up instantly.\n\nFor Gibbs and other proponents of AI's Second Wave, that's the point. The technology's future won't be defined by incremental cost savings, but by products that feel native to AI — experiences that surprise, motivate, inform, and entertain at consumer scale.\n\nIf the first wave made businesses leaner, the second may make everyday life stranger, richer, and more interactive — and, crucially, something people will pay for.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.

    "fullText": "Although billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg have expansive portfolios, they're not among the largest landowners in the United States.\n\nIn fact, they're not even close.\n\nThe Land Report published its annual roundup of the top private landowners across the country in January. The outlet has collected land ownership data for nearly two decades.\n\nIn 2026, the list includes several billionaires, the children of business moguls, and the family of a former Texas governor.\n\nStanley Kroenke is the largest private landowner in the US with 2.7 million acres. The billionaire bought over 937,000 deeded acres in New Mexico last December, marking the single-largest land purchase in over a decade, according to The Land Report.\n\nKroenke — married to Walmart heiress Ann Walton — is a real estate mogul who has invested heavily in sports teams through his holdings company, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment. That includes owning the NBA's Denver Nuggets, the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, the NFL's Los Angeles Rams, and the Arsenal Football Club.\n\nThe Emmerson Family is the largest private timberland owner in the country, which may not be surprising given their business.\n\nSierra Pacific Industries — founded in 1949 — says it owns and manages over 2.4 million acres of timberland in Washington, Oregon, and California.\n\nMark D. Emmerson and George Emmerson, the sons of Sierra Pacific Industries cofounder Archie \"Red\" Emmerson, now helm the company.\n\nJohn Malone, also known as the Cable Cowboy, is a billionaire media mogul who led Tele-Communications Inc. for over 25 years.\n\nHe owns 2.2 million acres of land across New Mexico, Wyoming, Florida, and Colorado, according to The Land Report.\n\nThe Malone Family Land Preservation Foundation has a joint initiative with The Land Institute called the Perennial Agriculture Project. The project funds research about perennial crop system development.\n\nTed Turner has amassed 2 million acres of land following a high-profile career in American broadcasting.\n\nTurner led Turner Broadcasting Systems before founding CNN, the country's first 24-hour all-news network, in 1980. Eight years later, he created TNT.\n\nTurner Enterprises Inc. oversees the billionaire's investments, business interests, and land holdings. That includes the millions of acres and over 45,000 bison.\n\nThe Reed Family, owners of the Green Diamond Resource Company, has over 1.6 million acres of land, according to the report.\n\nThe Green Diamond Resource Company is one of the largest timberland owner-operators in the US, managing 2.2 million acres across nine states.\n\nThe family-owned business has spanned six generations. Douglas Reed serves as the company's president and chair.\n\nThe Buck Family has accumulated 1.3 million acres across the country, making them the sixth-largest US landowner, according to the report.\n\nThe Buck family amassed their wealth through the late Peter Buck, who cofounded Pete's Super Submarines in Connecticut. The franchise later became Subway, which has over 20,000 restaurants globally.\n\nThe Irving family owns 1.2 million acres in Maine, as well as additional land in parts of Canada, according to the report.\n\nJames Dergavel Irving founded J.D. Irving, Limited, in 1882. The Canadian company's original portfolio included a sawmill, a gristmill, a carding mill, a farm, a general store, and a lumber business.\n\nNow, J.D. Irving, Limited has expanded its services into consumer products, construction, transportation, and other sectors. Robert Irving and Jim Irving serve as co-CEOs.\n\nThe report ranked the heirs of King Ranch, the largest ranch in the US, at No. 8, with 911,000 acres.\n\nThe ranch got its start in 1853 when Captain Richard King purchased land in South Texas. The ranch says it also owns land in Florida.\n\nKing Ranch has a wide range of operations, from cattle ranching to breeding horses.\n\nThe heirs of David Pingree Sr. founded the Seven Islands Land Company in 1964. Pingree was a Salem, Massachusetts, shipping merchant who invested in Maine's timberlands in the 1800s.\n\nAs of 2026, the family has amassed 830,000 acres, according to the report.\n\nThe report ranked the heirs of Hugh Roy Cullen at No. 10 with 800,000 acres in the US.\n\nThe Cullen Foundation says Hugh's career began in Texas in the 1890s. He entered the cotton business before investing in real estate.\n\nHugh founded Quintana Petroleum Corporation in 1932. The company's mining division — Quintana Minerals Corporation— was formed 31 years later.\n\nNow, the corporation is a management company run by the Robertson family. Corbin J. Robertson Jr. is Cullen's grandson.\n\nThe Briscoe family is the 11th largest US landowner.\n\nThe late Dolph Briscoe, Jr., was the governor of Texas from 1973 to 1979. The family's holdings, spanning over 1,000 square miles, are overseen by Dolph \"Chip\" Briscoe III, according to the report.",

    "title": "AH-64 Apache Is Getting Proximity Fuzed 30mm Cannon Ammo For Swatting Down Drones",
    "description": "The XM1225 APEX ammo will offer another arrow in the Apache's growing anti-drone quiver.",
    "fullText": "The AH-64 Apache attack helicopter has evolved into a counter-drone platform in recent years — something we have been following closely. While the Israeli Air Force had pioneered this role for the AH-64 for years, the U.S. Army has now formally codified it and added new capabilities in the process. Now, as we had suggested some time ago, the Apache is getting proximity-fuzed 30mm cannon shells for its chin-mounted M230 cannon that will add to its drone-killing arsenal, giving it a cheaper and more plentiful engagement option than some of the alternatives.\n\nCRAZY footage of an IAF Apache helicopter chasing down a Hezbollah drone over northern Israel and downing it with cannon fire from its chaingun\n\n— Raylan Givens (@JewishWarrior13) November 2, 2024\n\nApaches live-fire tested the 30x113mm XM1225 Aviation Proximity Explosive (APEX) ammo last December, according to a recent Army release. The trials occurred at the service’s sprawling Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) in southern Arizona. Multiple test engagements occurred against various types of drone targets.\n\nThe specialized APEX ammunition works by detonating only when it is close to an object, then it explodes in a spray of shrapnel. This is critical to shooting down drones as they are small, independently moving targets, and the Apache’s monocle-targeted chin gun isn’t exactly a sniper rifle in terms of precision. At the same time, the rounds could also be used against targets on the surface — including personnel, soft-skinned vehicles, and small boats, for instance — offering unique area effects compared to the Apache’s standard impact-detonating, high-explosive ammunition.\n\nVariants of the M230 cannon, the prime contractor for which is now Northrop Grumman, have already become an increasingly popular choice for dealing with lower-end drone threats from the ground. The light-weight M230LF version, designated the M914 in Army service, has found its way onto counter-drone vehicles. This includes the Sgt. Stout Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) system based on the 8×8 Stryker light armored vehicle. The Army has been separately pursuing self-destructing and other kinds of proximity-fuzed 30mm ammunition for use with the M914. The new APEX ammo offers improved performance that can plug-and-play with the Apache/M230 combo. The other rounds for use in ground-based systems have never been cleared for use on the Apache to our knowledge.\n\nAn official Army release on the XM1225’s successful testing reads, in part:\n\n“Developed and managed by Product Manager Medium Caliber Ammunition (PdM MCA) from Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the XM1225 APEX cartridge is designed to counter modern threats, including UAS, exposed personnel, and small boats, without requiring modifications to the Apache’s M230 Area Weapon System or fire control system. The XM1225 has undergone extensive safety testing to ensure reliable performance, making it a safe and effective addition to the Apache’s arsenal. This innovative design ensures seamless integration into existing platforms while delivering enhanced lethality and operational flexibility.\n\n…The primary objective was to evaluate the XM1225 cartridge’s accuracy and compare its performance to the legacy M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge under identical conditions. A secondary objective was to collect data on mixed loads of XM1225 and M789 rounds against both ground and UAS targets.\n\nInitial results were highly successful, with the XM1225 meeting all accuracy requirements and demonstrating exceptional effectiveness against both ground and UAS targets. The proximity-fuzed capability of the XM1225 allows it to detonate near the target, creating a larger lethal radius and significantly improving its ability to neutralize airborne and dispersed threats. This capability positions the Apache to dominate the battlefield in both air-to-ground and air-to-air engagements, providing warfighters with a critical edge in modern combat scenarios.”\n\nA key feature of the APEX ammunition is that it requires little additional training for Apache crews to successfully employ it as it acts very similarly, ballistically, to the M789 high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP) rounds already fielded. Those shells use an impact/grazing fuze to command detonation.\n\nA major issue with using any gun for counter-drone work from the air is that standard high-explosive or incendiary cannon rounds simply keep traveling until they hit something, then they explode. This makes any horizontal or upward aspect shots very problematic, as the rounds can fly many miles before hitting the ground. Anyone or anything in that unpredictable zone would not fare well. Even high-deflection shots are risky, especially considering the size of the drones. Not only will most rounds miss and still hit somewhere below, but the aircraft can easily fly into the drone itself, as judging its distance and keeping track of it in the air is problematic. So, having self-destructing rounds, and even better, proximity fuzed ones that do the same, is key.\n\nAs it sits now, the AH-64 has modified AGM-114 missiles that use the Longbow Radar to prosecute aerial targets. Laser-guided Hellfires are potentially another option. Regardless, any Hellfire costs well into the six-digit realm. Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) laser-guided rockets are a lower-cost option, having a low-to-mid five-digit price tag. It isn’t clear if the AH-64 has been cleared to use air-to-air optimized Fixed Wing, Air Launched, Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Ordnance (FALCO) versions of the APKWS II, which also use a proximity fuze for going after aerial targets, yet.\n\nSo, giving AH-64s the gun option, and in a far more reliable and safer manner via a proximity fuzed round, would be a huge boon for crews tasked with the counter-drone mission. Apaches can carry a whopping 1,200 rounds of 30mm ammunition, and they can be reloaded with more very quickly at forward austere locales on the ground.\n\nSo as it sits now, it likely won’t be too long before the AH-64 has a new arrow in its anti-drone quiver.\n\nContact the author: Tyler@twz.com",

    "fullText": "With a very high cost of operation and in many cases, a concentrated market of competitors, many smaller and even mid-size airlines have already filed for bankruptcy in the first two months of 2026.\n\nA few names of these names include Royal Air Philippines, Indian charter carrier Dove Airlines, Swedish carrier H-Bird, and U.S. charter airline Tailwind Air.\n\nIn the latter case, the carrier, based out of Westchester County Airport (HPN) in New York, filed for Chapter 11 protection after losing its Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) due to lack of funds in January 2025.\n\nThe AOC, the primary certification that allows a civil airline to begin running and selling flights, is issued by the government agency that regulates aviation in a given country (the FAA in the United States).\n\nOver in Austria, Mali Air became the latest small carrier to lose its AOC. Contrary to what its name might suggest, Air Mali had no connection to the West African nation of Mali. It was founded by Austrian pilot and aviation investor Karl-Heinz Mali in 1994 with a single twin-engine Cessna 340A jet.\n\nAs first reported by Swiss outlet ch-aviation, Mali Air no longer had an active AOC as of Feb. 16.\n\nBased out of the regional Graz Airport (GRZ) in southeastern Austria, Mali Air started out by offering wealthy travelers charter flights from Austria to multiple destinations in Eastern Europe in the 1990s and eventually expanded to more European destinations over the years.\n\nOn its website, Mali Air reports a fleet of four planes: a Cessna 340, a Cessna Citation 501, an Eclipse 500, and an Eclipse 550. The latter is a twin-engine jet with just six passenger seats.\n\nIt is not immediately clear whether Mali Air lost an active AOC over its financial situation, a failed safety audit, or another reason, which, in many such cases, relates to operational mismanagement.\n\nThe company also advertises loosely defined services, such as aircraft management and \"complete air logistics services of all cargo and restricted dangerous goods.\"\n\n\"By actively promoting your aircraft for third-party charter flights, we also help you earn income on your aircraft while reducing your fixed expenses,\" Mali Air writes on its website.\n\nSpirit Airlines (Spirit Aviation Holdings, Inc.): Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time on August 29,2025.\n\nRavn Alaska: Ceased operations in August 2025 after earlier Chapter 11 proceedings; shut down flights and folded into other operations such as New Pacific.\n\nCorporate Air: Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (restructuring) in September 2025 as part of a planned sale, according to Bondoro.\n\nPlay Airlines: The Reykjavik-based airline shut down operations and entered involuntary bankruptcy in September 2025.\n\nBraathens Airlines:The airline was forced to file for bankruptcy and canceled all of its flights in September 2025.",

    "description": "Wales needs a specialist defence coach but Welsh rugby greats Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones question when that will happen and who decides.",
    "fullText": "Steve Tandy needs help. As head coach of a crisis-ridden Wales side plunging to new depths every time they take to the field, that much is obvious.\n\nSpecifically, according to two Welsh rugby greats, Tandy needs the support of a full-time defence coach.\n\nHis work as defence coach for Scotland impressed enough to earn the same role with the British and Irish Lions, so Tandy was expected to tighten things up for Wales when he took the reins last September.\n\nYet there has been little case for the defence with Wales.\n\nIn his first six games in charge - albeit including the world's top four teams in their last four Tests - Tandy's Wales have conceded a staggering 302 points and 42 tries.\n\nThe latest battering, Sunday's 54-12 mauling by France in Cardiff, leaves Wales bottom of the Six Nations having already shipped 102 points. No team has conceded \n\nTandy has confirmed Wales will have a specialist defence coach by the summer but the timing of that appointment - and who makes it - has been questioned.\n\nWales cling to optimism despite another record loss\n\nLowest Cardiff Six Nations crowd amid rugby turmoil\n\nScotland game chance for Wales to 'deliver better'\n\nWales have full-time attack and forwards coaches in the form of Matt Sherratt and Danny Wilson, but Tandy only has the temporary support of Dan Lydiate – still very early in his coaching career – in defence.\n\nJuggling that work with his head coach duties, Tandy might be spreading himself too thinly, according to former Wales captains Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\n\"Mid-season it's hard to transition and get someone in,\" Tandy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's something we're working hard to have a look at and, probably by the summer, we'll have an option then.\n\n\"It isn't a quick fix. It's something we need to layer and build towards the future.\"\n\nWarburton won two Six Nations titles, including a Grand Slam, with a Wales team built on the rock-solid defensive foundation provided by Shaun Edwards, who now holds that role for France.\n\nThe former Wales captain said Tandy needs help with defence.\n\n\"Steve's admitted he's probably spread himself a bit too thinly,\" Warburton told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He's been doing the defence with Dan Lydiate but then you're trying to do the defence with all the other things that come with being a head coach.\n\n\"Dan is more the micro defensive skills [such as] tackle technique, competition on the floor.\n\n\"Wales don't have a full-time defence coach [and] it's not just about being a coach during campaign time. When the players are playing for their clubs, you're there full-time, watching the regions play, or the Welsh-qualified players playing in England, and you can still keep dialogue and send clips.\n\n\"He needs to bring in a defence coach [but] it sounds like they can't get people out of their contracts because it's difficult to bring people in mid-season.\n\n\"For someone to come in as a full-time defence coach, they need to be tried and tested at this level.\"\n\nWhen taking his role as Welsh Rugby Union's director of rugby last July, Dave Reddin said Tandy would \"not solely select\" his coaching team but would be involved in the process.\n\nHe added: \"It's about getting the right people in those spots as opposed to just getting the next people. It might well be that people are in position already and we need to be a bit more patient.\"\n\nWhoever that new appointment might be, Alun Wyn Jones believes his former Ospreys team-mate Tandy should have the biggest say in the matter.\n\n\"Steve needs to be able to oversee everything and get others to focus on those areas,\" he said.\n\n\"The bigger question I'd ask: Is he going to appoint his own defence coach?\n\n\"There have been questions around that, as opposed to other people in the organisation. That's the most important thing – he's got to be able to pick his own staff.\n\n\"He's got a great grip of the defence, but you can't spread yourself too thinly in that position.\"",

    "description": "The second weekend of the Six Nations brings redemption for Scotland, another blistering display from France and a threat for Ireland.",
    "fullText": "Redemption for Scotland as they end England's unbeaten run, Ireland squeeze past improving Italy, and can anyone stop France?\n\nHere are the main talking points from an enthralling second round of the Six Nations.\n\nThere were questions asked of Scotland and head coach Gregor Townsend after the opening weekend defeat by Italy but you would struggle to find a more emphatic riposte than their 31-20 victory over England.\n\nScotland started brilliantly and never took their foot off the gas to hand Steve Borthwick's side a first defeat in 13 games and improve on their dominant recent record in Calcutta Cup games, having now won six of the past nine.\n\nSpeaking to the Rugby Union Weekly podcast, former Scotland international Johnnie Beattie said: \"This was special. They were humbled last weekend in Rome and this time we had a chance to humble England here and came through.\n\n\"Everything that went wrong last week was righted. We fought and scrapped for everything. It was fully deserved and was a comprehensive Calcutta Cup win.\"\n\nBeattie said Scotland have always had the capacity to win one-off games against top sides but must find more consistency.\n\n\"They've had these seminal moments but not put together a consistent run that would put them in a position to compete for a championship,\" he added.\n\n\"It's how consistently can you find ways to beat these top-level opposition and Scotland don't have the answer yet. Can you finish in the top three? There are some huge games. We have to back it up.\"\n\n'Murrayfield pain will make England a better team'\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nEngland went into the game against Scotland looking for a 13th straight win and a first in Edinburgh since 2020, but were unable to cope with Scotland's energy and intensity.\n\nThey lost last week's hat-trick hero Henry Arundell to an early yellow card, which later became a red, and when they threatened to stage a comeback a chargedown on George Ford's drop-goal attempt led to Huw Jones' eighth try against England - the most of any player in the Six Nations era.\n\n\"Scotland were 20 points better not 11. They were comprehensive winners,\" ex-England scrum-half Matt Dawson told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"In the cold light of day England were taken apart from minute one to minute 80. Scotland were miles better.\"\n\nThe loss was England's fourth in their past five Six Nations away matches and Dawson questioned their tactics.\n\n\"For me it wasn't so much about the kicking game. It was like if that's not working what else are you going to do? Scotland had done their homework and defended ferociously and England were getting no change out of it, so what's the tactic?\" said Dawson.\n\n\"England didn't adjust accordingly. It was a masterclass from the Scotland coaching staff because England were nowhere.\"\n\nFormer England winger Chris Ashton told Rugby Special he felt England looked \"disjointed\" and there had been a \"snowball effect\" as errors mounted up.\n\n\"A lot of it was not being able to handle pressure. It was one thing after another so early in the game. England lost every battle,\" he added.\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\n'I felt guilty' - Tuipulotu says Scotland delivered for Townsend\n\nFrance are the only team still capable of a Grand Slam and the unbeaten Les Bleus put on another masterclass with a 54-12 win over Wales in Cardiff.\n\nIn a blistering display of speed, scything running and joie de vivre, France made 10 line-breaks in the opening 20 minutes on their way to scoring the most points they have racked up against Wales, surpassing the 51-0 win at Wembley in 1998.\n\nAn agile and mobile pack, allied with a magical backline playing with total freedom, the blue shirts were like a blur leaving Wales chasing shadows.\n\n\"You look at this France team and think, who stops them? They have it all,\" former Scotland back row John Barclay told Rugby Special.\n\nAshton said the French side could \"score at will\" and singled out winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey for praise.\n\n\"His all-round game is fantastic, he always seems so confident and does things not many players can,\" he added. \"He's the go-to guy for France.\"\n\nWill anyone stop 'massive favourites' France in Six Nations?\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nThese are tough times to be a Wales fan. The hardest in living memory for a generation who grew up with regular Six Nations success and a team full of stars such as Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\nThere are many issues at play in Welsh rugby, but by any measure, recent results are a complete horror show as Sunday's record loss to France made it 13 consecutive Six Nations defeats and a 10th straight loss at home in the championship.\n\nIt's now 1,072 days since their last Six Nations victory in March 2023 against Italy in Rome and 1,464 days since their last championship win at home against Scotland in February 2022.\n\nIt appears supporters are starting to vote with their feet. The attendance against France was 57,744, making it the lowest Six Nations crowd in Cardiff.\n\nBut speaking after the game on BBC One, former captain Warburton was encouraged by some parts of Wales' play and said they need to look at what went well such as the maul defence, line-out and the performance of Eddie James.\n\n\"Some aspects of the game went quite well, they weren't outpowered, they were outclassed with ball handling. There are some positives to take into next week,\" said Warburton.\n\n\"Looking at the small wins, there's no point kicking them when they're down. It has to be how can we get better from this point? Which young players look like they've got the mentality?\n\n\"We're not trying to solve this in one week, we're in this for a couple of years so let's all get tight and every week look for small improvements and move forward.\"\n\nJones said there had \"definitely been green shoots\".\n\n\"The effort was there but it's international rugby and you're going to be judged on results, but it was there from an effort standpoint,\" he added.\n\nEx-England captain Martin Johnson also offered words of encouragement.\n\n\"Wales can always play and score tries, they have good rugby players so you're never that far away and they can sit there thinking they've been smashed at home against a very good French side.\n\n\"But there will be some games coming up where they think we can win this.\"\n\n'Heartbreaking, sad, disgrace' – Wales fans react to state of game\n\nCan people fall back in love with Welsh rugby?\n\nWales still rugby nation despite struggles - Tandy\n\nAfter losing to France in the opening round, Andy Farrell's side survived a scare against an improving Italy side fresh from a home victory over Scotland.\n\nIreland have won all 13 home games against Italy in the Six Nations but that 100% record came under serious threat.\n\nAshton told Rugby Special that Italy, who led at half-time, missed a wonderful opportunity to get a first victory in Ireland.\n\n\"It would have been a long 10 days for Ireland so Farrell would have been happy they got the win but Italy missed so many opportunities. They've got to be annoyed they didn't get the win,\" he told Rugby Special.\n\nFarrell has a big decision to make before Saturday's match away at England after a difficult afternoon for starting fly-half Sam Prendergast, who was replaced by Jack Crowley, with the Munster man putting in a strong showing off the bench.\n\n\"It's hard for Ireland right now, they're in a funny place. They want success all the time and it's going to be hard for them at Allianz Stadium,\" Ashton told Rugby Special.\n\nBarclay added: \"They're not quite there but you don't write them off. They've got experienced British and Irish Lions and it's just small tweaks missing.\"\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nI think Crowley starts against England - Murray\n\nItaly captain Lamaro proud perception has changed\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.",

He did not have a criminal record.\n\nHe will be questioned by prosecutors on Tuesday. The child was treated in hospital and is recovering at home with her parents.\n\n“A survival instinct kicked in,” the father of the toddler, named as Matteo, told Italian television. “To see your daughter in danger is dreadful. The reaction was immediate. You don’t think, you just act.”\n\nHe said that his daughter was seated in a trolley while they were shopping but then wanted to walk.\n\n“I gave her to my partner and I was pushing the trolley. It all happened in a fraction of a second. It is not something that you expect, particularly because the supermarket was packed with people.\n\n“I must thank all the supermarket staff who intervened and the police, who were quick to arrive. My daughter is OK and she is playing despite the plaster cast she has to wear.”\n\nMarco Cadeddu, a senior police officer, said it was a very serious incident. “We arrested the man, took him to the police station, and took care of the child, who was taken to hospital. It could have ended up being a lot worse.”\n\nElena Carnevali, the mayor of Bergamo, expressed solidarity with the parents for the “terrifying experience” they endured.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "The Premier League and English Football League will resume their procedures for Ramadan, with matches pausing briefly to allow Muslim players to break their fast.\n\nRamadan starts this week and will last for a month. During the this time, Muslims abstain from food and drink from dawn until sunset.\n\nWith sunset in the UK ranging from about 17:00 to 19:00 GMT during this period, the only games that could see a break in play will be Saturday's 17:30 kick-off and Sunday's 16:30 kick-off.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, club captains alongside match officials will find a natural pause in the game to allow Muslim players or match officials to break their fast.\n\nTeams and match officials will discuss beforehand whether a pause is required and an approximate time for the stoppage will be agreed. The break will not be used as a team drinks break nor as a tactical time-out.\n\nPlay will not stop while matches are in mid-flow but at the earliest convenient moment during a goal-kick, free-kick or throw-in.\n\nIn 2021, an agreement was put in place to allow Muslim players to break their fast during a Premier League match.\n\nThis first break took place in a game between Leicester City and Crystal Palace in April 2021. The match was paused at a goal-kick around the half-hour mark to allow Leicester's Wesley Fofana and Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate, external to replenish themselves with liquids and energy gels.\n\nOne of the five pillars of Islam is that during Ramadan, Muslims fast during daylight hours to show their devotion to their religion.\n\nMuslim names in the Premier League include Mohamed Salah, William Saliba, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Amad Diallo among others.\n\n\"In the Premier League you are free to do whatever suits you. They will never do anything against your faith and this is great,\" former Everton player Abdoulaye Doucoure told BBC Sport in 2023.\n\n\"I fast every day, I don't miss any day. It has become normal and very easy for me. Training is still the same during Ramadan but when we go [for away matches], we might need to eat later than the others so the chef prepares food for us, making sure everything is in place as at home. We get halal food so there are no problems,\" Doucoure added.\n\nAnd in 2022, former Liverpool player Sadio Mane revealed the club altered their training schedules to support their Muslim players during the month of Ramadan.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Indiana-based PARLOUR Pizza + Pints, which opened its first Lexington location on Harrodsburg Road in 2024, is expanding.\n\nNow, the newest PARLOUR will be coming to Richmond. The new restaurant will open in a former Hooters at 241 Eastern Bypass, about a mile from Eastern Kentucky University, in late March, according to Don Robinson, PARLOUR CEO and president.\n\n“It was always a part of our target demographic for bringing PARLOUR to the Lexington market,” he said. “Most of the time the real estate kind of dictates the location. We really like the layout and the visibility.”\n\nHe said they’d actually intended to open a second Lexington location first, but construction delays mean the Richmond restaurant will leapfrog one coming soon to the Hamburg area.\n\nThis summer, he said, a PARLOUR will open on Justice Drive, near Harry’s, Drake’s, Malone’s, Graeter’s Ice Cream and more. Like the one at 2099 Harrodsburg, the Hamburg spot will have a “UK room” showcasing the University of Kentucky Wildcats and artwork from local artists.\n\nAll will have the same menu and very similar design, usually with outdoor seating. The one in Richmond will have an enclosed patio, but it has five garage doors that can be opened to bring that “inside out” atmosphere, he said. The smaller location doesn’t a have a separate room, but will incorporate local artwork throughout, he said.\n\nThe restaurant chain is known for its relaxed vibe with tons of TVs for watching sports while you enjoy handmade pizza, calzones, grinders, saucy smoked wings, craft cocktails and extensive craft beer selection. Signature dishes include the Sriracha Bourbon BBQ Nachos.\n\nWhy so much expansion in Central Kentucky already? Because business is booming.\n\n“We have been blown away by the way the Lexington Market has welcomed us,” Robinson said. “It’s our No. 1 store out of all of them. It’s been really fun. I didn’t spend a lot of time in Lexington until that store opened, and it’s been fabulous.”\n\nBesides Lexington, there are three locations in Louisville and two in Indiana.\n\nRichmond made sense as well: “We think it’s an underserved market, and we think it’s fantastic.”\n\nAnd if you don’t live in Lexington or Richmond, don’t worry. PARLOUR might be coming your way soon with more growth in the works.\n\n“We’re looking at a couple of different markets,” Robinson said. “We hope to get another one or so open by the end of the year, then three or four a year.”\n\nNew Lexington restaurants opening in 2026: Downtown changes as south side grows\n\nNew Mexican restaurant, sports bar opening in familiar Lexington location\n\nParent of restaurant chain that started in Lexington files for bankruptcy\n\nNew family entertainment venue with ax throwing coming to Lexington\n\nNew Lexington pizza chain has made-from-scratch dough, sauces (including garlic)",

    "description": "A powerful Valentine’s Day storm destroyed a centuries-old seaside arch in southern Italy long associated with romance, dealing a blow to local tourism and highlighting concerns about coastal erosion ...",
    "fullText": "An Italian coastal beauty spot known as “Lovers’ Arch” because of its popularity with courting couples collapsed during heavy storms on Valentine’s Day in what one local official called “a blow to the heart.”\n\nFaraglioni di Sant’Andrea, the site of an arch in the stone cliffs on the coast of Salento — the heel of Italy’s “boot’ — has drawn romantically inclined visitors for centuries, with lovers traditionally proposing marriage, stealing first kisses or celebrating unions. Those who kissed under the arch were destined for eternal love, according to local legend.\n\nBut when a powerful storm swept across southern Italy over the weekend, the arch’s fragile structure gave way, reducing it to a pile of rubble.\n\nIts collapse has dealt a “devastating blow to the image of Salento and to tourism,” Maurizio Cisternino, mayor of the town of Melendugno, near the fallen arch, told CNN. “It’s a blow to the heart.”\n\nThe arch was formed by centuries of harsh wind and high seas grinding away at the Calcarenite stone cliffs of Italy’s Puglia region, on the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea. The site, once a strategic lookout used to warn of pirates, became a magnet for lovers during the late 18th century.\n\nInstagram photos have drawn thousands more couples to the arch in recent years, Cisternino said. Because it’s free and open to the public, it’s impossible to know exactly how many, he added.\n\nLorenzo Barlato, a local resident, proposed to his wife on the clifftop overlooking the arch more than 40 years ago and the pair often returned for anniversaries.\n\n“I couldn’t wait to return,” he posted on Facebook after Saturday’s collapse. “Now, unfortunately, all I have left are the many beautiful photos I took of that piece of paradise.”\n\nThe area is so popular that hotels and resorts — many named for the arch — have sprung up to accommodate visitors.\n\nWarmer sea temperatures as a result of climate change are seen as a factor in driving the extreme weather that battered the arch, which had already been damaged by Cyclone Harry in January.\n\nBut concern over the landmark’s fragility goes back years.\n\nIn 2024, local authorities applied for a $4.5 million grant to fund a preservation project to combat coastal erosion, but failed to secure the money, according to Cisternino.\n\n“It’s a tragedy we knew was inevitable, we just didn’t expect it to happen so soon,” he told local media on Sunday.\n\nHe told CNN that “nature has reclaimed the arch, just as it created it,” and said that resources were needed to tackle the situation along the coast.\n\n“Nature has been transformed: what was there 30 years ago is no longer there.”\n\nThe collapse follows weeks of violent storms across southern Italy. In Sicily, a landslide recently saw houses fall into a ravine in the town of Niscemi. Widespread flooding has taken the lives of several people, including a man who died when his home collapsed near Rome last week.\n\nNow gone, the remnants of the arch will be left to wash out at sea, the municipality says. “It’s like a funeral,” Puglia tourism councillor Francesco Stella said Sunday of what was once one of the happiest places in Italy.",

    "description": "Macclesfield's FA Cup odyssey may have ended against Brentford but they have made memories to last a lifetime, says chief football writer Phil McNulty.",
    "fullText": "The tifo stretched across the Star Lane end by Macclesfield's fans moments before the start of the FA Cup tie with Brentford was emblazoned with the message: \"Against All Odds\".\n\nIt was also displayed in the players' tunnel at Moss Rose as John Rooney's side walked out to attempt a repeat of the historic third-round win against Premier League opposition that left holders Crystal Palace embarrassed and beaten.\n\nAnd for 70 minutes on a freezing Cheshire night, Macclesfield suggested lightning could strike twice as they once again stood toe-to-toe with top-flight opposition, refusing to give an inch.\n\nIt was only then, as tired legs started to betray the National League North side and the gap of 116 places on the game's pyramid finally started to show, that one cruel moment took the dream away.\n\nSam Heathcote, the PE teacher who has been a hero of Macclesfield's FA Cup run, was the victim of the fates this great tournament can inflict along with its glory when he headed Aaron Hickey's cross into his own net.\n\nBrentford grabbed at the gift, even then surviving the odd anxious moment before they were finally able to celebrate victory.\n\nThe honours were Macclesfield's, as illustrated by Brentford head coach Keith Andrews graciously going into their dressing room to offer his personal tribute to their display, before speaking in glowing terms about their opponents.\n\nHe said: \"I love stories like Macclesfield's. They fill my heart. I though they were awesome and a real tribute to John Rooney and his coaching team.\"\n\nRooney, despite the disappointment, appreciated Andrews' words as he said: \"He told us he had seen real togetherness in our group and that's what we work on. We have a good changing room and it takes you a long way.\n\n183 team changes in 14 ties - but does it really matter for the FA Cup?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nMatheson on Old Trafford heroics, 'torrid time' as £1m teenager & McLeod death\n\n\"I really couldn't be prouder of the team. For us to go toe-to-toe with two Premier League teams and to only lose by an own goal is something I'm incredibly proud of.\n\n\"All the lads are down and Sam's the same obviously, having scored an own goal. It's natural, but every player knows what they have achieved for this club on this journey, so we should all be so proud.\n\n\"We now go back to our bread and butter in the league. We train twice a week and we've put that performance on against a Premier League side. How can you not be proud of that achievement?\n\n\"I started my football career at this club and I've started my managerial career at this club. We want to go on and get promoted. We want to try and get in the play-offs.\"\n\nMacclesfield's fans arrived in a blizzard of optimism, the rainbow that arced over this compact, atmospheric stadium after a storm two hours before kick-off offering up an omen that they could claim another pot of gold.\n\nAnd how they revelled in another visit from a Premier League team, chanting \"West Ham away\" after hearing the fifth round draw, then \"are you Palace in disguise\" as they tore into Brentford - both physically and with their football - in the opening exchanges.\n\nMacclesfield captain Paul Dawson, a goal hero in the 2-1 win against Palace, was inches away from a repeat with a 20-yard shot that was just off target.\n\nEvery classic FA Cup ingredient was in this mix. The non-league side with a collection of PE teachers, podcasters and property developers in their squad shaking up elite opposition, with the added factor of Moss Rose's 4G artificial surface.\n\nThere was nothing artificial about the atmosphere as every Macclesfield fan scented another shock in the cold night air.\n\nFew other competitions can offer up such a spectacle and the FA Cup delivered again.\n\nIn some respects, the half-time whistle came at a bad time for Macclesfield as it disturbed their momentum and allowed Brentford to take a breath and regroup.\n\nBrentford head coach Andrews made seven changes, leaving his big attacking weapon Igor Thiago out altogether. It was a high-risk strategy and there were moments in the first 45 minutes when it looked like it might backfire.\n\nAnd even after suffering the devastating blow of Heathcote's own goal, Macclesfield refused to allow Brentford to simply shut the game down, forcing several desperate clearances in the area before referee Darren England sounded the final whistle on this FA Cup odyssey.\n\nMacclesfield will now return to their real world against King's Lynn Town on Saturday - but they have created FA Cup memories that will live forever with players and fans of a club on the rise.\n\nBrentford edge past non-league Macclesfield after second-half own goal\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil begins.\n\nSarina Wiegman's side travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThere are just eight international camps before England hope to be in Brazil for the World Cup - so they will want to ensure there are no slip-ups in their first qualifying matches of the year.\n\nEngland have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.\n\nWiegman will name her squad for the first time in 2026 on Tuesday at 11:00 - who might feature and what are the key decisions for the Dutchwoman?\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nEngland have not had a competitive fixture since winning Euro 2025 as they beat China 8-0 and Ghana 2-0 in friendly matches at the end of last year.\n\nBefore that, they suffered a 2-1 defeat by Brazil on their homecoming return but recorded a 3-0 win over Australia three days later.\n\nThe matches gave Wiegman an opportunity to test new players and formations - handing a debut to 30-year-old goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse in the process.\n\nAmong those to receive their first senior call-ups to the squad were defenders Anouk Denton, Taylor Hinds and forward Freya Godfrey.\n\nThere was also time for England stars Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren James to recover from lengthy injuries.\n\nChelsea defender Millie Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, announced her retirement in October having withdrawn from the Euros.\n\nThere was a serious blow for Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang - one of England's key players in Switzerland - as she was carried off on a stretcher after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during the win over Australia.\n\nBut it's been a successful time for the other Lionesses in Arsenal's squad, including captain Williamson, who lifted the Champions Cup in February.\n\nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was named the world's best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards in September, as Wiegman picked up the best coach award.\n\nHampton also wrapped up the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award in November after being caught up in the fallout of Mary Earps' autobiography, which was released earlier that month.\n\nMost of Wiegman's key players have returned from injury in recent weeks - but there will still be some noteable absentees.\n\nManchester United midfielder Ella Toone is out with a hip issue until the end of March so will not feature against Ukraine or Iceland.\n\nThere are not many midfield options available with Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns also absent, while team-mate Lucia Kendall came off the bench to play 28 minutes of Villa's 7-3 thrashing by Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance in five weeks due to a thigh injury.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal winger Beth Mead fractured her shin so is out but Chloe Kelly made her return at the end of January and is available for selection.\n\nArsenal defender Hinds has had an ankle injury that has kept her out for a few weeks but she could still be included.\n\nChelsea full-back Niamh Charles is also sidelined with an ankle injury but team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones came on as an 83rd-minute substitute in their win over Liverpool on Sunday so her return is timely.\n\nTottenham full-back Ella Morris is close to returning from the ACL injury she suffered last year but will not be back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Agyemang and Arsenal defender Katie Reid are still recovering from their respective ACL injuries.\n\nThere remains a lack of full-back options for Wiegman with Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier seen as back-up for Bronze despite playing her club football at centre-back every week.\n\nCharles' absence and Hinds' recent injury means there are limited options at left-back too - meaning Manchester City's Alex Greenwood could once again make the switch from centre-back to full-back.\n\nThere could be a recall for Bay FC's Anouk Denton, who moved to the American club from West Ham in February, two months after making her England debut.\n\nLondon City Lionesses forward Godfrey has impressed this season and Wiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to see her grab an assist in a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.\n\nThe 20-year-old was called up for the first time in November but remains uncapped - so she will hope to feature this time around.\n\nTeam-mate Izzy Goodwin could be a surprise call-up in Beth Mead's absence, though Chelsea's James is back so Wiegman has other attacking options.\n\nWiegman will need to manage players like Kelly, Bronze and Keira Walsh who have not been fully fit in recent weeks and they may not be able to start both games.\n\nBut she will have been boosted by James' impressive display for Chelsea on Sunday, while Jess Park has shone for United and Lauren Hemp for Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "Coco Gauff says it is \"tough to wake up\" and see what is happening back home in the United States and she will continue to speak out about issues that matter to her.\n\nThe two-time Grand Slam singles champion is among a host of American athletes who have voiced their displeasure with US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nProtests have taken place across the United States since Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed in Minneapolis last month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\n\nGauff, 21, spends most of the year competing overseas and the world number five learned of their deaths while in Australia for the first Grand Slam of the year.\n\n\"I don't think people should be dying in the streets just for existing,\" Gauff told reporters in Dubai, where she is set to compete this week.\n\n\"It is tough to wake up and see something because I do care a lot about our country. I think people think I don't for some reason, but I do. I'm very proud to be American.\n\n\"You don't have to represent the entire values of what's going on in the leadership. I think there's a lot of people around that believe in the things I believe in, believe in diversity and equality.\"\n\nWhen asked about issues in the US during the Australian Open, Gauff called for \"more peace and kindness\" in America.\n\nCompatriot Madison Keys championed immigrants and the diversity they have brought to the US, saying she hopes the country \"can come together\".\n\nTeam GB skier Gus Kenworthy, who grew up in America, said he has received death threats after posting an anti-ICE message on social media.\n\nSpeaking at the Winter Olympics, freestyle skier Hunter Hess added that \"just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US\", and President Trump responded by calling him a \"real loser\".\n\nBea Kim said the US is \"very divided\" but \"diversity is what makes us a very strong country\", while fellow snowboarder Maddie Mastro said she is \"saddened with what's happening at home. I feel like we can't turn a blind eye to that.\"\n\nChloe Kim, a silver medalist in Milan-Cortina, feels that athletes should be \"allowed to voice our opinions on what's going on. And I think that we need to lead with love and compassion.\"\n\nGauff says she feels confident giving honest answers when asked about politics, partly because of her maternal grandmother.\n\nYvonne Lee Odom helped desegregate public schools in the 1960s, becoming the first black student to attend public school in Delray Beach, Florida.\n\n\"My grandma is literally an activist,\" Gauff added. \"This is literally my life.

    "fullText": "Freestyle skier Kirsty Muir once again came heartbreakingly close to a Winter Olympic medal for Team GB with her second fourth-place finish of the Games.\n\nCompeting in the big air, Muir scored a combined 174.75 points from her best two runs, 3.5 points shy of Italian bronze medallist Flora Tabanelli.\n\nIt comes exactly a week after the 21-year-old missed out on slopestyle bronze by just 0.41 points.\n\nCanada's Megan Oldham won gold with China's defending champion Eileen Gu - competing in a big air competition for the first time since winning the Olympic title four years ago - settling for silver this time.\n\n\"I'm really proud of myself for putting the two tricks down that I did, and also going for it in that third run because I've never landed that trick before,\" Muir, competing at her second Games, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I just had to go for it, and yes I crashed out, but I'm still proud of myself.\"\n\nThe final had been delayed by more than an hour after a heavy blizzard set in at Livigno Snow Park, while Mathilde Gremaud, a big favourite for a medal, was one of two Swiss skiers to withdraw last-minute through injury.\n\nThat looked to have opened up the field for Muir, who had qualified in fourth for the final.\n\nBut in an astonishing first round, four skiers posted scores of 90.00 points or more, with Muir languishing in seventh and knowing she needed to go big.\n\nShe did just that, posting 93.00 with a 1620 trick, featuring four and a half rotations, the highest score of the second run and one that catapulted her up the standings into silver medal position.\n\nAt that point Gu, already a silver medallist in the slopestyle at these Games, was way off the pace having struggled with her second attempt, but she made amends on her final jump to bump Muir down into third.\n\nThe Chinese star - the fourth-highest paid female athlete in the world - celebrated like her medal was confirmed at that point, despite plenty of skiers waiting in the wings to nudge her off the podium.\n\nAs it proved, they couldn't do that, though Tabanelli's final jump of 94.25 points - the biggest score of the night - came just 0.75 points shy of silver medal position.\n\nThat piled the pressure on Muir's third and final jump.\n\nShe took her time at the top of the big air structure, talking through her options with her coach and decided to go for another 1620 trick with a different grab, but ultimately could not land her effort, leaving her lost in her thoughts of what might have been as she sat on the snow.\n\n\"When the scores came in for the other girls, I knew I had to give it something really, really good to try and get on that podium, so I'm stoked that I did try that,\" she said.\n\nGB men's curlers' semi-final hopes on line after shock defeat\n\nGB slalom legend Ryding bids farewell to Olympics\n\nIt marks an agonising fifth fourth-place finish for Team GB at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, with time running out to hit the minimum target of four medals set before the Games by UK Sport.\n\nIn addition to Muir's two near-misses, snowboarder Mia Brookes finished fourth in the big air, while the same position was reached by Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds in the mixed doubles curling, and Marcus Wyatt and Freya Tarbit in the mixed team skeleton.\n\nBrookes had been expected to contest for the medals in Tuesday's slopestyle final but failed to qualify, while both GB's men's and women's rinks face uphill battles to reach the semi-finals in their respective curling finals.\n\nHigh hopes remain with freestyle skier Zoe Atkin, who is the current halfpipe world champion. She starts her campaign with qualifying on Thursday, with the final set to take place on Saturday.\n\nShould GB reach the target of five, the team would equal its record haul from a Winter Olympics, achieved at both the 2014 and 2018 Games.\n\nBut even if it doesn't, these Olympics should still be seen as a success for the nation.\n\nSo far, three gold medals have been won, a historic achievement given Team GB had never before won more than one at a single Games.\n\nThat total includes a first Olympic gold on snow, from Huw Nightingale and Charlotte Bankes in the mixed team snowboard cross, in addition to double gold from Matt Weston in the skeleton, the second of those coming in the mixed team event with Tabby Stoecker.\n\nWhy first gold on snow has been just a matter of time\n\nWhy are Team GB so good at skeleton?\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "A storm system moving across Southern California brought rain to the desert and snow to the nearby mountains Monday, Feb. 16, with more precipitation expected over the next couple days.\n\nCloudy skies and steady rain arrived around midday in western parts of the Coachella Valley, with cooler temperatures than in recent days.\n\n“We’re kind of seeing the brunt of (the storms) move through at the moment,” Chandler Price, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s San Diego office, said Monday afternoon.\n\n“After that, we’re going to get showers through tomorrow (Tuesday) morning, then lightening up mid-to-late morning, then probably like 10 hours of sort of clear skies before the next (system) comes roaring in late Tuesday into early Wednesday,” he added.\n\nAs of about 3 p.m. Monday, the Palm Springs International Airport had recorded 0.10 inches of rainfall, while in the mid-valley, Thousand Palms had seen 0.12 inches.\n\nTo the east, Indian Palms Country Club in Indio had recorded just a trace of rain — 0.02 inches — as of Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Riverside area had seen a wider range of rainfall totals as of 3 p.m.\n\nThe northern side of Riverside had recorded about 0.15 inches of rainfall, while Jurupa Valley, located just west of Riverside, had seen 0.57 inches so far.\n\n“It’s a pretty big range there (in Riverside),” Price said.\n\nIn the nearby San Jacinto and San Gorgonio mountains, a winter storm warning is in effect until noon Wednesday, with the areas potentially seeing up to 3 feet of snow at higher elevation levels.\n\n“Travel could be very difficult to impossible,” the weather service said in its winter weather advisory. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday evening and Tuesday morning commutes. Very strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.”\n\nPrice said snow was starting to cover the roads in the Idyllwild-Pine Cove area above 6,000 feet as of Monday afternoon, but he added the weather service did not yet have exact precipitation totals.\n\nThe Big Bear area was also seeing snowfall Monday afternoon, though exact totals were not yet available. At a slightly lower elevation than Big Bear, Lake Arrowhead had recorded 2 inches of rain as of 3 p.m.\n\nPrice said Palm Springs could see another tenth of an inch of rain through Tuesday morning, with less precipitation expected in the central and southern parts of the valley.\n\nRiverside and the rest of the Inland Empire will likely see higher precipitation levels, potentially up to an inch through early Wednesday.\n\n“It’s really going to start dying down after 6 a.m. Wednesday, and then by noon, we’re looking at completely dry (conditions),” Price said.\n\nOvernight lows will stay in the 40s throughout most of Riverside County this week.\n\nAnother system could hit the region Thursday, potentially bringing more rain to the Inland Empire, though Price said it will likely be weaker than the storms earlier in the week.\n\nCity News Service contributed to this report.\n\nTom Coulter is a reporter for The Desert Sun.

    "description": "\"This amendment creates a narrow, commonsense check to ensure the pardon power is used fairly and responsibly regardless of who occupies the White House\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn before departing the White House, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, in Washington. \n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-NE) signed on Monday to co-sponsor a Democrat-led bill to amend the U.S. Constitution to give Congress oversight of presidential pardons, a measure aimed at pushing back at President Donald Trump’s highly controversial use of the presidential pardon power.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Rep. Johnny Olszewski (D-MD) last December and would allow for a minimum of 20 House members and five senators to call for congressional review of a pardon, which would lead to a 60-day deadline for Congress to nullify that pardon with a two-thirds majority vote – similar to a veto override.\n\nOlszewski announced his bill, the Pardon Integrity Act, in a floor speech listing off some of Trump’s most controversial pardons, including a blanket pardon for all January 6th rioters – including those who violently attacked police officers.\n\n“None of us should accept it as normal practice that a president, any president, used their executive pardon power to absolve convicted drug kingpins, those found guilty of violently attacking law enforcement officers, and even a money laundering crypto magnate with ties to the president’s family business,” Olszewski said in his speech, adding:\n\nYet, this is exactly what President Trump did. On his first day back in office, President Trump pardoned 1,500 people involved in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Since then, he’s pardoned or commuted the sentences of nearly 90 others. Just recently, he added former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to that list. Hernandez was serving a 45-year prison sentence for conspiring to smuggle more than 400 tons or 4.5 billion doses of cocaine into the US. Hernandez was also convicted of accepting bribes from violent drug cartel members to fuel his political career, shielding them from prosecution in exchange for their bribes\n\nOlszewski announced Bacon joining his bill, writing, “The Constitution does not give any president the authority to place themselves above the law. I’m proud to have Congressman Bacon join this effort, because safeguarding democracy and upholding justice should never be a partisan issue. When the pardon power is abused to protect criminals and political allies, Congress has a responsibility to act.”\n\nNo more get out of jail free cards for the wealthy and well-connected. pic.twitter.com/kcwDB3RSjy\n\n— Rep. Johnny Olszewski (@RepJohnnyO) December 19, 2025\n\n“This amendment creates a narrow, commonsense check to ensure the pardon power is used fairly and responsibly regardless of who occupies the White House,” he added.\n\nBacon, a former Air Force general who is not seeking reelection in his swing district, added, “Presidential pardons are an important constitutional authority, but like all powers held by the executive branch, these authorities benefit from the appropriate checks and balances the Constitution envisioned. Across multiple administrations, we’ve seen legitimate questions raised about how this authority has been used at the same time, the ability of Congress to provide oversight has weakened.\n\n“Frankly, it is clear to me the pardon authority has been abused. I’m pleased to cosponsor Rep. Olszewski’s Pardon Integrity Act, a constitutional amendment that establishes a narrow, commonsense guardrail that preserves the pardon power while ensuring Congress can fulfill its constitutional role to provide accountability and uphold the rule of law,” concluded Bacon in a statement. Bacon’s support for the measure followed Trump’s pardon of several NFL players who had been convicted of various crimes, including drug trafficking.\n\nBacon is also behind a bipartisan bill to return the power to levy tariffs solely to Congress, adhering to the original wording of the Constitution.\n\nThe post Republican Joins With Dems on Constitutional Amendment to Give Congress Power to Reject Trump Pardons first appeared on Mediaite.",
