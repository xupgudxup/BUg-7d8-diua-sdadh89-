    "fullText": "The major trading card authenticators graded more than 26 million cards in 2025, according to year-end data released by grading tracker GemRate.\n\nAccording to GemRate, which tracks population reports for PSA, CGC, SGC, Beckett, TAG and others, collectors graded 26.6 million cards in 2025 — the most recorded in a single year by GemRate since its launch in 2022.\n\nGemRate | 2025 Grading Year in Review\n\n— 26.8 million cards were graded across the major graders in 2025. Total cards graded were ⬆32% compared to 2024 (20 million).\n\n— 16.8 million TCG/non-sport cards (⬆95% YoY) and 10.0 million sports cards (⬇12% YoY) were graded in 2025.… pic.twitter.com/0513T4379s\n\n— GemRate (@gemrate) January 3, 2026\n\nPSA led the way among the major authenticators with 19.26 million cards graded, which represented a 26% increase year-over-year.\n\nCGC Cards finished second among the major graders with 4.92 million cards graded.\n\nSGC graded 1.42 million, Beckett graded more than 824,000, and TAG graded more than 440,000.\n\nLast year’s grading totals represented all-time records in a single year for PSA, CGC and TAG.\n\nPSA captured 72% of the overall market share, including 76% of sports cards and 69% of TCG.\n\nFollowing recent acquisitions of SGC and Beckett, PSA parent company Collectors and its brand held roughly an 80% market share in 2025.\n\nLargely driven by interest in Pokémon cards, TCG and non-sports grading (16.8 million) overtook sports card grading (10 million) in 2025. Pokémon was the year’s most popular single category with more than 16.1 million cards graded. Baseball finished with 3.6 million, football with 3.0 million and basketball with 2.1 million.\n\nPSA’s record year arrived alongside massive changes for the company, which included a lucrative partnership with video-game retailer GameStop. PSA and GameStop first partnered in May 2024 with the retailer buying PSA-graded cards for cash or store credit.\n\nThe two brands expanded the relationship in October 2024 when GameStop began accepting grading submissions at select retail locations. That collaboration hit 1 million graded cards in May 2025, and has proven to be especially profitable for GameStop, which now counts collectibles among its biggest revenue drivers.\n\nCGC Cards’ 4.92 million cards represented the largest percentage growth among the major graders with a 121% increase year-over-year. That growth was largely driven by the company’s success among Pokémon collectors — CGC captured 25% of the TCG market in 2025, second behind only PSA.\n\nSGC had the largest decrease in business last year, with its 1.42 million cards a 24% drop year-over-year. Acquired by Collectors in February 2024, SGC began to see a sharp decline in monthly grading volume following the resignation of prescient Peter Steinberg in July.\n\nPSA president Ryan Hoge, who now oversees grading operations for both PSA and SGC, said in July that SGC would be scaled down into a “boutique” brand.\n\nBeckett Grading Services’ more than 824,000 graded cards last year is the most during the GemRate era and a 26% increase year-over-year. The majority of Beckett’s business came from TCG and non-sports collectors, with hobbyists often coveting the brand’s elusive BGS 10 Black Label — a grade given only to cards with perfect 10 scores for centering, corners, edges and surface.\n\nBeckett’s grading services, media and magazines businesses were acquired by Collectors in December.\n\nTAG, which touts its use of technology over manual grading by humans, graded more than 440,000 cards in 2025 for an 83% increase year-over-year.\n\nWant more stories like this? \n\nBen Burrows is a reporter and editor for cllct, the premier company for collectible culture.

Happy New Year!\n\nThe Lakers finished December 2025 with a 5-7 record.\n\nAlthough the team was hopeful to find better chemistry with LeBron James back in the mix full-time after his rare absence early on, it simply hasn’t clicked yet for the Lakers.\n\nDefensively, the Lakers have been struggling all season long and they continue to trend in the wrong direction. The head coach, JJ Redick, reached a breaking point, calling out his team for its lack of execution, and the players aren’t exactly pushing back.\n\nThe seven losses occurred against the Phoenix Suns, Boston Celtics, San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Clippers, Houston Rockets, and the Detroit Pistons. Everybody listed is within the postseason picture for the time being, which isn’t a great look for a Lakers team that wants to contend for a title.\n\nThe Lakers are back on the court on Saturday night to take on the Memphis Grizzlies.

    "fullText": "Russell Westbrook has another place in the NBA record books.\n\nThe former MVP reached 26,711 career points on Friday, passing Oscar Robertson to become the NBA's all-time scoring leader among point guards. Robertson was previously the top scorer at the position with 26,710 points.\n\nWestbrook finished the game with 17 points on 6-of-12 shooting, 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 4 turnovers in the Sacramento Kings' 129-102 loss to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nBrodie passes The Big O 👑 \n\nCongrats to @russwest44 for becoming the NBA's all-time leading scorer for a point guard. pic.twitter.com/GOeQmKihE8\n\n— Sacramento Kings (@SacramentoKings) January 3, 2026\n\nWestbrook was already the NBA's all-time leader in triple-doubles and in rebounds among guards. He is seventh on the all-time assists leaderboard, and is on pace to pass Mark Jackson and Steve Nash for fifth by the end of the season.\n\nOf course, with the scoring record, the point guard distinction is an unofficial one. There are now 14 players ahead of Westbrook on the NBA's all-time leading scorer list and only three of them are guards: Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, James Harden. Jordan and Bryant are both quintessential shooting guards, while Harden has spent his career in more of a combo role.\n\nWestbrook has spent his post-Oklahoma City Thunder career as something of a journeyman, joining the Kings this season on a one-year, $3.6 million contract (aka the veteran minimum). He has still averaged double-digit points in every season of his career and currently ranks fourth on the Kings with 14.4 points per game, his highest output since the 2022-23 season.\n\nHe also entered Friday shooting 42.3% from the field, his worst mark since 2010, but that's partially offset by a career high 35.3% clip from 3-point range.\n\nIt was a tough night if you hate seeing less-heralded Oscar Robertson records go down, as Giannis Antetokounmpo surpassed him to become the all-time leader in 30-10-5 games.

    "fullText": "Paul Finebaum has hidden message for Indiana football, Big Ten after Alabama Rose Bowl win originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSEC Network pundit Paul Finebaum is essentially out on the Kalen DeBoer experiment for the Alabama Crimson Tide, thanks in large part to their 38-3 Rose Bowl loss on New Year's Day to the undefeated Big Ten champion Indiana Hoosiers.\n\nFinebaum sounded off about the Crimson Tide's shortcomings during a recent episode of \"The Paul Finebaum Show\" while also giving the Hoosiers the smallest bit of credit he could.\n\n“But this just felt like the beginning – this wasn’t the beginning,\" Finebaum said. \"This was a continuum. We’ve seen this movie before. Every time DeBoer would have one of these, he would make up for it. This game was different, but the Georgia game in Atlanta was an absolute bludgeoning, except he was able to turn that Oklahoma game around – by the way, against an Oklahoma team that probably had no business being in the playoff, either.”\n\nThe Crimson Tide's loss marked the end of a short-lived College Football Playoff run, one that would have been unimaginable under former coach Nick Saban, Finebaum added.\n\n\"You knew, walking out of that stadium in Santa Clara [in 2019 against Clemson], Alabama would win again,\" Finebaum said. \"[Nick] Saban was still going to be great. It was just an incredibly bad night. Those happened very rarely.\"\n\nTransitioning to the present day, those games have appeared to become a norm for a Crimson Tide team playing a complete polar opposite to the Hoosiers, as they advanced to the semifinal and will rematch the Oregon Ducks in the Peach Bowl.\n\nThe Hoosiers stunned the Ducks in Eugene during the regular-season, as the winner is going to advance to the national title game against either the Ole Miss Rebels or Miami Hurricanesin the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the SEC and Big Ten are left standing come the night of the title game, but perhaps the Crimson Tide ran into the Hoosiers' buzzsaw at the worst possible time.\n\nIn a few weeks, we'll find out.",

But their priorities now lie in midfield, with the club aiming to sign at least one top central midfielder in 2026.\n\nCasemiro cannot be relied on to play every game at 33, while Manuel Ugarte has flopped since making the move to Manchester in the summer of 2024.\n\nThere are speculations over Kobbie Mainoo’s future at United, despite his desire to stay and fight for his place.\n\nBruno Fernandes could also leave the club next summer due to the attractive release clause in his contract.\n\nBesides Baleba, United have three other Premier League midfielders on their shortlist too.\n\nNottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Joao Gomes have all been linked.\n\nBut a deal for any of them is expected to cost them heavily, and it remains to be seen whether they can afford to spend a lot.",

The stakes could not be higher, and the winner of this NFC South duel not only could capture the division but also claim the final playoff spot in the NFC.\n\nHowever, with the Atlanta Falcons winning in Week 18, there is a chance the Bucs win Saturday and still miss the playoffs.

    "title": "On This Day (2nd Jan 2009): Sunderland Edge Past Bolton in FA Cup Relief",
    "description": "Some light relief for Ricky Sbragia’s Sunderland in the FA Cup away at Bolton Wanderers…",
    "fullText": "It was less than two months before that a heavy defeat against the same opposition resulted in the departure of Roy Keane as Sunderland manager.\n\nKeane’s departure was a blow to a fanbase who had newfound hope under the Irishman’s tenure, but in truth it appeared to be a tenure by fear and frustration rather than a harmonious stewardship.\n\nKeane’s iron-fist approach was at odds with the tenure that followed in the form of Ricky Sbragia. Sbragia was an assistant to Keane, and his natural “softer” nature appeared to be getting a tune out of a squad of disenchanted footballers.\n\nAfter a run of decent results that saw the team pick up wins against West Brom and Hull City and a draw with Blackburn Rovers, the team had steadied the ship somewhat.\n\nA post-Christmas heavy defeat to Everton sparked fears of a return to some of the results that the team were getting at the end of the Keane era, with Sbragia speaking in the media ahead of the FA Cup clash on this day in 2009 that a response was needed.\n\nIndeed a response is what he got as second-half goals from strike duo Kenwyne Jones and Djibril Cissé earned the team a 2-1 win at the Stadium of Light in a game that wouldn’t be remembered long after.\n\nDescribed by the BBC as a “lifeless” first half, there was barely a chance created by either team although Wanderers defender Ricardo Gardner did have to clear off the line from El-Hadji Diouf’s corner which had caused panic in the box.\n\nThe second half was littered with mistakes too, but there was at least some goalmouth action as the home side earned themselves a two-goal lead with both goals coming from set-pieces.\n\nIn a moment of rare quality, Jones put the Black Cats in front when he headed home from a pinpoint centre by Kieran Richardson ten minutes after the half-time interval.\n\nAnd with the momentum with the home side, Cissé added a second when he volleyed in acrobatically from a Carlos Edwards cross to solidify the team’s lead.\n\nMuch had been made about the relationship between the two strikers at this time, but things appeared to be rosy in the garden as they celebrated both goals together with their dance routine that had become common around that time.\n\nLate on, Bolton pulled one back when substitute Ebi Smolarek’s effort deflected past Márton Fülöp to heap pressure on a vulnerable Sunderland side.\n\nDespite the away side’s efforts – which included sending goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen forward – Sunderland held firm with midfielder Teemu Tainio particularly showing maturity near the end when things were looking quite uncertain.\n\nThe win entered Sunderland into the fourth-round draw, but Sbragia was particularly happy with the response to the 3-0 hammering that Everton had given his team only days earlier.\n\n“I am delighted that after a bad performance at Everton we got back on track. It is great to go through.\n\n“I was reminded yesterday we hadn’t qualified for the fourth round for three years. We changed it around a little bit and I felt that team we put out there could see us through it.\n\n“I’m pleased with that and I’m pleased for the players.”\n\nThe win was a welcome one for Sunderland, though results wouldn’t significantly pick up under Sbragia’s tenure to keep us away from safety in the league, with a nervy ending to the season only seeing survival occur on the final day despite losing to Chelsea 3-2.",

Jamal Murray led the visitors with 34 points but had just six in the second half.\n\n\"I feel like the first three quarters, we just really weren't ourselves,\" Mitchell said after the Cavaliers' third straight win, adding that the key to keeping the victories coming was \"to be that team we were defensively -- we know we can be and everything else takes care of itself.\"\n\nDe'Aaron Fox scored 24 points and grabbed seven rebounds to lead the short-handed San Antonio Spurs to a 123-113 victory over the reeling Indiana Pacers.\n\nSan Antonio's French superstar Victor Wembanyama skipped the trip to Indianapolis after hyperextending his left knee in a win over the New York Knicks on Wednesday.\n\nSpurs coach Mitch Johnson said Wembanyama could return for Saturday's home game against the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nPascal Siakam scored 23 points for the Pacers, who trailed the entire second half on the way to an 11th straight defeat.\n\nAtlanta forward Jalen Johnson's seventh triple-double of the season propelled the Hawks to a 111-99 victory over the Knicks in New York.\n\nJohnson scored 18 points with 10 rebounds and 11 assists and Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Onyeka Okongwu added 23 points apiece for the Hawks.\n\nJalen Brunson scored 24 points to lead the Knicks, who heard boos from a Madison Square Garden crowd unwilling to make allowances for a team missing Karl-Anthony Towns and Mitchell Robinson.",

    "fullText": "The Rangers’ offense has struggled this season.\n\nOn Friday, though, their stars picked one of the best nights to deliver.\n\nLed by Mika Zibanejad and Artemi Panarin, the Rangers pulled out a commanding 5-1 victory over the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers in the 2026 NHL Winter Classic.\n\nNew York improved to a perfect 6-0-0 all-time in outdoor games.\n\n“Our best players were our very best players tonight,” head coach Mike Sullivan said.\n\nZibanejad scored three times and picked up assists on New York’s other two goals, giving him the first-ever hat trick and five-point game in Winter Classic history.\n\nThat, of course, came just hours after he was named an alternate captain for Team Sweden.\n\nThe other goals came off the stick of Panarin, the second of which was the dagger from the high slot on the power play after Florida cut the deficit down to two in the third period.\n\nPanarin also picked up the secondary helper on Zibanejad’s first of the night.\n\n“It’s hard to express how much [Mika] means to this group,” Sullivan said. “And the contribution that he has to helping us have success when he has a game like tonight -- he’s the type of player that can will our group to win.”\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the two of them who delivered on the night, as Alexis Lafreniere and Vincent Trocheck also enjoyed themselves strong showings under the bright lights at loanDepot Park.\n\nLafreniere put together easily one of his strongest performances of the season, dishing out a career-high three assists on New York's first three goals of the game.\n\nTrocheck picked up helpers on the final two (excluding the empty-netter), the first of which was a beautiful feed from the seat of his own pants, setting up Lafreniere before he found a driving Zibanejad.\n\n“That one was a good one, he surprised me with that pass a little,” Lafreniere said.\n\nThose five accounted for all 13 of the team’s points on the night.\n\nAnd of course between the pipes, Igor Shesterkin made sure to make the most of the rare goal support, stopping 36 of the 37 shots he faced in the second outdoor victory of his career.\n\nComing off a three-game losing streak, this is an effort the Blueshirts are looking to build off of.\n\n“We’re hoping this can be a start to something good for us,” Zibanejad said.",

    "description": "When self-driving cars make headlines, it’s usually because something went wrong — a glitch, a failure, an accident.This story is different.On a dark, isolated",
    "fullText": "When self-driving cars make headlines, it’s usually because something went wrong — a glitch, a failure, an accident.\n\nOn a dark, isolated stretch of Highway 54 in New Mexico, Clifford Lee believes he’s alive today not because of his own reflexes — but because his Tesla Cybertruck, operating in Full Self-Driving mode, made a split-second decision for him.\n\n“I almost got killed,” Lee said. “I was shaking uncontrollably for a while.”\n\nLee was traveling northbound on a two-lane highway, cruising at about 75 miles per hour, using Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system — known as FSD — during a long road trip.\n\nAhead of him, a semi-truck approached in the opposite lane. Behind it, a pickup truck attempted a dangerous pass.\n\n“All I saw were headlights,” Lee said.\n\nWith only seconds to react, Lee realized the pickup wasn’t going to make it back into its lane in time.\n\n“I think it was like five seconds out,” he said. “Around three seconds, I realized he would not make it.”\n\nLee says he tried to steer away — but the Cybertruck was already moving.\n\nThe Cybertruck recorded the entire event. In the video you can clearly see there was no room for error. An overcorrection would’ve bounced Lee’s Cybertruck off the guardrail and possibly back into oncoming traffic.\n\nSlowed down frame by frame, the video shows the Cybertruck making a precise maneuver — avoiding what could have been a deadly head-on collision.\n\n“I’m so convinced it was FSD,” Lee said.\n\nThe only damage: a shattered side window and a broken mirror.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system relies entirely on cameras — mounted in door pillars, fenders, and around the vehicle — to interpret the world in real time.\n\n“I use it every day,” said Cybertruck owner Aaron George. “I feel so much safer with FSD.”\n\nGeorge demonstrated the system for CBS Austin, starting at the station’s parking lot and setting a destination to Mount Bonnell — a route filled with tricky merges, construction zones, narrow neighborhood streets, and blind intersections.\n\nAt one busy frontage road, the Cybertruck waited for the safest window of opportunity before merging smoothly into traffic.\n\nAt stoplights, the screen displayed every surrounding vehicle — cars, trucks, vans — even those behind the truck.\n\nAs the drive continued, the system navigated tight residential roads, avoided trash cans in the street, detected pedestrians, and cautiously inched forward at blind intersections before turning.\n\n“It’s pretty blinded over there,” George noted at one intersection. “It inched up, saw there were no cars, and made the turn.”\n\nWhen we arrived at Mount Bonnell, the Cybertruck located an open parking spot and backed in— without George ever touching the wheel.\n\n“It’s amazing,” he said. “Every iteration is mind-blowing.”\n\nTesla is currently rolling out Full Self-Driving (Supervised) version 14.\n\nFor many drivers, Full Self-Driving is about convenience. For Clifford Lee, it’s something far more personal.\n\n“I realized this is my second life already,” he said.\n\nLee believes a full-speed impact — closing at a combined speed of nearly 150 miles per hour — would have been unsurvivable.\n\n“There’s no chance I would have survived that,” he said.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system still requires driver supervision, and federal regulators continue to scrutinize the technology. But for one driver on a lonely highway in New Mexico, a decision made in a fraction of a second may have made all the difference.",

    "description": "What is the current status of democracy in the world?",
    "fullText": "What is the current status of democracy in the world?\n\nIn its 2025 report, V-Dem, a Swedish independent research organization, concluded there were more dictatorial states (91) than democracies (88) for the first time since 2002.\n\nThe report warned that those numbers underscore the serious decline of democracy around the world.\n\nAfter an apparent victory over communism with the end of the Cold War, democracy now faces a major challenge.\n\nThe benefits of globalization did not reach all citizens, leading to a maldistribution of wealth.\n\nThe dissatisfaction and hatred toward existing political parties and society of those who feel left behind have been amplified through social media, widening the division.\n\nOn the other hand, authoritarian governments monitor their citizens to shut off opposing opinions. Under tight state control, decisions are quickly made, giving the impression of “efficiency.”\n\nMany people likely hold doubts as to whether democracy is something that should be protected.\n\nThe values of this government system can be found in “Democracy,” a textbook for junior and senior high schools that was published by the old education ministry soon after the end of World War II.\n\nAt that time, expectations for a fresh start in Japan were heightened as the people were liberated from oppression and a lack of freedom.\n\nSTRENGTHS OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONS\n\nIn a democracy, where citizens are respected as individuals, a major strength is the freedom and equality that lie in its roots.\n\nWhile time may be required to thoroughly discuss all decisions on policy matters, democracy does have the ability to correct mistakes.\n\nFor example, elections can oust corrupt politicians.\n\nAnd policy toward the Vietnam War by the United States, which had covered up the facts, changed course through the outcry of its citizens.\n\nIn dictatorships, those in power shut down those who criticize government mistakes, making corrections impossible to achieve.\n\nThe website for the American Center managed by the U.S. State Department and U.S. Embassy once had a section that defined democracy as a system placing the government under the control of laws and allowing all citizens equal protection under the law.\n\nThe section also explained that majority rule was respected in a democracy, but that the fundamental rights of individuals and minority groups would be earnestly protected.\n\nBut in 2025, the pages containing such definitions were deleted. It is not clear if the deletions were related to the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough the United States led the way after World War II in creating an international order based on the rule of law, the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy released in November declared, “The days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.”\n\nTrump is also moving to destroy the separation of powers, brazenly interfering in the judicial branch by firing prosecutors who previously investigated allegations against him.\n\nIn our New Year editorial for 2023, we expressed concerns about the decline of democracy, but we also displayed expectations for its recovery.\n\nThe situation, however, has worsened since then.\n\nAfter the Trump administration ended overseas support activities through the U.S. Agency for International Development, assistance toward democratic movements in Southeast Asia has stalled to the advantage of China and Russia.\n\nIn European nations, such as Germany and France, ultraright, anti-immigrant parties have increased their popularity.\n\nIn its 2022 report, the U.S. nongovernmental organization Freedom House listed four indices for determining if democratic nations were moving toward authoritarianism.\n\nThe first was “undermining the rule of law” by politicians and governments through the weakening of judicial independence.\n\nThe second was “perverting elections” to undercut public faith in democratic balloting through opaque financing and manipulation of electoral rules.\n\nThe third was “attacking media freedom” by targeting journalists and blocking access to information.\n\nThe fourth was “discrimination and mistreatment of migrants” and marginalized communities.\n\nThe “Democracy” textbook published after World War II also pointed to the fragility of democracy, warning that even in a democratized Japan, dictatorship could rear its ugly head at any time and from anywhere.\n\nThe textbook stressed the need for citizens to have a critical state of mind and awareness of that weakness of democracy.\n\nANTI-DEMOCRATIC TRENDS IN JAPAN\n\nDemocracy is also wavering in Japan.\n\nIf we use the four indices, rule of law is threatened by the proposal of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s administration to create an anti-spying law, which could narrow the rights of citizens.\n\nA law enacted in 2014 to protect specially designated secrets has already affected reporting activities. The anti-spying legislation could further strengthen restrictions on free speech under the excuse of protecting Japan from foreign nations.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party is reluctant to further investigate money scandals by its lawmakers, while a proposal to revise the electoral system would be advantageous to the ruling coalition and could arbitrarily eliminate small parties.\n\nA government panel has also started work on restricting entry into Japan by foreigners, a policy that could further spread xenophobia around Japan.\n\nPopulism that gains support through xenophobia and chest-pumping arguments is also spreading into Japan. This reflects the distortions in politics and society that fuel dissatisfaction among the public with their daily lives.\n\nCan those distortions be corrected? Or will populist politicians use them to further agitate fear?\n\nIf nothing is done and division deepens, “other people” could be viewed as a hated enemy, and an authoritarian atmosphere would strengthen under such circumstances.\n\nDemocracy, however, has shown the ability to recover from past difficulties.\n\nAlthough viewpoints and perspectives may differ in a democracy, respect has been shown for the other party, and common ground is sought through dialogue in search of compromise.\n\nPoliticians and citizens should once again recognize this principle and strength and avoid falling into the trap of division.",

    "description": "I designed, built, and shipped this small Pomodoro timer called realpomo — with the help of AI. This is the story of how it came together.",
    "fullText": "It started with something ordinary: watching my toddler use a physical timer to set boundaries around playtime and transitions. Twist the dial. Hear the click. Time feels real. I wondered whether a digital Pomodoro timer could feel that grounded — and whether I could actually ship one, not just design it.\n\nI'm a product designer by training. This was my first time owning every step of a desktop app end‑to‑end. What surprised me wasn't how fast I could build — it was how much there was to learn to actually ship.\n\nEvery interaction started as an experiment. I began in VS Code with GitHub Copilot, feeding it pictures of the physical timer I have and iterating directly in code. The UI took shape through behavior and feel — guided by a mental model, the object on my desk, and a lot of prompting and iteration.\n\nThen I tried Figma Make - because why not. With the same images and a simple prompt, it one‑shotted a clock UI that looked and behaved remarkably right — UI, interactions, look-and-feel. I was quite blown away, actually.\n\nThat was the pivot. I stopped looking for one perfect tool and started matching tools to phases. Figma Make helped me find the shape. VS Code and Cursor helped me turn it into a real system.\n\nThis felt like a meaningful shift in how design can happen: less about drawing artifacts up front, more about imagining clearly, expressing intent, and shaping the thing directly where it lives.\n\nDesigning the dial felt familiar. Implementing it didn't.\n\n\"Snap to minutes\" sounded simple until it wasn't. Dragging the hand couldn't constantly update state. Snapping at the minute marker had to happen on release. Overshoot needed to be allowed. Settling had to feel intentional.\n\nThe physical dial was the anchor, but this was still a digital product. Presets and readouts needed to be fast and precise, without losing the calm, tactile quality of the interaction.\n\nNothing was broken — it just didn't feel right yet.\n\nAI made that fine‑tuning approachable. I'd observe behavior, ask why something felt off, make a small change, test it, and repeat — until the interaction matched the taste I had in mind.\n\nSound was meant to be subtle. It ended up teaching me a lot.\n\nI explored free sound libraries, trimmed tiny fragments, and tuned them until they paired naturally with the dial — quiet, mechanical, easy to live with (thanks to ChatGPT)\n\nThen the surprise: the ticking sound worked locally but vanished in the packaged macOS app. The completion chime survived. The tick didn't.\n\nOne sound was synthesized. The other relied on bundled assets, paths, and runtime assumptions.\n\nIt wasn't a sound problem. It was a shipping problem.\n\nThe app worked locally long before it was usable by anyone else.\n\nMacOS security warnings sent me into code signing rabbit hole. CI builds succeeded but produced unusable artifacts. Secrets existed but were empty - result of not reviewing generated code. The website needed logic, not just copy. Even the app icon only became real once publishing forced the question.\n\nNone of this felt like failure. It felt like discovering a layer I hadn't been thinking about. Shipping turned out to be its own craft. Pipelines are systems. And there's a whole lot of effort in taking something that works locally to one that's shippable.\n\nAs a product designer working on Visual Studio and GitHub Copilot, I also experienced this project through another lens: thinking about what it means to build next‑generation IDEs for professional developers while using AI as a first‑class collaborator.\n\nI noticed how much context mattered, how progress indicators changed perceived speed, and how well today's tools understand entire repositories. Most real evaluation didn't happen in code — it happened by running the app and seeing how it behaved.\n\nThere's a lot here that carries back into my day job: designing AI interactions, surfacing progress clearly, managing context well, enabling powerful reviewing process, helping builders stay oriented while real work happens.\n\nrealpomo isn't a big app. That's the point.\n\nAI let me experience the full end‑to‑end arc of building software myself, over a weekend. That built real empathy for the many disciplines that come together to ship a product — and gave me a Pomodoro timer I could genuinely use.\n\nI set out to design a timer app for personal productivity. I ended up learning how real software gets made. That shift has been the most valuable part of this project.",

    "fullText": "Chinese auto giant BYD on Friday dethroned U.S. rival Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles on a calendar-year basis.\n\nThe milestone caps an extraordinary rise for BYD, a company Tesla CEO Elon Musk once dismissed by laughing at their products during a 2011 Bloomberg interview.\n\nIn a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.\n\nMusk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop.\n\nDeliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.\n\nTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.\n\nThe stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers.\n\n— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Using GPU to render vector graphics.",
    "fullText": "Despite vector graphics being used in every computer with a screen connected to it, rendering of vector shapes and text is still mostly a task for the CPU. This is wrong and needs to be changed. Here I describe a general approach to rasterization and how we can ask for help from GPU when rendering vector paths.\n\nFirst, let's overview a general principle of rasterization of vector shapes. Here is an image with a clockwise circle in it and I'll demonstrate a very rudimentary algorithm for drawing one row of pixels of that image. For simplicity reasons, anti-aliasing will not be included at this time.\n\nFor each pixel in this row we only need to know if its center is inside of this shape or outside. Outside pixels are left untouched while inside pixels are filled with color of that shape.\n\nWe start with a winding number set to zero. Winding number is an integer which indicates whether the pixel center is inside or outside of shape.\n\nNext imagine a horizontal ray being cast through centers of all pixels in this pixel row. Ray goes from infinity on the left side to infinity on the right side. Every time an intersection with an upward segment is found, the winding number is increased by 1. When an intersection is found with a downward segment, the winding number is decreased by 1. As we go from one pixel to another, left to right, if the current winding number at the center of each pixel is zero, the pixel is not visible. If it is something else, the pixel is filled according to the fill rule. For example, for the non-zero fill rule, all pixels with a winding number other than zero are filled with color.\n\nIn this picture the circle is drawn clockwise, but if it was drawn counterclockwise, the intersection on the left would result in the winding number decreasing by 1 instead of increasing it.\n\nNow, pixel centers between both intersections have winding numbers of -1, but according to the non-zero winding rule, they are filled the same way as for a clockwise circle.\n\nNote that intersections are found while ray travels from left to right so they are automatically sorted by X position of each intersection.\n\nRepeat the same operation for each row of pixels of the output image and in the end the image will be complete.\n\nOf course, state of the art rasterizers have a lot of optimisations and actual algorithms may look very different from this, but the basic idea is the same and it works for Bézier paths of any complexity.\n\nUnfortunately, GPUs work a bit differently from CPUs. CPU is like one person reading a book. You start at page 1 and read all the pages one by one, in order. But if you read books like me, it may take up to 6 years to finish one book. So you come up with a faster way. You hire 14.000 people to read that book, each reading a single line from it in parallel. They finish in about 8 seconds, but there are new challenges. You need to find a way to quickly assign which line to read to which person and when they finish, they somehow need to tell you the whole story in order. They cannot all speak at the same time randomly. This is the kind of challenges you face when programming for GPUs.\n\nGPUs are extremely parallel. They can run thousands of threads at the same time. For example, the original Apple M1 GPU can execute 24.576 threads in parallel. Ideally, data should be prepared for the GPU in such a way all these threads can work with small amounts of information and produce even smaller output of fixed size. This is not a requirement, especially for more modern GPUs, but I like to keep it simple because of my deep distrust in graphics drivers.\n\nAn intuitive way to do rasterization on GPU is one pixel at a time. Screens contain a lot of pixels and GPUs can run a lot of threads. So it looks like each pixel can be processed in parallel.\n\nTo do this, we need to modify the algorithm to work on each pixel separately instead of processing each shape and each segment of it in order in a single thread.\n\nNow, for each pixel, go over all segments of a shape and if a segment intersects with this imaginary horizontal line going through the center of that pixel, the winding number is modified. Only intersections on the left side of the pixel center need to be considered. Intersections on the right side of the pixel center can be completely ignored. The order in which segments are processed does not matter.\n\nIn this example there is only one intersection to the left of the highlighted pixel center. So if we were rendering it, this intersection would be contributing to the final winding number of this pixel by increasing it by one.\n\nAfter processing all intersections on the left side of the pixel center, the final winding number is used to determine if a pixel needs to be filled according to the fill rule of that shape.\n\nUp to this point anti-aliasing was not introduced to rasterizer for simplicity reasons. But having sharp edges of shapes has a 1995 vibe to it. People demand smooth pixels in 2022. Fortunately there are methods that can be used to achieve smooth edges without heavily modifying the entire rasterizer.\n\nOne of the simplest methods for anti-aliasing is Supersampling. It does not require modifying the rasterizer at all. The idea is to draw the image at a bigger resolution first, then scale the result back to desired size. While scaling down, an average of a few pixels will produce a single output pixel, making it look smooth. Supersampling, however, has a few problems. The biggest problem is that it is extremely expensive. If we wanted to achieve somewhat decent quality, we would have to render at size 4 times the original size in both directions. This means rendering 16 times larger image and taking an average of 16 pixels to produce one pixel in the final image. This means 16 times more memory and at least 16 times longer to render image. And in the end, 16 levels is not that good. A lot of people will quickly notice the low quality of anti-aliasing at the edges of shapes with only 16 samples per pixel.\n\nMuch better approach for vector graphics is analytic anti-aliasing. And it turns out, it is not just almost as fast as a rasterizer with no anti-aliasing, but also has much better quality than what can be practically achieved with supersampling. It requires small changes to the rasterization algorithm, but nothing fundamental.\n\nI introduced the concept of winding number for deciding if a pixel is inside the shape or not. This concept can be extended to also include information about how much pixel is covered by shape, not just binary covered or not covered.\n\nThe value indicating how shape is contributing to the coverage of a pixel will be called alpha from now on. Just like winding number, alpha is not the same as pixel opacity. It will need to be converted to opacity according to the fill rule.\n\nFrom here I will assume floating point arithmetic will be used and pixel size is 1.0 × 1.0. 100% of something is equal to 1.0, 50% is equal to 0.5.\n\nTo calculate alpha for any given pixel, there are two values that need to be calculated for each segment of a shape. First value is cover and another is called area. If a segment is on the right edge of a pixel, none of these values need calculation. Obviously, if the segment is below or above the pixel, computation is not needed either. The remaining situation is when the segment is in the pixel, on the left of the pixel or both. Area value is calculated for a part of the segment which intersects with the pixel being rendered. Cover value is calculated for a part of the segment which is to the left of the pixel. Once both of these values are calculated for a segment, they are added to the final alpha value. Once all segments in a shape are considered, the final alpha value is converted to pixel opacity according to the fill rule of that shape.\n\nHere is an example of how to calculate area and cover values for the highlighted pixel. The shape being drawn is the same clockwise circle, but now we are drawing a pixel which is located somewhere at the top left side of this shape.\n\nFirst step is to find the part of the ellipse which will be contributing to the alpha value of this pixel. We are only interested in the segment which is one the left from the right edge of our pixel.\n\nNow calculate the area. Find a segment which is within our pixel only. Cut off any parts of the segment that are outside of the pixel. And calculate the area that is to the right of the segment. For segments that go down instead of going up, area value is negated.\n\nTo calculate cover, isolate the part of the segment which is to the left of our pixel, but is still in between the top and bottom edges of the pixel row. Then multiply a value is calculated by subtracting the minimum Y value of the isolated segment from maximum Y value of the isolated segment. Like with area, if a segment goes down instead of up, cover value is negated. In this particular case, a is around 0.45 and pixel size is 1.0. So the cover value is 0.45.\n\nNote that cover needs to be calculated for all segments which are to the left of the pixel and between top and bottom edges of the pixel, even if they do not intersect with the pixel at all.\n\nOnce both area and cover values are calculated, they are added to alpha value. Here is an illustration of both area and cover values combined for this case.\n\nThen repeat the process for all segments of a shape, continuously accumulating their area and cover values. In the end we will have a final alpha value. Now alpha value must be converted to opacity according to the fill rule of a shape. If the fill rule is non-zero, alpha is calculated by using formula min(abs(alpha), 1.0). If the fill rule is even-odd, the formula is abs(alpha - 2.0 × round(0.5 × alpha)). Resulting opacity value is in the range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n\nI first discovered this algorithm in FreeType which cites LibArt as inspiration. Some form of the same algorithm with various modifications is used pretty much on every computer now.\n\nAt this point we can rasterize shapes on GPU with very good quality anti-aliasing.\n\nThe following algorithm is run in parallel for every pixel on screen -\n\nFor small amounts of small shapes this approach will be extremely fast. However, it will become slower when more shapes are added due to the increasing amount of segments that need to be processed at each pixel. To make this renderer usable in the real world, some fundamental changes need to be made. We have to reduce the amount of segments that require processing for each pixel. The simplest way is to divide the screen into smaller lists of segments and process only this reduced list of segments for each pixel.\n\nLet's split the entire destination area to virtual fixed size blocks. The size of these blocks do not depend on threadgroup size or SIMD group size. Since the renderer will be splitting segments at block boundaries, larger blocks will require less CPU processing power to cut segments, but will require more processing power on GPU to rasterize segments within a block. It is always best to choose some nice round number. I chose 32 × 32 pixels.\n\nThe origin of the first block is always at 0, 0 relative to the destination image. If the destination image is not multiple of 32, the last block is still 32 × 32 pixels size and extends a little beyond the image.\n\nEach block contains two main things. First, there is a list of shapes that intersect with a block. Each shape comes with a list of segments that make that shape. Second, there is a cover table. This is all that is needed to draw a pixel.\n\nPreviously I mentioned cover value and how it is calculated when implementing anti-aliasing. This is the same. We only have a list of segments which intersect with a block our pixel is in. Cover table carries cover information from previous blocks on the left side of a block our random pixel is in.\n\nCover table is needed because we do not know anything about shapes or segments outside of any given block, but segments outside of the block can still contribute to coverage of pixels within the block.\n\nAt this point, most of the things we need are there. Let's overview the full process.\n\nFor each shape in composition do the following -\n\nLastly, calculate cover table values for each shape in each block by examining contents of blocks to the left.\n\nNow the work on the CPU is done. Data can be uploaded to the GPU now.\n\nThe following algorithm is run in parallel for every pixel on screen -\n\nNow I'll write some thoughts about certain parts of the pipeline and what I discovered so far.\n\nIn this article I talk about shapes being made of segments. But what exactly is this segment? The answer is that it does not matter much. The simplest to handle are simple line segments. Hardest are cubic curves. And there can be everything in-between like quadratic curves or monotonic cubic curves.\n\nIn my implementation I use simple lines encoded as 8.8 fixed point numbers. Since block size is 32 × 32 pixels, 8.8 fixed point numbers are enough to describe lines with 1/256th of a pixel precision. Using this encoding, one line segment can be described using only 64 bits. It also makes shader which then processes these lines simpler. It can operate on 16 bit integers quite far in the algorithm until it needs higher precision.\n\nMonotonic quadratic curves are also tempting thing to try. You would need to find up to 2 roots of a quadratic curve to get a line which then can be used to calculate cover and area values. For input which is mostly curves, not lines, having segments encoded as curves may save some space and iteration over the list of segments in the shader will be shorter. However, if input is mostly lines, it will add cost to processing and memory requirements. So far, I'm sticking with simple line segments.\n\nOnce you ask the GPU to dispatch a list of threads, it divides them into thread groups. Each thread group has a list of threads to run. And threads within thread groups are further divided into SIMD groups. The last one is significant because every time the code path is diverging within the SIMD group, the shader will run longer because it will have to execute both sides of a branch.\n\nGiven that, a very good performance optimization is not to try to reject segments on the X axis in the shader. Rejecting segments which are below or above current pixel boundaries is fine. Rejecting segments which are to the right of the current pixel will most likely increase shader execution time.\n\nAnother point is to choose thread group size which has width equal to SIMD group on that hardware to make sure that within the thread group, SIMD group is only 1 row of pixels.\n\nIt is good to skip entire shapes in the shader and avoid processing of segments within. Again, since block size is 32 × 32 pixels, the bounding box can be only two 8 bit values. Only vertical minimum and maximum values are enough. As I said before, I do not attempt to reject shapes by X pixel position to avoid diverging branches within SIMD groups, but rejecting them by Y position gives a good performance boost.\n\nThis certainly can be achieved as demonstrated by brilliant piet-gpu. However, it requires more advanced features of GPU compute than I'd like. In the simple approach where blocks are prepared on CPU, there is only one GPU kernel dispatch. The simplest kernel which renders shapes with solid color is about 80 lines of code. Easy to fix and extend. I managed to optimize block preparation on CPU quite well and this preparation step is predictable while allocating memory. I think it is quite well balanced.\n\nPrimary inspiration for me to try rendering vector graphics on GPU was piet-metal. The next generation of concept is piet-gpu. It seems like it went to the opposite direction than my implementation and now it attempts to do everything on GPU, including flattening of shapes to individual segments. The method presented in Efficient GPU Path Rendering Using Scanline Rasterization is very interesting. Although a bit too complex for my taste since it relies on prefix sum calculation and sorting, both of which are not particularly trivial to do on GPU. Pathfinder is quite interesting as well and I suspect it is very similar to what I described here, but I have not attempted to figure out how it works exactly. Then there is Slug which is popular library for rendering scalable text for games. Algorithm seems to be patented.\n\nOverall I really like this approach of giving the GPU to perform some of the steps of rasterization. The most expensive elements of vector graphics rendering are blending, finding which pixels to fill and calculating fill colors. Calculating fill colors can become really expensive if shapes are filled with images using a bilinear filter. Radial gradients can become not so cheap as well for the CPU to process. So the most expensive parts are run on GPU already.\n\nTrying to come up with an exact number of milliseconds spent in an attempt to compare approaches is a more or less pointless task in my opinion. However, compared to rendering exactly the same input with heavily optimized software renderer, GPU-assisted version is 10-15 times faster. Image fills is the place with the biggest performance boost. I think this is a good start.",

    "fullText": "Despite faster CPUs, RAM and storage, today’s Windows experience doesn’t feel noticeably different from back in the 2000s when XP and later Windows 7 ruled the roost. To quantify this feeling, [TrigrZolt] decided to run a series of benchmarks on a range of Windows versions.\n\nCovering Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8.1, 10 and 11, the Pro version of each with the latest service packs and updates was installed on the same laptop: a Lenovo ThinkPad X220. It features an Intel i5 2520M CPU, 8 GB of RAM, built-in Intel HD Graphics 3000 and a 256 GB HDD.\n\nFor start-up, Windows 8.1 won the race, probably due to having the Fast Boot feature, while Windows 11 came in dead last as it showed the desktop, but struggled to show the task bar. Windows XP’s install size was the smallest and also had the lowest RAM usage with nothing loaded at 800 MB versus 3.3 GB for Windows 11 in last place.\n\nUsing the Chrome-based Supermium browser, memory management was tested, with XP performing as poorly as Windows 11, while Windows 7 and 8.1 took home the gold at over two-hundred tabs open before hitting the total RAM usage limit of 5 GB. That XP performed so poorly was however due to an issue with virtual memory and not hitting the RAM limit, which means that Windows 11 is the real dunce here.\n\nThis is a pattern that keeps repeating: Windows 11 was last in the battery test, took longer to render a video project in OpenShot, took its sweet time opening the File Explorer window, and opening built-in applications like MS Paint left enough time to fetch a fresh cup of coffee. Not to mention Windows 11 taking the longest to open websites and scoring worst of all in single-threaded CPU-Z.\n\nMuch seems to be due to the new code in Windows 11, as Microsoft has opted to start doing major rewrites since Windows 7, hitting a crescendo with Windows 11. Although there’s the unhelpful fact that Windows 11 by default encrypts the storage with the very slow software-based BitLocker, its massive RAM usage and general sluggishness are such a big deal that even Microsoft has acknowledged this and added workarounds for the slow File Explorer in Windows 11 by preloading components into RAM.\n\nAll of this appears to be part of the same trend in software development, where more resources are pointlessly used due to developing for the hardware, and performance increasingly takes a backseat to abstractions and indirections that effectively add bloat and latency.",

    "description": "A new country is gearing up to unveil the world's second-fastest commercial transport train, and despite their reputation with technology, it isn't Japan.",
    "fullText": "There are plenty of mistakes people make while traveling by train. Pick the cheapest ride, and you'll probably be stuck on a train moving slower than drying paint. Pick the wrong type of train, and you could be spending money faster than the blink of an eye. Knowing how to choose the right type of long-distance train is crucial, and when it comes to train systems, Asia's dominance in the sector far exceeds any other continent worldwide. China currently has the top spot for the most bullet trains, as well as the fastest, and this country will soon offer the world's second-fastest train, and no, it's not Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's government and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport just revealed on December 22 that the world's second-fastest bullet train is scheduled to join its fleet in 2030 for test operations, and expect it to be fully commercialized for the public by 2031. Capable of speeds reaching a staggering 230 miles-per-hour (370 kilometers-per-hour), the new EMU-370 train is a next generation high-speed train that's going to put South Korea on the map when it comes to bullet trains that promise lightning-fast trips.\n\nKorea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI), along with seven public and private organizations, led a national research and development program spanning the length of three years from April 2022 to December 2025, to design the highly anticipated EMU-370 train project that cost a total of 15.23 million dollars (22.5 billion Korean won). The EMU-370 was designed to have a fully functional top speed of up to 253 miles-per-hour (407 kilometers-per-hour), making the trip from Seoul to Busan in just under two hours, when typically it would take two-and-a-half hours.\n\nOne of the best places to take a day trip if you're staying in Seoul, is the coastal town of Busan, which will now be more accessible than ever. Currently, the EMU-320 (KTX-Cheongyong) is South Korea's fastest train, however the EMU-370's impressive stats speak for themselves. Set to seat 479 passengers with a two decibel reduced indoor noise level, and a motor capacity of 560 kilowatts, the EMU-370 puts out 47.4% more power to the equivalent of about 75 midsize family sedans with a sleek aerodynamic design, making it the sportscar of the train world.\n\nCurrently, China's CR450 high-speed train is in testing, with speeds reaching approximately 249 miles-per-hour (400 kilometers-per-hour), and is the world's leading passenger bullet train, which is set to launch in 2027 for commercialized public use. Other countries that have bullet trains, such as France, Germany, and Japan, who were the first to have a bullet train in 1964 called the Shinkansen, reach a top speed of approximately 200 miles-per-hour (320 kilometers-per-hour).\n\nWith technological advances in rail speeds, tracks must also naturally be upgraded. According to the head of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's Railway Bureau, there must be significant improvements before the EMU-370 can reach full speed. Without halting operations of the railway, replacing ballast tracks with concrete tracks on some sections will be done during a four-hour period in which trains do not run. The ministry official stated they expect South Korea's high-speed rail to exceed 217 miles-per-hour (350 kilometers-per-hour) in the near future, which would secure South Korea's spot as a top player within the high-speed railway sector for years to come.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

    "fullText": "Over the last several days, the National Weather Service has done a great job detailing the various winter storm warnings that have deeply affected many people. While that is an extremely useful service that the agency provides, they do a lot more than report on snowfall and heavy winds.\n\nToday, the National Weather Service has reported on a major earthquake that has hit and revealed whether it is believed that it will create any tsunamis. Other reports have revealed that the earthquake struck a heavily populated area, which is always an important factor in determining how impactful an earthquake becomes. It is also notable that reports state that several landslides have been caused by the earthquake\n\nOn January 2, 2025, the National Weather Service issued a report detailing a 6.5 magnitude earthquake that had struck Southern Mexico. That report stated that the earthquake struck at 5:58 a.m. Pacific Standard Time at a depth of 6 miles underground near the coast of Guerrero, Mexico. The report also stated that the earthquake took place at the coordinates of 16.8 North and 99.3 West.\n\nA website published by Michigan Tech University details how serious a 6.5 magnitude earthquake can be. According to the website, an earthquake that falls within a 6.1 to 6.9 magnitude range, \"may cause a lot of damage in very populated areas.\"\n\nFortunately, the National Weather Service's report about the 6.5 magnitude earthquake states that there was no danger of a tsunami hitting the United States' West Coast, Alaska, or British Columbia. Furthermore, the report stated that based on past events that were similar, they didn't believe any Tsunamis would occur due to this earthquake. \"Based on earthquake information and historic tsunami records, the earthquake is not expected to generate a tsunami.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Mexico's earthquake that struck on January 2nd, 2025, Newsweek published an article detailing its effects. That article stated that the earthquake had struck near Acapulco, a heavily populated tourist attraction. An ABC Eye Witness News 7 report published in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake detailed how residents of and tourists to the area were affected.\n\nMost importantly, the report detailed the fact that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had stated that no serious damage had been reported. Sheinbaum made that statement after speaking to Guerrero's Governor, Evelyn Salgado, who'd given her that news. However, the ABC report stated that Mexico's Civil Defense Agency had revealed that several landslides had been reported around Acapulco, including on highways in the state.\n\nOf course, details of the consequences of a 6.5 magnitude earthquake can change over time as more information can sometimes come to light. On top of that, it can take time for some damage to become obvious, and aftershocks can also change the dynamics.",

    "fullText": "A solo hiker who authorities believe was killed by a mountain lion on a remote Colorado trail on New Year's Day was not the first person to encounter one of the predators in the area in recent weeks.\n\nGary Messina said he was running along the same trail on a dark November morning when his headlamp caught the gleam of two eyes in the nearby brush. Messina used his phone to snap a quick photo before a mountain lion rushed him.\n\nMessina said he threw the phone at the animal, kicked dirt and yelled as the lion kept trying to circle behind him. After a couple of harrowing minutes he broke a bat-sized stick off a downed log, hit the lion in the head with it and it ran off, he said.\n\nThe woman whose body was found Thursday on the same Crosier Mountain trail had “wounds consistent with a mountain lion attack,” said Kara Van Hoose with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. An autopsy is scheduled for next week, said Rafael Moreno with the Larimer County Coroner's Office.\n\nPrior warnings and the hunt for a culprit\n\nWildlife officials late Thursday tracked down and killed two mountain lions in the area — one at the scene and another nearby. A necropsy will help determine if either or both of those animals attacked the woman and whether they had neurological diseases such as rabies or avian flu.\n\nA search for a third mountain lion reported in the area was ongoing Friday, Van Hoose said. Nearby trails remained closed while the hunt continued. Van Hoose said circumstances would dictate whether that lion is also killed.\n\nBased on the aggressiveness of the animal that attacked him on Nov. 11, Messina suspects it could be the same one that killed the woman on New Year’s Day.\n\n“I had to fight it off because it was basically trying to maul me,” Messina told The Associated Press. “I was scared for my life and I wasn’t able to escape. I tried backing up and it would try to lunge at me.”\n\nThe 32-year-old man from nearby Glen Haven, Colorado, reported his encounter to wildlife officials days later who posted signs to warn people about the animal along trails in the Crosier Mountain area northeast of Estes Park, Van Hoose said. The signs were later removed, she said.\n\nMountain lions don't often attack humans\n\nMountain lion sightings in that area east of Rocky Mountain National Park are common, Van Hoose said, because it offers good habitat for the animals: It’s remote with thick forests, rocky outcroppings and lots of elevation changes.\n\nYet attacks on humans by the animals are rare, and the last suspected fatal encounter in Colorado was in 1999, when a 3-year-old boy disappeared in the wilderness and his tattered clothes were found more than three years later. In 1997, a 10-year-old boy was killed by a lion and dragged away while hiking with family members in Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nTwo hikers on Thursday saw the victim's body on the trail at around noon from about 100 yards (meters) away, Van Hoose said. A mountain lion was nearby and they threw rocks to scare it away. One of the hikers, a physician, attended to the victim but did not find a pulse, Van Hoose said.\n\nThe victim will be publicly identified following the autopsy by the coroner, who is also expected to provide a cause of death.\n\nMountain lions — also known as cougars, pumas or catamounts — can weigh 130 pounds (60 kilograms) and grow to more than 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. They primarily eat deer.\n\nColorado has an estimated 3,800 to 4,400 of the animals, which are classified as a big game species in the state and can be hunted.\n\nThursday's killing would be the fourth fatal mountain lion attack in North America over the past decade, and the 30th since 1868, according to information from the California-based Mountain Lion Foundation. Not all of those deaths have been confirmed as mountain lion attacks.\n\nMost attacks occur during the day and when humans are active in lion territories, indicating the animals are not seeking out the victims, according to the advocacy group. About 15% of attacks are fatal.\n\n“As more people live, work, and recreate in areas that overlap wildlife habitat, interactions can increase, not because mountain lions are becoming more aggressive, but because overlap is growing,” said Byron Weckworth, chief conservation officer for the foundation.\n\nTo reduce the risk travel in groups, keep children close and avoid dawn and dusk when lions are most active, Weckworth said. During an encounter, maintain eye contact with the lion, make yourself appear larger and back away slowly; don't run, he said.\n\nLast year in Northern California, two brothers were stalked and attacked by a lion that they tried to fight off. One of the brothers was killed.",

    "fullText": "A Missouri police chief’s lit cigarette was the cause of a fire that destroyed a local nursing home over the summer, an official report has found.\n\nIn the early morning hours of August 7, 2025, the Vienna Point residential care facility went up in flames. Photos taken by the Vienna Fire Protection District showed a bright orange blaze burning through the building’s roof as smoke billowed through the dark sky.\n\nCrews launched an “offensive attack with heavy fire conditions, but with water supply issues, it was decided to go to a defensive mode and we requested mutual aid tankers and manpower,” Vienna fire officials said.\n\nFirst responders were able to get everyone out of the building unharmed but could not save the structure.\n\n“Although the loss of the facility is tragic, we didn’t lose any life and had no injuries,” the city’s Fire Protection District said.\n\nSecurity video revealed the moments leading up to the fire, which was ruled an accident.\n\nThe video, which the Missouri state fire marshal shared with ABC 17, reportedly showed Vienna Police Chief Shannon Thompson arriving at the nursing home shortly before midnight on August 6. Thompson was reportedly responding to an accidental 911 call.\n\nThe person reported to be Thompson then smoked a cigarette and placed it in a planter outside the building’s entrance, stomping it inside the planter before leaving, the video appears to show. About 90 minutes later, a flame sparks in the planter, which erupts into a larger fire that engulfs the building.\n\nInvestigators say the fire was caused by “the unintended result of an individual placing a burning cigarette near combustible material,” according to ABC 17, which obtained records from the fire marshal.\n\nThompson confirmed to investigators that he placed a cigarette in the planter and tried to extinguish it, noting that the brand of cigarettes that he smoked is designed to self-extinguish, ABC 17 reports.\n\nMaries County Prosecutor Anthony Skouby is yet to decide whether to press charges against Thompson. A spokesperson for Skouby told the Daily Mail, “The prosecuting attorney is still investigating and gathering evidence.”\n\n“A cigarette butt can was just 10 feet away, and he put his lit cigarette out in a plastic potted plant,” Skouby said in a statement shared by the Maires County Advocate in November. “I believe that listing the fire as accidental is insulting to my intelligence.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to Thompson and Skouby’s office for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump, 79, fired off an early-morning tirade Friday insisting he is in “PERFECT HEALTH” as concerns grow over his apparent mental and physical decline.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“P.S., I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination. Our great Country cannot be run by ‘STUPID’ or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!”\n\nTrump has routinely brushed aside suggestions he is in mental decline by boasting about passing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test used to detect cognitive impairment or early signs of dementia. The test involves tasks such as drawing a clock to show a specific time and identifying animals.\n\nDuring a December 2025 speech in North Carolina, Trump also proudly told the crowd how he “aced” such a test.\n\n“The first question is like, ‘What is this?’ And they show a lion, a giraffe, a fish, and a hippopotamus. And they say, ‘Which is the giraffe?’” Trump said.\n\n“I don’t think Joe [Biden] would have gotten the first question right,” he added. “He would say hippo. ‘I want the hippo,’”\n\nThe Daily Beast has been leading the way in reporting on concerns about the president’s health, including frequently documenting how Trump covers large bruises on his hands with makeup and tries to conceal his swollen cankles whenever possible.\n\nIn a remarkably candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published Jan. 1, Trump—the oldest sitting president in U.S. history—was forced to address his health issues and, in doing so, he contradicted previous assurances given to the public.\n\nHe revealed that his second medical exam last year at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center involved a CT scan, not an MRI as previously disclosed. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, Trump’s physician who conducted the exam, told the Journal that the CT scan was performed to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”\n\nThe White House confirmed in July 2025 that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that causes swelling in the lower legs.\n\nTrump told the Journal that he briefly wore compression socks to help with his cankles but stopped because he did not like them. The president also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.”\n\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\n\nTrump blamed the frequent bruising on his hands—which he desperately attempts to conceal with concealer—on his heavy daily aspirin use.\n\nFor months, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has offered a boilerplate response when the Daily Beast asked about the bruises, insisting they are the result of the president “meeting more Americans and shaking their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nTrump also admitted he is so fragile that his hand bled after Attorney General Pam Bondi nicked him with her ring during a high five at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024.\n\n“The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut,” Trump told the Journal of the incident, which reportedly caused alarm among members of his inner circle.\n\nTrump said he applies makeup to his hands whenever he gets “whacked again.”\n\n“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on. Takes about 10 seconds,” he said.",

    "fullText": "This year's Rose Bowl was so uncompetitive that fans paid more attention to the commercials than the actual game.\n\nTo be fair, Indiana squashed Alabama in the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza completed 14-of-16 pass attempts for 192 yards with three touchdowns. The Hoosiers also received great performances from Kaleon Black and Roman Hemby. They combined for 188 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 33 carries.\n\nDuring Thursday's blowout at the Rose Bowl, viewers noticed a rather unusual commercial from Eli Lilly and Company. The ad featured a man talking about his weight.\n\n\"I've been dieting since I was 12. You think I need to hear about your workout routine? You don't stop to ask about mine,\" the actor says, via OutKick. \"No matter what I do, you're gonna have your own thoughts, so get it all out while you're in the comment section. I'll be focusing on what really matters, like how I feel when I'm waking up in the morning, like showing up for people I love. My health is my focus, and my body is nobody's business.\"\n\nJudging by some of the responses online, Rose Bowl viewers didn't appreciate this commercial.\n\n\"There are so many things wrong with Lilly, a company that makes billions of dollars from obesity drugs, running a commercial during the Rose Bowl basically promoting the idea that obesity is perfectly healthy,\" Dan Zaksheske of OutKick said.\n\n\"Not Lilly with the [expletive] “my weight is nobody’s business” commercial during the Rose Bowl,\" another person wrote. \"The same company that profits off that? Where the taxpayer subsidizes publicly funded gluttony and medical care?\"\n\n\"Commercial for Lilly pharmaceutical that just aired during halftime in the Rose Bowl is one of the most fascinating cultural artifacts I’ve ever seen, not least because I’m still not certain if the main character was a real person or AI,\" Kat Rosenfield of The Free Press said.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with Lilly, a company that makes billions of dollars from obesity drugs, running a commercial during the Rose Bowl basically promoting the idea that obesity is perfectly healthy. pic.twitter.com/KNrJeeBvzn\n\n— Dan Zaksheske (@RealDanZak) January 1, 2026\n\nEli Lilly and Company is a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Indianapolis.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi during a phone call Friday to visit the United States this year, the Japanese foreign ministry said, in what would be the ultraconservative leader's first trip to the U.S. since taking office in October.\n\nThe White House is yet to confirm the call and the invitation. It comes as ties between Japan and China have been strained, ramping up tensions in the region. The U.S., a close ally of Japan, is seeking to strengthen its ties with Tokyo but also stabilize its relationship with Beijing ahead of a likely trip by Trump to China in April.\n\nBeijing staged two-day military exercises in the waters off Taiwan this week. Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, infuriated China late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response, breaking away from former Japanese leaders’ strategic ambiguity on the highly sensitive matter.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Japanese foreign ministry said Takaichi and Trump agreed to coordinate for the visit to happen this spring. Kyodo News, Japan's news agency, suggested that Takaichi's trip could coincide with the annual cherry blossom festival in Washington.\n\nThe foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed that they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S. alliance” in a year when the U.S. celebrates the 250th anniversary of its founding and that they would “further deepen the friendly relations” between the two nations, including economic and security cooperation.\n\nTakaichi and Trump also agreed on their commitment to promoting cooperation among like-minded partners, including the Japan-U.S.-South Korea partnership, and to a free and open Indo-Pacific, the foreign ministry statement said.\n\nThe two exchanged views “mainly on the Indo-Pacific region,\" the ministry said, but it did not provide details, including whether the two discussed recent actions by Beijing in the region.\n\nChina's military drills off Taiwan also came after the Trump administration announced a package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion. If approved by Congress, it would represent the largest such aid to the island ever — a move criticized sharply by China.\n\nBeijing claims sovereignty over the self-governed island and vows to seize it — by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient hardware to deter any attack from the mainland.\n\nTrump on Monday said he was not informed of the exercises in advance but still touted his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October, shortly after she took office. The two exchanged warm words, and Trump took her with him when he spoke to U.S. troops aboard an aircraft carrier in Japan.\n\nAfter Takaichi's Taiwan comments angered Beijing, Trump called her and said they were “extremely good friends” and that she should call him any time, according to the Japanese leader, without disclosing if the two talked about her remarks.",

With this in mind, it might be a bit of a surprise that the Bundeswehr announced the selection of the Czech-made CZ P-10C as the new German service pistol.\n\nPrevious Bundeswehr pistols include the Walter P38-derived P1 and the legendary H&K USP (as the P8), the A1 version of which is being replaced by the CZ as the P13. While the Germans have used foreign pistols in the past (including the ubiquitous Glock 17), the CZ P-10C represents the first adoption of a foreign pistol as a standard-issue sidearm. Interestingly, CZ’s competition in the final round was Austria’s Glock and Slovenia’s AREX, while H&K was not even in the running.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2025, CZ announced that the company had “achieved one of the most significant milestones in its history” with the selection of the P-10C by the Bundeswehr. The specific model selected to serve as the P13 is the optics-ready version with a flat dark earth finish. Of course, the pistol is chambered in 9x19mm in accordance with NATO standardization… looking at you, M7 rifle.\n\nOtherwise, the P-10C is a fairly ordinary pistol by modern standards. It features a 4-inch barrel, a tilting barrel action, a short-recoil system, and is striker-fired. The pistol’s polymer frame includes an accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, the barrel is cold-hammered forged, and the standard iron sights are night sights.\n\nFeeding from a standard 15-round magazine, the P-10C can also use CZ’s extended magazines, including the 17-round magazine, as well as magazines for the CZ P-07 pistol. The P-10C was adopted by the Army of the Czech Republic in 2020.\n\n“We are honored that the German Bundeswehr has chosen CZ as its partner. Our success in this rearmament tender is one of the most significant achievements in CZ’s modern history,” said CZ CEO Jan Zajic in a press release. “It clearly confirms the outstanding reputation our firearms have earned through active deployment in real combat conditions. We look forward to a long-term cooperation with the Bundeswehr and to fulfilling all its requirements in line with the contract.”\n\nNeither CZ nor the Bundeswehr announced the quantity or value of the P13 contract, nor did they provide a specific delivery timeline. However, the Bundeswehr has been undergoing an accelerated process of modernization since the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. While sidearms do not contribute as much to combat power as artillery or rifles, the awarding of the P13 contract is still a significant step toward German military readiness.\n\nZhakfar Ahmadi, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty",

    "description": "The Bruins could use another forward and should consider pursuing this Kraken forward because of it.",
    "fullText": "The Boston Bruins have struggled lately, as they have lost six out of their last seven games. While this is the case, they are still very much in the playoff race, as they are only three points behind the Philadelphia Flyers for the final wild card spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nWith the Bruins still being in the playoff hunt but clearly needing a boost, it would be understandable if they browsed the trade market. One of their biggest needs is another skilled forward, and Seattle Kraken winger Eeli Tolvanen stands out as a very interesting potential option to consider.\n\nThe Kraken have already begun selling this season, as they traded forward Mason Marchment to the Columbus Blue Jackets ahead of the holiday freeze. With Tolvanen being a pending unrestricted free agent, he could be another player to watch as a trade candidate as we get closer to the deadline.\n\nIf the Bruins acquired Tolvanen, he would have the potential to be a strong addition to their top six. Due to his ability to play both wings, he could give the Bruins' second line a nice boost if acquired. Furthermore, due to his strong two-way play, he would give the Bruins another clear option to work with on both their power play and penalty kill.\n\nIn 38 games so far this season with the Kraken, Tolvanen has posted seven goals, 18 assists, and 25 points. This is after he scored a career-high 23 goals and recorded 35 points in 81 games for Seattle this past season.\n\nBesides providing solid offense, the 5-foot-10 forward has also been making an impact with his physicality, as he has 102 hits this season. He also had 210 hits during the 2023-24 season with Seattle and 237 hits this past season. With this, he certainly would give the Bruins more bite if acquired in addition to offensive production.\n\nNevertheless, if the Kraken end up making Tolvanen available this season, the Bruins should seriously consider targeting him.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Timberwolves look lost.\n\nAfter another ugly performance—this one a 24-point loss to the Atlanta Hawks on New Year’s Eve—the questions surrounding Minnesota are growing louder and more uncomfortable. A team with championship aspirations continues to come out flat, unfocused, and unprepared. And now a conversation once considered preposterous is gaining steam:\n\nIs it time for the Timberwolves to move on from head coach Chris Finch?\n\nAgainst Atlanta, the Wolves sleepwalked through the first half, showing little urgency or cohesion while digging themselves into a 21-point halftime deficit they couldn’t overcome. It was a familiar script. Minnesota has repeatedly opened games this season lacking intensity, only to spend the rest of the night chasing a deficit they created.\n\nAs the uneven performances pile up, frustration has shifted from impatience to accountability. At some point, responsibility lands at the top.\n\nFinch is the most successful coach in franchise history, a steward of the Timberwolves’ rise from irrelevance to perennial playoff team. However, coaching tenures in the NBA are often judged less by past success than by present control. Increasingly, Minnesota looks like a team searching for direction.\n\nThat’s where Micah Nori enters the discussion.\n\nThe Timberwolves’ lead assistant—well-known locally for his candid, humorous interviews—has quietly built a strong reputation around the league. He has also passed every real-world test thrown his way.\n\nTwo seasons ago, when Finch was injured during the playoffs, Nori stepped in and helped guide Minnesota to its first Western Conference finals appearance in two decades. More recently, after Finch was ejected early in a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Nori took over and pushed the right buttons, particularly with rotations and lineup adjustments, in a win over the defending champions.\n\nThis sort of move, to fire a head coach during the regular season and elevate the lead assistant, is not without precedent. Just last season, the Denver Nuggets fired NBA champion head coach Mike Malone and elevated David Adelman, the team’s lead assistant. That move was made with just a handful of games left in the regular season.\n\nIn Minnesota’s case, making a change with roughly half the season remaining would give the organization time to evaluate Nori as head coach and to adjust the roster before the postseason pressure ramps up. Finch, for all his success, is not yet a championship coach, and may never be. And if this core is going to make a real run, urgency matters.\n\nWhat’s most alarming isn’t just the blowout losses, but how the Wolves look even in their wins. The execution is inconsistent. The energy fluctuates. The focus comes and goes. While roster construction plays a role, sustained issues with preparation and effort ultimately reflect on the head coach.\n\nThat Finch may be losing the locker room—at least in part—can’t be dismissed. Anthony Edwards’ leaving the bench in the fourth quarter and declining to speak to the media after the Hawks’ loss was notable. The franchise star rarely ducks these opportunities, and moments like that often signal more profound frustration. Edwards showed his dismay just a few days earlier, following a loss to the Brooklyn Nets, saying in part, “Man, I don’t know. The same answers every time. We’ve got to change something. I don’t know what it is.”\n\nIn an interview after the Hawks’ loss, Rudy Gobert, when asked about how the team is playing, responded, “Not like a team that wants to win a championship. That’s for sure.” Another sign that frustrations inside the locker room are beginning to boil over.\n\nNori, meanwhile, has been mentioned in coaching rumors for a couple of years now, a sign that NBA decision-makers view him as head-coaching material. If Minnesota promoted him and the same issues persisted, the franchise would still have options. Proven coaches, like Mike Malone and Ty Lue, could be available in the offseason.\n\nEdwards is 24 years old and is inarguably a top-10 player in the league—arguably top five. Championship windows close faster than teams expect, and with every passing season, there is one less chance to capitalize on a generational talent.\n\nFinch deserves respect for what he’s built. But the NBA is a league of relentless timelines, and right now the Timberwolves look like a team drifting rather than charging forward.\n\nSo the question isn’t reckless. It’s fair.\n\nIs it time for Minnesota to make a change?\n\nThe post Is it Time for the Minnesota Timberwolves to Fire Chris Finch? appeared first on The Lead.",

His play earned him first-team All-Sun Belt in his redshirt junior season.\n\nStroud has visits scheduled with Colorado on Jan. 6, West Virginia (Jan. 2) and Michigan State (Jan. 9).\n\nGeorgia Southern all-conference EDGE/OLB MJ Stroud has set the following visits, his rep @kohllleo tells @CodyNagel247 and @chris_hummer:\n\nJan. 2 - West Virginia \nJan. 6 - Colorado\nJan. 9 - Michigan State@JustinThind @adamcm777 @CMAnderson247 https://t.co/SW8grawO3b\n\n— 247Sports Transfer Portal (@247SportsPortal) January 2, 2026\n\nStroud ended the season with a pass-rushing grade of 78.7 and an overall defensive grade of 73.7. With one year of eligibility remaining, Stroud could fit into the Buffaloes' edge rusher room that is currently light following the departure of star freshman Alexander McPherson and London Merritt.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 235-pound edge could turn out to be a much-needed addition for the Buffs, as he could earn a starting role playing time with his experience and productivity.\n\nContact/Follow us@BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Colorado football sets visit with OLB MJ Stroud",

    "description": "Pickens is prepared to talk to Jerry Jones about his contract, but wants his agent to do the heavy lifting.",
    "fullText": "This offseason looms large for Dallas Cowboys receiver George Pickens as he chases his first big NFL payday.\n\nA Pro Bowler for the first time, Pickens has made it clear he would like to return in 2026. Dak Prescott, Jerry Jones, and Brian Schottenheimer are just a few who have made their feelings clear on having Pickens return, also.\n\nBut the small matter of a contract needs to be discussed first.\n\nAnd we know that isn't exactly a straightforward thing with Mr. Jones.\n\nCLICK HERE and WIN the DAK PRESCOTT BOBBLEHEAD By Joining Our COWBOYS COMMUNITY\n\nWith Jerry stating earlier this week he will talk to both George and his agent, David Mulugheta, the next couple of months will be interesting to see how the billionaire owner approaches it.\n\nBut is George prepared to talk to Jerry about the numbers of his expected deal?\n\nHe said he's “super-prepared\" for negotiations.\n\nBut he added, \"I definitely leave that type stuff to my agent just because I let them talk the deals and all that stuff, but definitely super-prepared.\"\n\nSo, Pickens has made it clear in a six-word summation - \"I let them talk the deals'' -- that Mr. Mulugheta will be handling the heavy lifting.\n\nThere will be no Micah Parsons one-on-one private controversy repeat, at least from George's side.\n\nWith the franchise tag looking like the easy decision for both the franchise and the player, it would net Pickens roughly $28 million in 2026 and give the Cowboys another year to fully evaluate No. 3.\n\nBut this season, George, aside from a dip in form for two weeks, has been sublime.\n\nPickens has totaled 1,420 receiving yards and nine touchdowns from 92 receptions. That includes five 100+yard games mixed in.\n\nSo, George has been exactly who Dallas had hoped he would be in 2025.\n\nNow the next step is to pay him. And to call the agent in order to do so.",

Things became worrisome defensively when Tech allowed 48 points to NC State, ending Tech’s undefeated run at 8-0, and then followed it up by allowing 34 points to 1-win Boston College, then going down 28-0 to Pitt in just over a quarter of play.\n\nOn the plus side, Tech’s defense did hold georgia to only 16 points.\n\nWith Gideon’s departure, the Jackets currently have vancancies in both offensive and defensive coordinator. Former OC Buster Faulkner left to become Florida’s OC under John Sumrall before the Pop-Tarts Bowl.

    "fullText": "Cornerback Jontez Williams, the top player at his position in the 2026 transfer cycle, will visit with the Florida Gators on Thursday, Jan. 8, according to On3's Hayes Fawcett.\n\nBoth Gators Online and Swamp247 have confirmed the report. The former Iowa State Cyclone is also set to visit Notre Dame (Jan. 5-6) and USC (Jan. 3). Penn State remains a possibility as well, should Williams desire to follow his former head coach, Matt Campbell, to Happy Valley.\n\nA Florida native, Williams grew up playing high school ball 40 minutes away from the University of Florida at Bradford High in Starke.\n\n247Sports ranks him No. 34 overall and No. 1 among cornerbacks in the 2026 transfer portal cycle, while On3 has him at No. 14 and No. 1, respectively.\n\nA three-star recruit out of high school, according to 247sports and Rivals, Williams spent his first two seasons at Iowa State developing into an all-conference defensive back. He redshirted in 2022 after seeing no action and played in 13 games (two starts) in 2023. He finished his redshirt freshman year with six tackles (two solo) and three pass breakups.\n\nThe 2024 campaign saw Williams break out, starting 12 of 14 games for the Cyclones. He finished sixth on the team with 46 tackles (nine solo) and was tied for third in the Big 12 with four interceptions. He also recorded nine pass deflections and two tackles for a loss. He was named to the All-Big 12 Second Team by the coaches that year.\n\nWilliams' 2025 season was cut short after five games due to a torn ACL in his right knee. He ended the year with 15 tackles and one interception.\n\nThe Orange and Blue are losing Devin Moore to graduation and both Jamroc Grimsley and Teddy Foster to the transfer portal, leaving seven cornerbacks on the roster.\n\nRising juniors Dijon Johnson and Cormani McClain are the most veteran returners and are expected to start, followed by rising sophomore J'Vari Flowers and rising redshirt freshmen Ben Hanks III and Onis Konanbanny. Florida added a pair of four-star recruits, CJ Bronaugh and CJ Hester, during the early signing period.\n\nWilliams would likely step in as the top player in the position room, should he choose Florida.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida football hosting transfer CB Jontez Williams on visit",

Three new assistants signed deals. At least two assistants have been fired, triggering buyouts. And the bulk of Heupel's coaching staff was solidified.\n\nTennessee provided Knox News with the new coaches' contracts. Here are the details of the 2026 Vols staff pay.\n\nHeupel fired defensive coordinator Tim Banks and secondary coach Willie Martinez. Outside linebacker coach Levorn Harbin will no longer be part of the on-field coaching staff.\n\nHeupel did not retain strength coach Kurt Schmidt, whose contract expires Jan. 31. And he did not retain assistant secondary coach Earnest Thomas, who was not under contract as a support staff member.\n\nOn Dec. 11, Heupel hired veteran defensive coordinator Jim Knowles. On Jan. 2, Heupel hired former Penn State co-defensive coordinator Anthony Poindexter (co-defensive coordinator/secondary), former Penn State assistant Andrew Jackson (edge rushers) and former Ohio State assistant Michael Hunter Jr. (cornerbacks). Defensive line coach Rodney Garner got a two-year contract extension, and linebackers coach William Inge was also retained.\n\nHeupel has not hired a new strength coach yet. He retained his entire offensive coaching staff, recently giving raises and contract extensions to offensive coordinator Joey Halzle and wide receivers coach Kelsey Pope.\n\nHere are the updated contract details with 2026 salary for Heupel and his staff.\n\nJosh Heupel (head coach): $9 million through January 2030\n\nJim Knowles (defensive coordinator): $2 million through January 2029\n\nJoey Halzle (offensive coordinator/QBs): $1.45 million through January 2028\n\nRodney Garner (defensive line): $1 million through January 2028\n\nGlen Elarbee (offensive line): $900,000 through January 2028\n\nWilliam Inge (linebackers): $795,000 through January 2027\n\nKelsey Pope (wide receivers): $800,000 through January 2028\n\nAnthony Poindexter (safeties): $805,000 through January 2028\n\nDe'Rail Sims (running backs): $425,000 through January 2027\n\nAndrew Jackson (edge rushers): $375,000 through January 2028\n\nAlec Abeln (tight ends): $375,000 through January 2027\n\nEvan Crabtree (special teams): $250,000 through January 2028\n\nMichael Hunter Jr. (cornerbacks): $225,000 through January 2028\n\nAdam Sparks is the Tennessee football beat reporter.

    "description": "Douglas Farmer breaks down his early Mississippi vs. Miami predictions ahead of Thursday's CFP Fiesta Bowl clash.",
    "fullText": "Neither the Miami Hurricanes nor the Mississippi Rebels were expected to make it to the College Football Playoff semifinals. Both closed as about touchdown underdogs in the quarterfinals, and thanks to those two upsets, we may have a very unpredictable Fiesta Bowl on Wednesday, January 8.\n\nMy early Mississippi vs. Miami predictions and college football picks will trust the unit playing the best at the moment, one that has been a standout all season.\n\nHere are our early thoughts on the spread and total for this week’s game. We will have a full game preview (with a best bet and SGP) later in the week.\n\nMiami defensive ends Akheem Mesidor and Rueben Bain Jr. are playing too well right now to do anything but bet on them. The duo has combined for 7.5 sacks in two Playoff games, only part of the Hurricanes’ 12 total sacks in those two games.\n\nDoes Mississippi enjoy the best offensive line Miami has faced in the Playoff? Arguably, but only arguably. Both Texas A&M and Ohio State gave up higher pressure rates this season — No. 21 at 27.6% and No. 30 at 28.4%, respectively, compared to the Rebels at No. 4 in the country at 23.2%, per CFB-graphs.com. But A&M quarterback Marcel Reed was much more of a scramble threat than Trinidad Chambliss, and Buckeyes quarterback Julian Sayin was better at getting the ball out amid pressure.\n\nThus, Reed scrambled nearly twice as often as Chambliss does, and Sayin was sacked far less often, both in number and in damage done via the sacks.\n\nExpect Mesidor and Bain to disrupt Mississippi’s offense all on their own, a luxury provided by a dominant defensive line like this.\n\nAnd then expect the Hurricanes’ offense to find success against a relatively middling Rebels’ defense. In particular, Miami running back Mark Fletcher Jr. should break loose against a defense prone to giving up successes on a sustainable rate of rushing attempts.\n\nIf the Miami blueprint is defensive chaos plus rushing success, that is obviously setting up this game for an Under.\n\nKeep in mind, 51 is a relatively important number in college football totals betting.\n\nThe Hurricanes will seek to slow down this game, to force Trinidad Chambliss to replicate his stellar showing in the second half of the Sugar Bowl. He is clearly capable of that, but that kind of performance is also rather unlikely, particularly against a defense that is considerably better than Georgia’s.\n\nMississippi vs. Miami spread: Miami -3.5\n\nMississippi vs. Miami moneyline: Mississippi +128, Miami -154\n\nMississippi vs. Miami Over/Under: 51.5\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Kansas City (6-10) at Las Vegas (2-14)\n\nAgainst the spread: Chiefs 6-10, Raiders 6-10.\n\nSeries record: Chiefs lead 76-55-2.\n\nLast meeting: Chiefs beat Raiders 31-0 on Oct. 19 at Kansas City.\n\nLast week: Chiefs lost to the Broncos 20-13; Raiders lost to the Giants 34-10.\n\nChiefs offense: overall (17), rush (23), pass (13), scoring (20).\n\nChiefs defense: overall (10), rush (10), pass (13), scoring (6).\n\nRaiders offense: overall (32), rush (32), pass (27), scoring (32).\n\nRaiders defense: overall (16), rush (18), pass (15), scoring (25).\n\nTurnover differential: Chiefs minus-1; Raiders minus-7.\n\nQB Chris Oladokun was forced into the starting role two weeks ago in Tennessee, when Gardner Minshew followed Patrick Mahomes by tearing ligaments in his knee. He then had to prepare for his first NFL start on Christmas night on just three days' notice, and wound up throwing for just 66 yards. Expect a better performance with 10 days to prepare for this one.\n\nQBs Kenny Pickett and Aidan O'Connell. With Geno Smith dealing with a significant ankle injury, coach Pete Carroll said he expected both to play. Each will have a chance to show that the Raiders should bring him back next season or for one of the other 31 clubs to take notice.\n\nRaiders RB Ashton Jeanty vs. Chiefs defensive front. This hasn't been the kind of season Jeanty envisioned, but he is 112 yards from 1,000. He might have trouble reaching that milestone against a Chiefs defense that ranks 10th in allowing 104.9 yards per game. But Kansas City has given up 409 yards rushing in missed tackles, according to Next Gen Stats. Jeanty has gained 350 yards after breaking tackles, so he might have a chance.\n\nChiefs: RG Trey Smith (ankle) is unlikely to play. The Chiefs already have OTs Jawaan Taylor, Wanya Morris and Josh Simmons on injured reserve, along with Mahomes, Minshew, CBs Trent McDuffie Chris Roland-Wallace and Jaylen Watson, LB Leo Chenal and WRs Rashee Rice, Nikko Remigio and Tyquan Thornton.\n\nRaiders: QB Geno Smith (ankle) likely won't play. ... DT Adam Butler (bicep) wasn’t as seriously hurt as feared and could play. ... LT Kolton Miller (ankle) likely won’t play.\n\nThe Chiefs have won the past three meetings, six of seven and 11 of 13. ... Kansas City has never lost in Las Vegas. The Chiefs are 5-0 against the Raiders at Allegiant Stadium, and KC defeated San Francisco in the Super Bowl two seasons ago. ... The Chiefs and Raiders have met in three playoff games with Kansas City winning two of them.\n\nKansas City has lost five straight and seven of its past nine. ... The Chiefs are assured of their first losing season since 2012, the year before Andy Reid took over as coach. They went 2-14 that season under Romeo Crennel. ... Kansas City has had 272 yards of offense combined over the past two weeks. It has not eclipsed 275 yards in any of its past four games. ... Chiefs TE Travis Kelce needs 46 yards receiving to reach 13,000 for his career. He has caught a pass in 189 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NFL and longest streak in franchise history. ... DT Chris Jones needs one sack to tie Neil Smith (85 1/2) for third most in Chiefs history. ... The Raiders have lost 10 consecutive games, tied with a skid last season for the fifth-longest skid in franchise history. Another defeat would tie for the third longest which was set in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. The Raiders' longest losing streaks were 19 games in the 1961-62 seasons and 16 in 2013-14. ... Las Vegas' losing streak is the longest active one in the NFL. ... The Raiders have a point differential of minus-193, worst in the NFL. ... Their average point different is minus-12.1 per game. If it doesn't improve, that will be the highest since the 2020 New York Jets finished with a minus-13.4 average. ... RB Ashton Jeanty is one of two rookies ever with at least 800 yards rushing, five rushing touchdowns and five receiving TDs. The other is Hall of Famer Gale Sayers in 1965. ... LB Devin White's 168 tackles are second to Miami's Jordyn Brooks, who has 174. ... ... The Raiders have held opponents to zero or negative yards on 95 rushing plays, tied with Minnesota for best in the league. ... A victory would give Las Vegas coach Pete Carroll 173 for his career, which would move him into a tie for 16th with Jeff Fisher. Carroll is currently tied with Bill Parcells.\n\nThe Chiefs defense might be worth a look given the Raiders offensive struggles. They have failed to reach 30 points a franchise-worst 36 straight regular-season games.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Liberty led the nation with 21 interceptions in 2023 and frequently ranked near the top in the nation in turnovers forced.\n\nKrantz is a Northern Colorado graduate. He was Washington State's special teams coordinator in 2021 and has also worked at Missouri (2022), South Carolina (2016-20), Auburn (2015), Florida (2013-14), Kentucky (2011-12) and Northern Colorado (2009-10).\n\nMcClendon spent the last four seasons as the defensive line coach at UConn under Mora.\n\nPrior to UConn, he was at Youngstown State (2020-21). He was at Valdosta State (2018-19) to help win a national championship.\n\nMcClendon played on the defensive line at Central Michigan (2009-13) and has also worked at Carthage College, Iowa State and Central Michigan.\n\nHilliard and Mora have a long connection. Hilliard worked under Mora at UConn from 2022-25 and also was a graduate assistant for Mora at UCLA from 2015-17.\n\nUConn's secondaries had double-digit interception numbers in three of his four seasons. Prior to UConn, he worked at Arkansas State (2021), Tennessee Martin (2019-20) and UCLA.\n\nDiabate joins Mora from UConn, where he served in the same role for the last four seasons (2022-25). Diabate has also coached at Middle Tennessee State (2017-21), Notre Dame (2017), Colgate (2015-17) and Syracuse (2013-15).\n\nHe played linebacker at Syracuse prior to his coaching career.\n\nAh You is retained by Mora after serving on Norvell's staff in 2025. Prior to CSU, he spent four seasons at Weber State coaching linebackers. The former BYU linebacker has also coached at BYU (2018-19), Oregon State (2017) and Utah State (2016).\n\nMatthews played for Colorado State as a safety from 2011-15 and earned All-Mountain West honors twice. He finished his career in the top-10 in school history in interceptions and games played and started.\n\nHe returned to CSU on Norvell's staff in 2025 and was retained by Mora. He's also worked at Colorado Mesa (2022-24) and Northern Colorado (2019) as well as in the high school ranks.\n\nBrown served in the same role he will hold at CSU for the last two seasons under Mora at UConn.\n\nPrior to UConn, he held the same role at Mississippi State from 2020-23 and Washington State before that from 2018-20.\n\nHe played defensive back at Sioux Falls, helping his team win two NAIA national championships. Brown has also worked at Elon, South Florida, Washington, Baylor and with the Houston Texans.\n\nBosnos is retained by Mora in the same role he served in 2025 and Bosnos has been with the Rams since 2022 in a variety of roles.\n\nPrior to CSU, Bosnos was on Norvell's recruiting and personnel staff at Nevada (2018-21).\n\nCollins is retained by Mora in the same role he served in 2025 after being hired as CSU's first football GM. Collins oversees the recruiting efforts and roster personnel for the CSU football program.\n\nPrior to CSU, Collins worked at Ole Miss (2020-24) where he was in player personnel and recruiting.

    "description": "Saturday's matchup against the Buccaneers represents a lot for Dan Morgan, Dave Canales and the Panthers.",
    "fullText": "The day is Nov. 8, 2018, and the 6-2 Carolina Panthers are on the road to meet with the 5-2-1 Pittsburgh Steelers for a Thursday night matchup. But the prime-time showcase went awry, particularly when linebacker T.J. Watt went unblocked and slammed into the right shoulder of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton right before the half.\n\nCarolina's eventual 52-21 loss that evening kickstarted a poisonous seven-game losing streak and torpedoed their playoff hopes, while leaving their franchise passer with a career-altering injury. And since then, the franchise hasn't been the same.\n\nTheir downfall in 2018 marked the first season of a now-franchise-record seven-year playoff drought. Over that time, they've gone through six different head coaches, including two interims, and a laundry list's worth of failed quarterback projects.\n\nWell, that long nightmare could end here—in Week 18 of the 2025 campaign—where a refreshing dream awaits. The Panthers, at a modest 8-8, will head into Raymond James Stadium on Saturday with an opportunity to climb out of the NFL's basement and into the throne of the NFC South.\n\nTomorrow's showdown against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers not only represents a chance for the organization to capture their first division title since the 2015 Super Bowl run, but also the progress the current regime of general manager Dan Morgan and head coach Dave Canales has accomplished. Even though there have been a few bumps on the way, the road paved by both Morgan and Canales has led the Panthers to the doorstep of the playoffs.\n\nA win over the Bucs—who, by the way, have ruled over the NFC South since 2021—officially clinches the division for the Panthers. And while there is an alternate route there, one that would see the Atlanta Falcons take care of the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, Carolina knows that their shot is in front of them.\n\n\"It's a true championship moment,\" Canales told reporters on Monday. \"Shirts-and-hats games—it's what you work so hard for all year. It's right in front of us. Prime-time football in Tampa. It's gonna be fantastic, we're excited about it and that's enough. That's enough for the guys to understand—this is your shot, this is the last shot we have.\"\n\nGone is the hopelessness. Absent is the bitter disappointment. Missing is the pure frustration.\n\nNo, they are not complete and are not one or even two pieces away from the first Lombardi Trophy of their 31-year existence. They are, however, perfectly imperfect for this moment—and, as they've shown for several months, the definition of \"Keep Pounding.\"\n\nThe Panthers can take a tangible step forward on Saturday. A victory would validate their current rebuilding process and provide hope for a starving fan base.\n\nNow, it’s up to the players to get the job done, and it's time for a head coach to throw everything out there to make it happen.\n\nFollow @ThePanthersWire on Twitter/X for more Panthers content.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Panthers Wire: Why the Panthers are about to play one of the biggest games in franchise history",

The award was voted on by his teammates.\n\nGainwell has certainly turned heads in his first season with the Steelers.\n\nThrough 16 games, Gainwell has rushed for 527 yards on 109 carries (4.8 average) and four touchdowns. His 527 yards rushing are second on the team to Jaylen Warren’s 892 yards. Gainwell also has 65 receptions for 422 yards (6.5 average) and three touchdown receptions. His 422 receiving yards rank third on the team, behind receiver DK Metcalf and tight end Pat Freiermuth.\n\nGainwell leads the team with 65 receptions and 949 all-purpose yards.\n\nSteelers head coach Mike Tomlin said last Tuesday that he expected Gainwell to have an increased role with Pittsburgh when the team signed him last offseason. Tomlin saw firsthand what Gainwell was capable of in the Philadelphia Eagles’ win over the Steelers in 2024.\n\ncom.\n\nDownload the FREE WPXI News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Channel 11 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch WPXI NOW",

    "description": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. has been having the best season of his career and now, he's drawing trade interest from multiple teams.",
    "fullText": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. has been having the best season of his career to the point that there is some buzz of him being an All-Star for the first time. Brooklyn has put Porter in a position to show what he can do as the primary scoring option on a team and now, he is drawing trade interest from multiple teams ahead of the February deadline.\n\nAccording to NBA insider Jake Fischer, Porter could potentially land with teams like the Milwaukee Bucks, Detroit Pistons, Golden State Warriors, and Chicago Bulls based on what he's hearing thus far. The Bucks being mentioned for the second time in connection to Porter is interesting given that Sam Amick of The Athletic reported recently that Porter is one of the players that Milwaukee is interested in trading for.\n\n\"The Nets, to this point, are best characterized as listening to offers for Porter rather than actively shopping him,\" Fischer wrote while explaining what Brooklyn's thought process is regarding a potential Porter trade. \"It could also be argued that it might behoove Brooklyn to wait until the offseason before any MPJ move to enable the Nets to use his contract as outgoing salary in any aggressive offseason splurge of their own.\"\n\nPorter, 27, is averaging 25.8 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 3.3 assists per game while shooting 49.6% from the field and 41.0% from behind the three-point line in 26 games played this season. As Fischer noted, Brooklyn doesn't have to trade Porter prior to the deadline if they believe that he can be part of the future or that they can get more for him in the offseason. Players around the league are recognizing that Porter is showing more this season than he ever did during his time with the Denver Nuggets.\n\n\"It's different. He didn't have as much freedom in Denver... He's showing that he's the player that everybody thought or knew he was coming out of college. He's finally getting to show that,\" Warriors forward Draymond Green said of Porter following Monday's matchup between the franchises, per Erik Slater of ClutchPoints. Golden State won the game 120-107, but Porter dropped 27 points despite the Warriors focusing all of their defensive attention on him throughout the contest.\n\nWhen the Nets traded forward Cam Johnson to the Nuggets this past summer in exchange for Porter and a 2032 first-round pick, there were some around the NBA that criticized Brooklyn for giving up too much for Porter, a player considered to be a negative value on his contract. However, it seems that Porter has changed minds over the first few months of the season. Per Fischer, one executive even asked \"Who couldn't use an MPJ?\"\n\nDraymond Green on facing Michael Porter Jr. with the Nets compared to the Nuggets:\n\n\"It's different. He didn't have as much freedom in Denver... He's showing that he's the player that everybody thought or knew he was coming out of college. He's finally getting to show that.\" pic.twitter.com/YYtJOBiMBy\n\n— Erik Slater (@erikslater_) December 30, 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nets Wire: Nets' Michael Porter Jr. drawing trade interest from multiple teams",

    "fullText": "Ohio State offensive lineman Devontae Armstrong plans to enter the NCAA Transfer Portal, per On3’s Hayes Fawcett. He spent two seasons with the Buckeyes.\n\nArmstrong redshirted his true freshman season in 2024 and didn’t see any action this season as well. His twin brother, Deontae, made one appearance this season, playing against Grambling State.\n\nDevontae Armstrong played high school football at St. Edward (OH), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 465 overall player and No. 38 interior offensive lineman in the 2024 recruiting cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Rankings.\n\nArmstrong is the 12th Ohio State player to announce his intent to enter the transfer portal this offseason. He is joined by several notable players, including quarterback Lincoln Kienholz, EDGE Logan George and linebacker CJ Hicks. As of this report, Armstrong’s brother has not announced he will be entering the transfer portal.\n\nOhio State only lost 15 players total in the transfer portal last season. The team placed in On3’s 2025 Team Transfer Portal Rankings. In no surprise, the 2024 national champions had an excellent 2025 campaign.\n\nOhio State finished this season with a 12-2 overall record after suffering a 24-14 loss to Miami in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals on New Year’s Eve. After the Buckeyes’ loss on Wednesday, head coach Ryan Day shouldered the blame for his team’s slow start.\n\n“We worked really hard … to come out of the gates and win the first quarter, win the first half and be ready to go,” Day said. “I thought we had an excellent plan. But at the end of the day, we didn’t get it done. That starts with me.\n\n“”We spent an inordinate amount of time putting the plan together to get everybody ready to go play in that first half. … We’ve got to figure out why that was and learn from it moving forward.”\n\nNext season will Ryan Day’s eighth at the helm of the program. The Buckeyes will look to bounce back and return to the national championship once again.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "description": "Gasperini’s starting XI should be a carbon copy of the side that dismantled Genoa on Monday.",
    "fullText": "“[Lorenzo] Pellegrini and [Leon] Bailey have got the flu, although they were injured anyway. [Niccolo] Pisilli should recover, hopefully. [Mario] Hermoso has recovered and we need to look at Wesley, who has a few niggles. There’s quite a bit going on and we’ll need to make some decisions but I’m sure we’ll try to get everyone fit for a match like this. We’ll be highly motivated.”\n\nThose were the latest injury updates from Gian Piero Gasperini during his pre-match press conference on Saturday. Fortunately for Roma, the flu hasn’t affected any of the players who are fit to play, and Hermoso’s recovery comes at a crucial moment, given Evan Ndicka’s absence for AFCON. Gasperini was also asked about his center-backs and the increasingly important role of Jan Ziolkowski in Ndicka’s stead.\n\n“With Celik playing wide, we have five defenders, with Ndicka at AFCON and [Gianluca] Mancini and Hermoso one card away from a ban, in a team that wants to stay in the Coppa Italia and in the Europa League, and certainly in Serie A. I’ve never been one for huge squads. I’m looking at the academy too but at the moment I think all the academies are a bit less prolific than they were in the past. In any case, you need a squad of at least 20 players plus the goalkeepers. Sometimes you have to go with players who play less, like Ziolkowski, and give them time to become as reliable as Mancini or Ndicka. That’s the aim. Those are the numbers. You don’t need an enormous squad but a complete squad.”\n\nThose are certainly encouraging words from the manager, as Roma will rely on Ziolkowski, Mancini, and Hermoso for as long as Ndicka is away. Despite the niggles reported for Wesley, we still expect the Brazilian to start wide on the left, with Çelik on the right. Given El Aynaoui’s absence at AFCON and Pisilli’s ongoing recovery, the usual Cristante–Koné pairing should patrol the center of the pitch.\n\nMeanwhile, Evan Ferguson should again lead the line with support from Paulo Dybala and Matías Soulé. Gasperini spoke about Dybala during his presser as well.\n\n“I like Dybala when he scores and when he helps others to score. He has to get forward, get into the box, time his runs, and when we’re struggling he has to help the team. With his technique and his football intelligence he can help us when the opponents are in our area. But the real Dybala is the one who scores goals, sets up team-mates, takes free kicks and set-pieces. Those things.”\n\nROMA (3-4-2-1): Svilar; Mancini, Ziolkowski, Hermoso; Çelik, Cristante, Koné, Wesley; Soulé, Dybala; Ferguson.",

After one season as Purdue football's defensive coordinator, Mike Scherer is returning to UNLV, ESPN's Pete Thamel reported.\n\nScherer followed head coach Barry Odom from UNLV, signing a three-year contract last December. He was paid a base salary of $1 million for the 2025 season.\n\nIn addition to calling the defense, Scherer coached linebackers in his one season at Purdue. He left the program last month. He's previously spent two seasons as Odom's defensive coordinator and linebacker coach at UNLV from 2023-24 and had played linebacker under Odom at Missouri. Scherer also worked under Odom when Odom was Arkansas defensive coordinator.\n\nAfter serving as Purdue's defensive coordinator from 2023-24, Kevin Kane was hired back by the Boilermakers as Scherer's successor after one season on Minnesota's staff.\n\nLast season, the Boilermakers went 2-10, and Purdue's defense ranked 17th out of 18 Big Ten teams in yards allowed per game (423.5), yards allowed per play (6.6) and points allowed (31.8).\n\nSam King covers sports for the Journal & Courier.

    "fullText": "Texas ‘confident’ in landing $1.8 million transfer weapon for Arch Manning originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe old saying still applies: Everything is bigger in the state of Texas — including the NIL budget for the Texas Longhorns.\n\nTexas hasn’t exactly been shy about its spending over the past few years in its pursuit of the program’s first national championship since 2005. Even back in 2024, Lamborghini Austin — one of the Longhorns’ most visible NIL supporters — lined up luxury vehicles to help entice incoming recruits.\n\nThe dealership has previously signed former Texas stars Bijan Robinson and Jordan Whittington. Now, it appears Lamborghini Austin could be involved again as the Longhorns pursue one of the top players in the transfer portal: former Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman.\n\nAs of January 2, Coleman is visiting Austin, and Texas is feeling optimistic about its chances.\n\n“Texas’ confidence is high that they can land the talented pass catcher,” On3’s Pete Nakos reported.\n\nLanding Coleman, who has a reported NIL value of $1.8 million, would be a major addition for the Longhorns, who are looking to surround quarterback Arch Manning with as much offensive firepower as possible heading into next season.\n\nHowever, Texas won’t have a clear path to securing his commitment.\n\nUnless Texas is able to close the deal during his visit, Coleman plans to take additional trips, according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel. After leaving Austin, he is expected to visit Texas A&M, Texas Tech, Alabama and USC.\n\nThose programs are all capable of competing in the NIL space, but Texas may still hold a significant advantage. The Longhorns’ 2025 roster was reportedly built with an NIL budget in the $35–40 million range. Unless that number shifts following Texas’ playoff miss this season, it will be difficult for most schools to outbid them.\n\nFor now, Coleman’s visit represents another example of how Texas continues to leverage its financial muscle in the transfer portal — and why landing elite talent in Austin often comes down to whether anyone else can realistically keep pace.",

    "description": "Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo should be no stranger to upcoming open head coaching interviews.",
    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s Jordan Raanan, Indianapolis Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo is among the initial top interview candidates for the New York Giants current head coaching vacancy:\n\n“The first assignment is to find a new head coach. The Giants fired Brian Daboll almost eight weeks ago and named Mike Kafka the interim head coach,” writes Ranaan.\n\n“The team had a head start on compiling a list of candidates that includes former NFL head coach Mike McCarthy, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, former Raiders coach and Giants player Antonio Pierce and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, among others. Kafka will also be given an interview.”\n\nWhoever is ultimately hired in New York will replace Brian Daboll, who coached the Giants from 2022-25.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Anarumo has been linked to an NFL head coaching opening, as he’s previously been connected in-season as a top candidate for the Tennessee Titans vacancy through multiple league reports respectively.\n\nNicknamed the “Mad Scientist,” the 59-year-old veteran defensive coordinator has been lauded for his ability to tailor his defensive gameplans weekly to stopping the opposing competition, even giving the likes of Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes some trouble in the past among other elite quarterbacks.\n\nIn his debut campaign with the Colts, there’s no question that Anarumo has been a significant upgrade to his Colts veteran defensive coordinator predecessor Gus Bradley.\n\nWhen healthy and going right, the Colts had a formidable unit this season.\n\nThat being said, after losing arguably the defense’s three best players down the season’s late stretch due to key injuries, namely to DeForest Buckner, Sauce Gardner, and Charvarius Ward, the Colts defense has since fallen on some hard times to close out this season. It no longer recently resembles the Top 10 defensive unit that it was for the majority of the 2025 campaign because of the loss of its best players.\n\nIt’s hard to win on defense in the NFL without your horses. Much less, there’s personnel issues with the Colts lack of consistent outside pass rush that go beyond Anarumo and key injuries down the final stretch.\n\nAnarumo has paid his coaching dues, has a track record of success, and is deserving of strong consideration for any NFL head coaching opening this upcoming offseason. However, it would be a real shame if he only gets to coach the Colts defense for one season. To me, he’s a top candidate to return in Indianapolis as defensive coordinator even in the rare case that Colts head coach Shane Steichen surprisingly doesn’t.\n\nGiven that we really didn’t see this unit fully together healthy upon Gardner’s arrival, Anarumo’s coaching best is still theoretically yet to come in Indianapolis—if we even get to see it again.",

    "description": "The streamer’s annual charts are just another version of the tech that’s alienating us from our inner lives. Hold on to your musical memories and reclaim ownership of your taste",
    "fullText": "The streamer’s annual charts are just another version of the tech that’s alienating us from our inner lives. Hold on to your musical memories and reclaim ownership of your taste\n\nI like year-end list season. I like an opportunity to remember and reflect on the records that stuck with me over the course of a year – especially when there is a chance to recommend something that others may have overlooked. I like looking through friends’ favourites for albums that I missed completely, and making a big listening queue. I like following along as critics attempt to determine the year’s “best”, even when I end up yelling into a group chat about how wrong they all are. I like it because it all requires looking back, racking your brain and processing your year in listening. It requires thinking.\n\nThis year, as Spotify Wrapped takes over social media feeds again, I am struck by how the whole concept seems to discourage that critical practice for something more passive. It nudges listeners away from deep consideration and towards accepting a corporate-branded scorecard reflecting a very specific perspective on musical value. It encourages music fans to believe that the records they streamed the most must be the ones they liked the most, which is surely not always the case.\n\nWhat is lost when we entrust Spotify’s systems of data collection and interpretation to do our year-end reflections for us? What ideas and recaps are we not writing and sharing when we hand over that labour to tech companies who would prefer to automate our thinking? What playlist are you not making when you share the one Spotify has made for you?\n\nAs with other ways in which convenience culture infects music – from personalised playlists to prompt-based audio generation and beyond – it makes sense that some fans would receive their results, see the “share” button, and dutifully comply. But what’s at stake is a sense of our own musical memories, and our own personal archives of our years. When our own thoughts and recollections aren’t written down they can simply get lost. When we just accept that what a streaming service tells us about our music taste is true, there is much that we are not remembering, learning or celebrating about the music of our years and lives.\n\nSpotify Wrapped now feels like just another example of something personal and precious that is being automated away from us; another example of a supposedly unbearable task of thinking and writing being “offloaded” in order to make life more frictionless. It is an especially urgent consideration in 2025, a landmark year for consumers being sold on this sort of cognitive offloading via consumer-facing AI. It can feel as though every day there is some new start-up prompt-based surveillance product claiming to ease the daily burdens of reading, writing, researching, summarising or brainstorming – but this is the work that helps shape how we think, how we make connections, what we remember and what we forget. It may sometimes feel unpleasant and it may require friction, but friction is where connections get made, and working through that process is a part of staying sharp and curious and in relationship with the world around us. Without those points of friction, the degeneration of critical thinking just continues.\n\nThere is much to be said about how corporate decision-making shapes public memory when it comes to music – not just because marketing budgets often determine what becomes popular but because corporate strategy decides the very metrics that dictate what has value. But Wrapped does not just use corporate metrics to communicate what’s important to the market – it uses the same logic to make claims about what’s important to you. It reinforces its own logic into not just taste but one’s sense of self.\n\nAnd there are other reasons to find the whole Wrapped idea generally troubling – and not just Wrapped but the similar year-end recap campaigns that other streaming services have launched to mimic it. These are essentially meme-like advertising campaigns for companies that notoriously pay musicians penny fractions. And they are only possible due to user-surveillance practices. As for Spotify specifically, in a year in which the biggest music streaming company has made headlines for its outgoing CEO’s investment in military AI technology and the subsequent artist boycotts, its deals with major labels to build generative AI products, big changes in its leadership and its running of ICE recruitment ads, there will likely be much Wrapped-synchronised commentary on the state of streaming – and the varied reasons users will find for opting out this year.\n\nSo what will we opt into instead? This year, rather than letting a streaming service tell you what records were important to you simply because you played them the most on one app, consider taking the time to write a list based on what you actually connected with. Share it if you feel like it – even if it’s just a notes app screenshot or a scribbled, handwritten list that you photograph and share with a caption. Even if you only text or email it to some friends. Or if you prefer, write it in a notebook just for yourself and your archives.\n\nI can already hear some of the defeatist replies this idea is likely to receive: “But the people who post their Wrapped were never going to make their own lists anyway!” To which I say: “Why not?” It may require some research but at least you can determine the parameters for yourself. I would suggest a list of records you feel may have been overlooked, or a list of your favourite local releases. Or how about a list of the most exciting live shows you saw, or the most surprising new-to-you music from the past? The possibilities are limitless. Corporations take so much: let’s not let them have this too.",

    "fullText": "Tax authorities are closing in on crypto tax evasion, and the net is widening beyond national borders. Beginning Jan. 1 in the U.K. and more than 40 other countries, exchanges must start collecting and reporting detailed trading records for local customers. This data can expose undeclared gains and, in some cases, help investigators trace suspicious flows. The change matters for the payments and FinTech ecosystem that connects bank accounts and cards to crypto platforms.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 report, the Financial Times said major cryptocurrency exchanges will be required to collect full transaction records for U.K. customers, including purchase price, sale price and profits, and to gather and report users’ tax residency information to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The U.K. is part of an initial group of 48 jurisdictions implementing the OECD’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, or CARF, which sets a common format for reporting and sharing crypto trading data.\n\n“This is the beginning of the end for crypto investors who thought they could invest and gain from crypto in secrecy,” said Andrew Park, a tax investigations partner at Price Bailey.\n\nThe FT said that from 2027 HMRC will begin automatically sharing the information it receives with other participating tax authorities, including all EU countries, as well as jurisdictions such as the Channel Islands, Brazil, the Cayman Islands and South Africa. Overall, 75 countries have committed to implement CARF, with major crypto hubs including the UAE, Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland slated to join in 2027 and start exchanging data in 2028; the U.S. is expected to implement in 2028, with exchanges beginning in 2029.\n\nFor U.K. taxpayers, the FT noted that crypto taxes generally fall under capital gains rules, with profits above a £3,000 annual allowance taxable, although heavy buying and selling can be treated as trading and taxed as income with national insurance. HMRC has also opened a voluntary disclosure facility for undeclared gains made before April 2024 and trebled “nudge” letters to 65,000 suspected non-compliers in the 2024–25 tax year.\n\nPYMNTS’ recent reporting has tracked the fraud backdrop that regulators cite when they push for more transparency. PYMNTS covered the Justice Department’s new crypto scam “strike force,” aimed at organized networks tied to China. PYMNTS also reported on a Senate bill that would create a federal task force to combat cryptocurrency scams, and on an SEC case alleging a $14 million scheme that targeted retail investors.

    "description": "Detecting kinetic vulnerabilities in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), vulnerabilities in control code that can precipitate hazardous physical consequences, is a critical challenge. This task is complicated by the need to analyze the intricate coupling between complex software behavior and the system's physical dynamics. Furthermore, the periodic execution of control code in CPS applications creates a combinatorial explosion of execution paths that must be analyzed over time, far exceeding the scope of traditional single-run code analysis.\n  This paper introduces RampoNN, a novel framework that systematically identifies kinetic vulnerabilities given the control code, a physical system model, and a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specification of safe behavior. RampoNN first analyzes the control code to map the control signals that can be generated under various execution branches.",

    "title": "Albert Einstein's Brilliant Politics",
    "description": "The physicist fought for the promise of a diverse, meritocratic America. We need his optimism today.",
    "fullText": "As Albert Einstein wrote elegantly about our experience of time and space, he also devoted his days to the process of social transformation: the question of how one world becomes another. He was concerned about not just the perils of progress—including modern science’s role in the creation of apocalyptic weapons—but also the promise of a more just society. From his very first years in the United States, Einstein wrote powerfully in opposition to American segregation, drawing on his personal experience of Nazi persecution as well as his ties to the long-standing African American community in Princeton, New Jersey, where he lived. In 1946, deep in the Jim Crow era, he visited the nation’s first degree-granting historically Black institution, Lincoln University, where he gave talks and accepted an honorary degree. Eighty years later, after searching through the archives of his correspondence that are housed in Princeton, I’m reflecting on the full scope of what we have inherited from him.\n\nEinstein was among the first faculty members of the Institute for Advanced Study, which was founded in 1930 as an independent research center against the backdrop of fascism’s rise in Europe. He was a faculty member at IAS, which was initially housed at Princeton University, from 1933 to 1955, setting down roots in the town as he and the growing institution changed the trajectory of the modern world. This fall, I’m a visiting fellow at the institute, and the opportunity has inspired me to think about the wide range of subjects he explored while living here: not just his study of general relativity, quantum theory, and statistical mechanics, but also his devotion to the cause of human freedom. His critical optimism, rooted in a rigorous scientific worldview and a deeply humanistic sensibility, is imperiled today in a cultural moment marked by broad skepticism of scientific research and the promise of higher education. If we hope to revive and reclaim this persistent hope, his story—and the ethical vision it helps to illuminate—is a good place to begin.\n\nThe Princeton that Albert Einstein knew in 1933 was sharply divided by the color line; a long-established border—marked by Witherspoon, John, and Jackson Streets—separated its predominantly Black neighborhood from the rest of town. Einstein walked or biked across this divide often as he traveled through Princeton—he famously never learned to drive—and that journey was often accompanied by the voices of the children of Witherspoon, many of them yelling questions from bedroom windows.\n\nYears later, in interviews recorded by the researchers Fred Jerome and Rodger Taylor, several of the men and women who once were those children offered lovely, vivid descriptions of their neighbor. Mercedes Woods describes his wild white hair and unlaced shoes; Shirl Gadson remembers his frequent walks and talks with her mother, Violet; Henry Pannell recalls Einstein giving out nickels to the neighborhood kids before sitting with Henry’s grandmother on the porch. Shirley Satterfield, a local legend and historian of African American life in Princeton, remembers meeting Einstein while spending the day with her mother, Alice, who worked as dining staff at IAS more than 70 years ago. When Shirley asked her mother what she and Einstein had talked about, she told her, simply, “the weather, or whatever.” His local reputation—as someone whom you could ask anything, anytime—was an outgrowth of his lived relationship with this community.\n\nEinstein’s opposition to segregation was already well known in some quarters by the time he moved to Princeton. In 1932, W. E. B. Du Bois published a letter from him in The Crisis, one of the nation’s most prominent Black publications, in which the scientist offers the idea that racialized self-hatred, though often imposed by the majority, could be defeated through a communal practice of education and self-empowerment, “so an emancipation of the soul of the minority may be attained.” This was the aim of so much of Einstein’s public political writing: a conscious shift in perception, engineered via collective effort. To me, this seems like an extension of his scientific thinking—a theory of change made to the measure of a human life. In his letter to Du Bois, Einstein’s focal point is the structure of human cognition: how socially sanctioned prejudice corrupts our mental models of the world and ourselves. I don’t think this can be easily separated from his interest in the fundamental workings of motion and time, or his belief that, as he once wrote, the “most beautiful logical theory means nothing in natural science without comparison with the exactest experience.”\n\nThroughout his career, one of Einstein’s core projects was what he called “unified field theory”: a single, elegant framework that would help us better understand the forces giving form and structure to the universe. This pursuit was also representative, I think, of Einstein’s larger political project—his desire to challenge false schemas of perceived difference. These distortions keep us from seeing fundamental truths about the nature of mortal life: that we are irreducibly complex, atoms and air, opaque to one another in ways that demand curiosity rather than surety. In “Geometry and Experience” he writes, “As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.” Everything we see, on this plane of perception, is in a state of endless transformation.\n\nEinstein’s commitment to the creation of a new world, through both direct protest and everyday acts of solidarity, is visible in his relationships with artists and freedom fighters such as Paul Robeson, a native son of Princeton, whom he met in 1935 amid a national increase in extrajudicial killings of African Americans. At Robeson’s invitation, Einstein became a co-chair of the American Crusade to End Lynching. He also wrote a letter to President Harry Truman requesting the passage of a federal anti-lynching law. This sort of political activity eventually made Einstein a target of J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI, which surveilled him through his final years. At the time of his death, his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.\n\nWhen the opera singer Marian Anderson performed a sold-out show in 1937 at Princeton’s McCarter Theatre—the same venue where Einstein had first met Robeson two years earlier—she was barred from staying at the segregated Nassau Inn next door to the campus. Though they had never met before that day, Einstein offered her his home. They would remain friends until the end of his life. During a 1940 speech at the World’s Fair in Queens, New York, beside an exhibit honoring notable immigrants, Einstein described Black music as “the finest contribution in the realm of art which America has so far given to the world.” He went on to say: “And this great gift we owe, not to those whose names are engraved on this ‘Wall of Fame,’ but to the children of the people, blossoming namelessly as the lilies of the field.”\n\nRead: The scientist and the fascist\n\nAmong the great surprises of Einstein’s archive are the letters written to him by children across the world. A girl named June asked whether he was a real person or a fictional character. Others wanted to know how a bird’s feathers attain their color, or wished that he would settle schoolyard debates about whether life could exist without the sun (he responded with a litany of life-forms that need sunshine to survive). The subject of Tyfanny’s note is infinitude. After describing her daily practice of looking out the window to study stars with her boarding-school friends, and relaying her excitement about learning that Einstein was not dead after all, as she had initially assumed, she asks: “How can space go on forever?” Einstein replies with a combination of solemnity and wit: “Thank you for your letter of July 10th. I have to apologize to you that I am still among the living. There will be a remedy for this, however.” After answering Tyfanny’s question, Einstein ends his note with a larger claim about intellectual freedom and state control:\n\nI hope that yours and your friend’s future astronomical investigations will not be discovered anymore by the eyes and ears of your school government. This is the attitude taken by most good citizens toward their government and I think rightly so.\n\nI spent weeks searching for the historical Einstein at IAS—whose online database is named Albert, in his honor—and every time I logged on, I happened upon some new and unexpected figure in the ensemble of his life. As I tried to home in on the man so often perceived as a solitary genius, Albert seemed to point me elsewhere: to Einstein’s walking companions and their children; to Robeson, Anderson, and Du Bois; and even to the Institute Woods, the nature preserve that adjoins IAS. I learned that an African American family, the Bedfords, once lived in a house there. According to one interview, they were “due to get electricity” at some point from the institute. But they eventually had to move, and their home was destroyed.\n\nThrough a combination of interviews and archival searches, I soon learned of other local families displaced over the years as the town continued to transform: the Montgomeries, the Wrights. Hearing and reading these names, I thought of Bruce Wright, born in Baltimore and raised in Princeton; he was admitted to Princeton University in the 1930s. During his first day on campus, once the administration realized that it had offered a place to a Black student, his admission was revoked and he was asked to leave. In 1935, IAS—still on Princeton’s campus—had attempted to recruit its first Black visiting fellow, a mathematician named William Claytor, and was overruled by the university administration. In 1939, the year the institute moved to a separate campus, it offered Claytor a fellowship, but he rejected the offer on principle. These sorts of stories reflect the Princeton that Einstein lived in—and did his best to navigate with integrity.\n\nAlongside essays such as “Freedom and Science,” in which Einstein writes that “spiritual development and perfection” are possible only when “outward and inner freedom are constantly and consciously pursued,” I found photos of him walking across campus alone, but also some of crowded parties with Einstein at the center of the action, as well as shots of him working in the community to achieve his vision of beauty and justice. I also saw pictures of workers in the mail room, kitchen, and grounds who had helped keep the institute running after Einstein was gone—people such as James H. Barbour Jr., who had managed the buildings and grounds at IAS for two and a half decades, and Gary Alvin, who had worked in the mail room for 39 years, drove faculty to and from campus, and documented everyday life with his camera. While in search of one man’s story, I found a constellation of others. This is one of the great lessons of Einstein’s legacy: that the work of scientific discovery, like the work of social transformation, is no solo act. We must learn to live for one another.\n\nRead: Why so many MIT students are writing poetry\n\nMy first trip to IAS was 16 years ago, at the invitation of Adventures of the Mind, an organization devoted to creating mentorship opportunities for promising high-school students. I was there to read poems alongside two former U.S. poets laureate, Billy Collins and Rita Dove. During the official tour for the new fellows this past September, I noticed all sorts of things that I hadn’t during my first trip here: the lake where visitors skate once frost covers the grounds in winter, the Bauhaus-style apartments housing fellows and their families, the elegant shape of the large linden tree behind Fuld Hall, where Einstein’s office was once located. A small group of us was guided through a campus that features Einstein’s influence at every turn (multiple statues bear his likeness). In the director’s office, there is even a blueprint on the wall depicting a sailboat that was built for him.\n\nOut of everything we saw on the campus tour, this singular image became an obsession of mine: framed schematics for a vessel lost to history. Searching the archives, I discovered this anecdote about Einstein sailing in Europe:\n\nWhile his hand holds the rudder Einstein explains with joy his latest scientific ideas to his present friends. He sails the boat with the skill and fearlessness of a child. He himself hoists the sails, climbs around on the sailing boat to tighten the tows and ropes and handles bars and hooks to set sails. The joy with this hobby can be seen in his face, it echoes in his words and in his happy smile.\n\nThree years before Einstein arrived in the United States, a relative offered this description of him aboard his 23-foot sailboat, a gift he had received for his 50th birthday. Tümmler it was called, from the German for “porpoise.” The vessel was seized (along with everything else he had left behind) by the Gestapo in 1933, despite Einstein’s best efforts to rescue it from afar. He even inquired after it in 1945, at the end of the war, but was never reunited with it. Learning this, I realized that the first images that I had seen of Einstein sailing were not aboard the Tümmler, but on the boat he kept here on the East Coast: Tinnef, the name derived from Yiddish and meaning “cheaply made.” In hindsight, the moniker seems like both a straightforward description and a refusal to forget the gift that was stolen from him.\n\nThe IAS archives contain other sailing photos, all attesting to Einstein’s quiet intensity, the sense of a man both constantly in motion and at peace. I’ve thought a fair amount about why these photographs, in particular, resonated with me so strongly. Perhaps it’s the idea that in them, Einstein is headed somewhere we can’t see yet. I like to imagine that he’s moving toward the dream of the unified field, and toward a world set free from the illusion of irreconcilable separateness. That promise, I think, is still available. It lives on in those committed to the dream of the future world that he imagined: one more open, more free, shining and barely visible, just beyond the horizon.\n\n*Lead-illustration sources: MPI / Getty; Buyenlarge / Getty; Three Lions / Hulton Archive / Getty; Universal History Archive / Getty; Bettmann / Getty.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Inaccurate information presented in summaries, Guardian investigation finds\n\nPeople are being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google’s artificial intelligence summaries, a Guardian investigation has found.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.\n\nGoogle searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nA Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.\n\nThe Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platforms gave inaccurate financial advice, while similar concerns have been raised about summaries of news stories.\n\nSophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.\n\nStephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”\n\nThe Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.\n\nAnna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.\n\nJewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.\n\nPamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.\n\n“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”\n\nA search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.\n\nAthena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.\n\n“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”\n\nLamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.\n\nThe Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.\n\nSome of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.\n\nSome also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”\n\nGoogle said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.\n\nThe company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”",

    "description": "\"This should never happen!\"",
    "fullText": "Two conservation groups are suing Alaska's Board of Game over a program that authorizes helicopter shooting of both brown bears and black bears across a sprawling 40,000-square-mile zone in the state's southwest.\n\nAs the Center for Biological Diversity detailed, it brought the case before the state superior court alongside the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, claiming the Mulchatna bear control program violates Alaska's constitutional requirement to manage wildlife sustainably.\n\nThe state's highest court has previously ruled this provision covers all wildlife, bears included.\n\nUnder a previous version of this program, state officials shot 175 brown bears and another five black bears over the 2023-2024 season.\n\nThe reinstated program allows officials to shoot bears regardless of age, with no limit on how many can be killed, through 2028.\n\nThe targeted area lies just miles from Lake Clark National Preserve and Katmai National Park, putting bears that travel across protected and unprotected territory at risk.\n\n\"This is a disgraceful misuse of public resources and a betrayal of the trust Alaskans place in their wildlife managers,\" said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n\"State officials should protect all of our wildlife for future generations, not flaunt their power by orchestrating the mass killing of iconic bears with no scientific basis.\"\n\nThe program has caused outrage on social media.\n\n\"Stop letting politicians run natural resources programs,\" one Instagram commenter wrote. \"Hand them to biologists.\"\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother pleaded, \"This should never happen! Please save the bears and other wildlife!\"\n\nA state court already invalidated an earlier version of this program in March 2025, ruling it was adopted without reliable scientific information about how many bears actually live in the region.\n\nMonths later, state officials reinstated it without first gathering the population data that the ruling had called for.\n\nBears are irreplaceable to their ecosystems, carrying seeds and distributing nutrients across wide areas. A program that lacks both kill caps and population counts could throw wildlife numbers off balance across the region and affect nearby communities and protected lands.\n\nAccording to the Royal Society, \"Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans.\"\n\nA shift in the natural order can impact everything from water and air quality to the human food supply.\n\nPredators, such as bears, are essential for controlling prey populations. In Scotland, for example, experts are considering reintroducing wolves to reduce the number of deer, which are growing out of control and preventing the growth of important shrubs.\n\n\"How we treat our animals, our elders, our veterans, and our most vulnerable shows us exactly who we are as a country,\" one Instagram user commented.\n\nIf you want to support bear protection efforts, donate to or volunteer with the Alaska Wildlife Alliance or Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nMeanwhile, contacting Alaska state legislators to oppose predator control programs that lack scientific backing can help inform lawmakers of public perception.\n\nSharing information about this lawsuit with friends and family can also encourage public pressure for wildlife protections based on science, not politics.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Camp Hero, a former military base, has been plagued by conspiracy theories about the so-called \"Montauk Project,\" which inspired \"Stranger Things.\"",
    "fullText": "As a huge \"Stranger Things\" fan, I'm officially mourning the end of my beloved show.\n\nIf you're like me and need a \"Stranger Things\" fix to help ease the pain, you can pay a visit to the real abandoned base that inspired one of Netflix's biggest franchises.\n\nWhile the interdimensional problems that have befallen our friends in Hawkins, Indiana, are completely fictional, the series is based on a real-life New York town called Montauk and its government Air Force station, which has been at the center of multiple conspiracy theories for decades — Montauk even got a name-check in the series finale.\n\nUnsubstantiated claims include that researchers at the base had repressed the memories of employees who'd been subjected to experiments throughout the '70s and '80s.\n\nToday, it's possible to visit the station, now called Camp Hero, and after checking it out in 2023, I can confidently say it's still one of the creepiest places I've ever visited.\n\nI came away understanding where the Duffer brothers, who created \"Stranger Things,\" got their inspiration for the creepy Hawkins Lab and the psychedelic experiments that go on inside.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" began as the story of a group of pre-teens who, after one of their best friends goes missing, become tangled in a dangerous web of government conspiracies, alternate dimensions, the Cold War, and more.\n\nSince its debut in 2016, the show has become a phenomenon, spawning millions of dollars in merch, tie-in novels and comics, a stage adaptation, mobile games, a tabletop game, at least one animated spinoff, and more.\n\nOne of the show's breakout characters is Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown), a young girl born with telekinesis. Immediately after her birth, she was abducted by a scientist whom she calls Papa (Matthew Modine) and taken to Hawkins Lab, where she and other children were experimented on.\n\nThe show wrapped up its fifth and final season on December 31.\n\nIn 2016, Matt and Ross Duffer confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that \"Stranger Things\" was originally sold as \"Montauk\" before they decided to switch the name and the location to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.\n\n\"We liked Montauk, because we liked the coastal setting,\" Matt Duffer said, adding that Montauk was also the basis for Amity Island, the fictional location of \"Jaws,\" one of their favorite movies.\n\nHowever, the setting changed when they realized \"it was really going to be impossible to shoot in or around Long Island in the wintertime,\" Matt Duffer said.\n\nFilmmaker Charlie Kessler, sued the brothers in 2018, claiming they stole the idea of \"Stranger Things\" from his script \"The Montauk Project,\" Thrillist reported. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the Duffers denied his claims, and Kessler dropped the lawsuit in 2019.\n\nSpoiler for the series finale: Montauk even got referenced by name in the last episode, when Hopper mentioned that a friend mentioned that the town was looking for a new sheriff.\n\nAccording to signs in the park outlining Camp Hero's history, the US Army commissioned Camp Hero in May 1942 — five months after the US joined World War II in December 1941 — to defend against German submarines and boats.\n\nThe Army deactivated the base in 1947 and turned it over to the US Air Force in 1951, which remained there until 1982.\n\nCamp Hero, named for Major General Andrew Hero Jr., who served as the chief of coast artillery from 1926 to 1930, according to Arlington National Cemetery, opened to the public in 2002.\n\nMontauk is commonly known as The End. It's the last town on Long Island, making it the perfect spot for an Army base scanning the oceans for submarines hiding in the depths below.\n\nAs a huge fan of \"Stranger Things\" with a mild interest in secret governmental conspiracy theories, I figured I'd drive out east and laugh with my mom (who made the trek with me) about the wildest things we'd learn about Camp Hero.\n\nInstead, I came away feeling like \"Stranger Things\" got the atmosphere of this place exactly right.\n\nI'm from a town on Long Island 99 miles west of Montauk, so it took me around two hours to drive there.\n\nWhen there's no traffic, it can be a fun drive. You pass through picturesque towns worth a stop, like Amagansett, East Hampton, Southampton, Wainscott, and more.\n\nCurbed reported that celebrities including Julianne Moore, Ralph Lauren, and Robert De Niro have owned real estate in the town.\n\nI grew up on Long Island and have been to Montauk dozens of times, but I'd never explored Camp Hero before.\n\nMontauk Lighthouse, according to the Montauk Historical Society, was the first lighthouse to be built in New York after George Washington commissioned it in 1792. Today, it's a Long Island landmark that is part of the adjacent Montauk Point State Park.\n\nIt's also the fourth-oldest working lighthouse in the US and just one of 12 lighthouses to be named a National Historic Landmark.\n\nOr, if you're a New York resident with an Empire Pass like I am, it's free.\n\nAccording to New York State's Parks Department, the Empire Pass \"permits unlimited vehicle access to most facilities operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\"\n\nEssentially, it gets you into most New York state parks for free. A card costs $80 per year (or $72 a year for a digital card), or you can purchase a lifetime pass for $750 (or $742 for a digital card). Three-season and five-season passes are also available, as shown on the parks' website.\n\nAs my family members are big fans of Jones Beach, another state park, we've had an Empire Pass for as long as I can remember.\n\nI was surprised to learn that a decent chunk of land is off-limits to visitors and is a wildlife and plant sanctuary.\n\nThere are a few parks in the Montauk area that offer a good view of the bluffs, including Shadmoor State Park, Montauk Point State Park, and Ditch Plains Beach.\n\nThis wouldn't be the last warning sign I'd see that day.\n\nErosion is also a huge problem on Long Island's beaches. The Patch reported that the town of East Hampton, which includes Montauk, was given a $350,000 federal grant to address the erosion issues along the coastline in December 2022.\n\nOfficials told The Patch that, according to measurements by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Montauk's shoreline \"eroded more than 44 feet inland between 2000 and 2012.\"\n\nIn the years since, the erosion has only continued, so I heeded the sign's warnings and stayed as far back as possible.\n\nThe radar tower looms over Camp Hero. I knew I needed to make my way over there to get a good look.\n\nMore about those conspiracy theories later.\n\nAccording to signs in the park, the Army built batteries throughout the base. Batteries 112 and 113, which are both still standing, contained two 16-inch guns each. The artillery was removed in 1947.\n\nEven from a distance, you can see just how big it is.\n\nBeing up close was somehow even more unsettling.\n\nAccording to signs in the park, the \"giant\" radar, specifically an AN/FPS-35, was built in 1960, and it remained operational until 1980.\n\nIts radar dish was built to detect an attack on the US. As The New York Times reported in 2006, it was once \"able to detect airborne objects more than 200 miles from shore.\"\n\nAt the peak of the Cold War, multiple towers were located throughout the eastern US, but now, the Montauk tower is the only one left.\n\nThe radar tower is central to many of the conspiracy theories surrounding Camp Hero.\n\nFilmmaker Christopher Garetano, who directed a docudrama about Camp Hero called \"Montauk Chronicles\" in 2014, spoke about the radar dish during a History Channel documentary called \"The Dark Files.\"\n\n\"Every 12 seconds the radar tower would rotate and there would be animals freaking out and people getting headaches and bad dreams,\" says Garetano in \"The Dark Files,\" claiming \"people's electronic equipment would go haywire\" when the dish rotated.\n\n\"I don't want to add fuel to the fire because I don't believe all the zombie stuff,\" one resident of 40 years told The New York Post in 2020. \"But the impact that tower had on the town was real. I don't know if it affected our thoughts like some people say, but it was a force.\"\n\nTicks are frequent carriers of Lyme disease. That was more than enough to keep me away from any heavily wooded areas.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2006 that visitors to Camp Hero were given pamphlets about what to do in case they spotted an undetonated grenade or other unexploded ammunition — it did use to be an active military base, after all.\n\nAt first, I scoffed, but as the day went on, I started to see what she meant.\n\nIt was spookily silent as we walked through the woods, even though we weren't too far from the beach or a busy highway. I felt like we were in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAs you can see, it looks like we were just about to walk into a heavily wooded forest.\n\nIn the first episode of \"Stranger Things,\" Mike, Lucas, and Dustin search the woods for their friend Will after he goes missing while biking home. The trio are searching on a rainy night when they suddenly come across Eleven, who had just escaped Hawkins Lab.\n\nAt the end of season one, Eleven returns to the woods to escape the lab's clutches.\n\nThis rock was helpfully in the perfect place for me to pose for a photo.\n\nFishing is one of Camp Hero's biggest draws, and I saw a few fishermen on the beach casting their lines.\n\nHe was just a friendly pet running back to his owner, but safe to say, we were both on edge.\n\nI didn't even have the presence of mind to take a picture of this dog — that's how you know my mom and I were truly freaked out.\n\nThis building used to be a gymnasium.\n\nThe sign in front explained more about downtown Camp Hero. When the base was built in 1947, 600 men and 37 officers lived in this area, and the structures were disguised as a \"seaside fishing village,\" with artificial wood siding and fake windows.\n\nThe gym was designed to look like a church. It's the only structure left from the original \"downtown\" Camp Hero, though other newer buildings are still standing.\n\nI was half-convinced that someone was just going to pop out of the windows if I got too close.\n\nWe didn't want to scare the deer away, so we kept our distance while exploring the buildings.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive summary of the conspiracy theories surrounding Camp Hero written by Thrillist in 2016, the events that conspiracy theorists claim happened in Camp Hero were actually pretty similar to what happens in \"Stranger Things.\"\n\nAuthor Preston Nichols brought the theories into the mainstream when he published 1992's \"The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time,\" which detailed his reported experiences working at Montauk Air Force Station — he claimed he'd recovered repressed memories of his time at the base in the '70s and '80s.\n\nNichols said he worked with another former employee on something called the \"Montauk Chair,\" which used electromagnets to strengthen psychic powers. In season four of \"Stranger Things,\" Eleven uses something similar to recover her powers.\n\nNichols also said scientists at the base used abducted children (like Eleven and her \"siblings\") to perform experiments on, and that some were even sent to an unknown dimension (like the Upside Down).\n\nEventually, these experiments were shut down when one of the children summoned an interdimensional monster, Nichols wrote — just like Eleven bringing the Demogorgon to our world.\n\nJoe Loffreno told the Post in 2020 that he believes he's one of the children who were abducted and experimented on and who were mentioned in \"The Montauk Project.\"\n\n\"I didn't believe it until two years ago,\" Loffreno said. \"I was hypnotized [by a certified hypnotist] for about 40 minutes and all these memories flooded back. They did a very bad thing to us out there. We were just little kids. They had no right to experiment on us. It was a very dark, very evil thing.\"\n\nGaretano, director of \"Montauk Chronicles,\" spoke with Newsday in 2017 about the reported tunnels. He said that when the History Channel was filming for \"The Dark Files,\" they found proof that the tunnels existed.\n\n\"Something extraordinary was found, which goes against all the official statements that there isn't anything there,\" Garetano said. \"We didn't get into them, but we have footage of them that was taken by someone else.\" He added that they saw something on the \"electric resistivity imagery tests\" that were conducted.\n\nAnother local, Paul Fagan, told the New York Post that he believes a nuclear reactor might've secretly been buried at the base in the '50s, and that any conspiracy theories are actually meant to distract from the reactor's existence.\n\nThe New York Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the claims.\n\nThe Army and the Air Force have never appeared to go on the record about the claims either, and they did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider either.\n\nWhen the Army built the base, it was used to surveil the surrounding area for German submarines, and it was also an antiaircraft artillery training station. At the time, according to the sign, all antiaircraft units in New York were sent to Camp Hero for a few weeks to train.\n\nThe sign also said it was home to other surveillance and height-finding radar that \"guarded the New York City area against a surprise attack by Soviet bombers or other missiles.\"\n\nThe base was also used \"extensively\" as a live-fire training range until it was shut down in the '80s.\n\nThere are no lights and very little signage — I could see myself getting hopelessly lost in the woods.\n\nDo I really believe that there were scientists using abducted children to contact a different dimension at Camp Hero?\n\nHowever, I understand the fascination with Camp Hero — the fact that the radar tower and other disguised buildings are still standing decades later, the secluded location, and the idea that there could be secret tunnels underground are all compelling fodder for urban legends.\n\nAnyone interested in military history or conspiracy theories would learn a lot at Camp Hero, and I'd recommend visiting — but only during the day, and not on your own.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in August 2023 and was most recently updated in January 2026.",

    "description": "Yann LeCun, formerly Meta's chief AI scientist, criticized Wang and predicted that more AI employees will leave the company.",
    "fullText": "AI pioneer Yann LeCun isn't sold on Mark Zuckerberg's $14 billion bet on Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old Scale AI cofounder recruited to lead Meta's Superintelligence Labs.\n\nIn a new interview with the Financial Times, LeCun, who was Meta's chief AI scientist before announcing in November that he was leaving to form his own startup, said Wang was \"inexperienced\" and didn't fully understand AI researchers.\n\n\"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know . . . There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher,\" LeCun said.\n\nWang was the crown jewel of Zuckerberg's aggressive moves in the AI talent war. Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI, which included hiring Wang from the buzzy startup.\n\nLeCun said that Zuckerberg grew frustrated after disappointing progress on Llama, the company's flagship, open-sourced AI model.\n\nIn the interview, LeCun said that the AI team \"fudged\" some of the results of Llama 4. At the time, Meta was criticized for potentially gaming the results of benchmark tests. LeCun said the episode soured Zuckerberg on Meta's existing AI team.\n\n\"Mark was really upset and basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved in this,\" he told FT. \"And so basically sidelined the entire GenAI organisation.\"\n\nAs for his relationship with Wang, LeCun said that even though the 28-year-old was briefly his boss after Zuckerberg's AI reorg, he wasn't really directing him.\n\n\"You don't tell a researcher what to do,\" LeCun told the publication. \"You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.\"\n\nLeCun said Zuckerberg remained supportive of his views on the future of AI, but that the Meta CEO's larger hires are focused on large language model development.\n\n\"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,\" LeCun said. \"But I'm not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I'm wrong. I'm not wrong. My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this.\"\n\nLeCun has repeatedly argued that LLMs are too limited and that to unlock the true power of AI, a different approach is needed. It's why his startup is reportedly called Advanced Machine Intelligence, the very approach he has argued is better suited than LLMs.\n\nHe will serve as executive chair, not as CEO, of the new company.\n\n\"I'm a scientist, a visionary. I can inspire people to work on interesting things. I'm pretty good at guessing what type of technology will work or not. But I can't be a CEO,\" LeCun said. \"I'm both too disorganised for this, and also too old!\"",

    "description": "From brisket to spicy homemade queso, these game-day snacks can be made in a slow cooker.",
    "fullText": "Olson recommends her recipe for slow-cooker meatballs on game day.\n\n\"I love grape-jelly meatballs, which only have three ingredients,\" she said. \"They're so good, everyone will ask you for the recipe.\"\n\nAnother recipe by Spend With Pennies suggests placing your seasoned, raw meatballs into the slow cooker, topping them with sauce, and letting the slow cooker finish them off.\n\nBrats with onions, peppers, and garlic simmered in the slow cooker along with beer are another one of Olson's favorite game-day recipes.\n\n\"When the guests arrive, they get to choose when they want to eat since the slow cooker keeps these brats nice and warm during the game,\" she wrote on her website, The Magical Slow Cooker.\n\nPlus, you can even choose peppers to reflect the colors of your favorite team.\n\n\"Brisket is a natural partner for the slow cooker, as a gentle braise renders it meltingly tender,\" Kim Laidlaw wrote in \"Everyday Slow Cooking: Modern Recipes for Delicious Meals.\"\n\nLaidlaw's recipe for slow-cooked braised brisket features garlic, onion, dry red wine, carrots, and either chicken or beef stock, accompanied by a chimichurri sauce.\n\n\"One dish I think is so versatile is pork shoulder in a slow cooker with broth and a little salt and pepper,\" Laidlaw told Business Insider. \"I just braise that and then you can turn into so many different things.\"\n\nOne of the best ways to use slow-cooked pork shoulder is to make pulled-pork sliders with all that tender meat. Then, top with barbecue sauce and slaw.\n\nOlson's recipe for slow-cooked Buffalo chicken wings calls for thawed chicken wings, hot sauce, and unsalted butter. To get the wings super crispy, remember to remove them from the sauce after 2.5 hours of cooking and broil them in the oven before adding them back to the slow cooker.\n\nOne of the benefits of using a slow cooker is that you can start with a basic protein and jazz it up.\n\nFrom Mexican-food-inspired spices to Indian simmer sauces, there are lots of ways to transform shredded-chicken dishes into something show-stopping by adding them to tacos, sandwiches, or salads.\n\nIf you want to add some carbs to your game-day menu, look no further than a piping hot pot of mac and cheese. Olson's recipe uses cream cheese, milk, sharp cheddar, and white sharp cheddar.\n\nCelebrity chef Martha Stewart's recipe for slow-cooker mac and cheese is also easy to make.\n\n\"It is important to use pungent cheeses, such as sharp cheddar, mixed with a little Gruyere or pecorino Romano for extra bite, since the white sauce and pasta will absorb a lot of flavor,\" Stewart writes.\n\nOne of the benefits of making a slow-cooker Buffalo chicken dip — or any other side dish in a slow cooker — is that the recipe can be prepared well in advance and reheated when you're ready to eat.\n\n\"There are so many different dips that can be made in the slow cooker, you can make Buffalo-chicken dip, bacon-cheeseburger dip, cheesy bean dip, Rotel and Velveeta Dip, and even artichoke dip,\" Olson said. \"I like to serve all these dips with tortilla chips. Can't choose one dip? Make two or more for a variety for your guests.\"\n\nOne of the most popular game-day foods — that turns out even better and creamier in a slow cooker — is spinach and artichoke dip.\n\nMade with full-fat cream cheese, shredded cheese, and mayonnaise, this recipe from Delish is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\n\"I often make a queso verde dip in my slow cooker for game days,\" Olson told Business Insider.\n\nHer recipe for queso verde uses white Velveeta cheese, salsa verde, milk, and sour cream.\n\nSpicy chili and chipotle turkey chili is another recipe that can be left simmering all day until you're ready to dig in. Paired with some cornbread, you've got a hearty meal that will last until the final whistle blows.\n\n\"I use three slow cookers for a nacho bar, which is a great way to utilize those smaller slow cookers,\" Olson said. \"I use one slow cooker for nacho cheese (store-bought), one for seasoned ground beef, and one for refried beans. I also make a toppings bar that has salsa, sour cream, guac, olives, onions, and tomatoes.\"",

    "title": "A longevity researcher doesn't take any supplements. Here are his 3 anti-aging habits instead.",
    "description": "Longevity researcher Dr. Thomas Rando doesn't take supplements. He stays healthy by running, fasting once a week, and socializing.",
    "fullText": "After studying stem cell aging for decades, Dr. Thomas Rando learned that some of the best longevity advice is timeless.\n\n\"I often make the joke that the billions of dollars that have been spent on studying healthy aging could come down to the two things your mother told you,\" Rando, the president of the American Federation for Aging Research and director of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at UCLA, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Eat a good diet and get plenty of exercise.\"\n\nRando dedicated his career to studying how tissues repair themselves — and why they eventually lose the ability to do it well. What he learned is that many of the drugs tested in animals that are meant to extend lifespan work as effectively as a balanced diet and exercise do. One example was a 2022 study that found mice that were put on fasting diets were as resilient to stress as those injected with ketone bodies.\n\nHe said that many drugs and interventions are \"just in a way supplementing the challenges that humans face in dieting and exercising.\"\n\nIn his own life, he said his research hasn't inspired too many drastic lifestyle changes as much as reinforcing healthy habits, like cutting ultra-processed foods after college or continuing to drink in moderation.\n\nUnlike some of his peers in the field, he doesn't take any supplements; he's more persuaded that lifestyle habits such as eating whole foods and taking care of his body are the keys to longevity. \"From my own studies, if you are eating well, sleeping well, and exercising, it's unlikely that supplements are going to make a difference,\" he said.\n\nRando shared the three longevity habits he's stuck to for years, from avid running to lots of socializing.\n\nAfter a colleague convinced him to run a 5K, he fell in love with racing. He worked his way up to a 10K, half-marathon, and eventually, a marathon. He's been a marathon runner for the last few decades.\n\n\"Not that people should do marathons, but I really believe in the rejuvenating powers of exercise,\" Rando said. While he's still researching all the ways that working out benefits longevity, he said there's lots of evidence to support that regular exercise lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's.\n\nRando, who's currently dealing with an Achilles tendon injury, said he's running a little less often and focusing a little more on strength training, which is also important for healthy aging as muscle mass declines over time.\n\nBeyond the anti-aging benefits, he said he loves how running makes him feel. \"I think clearly, I think I solve problems when I run,\" he said. \"So that was an added icing on the cake.\"\n\nRando generally follows the Mediterranean diet, considered the healthiest diet in the world. He eats lean protein, fruits, and vegetables while cutting back on red meat, carbohydrates, and processed foods.\n\n\"I love a steak dinner, and I'll splurge on that,\" Rando said. \"But my typical dinners are either purely vegetarian or with some light meat or some fish.\"\n\nFor decades, he's practiced a form of intermittent fasting where he doesn't eat breakfast. He usually has a light lunch of edamame and hard-boiled eggs, and eats his biggest meal at dinner. Some studies find that intermittent fasting can help control blood sugar levels and burn fat, while others show mixed evidence that intermittent fasting has sustained benefits.\n\nOver the past few years, Rando also fasts for 24 hours once a week, another form of time-restricted eating. Because dinner is his biggest meal, he usually starts fasting until dinner the next day, rather than starting the fast in the morning.\n\nStill, he isn't super strict about fasting. \"My lifestyle is just not conducive to fasting multiple days in a row, partly because of the exercise, partly because I'm going to dinners and lunches with people,\" he said. \"But I do believe in fasting as a means toward healthy aging.\"\n\nBecause intermittent fasting is still being studied, including any potential long-term risks, Rando considers it \"a leap of faith.\"\n\n\"I believe from the science that this will have a long-term benefit,\" he said. But it's not because he feels the same immediate effects as he does from exercising. \"I just feel hungry.\"\n\nAs president of AFAR, Rando naturally interacts with a lot of people. \"Through my work, I lead a very social life,\" he said, including collaborating with other researchers, sitting on various committees, and attending events. He said he also makes it a point to socialize outside work.\n\nWhile he said it's harder to quantify the impact of social ties on longevity, there's a lot of compelling anecdotal evidence in favor of it. Some of it comes from Rando's own research: Dr. Ira Eliasoph, a 96-year-old AFAR study participant, said strong relationships helped him live a long life.\n\n\"I believe in the evidence that social interactions are really important as people get older,\" Rando said.",

    "description": "From protein-packed egg cups to easy tortilla chips, here are my best air-fryer recipes for breakfast, dinner, and snacks that I cook for my family.",
    "fullText": "My health-centered, active family focuses on nutrient-dense foods that provide us with energy.\n\nWe don't shy away from less nutritious foods (everything in moderation), but most of our meals are centered on lean protein, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and healthy fats.\n\nOn top of that, I also face the ever-pressing need to appease all four of my kids. Making nutritious foods that appeal to everyone's palate can be challenging, but using an air fryer helps.\n\nI love that air fryers help create that crunchy, fried appeal without adding a ton of fat to a dish. Though fats can be nutritious, they are better consumed in proportion to the carbs and protein in your meal.\n\nPlus, my air fryer doubles as another cooking tool when the stove or oven is in use, and my kids can use it to make food on their own without having to navigate burners and dials.\n\nHere are some of my favorite air-fryer meals and snacks.\n\nBreakfast cups are nothing new in our house, but they require less time and effort to make because of the air fryer.\n\nPlus, we can make them in small batches to suit each person's tastes — and my kids have no problem creating their personalized mini egg cups.\n\nThe number of cups you can make at once may depend on the basket size of your air fryer. Usually, I can make eight at a time using silicone baking cups.\n\nPreheat your air fryer to 300°F.\n\nLine each baking cup with a slice of ham or prosciutto for a fancier option. Mix eggs with salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings of your choice, such as Worcestershire sauce and red-pepper flakes.\n\nCarefully place the ham-lined cups into the air fryer and pour the egg mixture into each. Add any veggies you prefer, such as chopped asparagus or cooked spinach. Sprinkle on a cheese of your choice.\n\nLet the egg cups cook for about 15 minutes. Serve hot, or let them cool slightly and store in the fridge to reheat later.\n\nIt can be challenging to have a vegetable-packed breakfast, but it's a great way to better ensure you'll get enough nutrients throughout your day.\n\nWith the air fryer, I can easily cook fresh produce in the morning. I like to use asparagus and tomatoes, pairing them with eggs that I've poached or \"boiled\" in the air fryer.\n\nLine your air fryer with foil and preheat it to 300°F.\n\nClean and snap asparagus, chopping it into bite-sized pieces. Add cherry or grape tomatoes to a bowl with asparagus, spritz with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.\n\nPlace the produce in the preheated air fryer for 10 to 12 minutes. If you prefer crunchy asparagus, leave it out until the last four to six minutes, and then place it on top of the tomatoes to finish cooking.\n\nServe with eggs and some toast for mopping up all the yummy juices.\n\nChicken Parmesan is one of my favorite comfort foods, and the air fryer helps me make it without having to pan-fry my protein in oil.\n\nFor two 8-ounce chicken breasts, you'll need about ¼ cup of Parmesan cheese and 1 cup of breadcrumbs. You'll also need two eggs, marinara sauce, and mozzarella for topping.\n\nFirst, pound the chicken breasts until they are a uniform thickness, about 1/2 inch. Then set your air fryer to 360°F.\n\nCombine the Parmesan and breadcrumbs in one dish and add any desired seasonings, such as garlic powder, salt, pepper, oregano, and red-pepper flakes. Whisk your eggs in a separate bowl. Coat each piece of chicken in egg, then in the crumb mixture.\n\nPlace the breasts in the preheated air fryer and cook for six minutes. Flip and top with marinara sauce and mozzarella. Cook an additional four minutes or so until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F.\n\nWe like to serve the cutlets on top of pasta with more marinara sauce.\n\nWe buy a lot of seeds in bulk, so switching up the flavor profile helps turn them into coveted snacks. We especially enjoy using seeds from squash, such as pumpkins, for this recipe.\n\nCumin, salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika are all excellent choices for seasoning seeds, though you can experiment with other flavors you enjoy.\n\nToss your seeds with a bit of olive oil and salt. Place them in the air fryer at 320°F, periodically opening the machine to shake the seeds to ensure even cooking.\n\nCook for about 15 minutes or until the seeds are crispy. Then, toss the seeds in a bowl with a bit of oil and your preferred seasonings.\n\nOne of my family's favorite air-fryer desserts is a fruity crumble that we usually make with apples.\n\nAfter all, baking fruit is a delicious way to bring out its natural sugars and create a deeply comforting dessert that's both nutritious and satisfying.\n\nSimply combine 1 or 2 tablespoons of a fat, such as butter or coconut oil, with the same amount of oats, chopped nuts, and shredded coconut.\n\nAdd a sweetener, such as monk fruit, brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup, and some warming spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.\n\nCut the apples in half and top them with spoonfuls of the mixture you've created. Cook them in a preheated air fryer at 350°F for 20 minutes.\n\nTop with vanilla frozen yogurt, ice cream, or whipped cream.\n\nThis recipe can also be made with bananas or pears, though you may need to adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\nMy kids love the idea of mini pizzas — and if you use fresh mozzarella, basil, and a balsamic reduction, you've got a fancy-ish hors d'oeuvre.\n\nFor the base, I slice up a tube of precooked polenta. From there, you can use whichever sauces, cheeses, and extra toppings you'd like.\n\nPreheat your air fryer to 400°F, then spritz the basket with olive oil.\n\nCreate 1-inch-thick polenta slices, and place them in the air fryer, topping them with another spritz of oil.\n\nSprinkle with salt and pepper. After five minutes, top the polenta with marinara sauce and your choice of cheese, as well as any other cooked toppings you desire.\n\nCook for another five minutes, then plate with fresh basil and balsamic glaze, if desired.\n\nPro tip: You can make a quick marinara using tomato sauce, a splash of balsamic and/or Worcestershire sauce, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Heat this in the microwave (lightly covered) to blend the flavors.\n\nWe make a lot of tacos with corn tortillas, but they go stale quickly. To avoid food waste while creating a tasty snack, we turn them into chips in our air fryer.\n\nPreheat your air fryer to 350°F. Cut small corn tortillas into quarters, spray with olive oil, and season with salt.\n\nPlace your pieces in the air-fryer basket, ensuring they're not overlapping. Cook in batches for five to seven minutes at a time, flipping each chip halfway through.\n\nUse a strainer to cool your batches of chips so they don't get soggy.\n\nFresh salsa is incredible, but roasted salsa is an easy way of using up bits and pieces to create a deep, rich dip for your air-fried tortilla chips.\n\nThe best part is you can adjust the heat, garlic, and seasonings to your preferences.\n\nPreheat your air fryer to 400°F.\n\nAdd garlic cloves, hot peppers of choice, tomatoes, and onion to the preheated air-fryer basket and spritz with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt.\n\nYou may want to remove the stems and seeds from your peppers before cooking them. Leave garlic cloves in their skin, as they will roast and become deliciously mushy and caramelized.\n\nCook everything for about 15 minutes, or until your veggies look slightly charred. Then, pulse your ingredients in a food processor to your desired chunkiness.\n\nAdd cilantro and fresh lime juice, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Cumin and cayenne pepper make excellent additions.\n\nPreheat your air fryer to 360°F.\n\nCut your bell pepper in half and remove the seeds. Then, top each pepper slice with your favorite tuna salad — we make ours with mayo, Greek yogurt, green onions, diced pickles, and hot peppers.\n\nCook for 10 minutes, and then sprinkle with mozzarella or your favorite cheese. Cook for another two or three minutes until the cheese melts and bubbles.\n\nThis is another crunchy and quick savory snack that provides a ton of nutrients in a snap.\n\nStrip the leaves off the stems from a bunch of kale and rip them into pieces. Place them in a bowl and spritz with olive oil, then sprinkle with sea salt.\n\nMassage the kale until it turns softer and becomes a brighter green. Place in the air fryer preheated to 370°F and cook for about five minutes.\n\nRemove the leaves when they appear crispy and have a slight color. Season the kale chips as desired. We use garlic powder, salt, and pepper.\n\nThis story was originally published in 2021, and most recently updated on January 2, 2025.",

    "description": "Gaten Matarazzo, who plays fan-favorite Dustin Henderson, said he was \"taken aback\" by how much he realized the \"Stranger Things\" finale made sense.",
    "fullText": "Major spoilers ahead for \"Stranger Things\" season five.\n\nHellfire lives! That is, if Dustin Henderson — and the actor who brought him to life, Gaten Matarazzo — has anything to say about it.\n\nDustin gets his mostly-happy ending in the series finale of \"Stranger Things,\" which premiered on Netflix and in select theaters on New Year's Eve, reportedly generating over $25 million at the box office.\n\nAfter saving the world with his friends and destroying the Upside Down — and, apparently, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) along with it — the curly-haired wunderkind is crowned valedictorian of Hawkins High. Onstage at graduation, Dustin pays tribute to his fallen idol, Hellfire Club leader Eddie Munson, by flipping off his principal and urging his classmates to reject conformity.\n\n\"Screw everyone and everything trying to hold you back and tear us apart,\" he shouts gleefully, \"because this, this is our year!\"\n\nFor Matarazzo, that speech rings especially true. The actor, now 23, delivered one of the defining performances of the hit show's fifth and final season, earning praise for being an emotional powerhouse whose scenes often remind viewers of the sci-fi series' more grounded, human stakes. (The heart-wrenching season-five scene in which Dustin sobs in the arms of Steve Harrington (Joe Keery), begging his best friend to stay alive, will go down as a series highlight.)\n\nAs one chapter closes, another one will surely open for Matarazzo, who, despite admitting to me that he would play Dustin for the rest of his life if he could, conceded that it's time to say goodbye to Hawkins for good.\n\nBusiness Insider caught up with Matarazzo to discuss his reaction to reading the \"Stranger Things\" finale, crying through filming scenes with his friends, and what's next for him.\n\nTake me back to your first read-through of the finale script. What was the plot point that shocked you the most?\n\nIt's harder to say what shocked me then. It shocks me how well, I believe, the ambiguity of Eleven's outcome sits. I was so curious as to how that was going to translate, and I was curious as to whether people were going to be frustrated by that. And after seeing it, they kind of handled that as perfectly as I could have imagined them doing so. It just bounced off the page really, really well. So that was really good to see.\n\nIt's so hard when you're reading it on paper, because you never know what something is actually going to end up looking like. Like, a giant-ass monster comes to life, and I'm like, \"Oh, that's going to be cool, I think.\" And thankfully it is, which is great.\n\nI was kind of taken aback by how much I was like, \"Of course it ends like this. This is exactly how it needs to happen.\"\n\nAs you mentioned, the show makes it pretty clear that Eleven's death scene is up for interpretation. I'm curious about your take on her fate, as a fan and a viewer.\n\nI don't know. I feel like I don't want to say, just because I really would love for that to be… I don't know if people hearing what the cast has to think is going to influence their decision, and I don't really want to influence that at all. I'd rather them fully just feel the way that they feel about it. And I'd rather just contribute to that privately rather than give my take.\n\nThe scene where all of Eleven's friends are discussing Mike's theory — how did that land for you onscreen, compared to when you read the script?\n\nI think it's exactly what it needs to be. It's weirdly meta, and I love it. I love how self-referential it really feels. I love how much it almost feels like just us, as people, saying goodbye to this show and saying goodbye to the people who have invested their time and energy into watching it.\n\nIt feels like the first time that people can see us for being Finn [Wolfhard], Caleb [McLaughlin], Noah [Schnapp], Sadie [Sink], and I, and not just as our characters. I feel like it's the first time they saw us all in that room, weirdly, as us.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but that was the last scene you all filmed together, right?\n\nSo you feel like your personal feelings about the show ending bled into those performances?\n\nOf course. I mean, it was our last day. I remember they did some wide shots, the whole scene of the campaign leading into it, before it got really emotional. And then they did the first bit of coverage on that last bit of the scene, and they started with Sadie's coverage, and for some reason, I just couldn't handle it. I wasn't even on camera.\n\nI just started blubbering. And the thing is that it was loud. She was in the middle of her scene, and I was trying to say the lines that I had, and I sounded like I was choking on a biscuit, and it was so obnoxious. I felt terrible.\n\nThe scene ends, and she just laughs at me. It was a very fun memory with her, but I felt terrible. I felt like I ruined her coverage. And I think it is the shot that they use. She has a chuckle. It very well could have been her just laughing at me, sobbing like a child.\n\nAnd then for some reason I was spent, and I couldn't cry anymore. I got that out, and then it was time for my coverage, and I'm like, \"Well, I'm dry.\" I had nothing. I had nothing in the tank. So I had to start from scratch.\n\nSwitching gears to one of your big moments, the valedictorian speech. What was your reaction to that when you read it for the first time?\n\nIt was fun. The first line was, \"I just wanted a normal childhood.\" For some reason, Matt [Duffer], Ross [Duffer], me, all the kids just started... Yeah, we couldn't even get through that little section without it becoming overtly emotional.\n\nThat's such an interesting thing for Matt and Ross to wiggle in there, because they were so good about making it as normal of a situation as it could be. They were so good about making it such a warm, inviting, professional, fun place for a kid to grow up in. And yet, I still think that they had anxiety about the idea. They had a fear that maybe they took some of the normal childhood away, but they really didn't. I want that to be very clear, that they were major contributors to maintaining that childhood.\n\nI think them putting that in there was their way of kind of acknowledging that. And I thought that that was very touching and very beautiful, and I hope they know that they have nothing to worry about in that department.\n\nWere you surprised that you were meant to deliver one of the show's final defining monologues?\n\nYeah, I was. I was very nervous about it, because as I'm reading through it, I'm like, oh, great. He's just talking about the theme of the show — changing for the better through trauma with your friends. It fully is just what the speech is about, and all of us feel very similarly to the way that Dustin feels, as people being a part of it. So there was some pressure there.\n\nBut I got to be there with my friends, and I got to look at my friends throughout that whole scene. I found it just cathartic and stunning, and I was very, very honored and privileged to be given the responsibility of delivering that.\n\nBeyond the obvious tribute to Eddie, what does the T-shirt slogan \"Hellfire Lives!\" mean for Dustin's legacy, and for you personally?\n\nI think it's a really cool way to acknowledge that Dustin has learned to deal with his grief healthily, and that's such a valuable lesson that he, I know, will take with him throughout his adulthood, and he'll be able to help other people through that.\n\nI think people who deal with grief at a young age develop — despite how scary that can be as a situation for somebody so young — it equips them with the tools to be able to help so many people go through it themselves. I think he develops into one of those people, and that's really special and something I wish I had as a teenager.\n\nOf course, it's not just losing Eddie that affects Dustin throughout the season, but the fear of losing more of his friends.\n\nThere's even a sense of guilt that I think Dustin felt initially after he lost a friend, where there was almost a bit of relief that it wasn't Steve. I'm sure he feels a lot of shame in that.\n\nAnother key friendship moment in the finale is when Lucas saves Dustin from the Mind Flayer. What did that mean to you and Caleb to have that scene together?\n\nOh, it's lovely. It's so fun doing it, too, because I love seeing Caleb do stunts. He's tremendously good at them.\n\nMy favorite part about it is — I'm sure there are videos of it — when we had to set up for that shot, it was like we had to wrap around each other and do the tuck and roll. But while we're setting up, he's just on top of me, and we're wrapped around each other very intimately.\n\nIt's a very funny picture that we heavily laughed at, doing a bit about us being wrapped in each other's arms — fully smut-novel-at-an-airport-style wrapped in each other's arms on the cover of a book. It's hilarious.\n\nDid you ever have a conversation with the Duffers about what happened between Dustin and Suzie?\n\nI didn't have a conversation with them about it. I think, unfortunately, what can be assumed is that in Dustin's yearlong unhealthy grieving process — I mean, if he's cutting out the friends that are day-to-day spending time with him, you can imagine he probably cut out a long-distance relationship. I would like to think he did so nicely. I don't think he did so nicely, because he wasn't very nice at that point in his life.\n\nOr maybe she was sick of his shit. Maybe she was just like, \"I'm not dealing with this.\" And that would be very tremendously fair of her. So I can imagine she was like, \"I don't have time for any of this.\" So I like to think she probably broke up with him.\n\nHopefully he gets more dating opportunities in college.\n\nYou know, he'll be fine. He's a confident guy.\n\nYou seem pretty tapped into the \"Stranger Things\" lore, so I'd love to get your take on Will's fate. I was convinced that, being connected to the Hive Mind, he was going to die with Vecna.\n\nI think it's great. I'm also curious to see if the kiddos will inevitably end up having a similar connection to the Mind Flayer, specifically, and to the Hive Mind, because they were under that trance, and they were tubed up with Hive Mind guts being pumped through their systems throughout the show. And even though you see the Mind Flayer leave their bodies, it did the same to Will, but Will kind of had that innate connection.\n\nI guess the thing that you hope for is that because the Upside Down is gone, there is no physical connection between the Mind Flayer's dimension, the abyss, and our world anymore.\n\nSo I'm sure that if the Hive Mind were to come into contact with any of them again, they would be able to tap into it. But because it's kind of in deep space somewhere, there really isn't any way for it to come back — which is, I think, a relief.\n\nWould you be interested in appearing in a \"Stranger Things\" spinoff or sequel series?\n\nOh, man. We just wrapped it up!\n\nIt's a deep breath. I love the show so much, and I would play Dustin for the rest of my life if I could. I don't know if the show would be serviced by us doing that, at least not for a very, very long time. So I will say, not yet. Who knows what 20 years from now looks like? Who knows if they'll have other opportunities?\n\nAnd they also have their own spinoff in the works as well. [The Duffers are] already working on expanding this lore and exploring new parts of the world. I believe I'm allowed to confirm that this gang and this crew is not a part of that, which I think is necessary, but I would love to be this part again someday.\n\nBut I really do think that entertaining that conversation takes away from understanding that this really is the end of their story.\n\nNot many actors get to revisit the same character for 10 years. How has playing Dustin informed the kinds of roles you hope to take going forward?\n\nIt's unreal. Momentum and consistency is so hard to come by. When you work in film, you have 20 pages of script to go and deliver what the backstory of somebody looks like before getting into the crux of the movie that you're in.\n\nWe had a decade to explore, and find new context, and unfold, and unpack, and show everybody who this person was front to back. And there isn't an opportunity to do that really ever in this job. So that's always been one of my greatest joys, being able to fully unpack him.\n\nWhat are you working on that you're most excited about?\n\nI have a movie coming out in the spring that I'm stoked for people to see, a comedy that I worked on with Nick Kocher and Brian McElhaney, who are the BriTANicK comedic duo, and it's their first feature, so that's going to be a lot of fun. That's due at SXSW, which is going to be a blast. And there's talks, there's very early development things in the theater that are unconfirmed and just maybes at the moment, but I would love to get back on stage very soon.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for length and clarity.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" is streaming now on Netflix.",

    "description": "“Of course it’s risky,” Damola Adamolekun told Fortune’s Ruth Umoh. “I took over a company that’s bankrupt and had a lot of problems.”",
    "fullText": "Red Lobster entered bankruptcy in 2024, but quickly clawed its way out in just about three months. The once-struggling 57-year-old seafood chain had endured an $11 million endless-shrimp fiasco among other mistakes made.\n\nBut under the leadership of Damola Adamolekun, 36, who was previously the CEO of P.F. Chang’s, Red Lobster has officially turned the ship around. As the company continues to recover from bankruptcy, the chain expects positive net income in fiscal 2026, and adjusted EBIDTA is expected to grow 43% from fiscal 2025 to 2027.\n\n“I think this is going to be the greatest comeback in the history of the restaurant industry,” Adamolekun told Fortune’s Ruth Umoh in her vodcast series, The CEO Playbook. “Of course it’s risky; I took over a company that’s bankrupt and had a lot of problems.”\n\nBut Adamolekun, who was featured on Fortune’s inaugural 100 Most Powerful People in Business list, knows about taking risks. He led P.F. Chang’s, an Asian-fusion chain, through the COVID pandemic, returned the company to profitability, and drove major operational and strategic change at the company. Under his leadership, P.F. Chang’s started generating revenues of about $1 billion, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nThat was “a crazy feat on its face, given the challenges the restaurant and hospitality industry is recovering from: the worst pandemic in 100 years, supply-chain challenges, a shallow labor pool, and a still-uncertain economy,” according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nBut for Adamolekun, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker, that reward was worth the risk—and it could be the same at Red Lobster.\n\n“Investing is the business of risk assessment, and I think you should manage your career the same way,” he told Fortune’s Umoh. “Risk on its own isn’t something to avoid. You just need adequate return.”\n\nSimilar to his P.F. Chang’s playbook, Adamolekun is laser-focused on shattering inefficiencies at Red Lobster. Namely, he said he’d never bring back the endless-shrimp promotion, one of the factors that propelled Red Lobster into bankruptcy in the first place.\n\nIt’s “because I know how to do math,” Adamolekun said plainly during an interview with Today last November. While the $20 endless shrimp deal made quite a splash with customers, the company suffered millions in operating losses.\n\nAdamolekun is also spearheading the company’s $60 million plan to keep the seafood chain afloat by stacking his C-suite with restaurant-industry veterans. His vision is to “inject more energy” into the restaurant locations, Adamolekun told Today, through new lighting, music, and decor.",

The visit, which occurred on New Year’s Day on Thursday, even sparked speculation that the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, could be named a high-level official at the upcoming ruling Workers’ Party congress.

    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum, a step that experts say bolstered her status as her father's potential heir.\n\nThe visit, which occurred on New Year’s Day on Thursday, even sparked speculation that the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, could be named a high-level official at the upcoming ruling Workers’ Party congress.\n\nThe palace is “a place that symbolizes legitimacy of the North Korean regime” and her visit there ahead of the Workers' Party congress is a politically orchestrated move, said Cheong Seong-Chang, deputy head of the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.\n\nKim Jong Un, 41, is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea since the country's foundation in 1948. He often marks key state anniversaries by visiting the Kumsusan palace and paying respect to his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung.\n\nCheong predicted that Kim Jong Un could give his daughter the first secretary post at the Workers' Party, the party's No. 2 job, at the congress. Other experts say she is too young to accept such a high-profile post and might be provided with lower-level jobs.\n\nThe congress, the first of its kind in five years, is meant to establish new priorities in state policies and reshuffle officials. North Korea hasn't said when it will hold it, but the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, said it likely will be held either in January or February.\n\nSince first appearing in state media in November 2022, Kim Ju Ae has accompanied her father at a slew of events including military parades and missile launches. In September, Kim Jong Un brought her on his trip to Beijing. During New Years' Day celebrations this week, she kissed her father on the cheek, showing their closeness.\n\nIn January 2024, the NIS said it viewed Kim Ju Ae as her father's likely heir. Some outside experts disagree with that assessment, citing Kim Jong Un’s relatively young age and the extremely male-dominated nature of North Korea’s power hierarchy. The NIS told lawmakers in November that Kim appeared to have no major health problems.\n\nRevealing the young Kim Ju Ae was a surprise to foreign experts because neither Kim Jong Un nor Kim Jong Il were mentioned in North Korean state media before they became adults. Some observers say Kim Jong Un likely aimed to shore up public support for his plan to extend the family's rule by repeatedly disclosing Kim Ju Ae in public events.",

    "fullText": "SWANSEA — The Swansea community is mourning the loss of an elementary school student who died over the holiday break.\n\nSuperintendent of Swansea Public Schools Scott Holcomb responded Friday, Jan. 2 with a letter to families and staff about the death of second-grader Mason Stringer.\n\n“It is with heavy hearts that we share the heartbreaking news of the unexpected death of one of our students. … We hold Mason’s family, friends, classmates, teachers, and all who loved him close in our thoughts and hearts during this time of profound loss.”\n\nStringer, a student in Ms. Robinson’s class, the letter read, attended Gardner Elementary School.\n\n“The death of a child touches us in different ways. It can leave us feeling heartbroken and confused as we navigate the emotions that come with grief,” Holcomb wrote.\n\nIn the days ahead and upon students’ return to school, “additional therapeutic and counseling supports” will be made available to staff and students at Gardner, and at Elizabeth S. Brown Elementary School where Stringer’s brother is a student.\n\nSchool counselors, adjustment counselors, and other trained professionals will be present to “offer care, comfort, and a listening ear to any student or staff member in need,” Holcomb wrote.\n\nSupport will be offered, “to anyone who may need it, as we recognize that many members of our school community may be impacted. Families are encouraged to reach out to their school if they feel their child would benefit from additional assistance,” Holcomb’s letter read.\n\nHolcomb’s letter lists books and materials that could offer “thoughtful,” “age-appropriate” guidance for navigating the loss of a community member through conversations among families at home.\n\nGood Grief, a website that offers age-appropriate guidance for talking with children about death, grief reactions to expect, and ways to support children through loss.\n\nNational Alliance for Children’s Grief, an online resource that provides articles and caregiver toolkits focused on helping children cope with grief.\n\nSesame Street in Communities – Grief, a guide that offers child-friendly language, videos, and activities designed to help young children understand and express feelings related to loss.\n\nHolcomb’s letter recommends families use simple, honest, and age-appropriate language to speak about the event and reassure students that “they are safe, loved, and cared for,” and that feelings of sadness, confusion, or even uncertainty are natural.\n\nThese conversations, wrote Holcomb, may be ongoing and student questions are expected.\n\n“Out of respect for the Stringer family’s privacy, we ask that you hold them in your thoughts and heart while honoring their need for space as they grieve,” Holcomb wrote.\n\nNo other information related to the death is known at this time.\n\n“We are a deeply caring and connected community. In moments like this, our compassion, kindness, and willingness to support one another matter more than ever,” Holcomb wrote.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Herald News: Swansea mourns the loss of Gardner Elementary School student",

    "fullText": "Mayor Zohran Mamdani defies the cold and the calls to move to the center with the promise of a New York that belongs to the people who live in it.\n\nHow cold was it in City Hall Park on the morning that New York’s “111th or 112th mayor” was inaugurated? So cold that I had to keep returning my pen to my pocket to keep the ink from freezing. So cold that Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, waiting on the dais for the proceedings to start, was visibly shivering—though he, like Comptroller Mark Levine and the mayor-elect (and former mayor Bill de Blasio, also on the podium), remained bare-headed throughout.\n\nAnd once New York Attorney General Letitia James, herself a target of President Donald Trump’s vindictive Justice Department, and who had officially sworn in Zohran Mamdani at the stroke of midnight (and was sensibly keeping warm in a camel coat and matching beret), issued the oath of office to Levine the themes of the day—and the new administration—began to emerge.\n\nThe first was the affirmation that diversity is New York’s secret weapon. As Levine observed, “Today we have three swearings-in: one by a leader using a Quran, one by a leader using a Christian Bible, and one by a leader using a Chumash, or Hebrew bible.” Levine, who spoke briefly in Spanish, Hebrew, and Greek as well as English, noted that “while our city is booming for people at the top, it’s getting tougher and tougher for working families.”\n\nThe second theme was that New York must retain—and celebrate and protect—its status as “Mother of Exiles.” As Williams, himself the son of migrants from Grenada, reminded the crowd, “This celebration at City Hall is only blocks from tribulation at Federal Plaza.” Williams was introduced by the actor and producer Amadou Ly, whose own odyssey as an undocumented immigrant from Senegal to US citizenship—the subject of a front-page New York Times story in 2006—now seems like a relic of a lost era. But then so did Williams’s invocation of Grenadian revolutionary Maurice Bishop, who “took up the fight for ‘radical’ socialist ideals like housing, healthcare, and education.” It was Bishop, said Williams, who proclaimed that “revolutionaries do not have the right to be cowards.” Both of the office holders who preceded him harmonized on Mamdani’s message that in order for New York to truly belong to the people that live here, the city must become more affordable.\n\nIt was Bernie Sanders, of all people, who dialed back the day’s rising rhetoric, reminding the crowd, “In the richest country in the history of the world, making sure that people can live in affordable housing is not radical…. Providing free and high-quality childcare is not radical. Countries all over the world have done it for years.” Yet the historic nature of Mamdani’s victory and the genuinely radical expectations that victory has aroused were not to be denied.\n\nWhen the Vermont senator also attempted to point out that “demanding that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes” was not exactly radical either—as Sanders has frequently noted elsewhere, under Republican President Dwight Eisenhower the marginal tax rate on the wealthiest Americans was 92 percent—the crowd erupted in chants of “Tax the rich!” Mamdani merely smiled, but as everyone in viewing range of one of the many Jumbotrons around City Hall could see, his wife, Rama Duwaji, fortified against the cold in what The New York Times described as a “statement coat,” nodded along in approval.\n\nAs for the new mayor, he began by demonstrating the same blend of soaring rhetoric and street-smart semiology that carried him from less than 1 percent in the polls to his victories in September—the election that normally decides matters in this overwhelmingly Democratic city—and November. Invoking “New Yorkers watching from cramped kitchens in Flushing and barbershops in East New York, from cell phones propped against the dashboards of parked taxi cabs at LaGuardia, from hospitals in Mott Haven and libraries in El Barrio that have too long known only neglect,” Mamdani said he stood alongside “every person who makes the choice day after day, even when it feels impossible, to call our city home.”\n\nThose who watched hoping for a tack to the center—a signal that while, as a politician from an earlier generation once observed, “you campaign in poetry, you govern in prose,” and that it was now time to begin reducing expectations—must have come away deeply disappointed:\n\nToo often in our past, moments of great possibility have been promptly surrendered to small imagination and smaller ambition. What was promised was never pursued, what could have changed remained the same. For the New Yorkers most eager to see our city remade, the weight has only grown heavier, the wait has only grown longer.\n\nI have been told that this is the occasion to reset expectations, that I should use this opportunity to encourage the people of New York to ask for little and expect even less. I will do no such thing. The only expectation I seek to reset is that of small expectations.\n\nBeginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously. We may not always succeed. But never will we be accused of lacking the courage to try.\n\nAnd finally, for the removal of all doubt:\n\nI was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed radical. As the great senator from Vermont once said, “What’s radical is a system which gives so much to so few and denies so many people the basic necessities of life.”\n\nTo what my late friend Paul Du Brul and former colleague Jack Newfield dubbed the city’s “permanent government,” those are fighting words. The last democratic socialist to take power in City Hall was David Dinkins (also, like Mamdani, a dues-paying member of DSA). I was there when he was sworn in, too, and remember the great hopes aroused by his declaration that “we are all foot soldiers on the march to freedom,” his vision of “a gorgeous mosaic of race and religious faith, of national origin and sexual orientation, of individuals whose families arrived yesterday and generations ago, coming through Ellis Island or Kennedy Airport or on buses bound for the Port Authority.” Dinkins, too, promised an administration that would “stand for, and speak for, justice around the world.”\n\nThat was 35 years ago. And while Mamdani name-checked his democratic socialist predecessor—along with de Blasio and Fiorello La Guardia—only one of those mayors is widely viewed as successful. And LaGuardia had an ally in the White House, while Mamdani has… something completely different.\n\nYet, even as he raised expectations, Mamdani acknowledged that only by delivering on those promises in government can he redeem his pledge to lead a city that “belongs to all who live in it.”\n\nFor now, let it be noted that he began well, and that in the coming fight, our new mayor has not just his own considerable resources of intelligence, charisma, and political sure-footedness but also an army of eager followers—tens of thousands strong—who defied the cold on Thursday just as they defied expectations in November.\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul—whose cooperation will be crucial in providing the fiscal resources for Mamdani’s ambitious program of urban reconstruction and public sector resurrection—must have looked at the crowd filling a stretch of lower Broadway known as the Canyon of Heroes with a mixture of admiration and envy.",

    "fullText": "New reporting shows that Trump’s split with his pedophile friend was opportunistic.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Donald Trump delivered the most bizarre yuletide message ever offered by a US president. Complaining that he’s being unfairly linked to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, Trump posted a long rant on Truth Social that began, “Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein.” Trump went on to lament how he is being blamed for his ties with Epstein, protesting that he was “actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so.”\n\nTrump’s claim to have dropped Epstein is partly true but obscures a crucial fact: that he and Epstein were close friends from the 1980s until their break at some point in 2003. Epstein had been barred from the spa at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in 2003 and the two men seemed to have a more definitive break in 2004. The exact circumstances of the break remain mysterious, since Trump has offered conflicting accounts, sometimes claiming that he was mad that Epstein “stole” an employee from Mar-a-Lago and sometimes referring to competition the two men had over real estate in 2004.\n\nThe nature of Epstein’s relationship with Donald Trump has been clarified by a damning report published by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The report makes clear that Mar-a-Lago was crucial to Epstein’s sexual predation, a fact that was well-known by Trump’s inner circle long before Epstein was charged with any crime. One reasonable inference from the report is that Epstein was protected by a system of plausible deniability at Mar-a-Lago that allowed him to use the resort to harvest victims. Trump initiated a break with Epstein only once a formal complaint by a Mar-a-Lago employee made it impossible to maintain plausible deniability.\n\nJeffrey Epstein wasn’t just a frequent visitor to Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The club was also sending spa employees—usually young women—to Epstein’s nearby mansion for massages, manicures and other spa services, according to former Mar-a-Lago and Epstein employees.\n\nThe house calls went on for years, even as spa employees warned each other about Epstein, who was known among staff for being sexually suggestive and exposing himself during the appointments, according to the former Mar-a-Lago employees.\n\nThe spa occasionally provided house calls for members. Epstein wasn’t a dues-paying member of the club, but Trump told staff to treat him like one, the employees said. Epstein had an account at the spa where his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, booked appointments on his behalf.\n\nBased on this report, the question becomes: What did Donald Trump know about Jeffrey Epstein’s predations and when did he know it? Trump was married to Marla Maples from 1993 to 1999. Maples, according to the Journal, “in the mid-1990s warned her husband and others there was something ‘off’ about Epstein.”\n\nIn 2000, Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s most important accomplice, recruited Mar-a-Lago employee Virginia Giuffre to work with Epstein. Giuffre was raped by Epstein, who also sexually trafficked her to his friends.\n\nIn 2002, Trump told New York magazine, “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” In January of the following year, Trump sent a birthday card to Epstein full of sexual innuendo.\n\nA crisis in the Epstein-Trump relationship started soon after. As the Journal details, the Mar-a-Lago arrangement ended “after an 18-year-old beautician returned to the club from a house call to Epstein and reported to managers that he had pressured her for sex, former employees said.” The Journal reported that former employees said a manager then faxed Trump the allegations and urged him to ban Epstein, which Trump did.\n\nWhile Trump and his supporters will claim that the fact Trump barred Epstein from the Mar-a-Lago spa in 2003 exonerates the president, the facts of the case make Trump’s culpability much more evident.\n\nTrump had every reason to know before 2003 that Epstein was sexually mistreating Mar-a-Lago employees, some of whom were under the age of consent. The 2003 letter from the beautician created a problem for Trump: He no longer had plausible deniability about Epstein’s misconduct. There was now a paper trail, one that could be used against Trump. His break with Epstein was entirely opportunistic. Trump may not be criminally culpable in this situation. It would certainly be difficult to prove he’s guilty of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. But in judging politicians, criminal guilt is not the only standard to use. On any reasonable moral ground, Trump’s behavior was atrocious. Mar-a-Lago was key to Epstein’s criminal enterprise. Trump’s critics should not hesitate to hammer this fact home.",

    "description": "A Blackberry style companion device for all your messaging needs.",
    "fullText": "Clicks, the company behind those physical keyboard cases for your smartphone, has announced a new device, but it'll look pretty familiar to anyone who's used a Blackberry before. It's called the Clicks Communicator, and it's a pocketable little handset that's perfect for anyone who misses having physical buttons on their phone. It comes with a full, old-school style QWERTY keyboard and runs Android 16, and while you can pump it full of apps and use it standalone, Clicks says it expects many of its customers will prefer to use it as a minimalistic companion to a primary smartphone. In that way, this device is designed to be your secondary smartphone, where you only load it with the apps you need at a moments notice and use it to quickly reply to your messages, emails, and other important notifications.\n\nOne of the headlining features of the Clicks Communicator is the Signal LED, which is a notification light around the side button. You can set it to light up with a different color based on who's pinged you or which apps are sending you notifications, so you can know what needs your attention first without having to scroll through a long series of notification boxes. For instance, you could set up a green LED for notifications from people you care about, and use other colors for different apps. I'm not entirely sure how this'll play out in practice, because I do worry that I'll forget which color is for what after a point. Fortunately, Clicks says you can also turn off the Signal LED if it's not useful for you (and yes, there will still be traditional notification boxes if you need them).\n\nAs for the core experience, in line with its design philosophy, the company has chosen not to show you an app grid when you go to the home screen. In collaboration with Niagara Launcher, Click has instead built a messaging hub, which shows you all your pending alerts on the home screen, grouped by app. You can use the keyboard to triage these messages or to reply to individual chats, the company says.\n\nThere's also a lot of emphasis on the keyboard, as is expected from a company that went viral by launching a physical keyboard case for touchscreen phones. Clicks says the keys on the Communicator are bigger and better than those on its keyboard case. There's a red Clicks key on the keypad, which you can use to launch custom shortcuts. The Spacebar has a built-in fingerprint sensor, which could be handy for unlocking the phone quickly. The keypad is touch-sensitive, which means that you can slide your fingers over it to scroll through messages. And before you ask, yes, it also has a 4.03-inch OLED touchscreen display for those of us who like scrolling on a smoother surface.\n\nSome of you may also be pleased to know that the Clicks Communicator has a 3.5mm headphone jack and that it supports microSD cards for storage expansion. It ships with 256GB storage and you can add a microSD card with up to 2TB of capacity.\n\nThe device runs Android 16, supports Qi2 wireless charging, has a USB-C port, and has a 50-MP rear camera with optical image stabilization, alongside a 24-MP front camera. It's powered by a 4nm MediaTek chip that has 5G support. It's a dual-SIM phone with one physical SIM slot and an eSIM, so you could use it on its own instead of as the \"complementary product\" its pitched as, but taking calls or using certain apps could be tricky on such a small device.\n\nIf you want a Clicks Communicator, you can reserve one now for $399 + $30 for shipping and duties. The launch price is expected to be $499, which means that pre-orders get a $100 discount. The device also has swappable back covers, and the company is offering two back covers for free with pre-orders.\n\nFor everyone that just wants to add physical keys to their existing phone, Clicks has also launched a magnetic wireless power bank with a built-in sliding physical keyboard. This is one of the more quirky products I've seen from this year's pre-CES announcements, but it could make for a great middle ground for everyone who doesn't want the Communicator.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of wired power banks back in the day, but the advent of magnetic wireless charging has changed that, and now I'm itching to slap one onto my iPhone. Throwing a slide-out Bluetooth keyboard into the mix just sweetens the pot, even if it is a bit of a heavy package overall, at 180g. And because of that wireless Bluetooth connection, you can also use the keyboard with your phone, tablet, TV, or gaming console, if you like. The charger doesn't need to be physically attached to a device for its keyboard to work with it, and the device as a whole works with both Apple and Android.\n\nThere is a downside, though. The Clicks Power Keyboard has a 2,150mAh battery, and it only supports 5W Qi wireless charging. That's a very slow charger by today's standards, but the good news is that your smartphone is less likely to overheat with those charging speeds. It's priced at $80 for pre-orders and is expected to start shipping this Spring.\n\nFor a comparison, you could get an Anker wireless power bank for around $55. This one weighs 4.3oz (120g), offers faster 15W charging, and has a higher battery capacity (5,000mAh). You don't get a physical keyboard with most power banks in the market, so Clicks is banking on that to power sales of its Power Keyboard.",

    "description": "Next time the neighborhood kids launch a snowball assault, you’ll be ready.",
    "fullText": "Winter weather can be miserable, but there is one huge perk: snowball fights. Any time a deep carpet of snow gets dumped on us, you can count on a bunch of kids (or young-at-heart adults) engaging in epic snowball fights, sometimes involving surprisingly well-engineered snow forts and sophisticated tactics.\n\nThis is the 21st century, however—if you’re still fighting your snowball fights with nothing but your bare hands and a sense of determination, you’re missing out. We can’t all be Buddy the Elf, shotgunning perfectly made snowballs like some sort of winter weather Terminator—but we can invest in some of the most fun snowball tech money can buy. If you’re looking to dominate your neighborhood’s winter wars (or put some snowball-tossing whippersnappers in their place), here’s what to buy.\n\nYour first step is to up your snowball-making game. A cosmetically pleasing, perfectly spherical snowball is your first step toward snowball fight dominance. This set of simple snowball forms will make it easy to stockpile perfect snowballs in just a few minutes. If you don’t have a few minutes because you’re already under attack, you might turn to this 5-in-1 snowball maker that will let you quickly amass some serious firepower.\n\nIf you want to get a little more whimsical, you can also pick up snowball-making sets that include other shapes, like ducks or hearts, if that’s your jam.\n\nOnce you have your snowballs assembled, you’ll need something to augment your throwing power. This Snow Trac Ball (or these) can launch snowballs a lot further than you can with just your arm—up to 150 feet away. They also come with built-in snowball makers, so when you run out of your initial supply, you can quickly make and deploy fresh snowballs without missing a beat.\n\nThrowing snowballs either bare-knuckled or using an implement is all well and good, but what if your opponents are serious about their snowball fighting? If you need more firepower, this Snowball Blaster is just what you need—load a snowball into the front, pull back the firing mechanism, take aim, and destroy your enemies. Want to keep things a little more primitive? This snowball slingshot keeps it simple—load a snowball, take aim, and launch for victory (this kit even comes with dye to color-code your snowballs in case you’re trying to keep score). Or go medieval on your enemies with this very cool Snow Crossbow, which even comes with a target so you can practice decimating your enemies.\n\nNo one wants a snowball to the face, so having a snowball shield on hand can keep you dry and unscathed while you rain snowballs on your opponents. Of course, this doesn’t have to be a snowball-specific shield—just about any plastic shield will help protect you from the snowballs being thrown your way.\n\nItching to have a snowball fight, but you live in a warm-weather area that hasn’t seen snow in decades? Or there just hasn’t been enough snowfall? Or it’s summer? Get yourself an indoor snowball fight kit and go to town. While you won’t get the visceral joy of smashing snow into someone’s head from a distance, you can replicate just about everything else that’s fun about snowball fights without the cold, damp, or, you know, snow. Throw in some couch-cushion forts and you have a guaranteed good time.",

    "description": "The MC03 appears geared towards users who prioritize privacy and minimalism.",
    "fullText": "If you've ever looked into trading in your smartphone for a dumbphone, you might have stumbled across Punkt. The German-based company's MP01 and MP02 phone were purposely not \"smart;\" rather, they were minimalist slabs of plastic, sporting a tiny display and an array of large, physical buttons. The point of owning one of these Punkt devices isn't to sit scrolling on your smartphone for hours on end; it's to use your phone when you need to—privately, at that.\n\nThe company's MC0 line flips the script a bit, and that doesn't change with the latest: MC03. While there's still a focus on privacy and minimalism, this newest device is virtually indistinguishable from other Android smartphones on the market—at least, in outward appearance. Gone are the physical buttons and tiny display; now, you have a large 120Hz OLED display, complete with a selfie camera at the top. Flip the MC03 around, and you'll find a set of four rear cameras, corralled in the top-left corner of the back. Aside from the large \"Punkt\" logo in the bottom right, this really could be any other phone.\n\nWhat separates the MC03 from phones from Samsung or Motorola is what's on the inside, including, namely, the OS. When you open the phone, you aren't greeted by a grid of app icons and widgets. Instead, you see a list of app and function names, without icons or colors. This is just about as simple an interface as you can expect from a device with a modern smartphone display, which may appeal to those who are looking for a minimalist experience.\n\nThat's because the MC03 isn't running Android. Like previous Punkt phones, this device runs AphyOS, an operating system built by Apostrophe. This custom OS is advertised as a privacy-focused operating system, something Punkt runs with for the MC03. According to the company, AphysOS can block tracking and profiling tools, and keeps out bloatware, hidden apps, and background services. The OS can also reportedly fight against spying with \"hardened code\" to block attacks.\n\nThe company says this new phone separates data and functions in two key \"repositories:\" First, there's the \"Vault,\" which includes Punkt-approved apps and that minimalist UI. Proton is a trusted company here, so you can expect to find Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, Proton VPN, and Proton Pass in the Vault. Second, there's \"Wild Web,\" which lets you install any app you want, against a strict system of safeguards and privacy settings. You can choose to download apps from either Punkt's privacy-focused app store, featuring programs approved by both AphyOS and Punkt, as well as a store with \"widely available apps.\"\n\nIn addition to that display, Punkt says the device comes with other hardware perks, like a 5,200mAh removable battery—a rarity with modern smartphone—IP68 water and dust resistance, and a 64MP camera.\n\nAll those features come at a recurring cost, however. After one year, you'll need to pay for AphyOS, which charges $10 per month. You can also choose to 38 per month), or five years for $199 ($4.15 per month). The phone itself costs $699, which is relatively expensive for a phone of this caliber, so whether or not the privacy and minimalism perks are worth the price will really come down to the individual customer. (I'm a huge privacy advocate, but the MC03 would definitely need to impress me before I commit to a subscription model for its OS.) If you don't want a new phone, there are hacks to dumb down your existing device into something more minimal—and, of course, there are steps you can take to protect your privacy on any device.\n\nThe MC03 isn't available yet. Punkt announced the new phone ahead of CES next week, and says the new device will launch in North America this spring. Pre-orders are currently available in Europe.",

    "title": "I Finally Figured Out What Productivity Hack Helps Me Crush My New Year's Resolutions",
    "description": "I tried a little something new last year—and it worked.",
    "fullText": "There are a lot of ways I trick myself into meeting my goals, like coming up with various rewards and punishments for myself or outsourcing my progress tracking to apps. In general, I'm a deeply goal-oriented person and I am, for better or worse, obsessed with \"winning\"—which I always thought made me a perfect candidate for complicated productivity techniques like detailed to-do lists full of tasks in order of priority. While I do love a good technique, I decided to switch things up last year when I got worried that maybe I was spending so much time prioritizing and planning that I wasn't spending enough time doing. So I just focused on the doing—and it worked. Here's what I mean and how my bright idea helped me crush last year's resolutions.\n\nI've covered a lot of productivity hacks for Lifehacker and the two I liked best, both in theory and practice, were the two- and 10-minute rules. The idea is that if a particular tasks takes less than two (or 10, depending on your preferred approach) minutes to complete, you should just get it out of the way early in the day. It's smart because it leaves little time for deliberation or over-planning, but even when I used it for the 10-minute tasks, I wasn't convinced it was effective enough. Some tasks take longer than 10 minutes. I felt like the \"just do it\" mentality was helpful for me, but could be more helpful. So I started thinking \n\nSitting down every morning to write out a to-do list and determine how long each responsibility will take, which are most important, and which will demand the most resources works well for some people, but it is too tedious for me. Since coming around on a \"do it now\" mindset, I don't do that anymore at all. When I think of something, I just do it, no matter what it is or how long it will take (within reason). If, for some reason, I can't fit it in at the moment I come up with it, I add it to a note on my phone, which I also count as doing it now, though the \"it\" is adding the task to the list.\n\nMy goals for the last year have largely been about my health and fitness, as well as my living space. I wanted to become a healthier, better me, which involved more time in the gym and having a clean, organized home to relax in. My \"do it now\" mindset helped me with both, especially when I was starting out on my resolutions around this time last year. I didn't pressure myself to work out at a certain time or try to wedge exercise into a structured daily schedule. Instead, I just firmly told myself I'd go when it occurred to me and I wouldn't deliberate or make any excuses. I found myself at the gym on lunch breaks, Saturday mornings, and late week nights. As soon as I thought of it, I went (or worked out at home, usually riding my Peloton)—and it worked. The longer I did this, the more working out became a normal, expected part of my day. Notably, by the fall, I had developed such an affinity for my hour of physical activity each day that I did start scheduling it and have been able to wake up every day before the sun to simply knock it out. I don't think that would have happened if I hadn't tried my new motivation-first approach.\n\nThe same was true for cleaning. There are so many cleaning techniques and approaches out there and, to be clear, each one of those works well for a certain kind of person. I've tried them all and nothing was as useful to me as just cleaning something the moment I thought of it or saw it needed to be done. If I see a dirty baseboard, I don't file that information away for \"living room cleaning\" day; I hop off the couch and wipe it down. Building this habit was a challenge because it's easy to kick the can down the road and decide to complete these tasks during designated home-tidying times, but once I got the hang of it, I noticed something: I no longer needed to set aside a Saturday afternoon for cleaning. There was nothing to clean in bulk because it all got handled whenever an issue sprang up.\n\nMy goals for the new year this time around are to stick with the momentum I built up working out and cleaning, but also improve my finances and notch some professional accomplishments I've been putting off during the year I spent on self-improvement. As soon as I finish this, I'm going to call one of the companies overseeing one of my 401k accounts to check on my rollover status, which is something I would have procrastinated on before entering my \"do it now\" era.\n\nDifferent things work for different people, but you can get caught up in thinking too much and doing too little. My technique doesn't come from a book and, I'll admit, does have to be abandoned sometimes when there are serious, large-scale projects that need to be broken down and handled systematically, but the beauty of it is that it leaves time and mental energy for doing that when I have to.",

(AP) — A yellow Labrador out for a walk with his owner in Rhode Island had to be rescued by firefighters on New Year's Day after he wandered onto a thin layer of ice covering a pond and fell through the center.\n\nAccording to the Misquamicut Fire Department, volunteer firefighters and other emergency officials were dispatched early Thursday morning for a water rescue. Once on scene, firefighters saw a dog named Phoenix struggling and unable to move to shore in the slushy, icy water.\n\nMembers from both the Misquamicut and Watch Hill fire departments donned ice rescue suits, which help protect the body from frigid temperatures, to enter the pond and successfully rescue Phoenix. The National Weather Service reported it was 26 degrees Fahrenheit around 9 a.m. on Thursday, with the wind chill dropping the temperature to 14 degrees.\n\n“It was the chillest dog I've ever seen in my life,” said Steve Howard, deputy chief of the Misquamicut Fire Department, in a phone interview on Friday. “The dog never made a sound. He was pretty chill.”\n\nWhile the firefighters were evaluated for possible hypothermia, they did not require treatment. The fire departments described the incident as “a successful first call of 2026,\" in a statement posted on Facebook.\n\nPhoenix was also declared free of injuries, but Howard made sure to check in with his owner later Thursday.\n\n“He got a little bit of extra food last night,” Howard said. “And he took a little nap.”\n\nThe incident served as a reminder to treat all ice as potentially dangerous, particularly over bodies of water, the fire department warned.\n\n“No ice is ever safe. Our firefighters train extensively for cold water and ice rescues, but these situations are extremely dangerous,” the fire department said.",

Swearengen provided the following statement:\n\nWe are devastated beyond words that our beloved Donnell Roberts is gone!  Donnell Roberts started as an employee with the Shelby County Circuit Court Clerk’s Office in 2019 as a 19-year-old teenager who began under the tutelage of Judge Jerry Stokes.  Roberts’ exponentially grew under Judge Stokes’ guidance until Judge Stokes retired in 2022 and continued his amazing growth under Judge Cedrick Wooten.  While he was the youngest in the department, he was extremely reliable and consistent with his job and with others.  Mr. Donnell Roberts was a smart and bright young man who was a fast learner and very detailed.  We all will truly miss his silent smile and always being the first one at work grabbing two donuts at a time.  Words will never be able to express the love and care we have for Donnell. He has gone far too soon!  He touched everyone around him differently but significantly.  We will always remember Donnell as an awesome father, son, grandson, brother, friend, coworker and, most of all, a young man who was loved by all.  We miss and love you, Donnell!",

So, we'll just have to move on in the short term without him, and we'll see how things go.\"\n\nWith the conveyor belt of underage success coming through in Tyrone at the minute, including last year's U20 and minor All-Ireland winning sides, the experience of the 35-year-old would be beneficial for the county.\n\n\"Both on the field and off the field, just the way he conducts himself, the way he trains, the way he prepares for training, and everything about him is just what you want in a panel,\" O'Rourke continued.\n\n\"And it's great. We've so many young lads coming through who, I suppose, in many ways, are learning to trade at this level.\n\n\"And the more fellas like Peter that they can learn from, the better. Maybe there will be some chance that he'll be back to us later on in the year. But, at this stage, I'm not sure that's going to be the way it turns out.\n\n\"But, Peter certainly owes nobody anything. He's had a tremendous career. Even last year when he was in with us, he was brilliant to work with.\"\n\nO'Rourke also confirmed that Darragh Canavan should be available for selection ahead of Tyrone's National Football League opener at home to Kildare on 24 January.\n\n\"All the boys that weren't involved tonight were all training earlier on today, and Darragh included,\" the Tyrone boss confirmed.\n\n\"They were all out in the field. So, everybody was training. Everyone was at different stages.\n\n\"But, no, we'd be hoping that they'll all be back and be in contention for the start of the National League.\"",

When you consider what we're going through with injuries, people think it's over but the others have stepped up.\n\n\"There's so many shared experiences that we're growing with on and off the field and it's holding us in great stead.\n\n\"I said, 'Let's treat this like a final,' because we knew we win this game and we're top of the table, so let's go for it, and that was finals rugby.\"\n\nSale director of rugby Alex Sanderson said:\n\n\"It's a tough one to take as we turned up with the right mentality and we were executing our game plan well.\n\n\"However, we let them out of their half too easily and that resulted in swings of 60-70 metres, and although we defended well, they were repeatedly knocking at our door and eventually it had to give way.\n\n\"Losing players to injury and enforced rest periods for some others upset our cohesion and that proved costly in the last 10 minutes, especially after the yellow card.\"\n\nBristol: Rees-Zammit, Boshoff, Janse van Rensburg, Williams, Ravouvou; Jordan, Randall; Genge, Oghre, Chawatama, Rubiolo, Owen, Grondona, Harding (c), Mata.\n\nReplacements: Thacker, Lahiff, Kloska, Taylor, Grondona, Marmion, Worsley, Heward.\n\nSale: Carpenter, O'Flaherty, du Preez, Ma'asi-White, Wills; Ford, Quirke; Rodd, Cowan-Dickie, Harper, Bamber, van Rhyn (c), Vermeulen, Dugdale, T Curry.\n\nReplacements: Jibulu, McIntyre, Bell, Burrow, Gilmore, Warr, Louw, Wehr.",

    "fullText": "United Rugby Championship, Affidea Stadium\n\nTries: Stewart, Flannery, B Ward Pens: Doak 3 Cons: Doak 2\n\nUlster moved second in the United Rugby Championship with a 28-3 victory over Munster in Belfast.\n\nThe hosts had led just 6-3 at half-time in snowy conditions but dominated the second period with Tom Stewart, Jake Flannery and Bryn Ward all crossing for tries after the turn.\n\nNathan Doak, at the end of a week in which he signed a new contract to keep him with the province until 2028, added 13 points off the tee for Ulster, while Munster's only points of the game came through a JJ Hanrahan penalty.\n\nRichie Murphy's side have now won six of eight league matches this season with their latest triumph taking them above Cardiff, Munster and Glasgow in the URC standings to sit just one point behind leaders Stormers having played a game more.\n\nAfter a busy festive period, it was the visitors who rotated more heavily with Irish internationals Tadhg Beirne, Craig Casey and Jack Crowley all absent after the 10 changes made from last Saturday's defeat by Leinster in Limerick.\n\nIn front of their first sold-out crowd of the season, it was certainly Ulster who appeared the more fired up by the prospect of another Irish derby in the opening exchanges.\n\nJacob Stockdale barged past the tackle of JJ Hanrahan to bring the first roar from the home supporters, while soon after James Hume charged into a tackle of Calvin Nash.\n\nThe resulting turnover penalty following the latter allowed Doak to kick the game's first points after four minutes.\n\nTwice, however, in the opening quarter, Munster turned Ulster over within five metres of the tryline.\n\nThat, in truth, set the tone for the first half. The hosts, who are the top try scorers in the league this season, showed plenty of intent but could not match it with accuracy in difficult playing conditions.\n\nDespite a considerable edge in territory and possession, their lead was just 6-3 at the turn with Doak's second penalty of the evening quickly cancelled out by Munster's fly-half Hanrahan after his opposite number Jack Murphy made a mess of the restart.\n\nThe second half, however, was a different story with Ulster scoring three tries and 22 unanswered points to secure the deserved win.\n\nDespite losing their past three meetings with Munster, they took control of the game across the first eight minutes of the second half and rarely looked like conceding thereafter.\n\nDoak kicked another penalty for the half's first points before, shortly after Jacob Stockdale had a score chalked off in the corner, Tom Stewart powered over from close range.\n\nUlster's second try of the game came 25 minutes from time when Munster were turned over close to their own line and Richie Murphy's side worked the ball across on the counter for replacement Jake Flannery to go over in the opposite corner.\n\nHaving reinvigorated their attack this season, the snow, which worsened again during the second half, ensured a different sort of gameplan was required here and it was again power in the tight exchanges that produced Bryn Ward's first senior try with nine minutes remaining.\n\nDespite two further visits to the opposing 22 in the closing stages, Ulster could not get the fourth try that would have brought with it a bonus point and will now turn attention back to the Challenge Cup where they face the Cheetahs in Amsterdam on 11 January.\n\nAfter back-to-back derby defeats, Munster play Toulon on the same day in the Champions Cup.\n\nUlster: Stockdale; Kok, Hume, McCloskey, Z Ward; Murphy, Doak; Bell, Stewart, O'Toole, Henderson (capt), Hopes, Izuchukwu, Timoney, Ward.\n\nReplacements: Herring, O'Sullivan, Wilson, Sheridan, McCann, McKee, Flannery, Postlethwaite.\n\nMunster: Haley; Nash, Kelly, Nankivell, Abrahams; Hanrahan, Patterson; J Wycherley, D Barron (capt), Ala'alatoa, Kleyn, F Wycherley, T Ahern, Hodnett, Kendellen.\n\nReplacements: Barron, Loughman, Bartley, O'Donoghue, Gleeson, Coughlan, Butler, O'Brien.",

    "fullText": "In many cases, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy does not mean the end for a restaurant chain.\n\nThat's at least partially because brand names have value, and as long as the finances can be worked out with creditors, there will usually be more investors willing to get behind a Red Lobster comeback than those who might attempt to launch a novel seafood chain.\n\nA successful Chapter 11 reorganization can streamline operations, reduce expenses, and establish a more sustainable financial structure, giving the restaurant a second chance at success.\n\nThat's what happened with Red Lobster.\n\n\"In 2024, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing financial strain from rising labor costs, unfavorable lease agreements, and supply chain issues, including losses from an 'all-you-can-eat' shrimp promotion. The filing allowed the company to restructure its debt, renegotiate leases, close underperforming locations, and secure financial support, enabling continued operations and a path toward long-term recovery,\" Toast reported.\n\nBrand names matter, whether the original operator survives or a new one takes over.\n\n“Think about how hard it is to build a brand in today’s world,” Greg Portell, lead partner in the global consumer practice of consulting firm Kearney, told Retail Dive. “It’s really difficult. The name itself tends to be the valuable asset in an IP portfolio.\"\n\nThat makes it surprising that Don Pablo's, once the second-largest full-service Mexican chain in the United States behind Chi-Chi's, remains a relic of the past with no open locations.\n\n\"During its heyday, it served 20 states with over 100 locations, which made it the closest competitor to Chi-Chi's. The first Don Pablo's location appeared in Texas in the mid-'80s, and due to its success, it started growing from there — so much so that seven years after its conception, it was already gaining traction with 10 stores,\" Newsbreak reported.\n\nDon Pablo's was famous for its use of high-quality ingredients in its tacos, burritos, fajitas, salads, and more.\n\nThat was a stark contrast to Taco Bell, the brand most Americans associated with Mexican food at the time.\n\nIt was also an affordable sit-down option, likely at least partially because meat portions at Mexican restaurants are supplemented by much cheaper ingredients, including rice and beans.\n\n\"By 1995, Don Pablo's had grown to 51 locations across Texas, New Mexico, Kentucky, Ohio, Oklahoma, Michigan, Indiana, Virginia, and Maryland. This number had nearly doubled by 1998 when those looking for tasty Tex-Mex could choose from 96 Don Pablo's restaurants,\" according to The Takeout.",

I didn't have the results we wanted - it's a fact, I cannot deny that.\"\n\nHe appealed for patience, but immediately accepted this is a job where the high stakes mean patience is in short supply.\n\n\"This is only the beginning. Usually, we have four or five weeks of pre-season. I didn't have that,\" Nancy said.\n\n\"The reality is, before I came, I knew if I didn't win games, I was going to be in trouble. This is part of the job. I'm pleased to be here and I know where we are now.\"",

But then when it starts to get into your family, I heard stuff about my daughter that I couldn't even repeat here. It's horrific.\"\n\nHe thinks Bradley could have made a difference by steering fans away from making it a toxic atmosphere for the visiting team.\n\nThe world number two added: \"Keegan and I have talked about this. You have to play into the home-field advantage, absolutely.\n\n\"But during the competition on Friday night and Saturday night, after the stuff that we heard on the course, there was an opportunity for either Keegan or some of the team-mates to be like: 'Let's just calm down here. Let's try to play this match in the right spirit.'\n\n\"Some of them did that, but obviously Keegan had the biggest platform of the week in being the captain. I feel like he could have said something on that Friday or Saturday night, and he didn't.\"",

St. Louis County Police released video of the incident and more details today. The video attached to this story has been edited for content. The full clip can be found here and may be disturbing for some viewers.\n\nPolice identified the man as 31-year-old Darius Kennedy of Peoria, Illinois. Officers on foot patrol encountered Kennedy just after 12:40 a.m. and told him to leave the terminal. Investigators said Kennedy refused, pulled a knife from his jacket, and ignored repeated commands to drop it.\n\nAn officer used a Taser to stun the armed man but he kept moving towards another officer. A 43-year-old officer fired his gun. Four shots were fired. Officers provided aid, but Kennedy was pronounced dead at the scene. A knife was later recovered.\n\nAuthorities said Kennedy was homeless. No officers were injured. The fatal shooting remains under investigation by county detectives, with findings to be reviewed by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office once the case is complete.\n\nSt. Louis Lambert Airport released this statement:\n\n“The entire airport community is saddened by the events of November 21st.

    "fullText": "The body of Johnathan Everett Boley, a 4-year-old boy who went missing in Alabama on New Year's Eve, has been found, authorities announced in a press conference on Friday afternoon.\n\n“We have located Johnathan, and Johnathan is deceased,” Walker County Sheriff Nick Smith told reporters.\n\nHe was found about 2 miles from his home, Smith added.\n\nThe boy’s father, Jameson Kyle Boley, has been arrested on a separate explosives-related charge and has been charged with two counts of chemical endangerment of a child, according to court records.\n\nThe child had last been seen at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday near Highway 195, in a wooded and rural area of Jasper, Alabama, according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. Jasper is a small city located about 40 miles northwest of Birmingham.\n\nHe was last seen wearing a yellow Mickey Mouse shirt, black pants and Paw Patrol shoes.\n\nThe Walker County Sheriff’s Office received a call about the missing child at around 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, Smith told reporters Thursday.\n\nSmith said it was reported to authorities that Johnathan was with his 6-year-old brother and their dog when he disappeared. Johnathan’s brother “identified the last place that he saw John John” and their dog, Smith told reporters Friday.\n\nWhen Johnathan’s body was found on Friday, his dog was with him and still alive.\n\nJohnathan’s father has also been charged with unlawful manufacture of a destructive device or bacteriological weapon, court records show.\n\nSmith told reporters that explosive devices were found on the child’s father’s property during the search and law enforcement had to “take care” of the devices before they could execute a thorough search warrant.\n\nThe father was arrested on an explosives-related charge, Smith said. He said the charge had “nothing to do” with the search for Johnathan.\n\nSmith described the father, whom he did not name, as being formerly in the military.\n\nIt’s not clear why explosives were at the home.\n\n“Neighbors have said they’ve been hearing explosions for weeks now. They didn’t really know where it was coming from. The morning before the [missing person] report came in, one of the neighbors reported that they heard an explosion about 4 a.m. that morning, they just didn’t know where it came from. Can’t say that that’s in any kind of connection to the missing child,” Smith said.\n\nJohnathan‘s parents are separated, and the child’s mother moved to Florida last year. As part of the custody agreement, the father was given five days a year for visitation, Smith said.\n\nThe mother went to Alabama on Wednesday evening and is cooperating with authorities, according to the sheriff. The father was interviewed by the FBI on Wednesday, he said.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",
