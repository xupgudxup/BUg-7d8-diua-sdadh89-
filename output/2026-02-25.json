    "fullText": "I’m going to keep this preview for the final home game on the Marquette women’s basketball schedule pretty straight forward.\n\nFirst, it’s Senior Day at the McGuire Center. Marquette will be honoring seven of the eight seniors listed on the roster in a pregame ceremony as they appear for their final regular season home game. The lone exception to the list is Aryelle Stevens who has been out all year after an Achilles tear last summer. Marquette isn’t explicitly saying she’s returning, merely not saying she’s departing. With seven senior players and five student managers to honor, get yourself to the building early for the festivities.\n\nSecond, Marquette is on a four game losing streak. They shouldn’t be after coughing up a fourth quarter lead at Creighton and letting Seton Hall rally and run away from them in Milwaukee, but that’s where we are. Perhaps more disappointingly, Marquette looked lifeless on the road against Villanova on Sunday after putting up a pretty solid fight against #1 UConn in the third of the four straight losses.\n\nThird, Marquette is trying to stay out of the opening day tripleheader at the Big East tournament. Some of this work may get done for them as 11-8 St. John’s wraps up with UConn, so all the Golden Eagles need to do is avoid dropping either of their final two games, and they will finish ahead of the Red Storm. That alone would be enough to clinch a top five finish in the Big East, as sixth place Creighton already has nine losses with two games to play.\n\nFourth, Marquette is a heavy favorite in their final home game of the year because Xavier is bad. BartTorvik.com says Golden Eagles by 17, 69-52. Part of that is because Marquette beat Xavier 67-54 in Cincinnati on New Year’s Day, and the Golden Eagles did that without Skylar Forbes available. It took a 20/19/5/2 from Halle Vice, but Marquette pushed it across the finish line and led by double digits for the entire second half. The Musketeers have lost nine of their last 10, and their assorted metrics have been getting worse across their current five game losing streak.\n\nThere is zero reason why Marquette should lose this game. Everything points at reasons for Marquette to be motivated to 1) win on Senior Night, 2) win to lock up a bye to the quarterfinals, 3) win to snap their losing streak, and 4) beat a bad Xavier team.\n\nDate: Wednesday, February 25, 2026\nTime: 6:30pm Central\nLocation: Al McGuire Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nStreaming: ESPN+ with Bob Brainerd and Chloe Marotta calling the action\nLive Stats: Stat Broadcast\nBluesky Updates: @AnonymousEagle\n\nMarquette is 26-7 all time against Xavier. The series started back in 1985 and was pretty even through the first nine encounters. The Musketeers won three of the first five meetings between the two teams once XU joined the Big East, but the Golden Eagles have now won 19 straight in the series, after a shorthanded 67-54 win in Cincinnati on New Year’s Day.",

    "title": "Champions League Preview: Juventus vs. Galatasaray",
    "description": "Juventus face a monumental task of trying to reverse a 5-2 aggregate scoreline that was a lot of their own doing in Wednesday night’s second leg against Galatasaray.",
    "fullText": "When Juventus headed into the second leg of their Champions League play-off round tie against PSV Eindhoven last season, they had every chance to qualify for the Round of 16. All they needed to do was avert disaster and then they would be extending their European campaign by another 180 minutes at least.\n\nThe problem about what happened last week is that the disaster has already happened, not taken place in the second leg. It was the second half in which Juve completely self-destructed in Istanbul, seeing all the work they had done to get ahead 2-1 after falling behind early disappear faster than a trick by your favorite magician.\n\nSo now, with just about 99.9% of folks thinking that this tie is pretty much over, there’s a second leg to play.\n\nIt comes after another disappointing performance in the month of February, too.\n\nWe are about to see if Luciano Spalletti’s can muster up something that they didn’t over the weekend against Como: the ability to fight. We saw that fight against Inter Milan in the Derby d’Italia. We saw that fight in the first half in Istanbul as Teun Koopmeiners did the unexpected and scored a brace in a Juve shirt. But ever since everything went to hell and Galatasaray stormed back from a goal down to score four unanswered and take a 5-2 aggregate lead with them to Turin, Wednesday night’s second leg will be the chance to show that the fight still exists no matter what the final aggregate scoreline ends up being after the final whistle sounds.\n\nTo turn the tie in their favor may be too much to ask.\n\nHell, after Saturday’s showing against Como expecting a big response might be, too.\n\nBut at this point, there really is only one thing that Juventus know they can do: they can’t play like they have over the course of their last three halves of football. Or really much of the last month. Because if they repeat any of that, then their Champions League campaign will come to an end and it will be done in just as bad of a fashion as it possibly could. And on their home field.\n\nIf they come out fighting … yeah, they will still probably lose on aggregate because that’s just what happens when you allow four goals in a half and see your 2-1 lead go up in smoke.\n\nThis is a test of Juventus’ character as much as it is to see if they can just make things interesting against a Galatasaray side that also fell to a 2-0 loss over the weekend. Spalletti essentially said that during his pre-match press conference, including a call to the fans in the same stadium that booed the squad before, during and then after the loss to Como on Saturday.\n\n““Some games aren’t just played, but composed,” Spalletti said. “Tomorrow requires the involvement and participation of the whole environment, and we need the spirit of our fans. We know it’s a delicate situation, but we’re asking them to stand by our side tomorrow. With them by our side, we are stronger.”\n\nIt’s also going to be interesting to see how Galatasaray play it considering they will take the field with a three-goal aggregate lead and can still lose by two without being in any danger of advancing to face either Liverpool or Tottenham in the UCL Round of 16. Does Galatasaray manager Okan Buruk pretty much just set up shop and hunker down for much of the night to comfortably defend their lead? Or, knowing what they did in the second half of the first leg last week, come out with their offensive firepower that they will likely field up front and try and put the early nail in Juve’s coffin and make it even more impossible to flip the aggregate scoreline?\n\nEither way, the easy thing to say is that Juventus need to be much more like the team that rallied back from going down 1-0 early in Istanbul rather than the one that squandered that same 2-1 lead a few short minutes later. They will not only have to be just that kind of team, but one that’s even better. It will come at a time in which Spalletti is sh0rt-handed at the back — most notably without both of his natural left back options as well as potentially his best central defender after he came off the field injured last Tuesday.\n\nThe odds are slim that Juventus advance to the Champions League Round of 16. Very, very slim. But there’s one thing Juventus can do regardless of what the aggregate scoreline says: play like they don’t care what said scoreline is. They can play like they give a damn regardless if it’s 2-2 on aggregate or the reality of it being 5-2.\n\nPlay for the pride of the jersey. Play for the personal pride of not being booed off the field yet again.\n\nIf they do, then they can bow out with some modicum of pride. But if they don’t, then it’s looking like a winless February and even worse of an overall vibe surrounding them from the outside as they head to Rome in a few days.\n\nThanks to their respective variety of cards in last Tuesday’s first leg, Juventus will be without both Andrea Cambiaso and Juan Cabal for Wednesday night’s play-off round decider.\n\nThe big news out of Spalletti’s press conference on Tuesday: Bremer will be available and will be available against Galatasaray. The catch is that many of the predicted lineups on Tuesday don’t expect Bremer to be in the starting lineup on Wednesday. Considering what happened after he left late in the first half last week, this is a pretty good thing to actually have him available again.\n\nBremer’s final status for Galatasaray will be assessed Wednesday morning, according to Spalletti.\n\nSpalletti sounded a little more optimistic about Kenan Yildiz’s status to face Galatasaray, saying “He wants to be involved tomorrow at any cost, and today he trained partially with the group.” Spalletti added that Yildiz “could start from the first minute.”\n\nThe other injured players are the ones we know about already, with Dusan Vlahovic, Emil Holm and (or course) Arek Milik all missing out.\n\nThere is a growing feeling in the Italian media that Mattia Perin will start in goal for the struggling Michele Di Gregorio — which, considering what has happened in recent weeks, is completely understandable.\n\nJonathan David is expected to return to the starting lineup after missing the first leg in Turkiye last week.\n\nDespite the lack of fullback options, most predicted lineups has Spalletti going with a 4-3-3 formation.\n\nIf Spalletti does choose to go with a 3-4-2-1 because of limited options at the back, the existence of Filip Kostic will give the Tuscan tactician an actual wingback to have in the starting lineup. That’s right — Kostic in a crucial Champions League fixture in 2026. You didn’t expect that back in August, did ya?\n\nWith all of the absences in defense, this feels like one of those games in which Juventus’ ultimate wild card in terms of where he’s going to be playing is going to take on yet another interesting chapter.\n\nCould he be a left back if Spalletti goes into a back four? Does he play as a wingback opposite Kostic if Spalletti goes with a back three? Is it some kind of whacky hybrid kind of role that will be ever-evolving throughout his time on the field on Wednesday night?\n\nEither way, we know one thing: Weston McKennie will be on the field and battling like all hell.\n\nProbably around the time that Juventus players took the fields at Continassa for Tuesday’s training session ahead of their showdown with Galatasaray, we heard that McKennie was closing in on a contract extension with the Bianconeri. It is certainly a reward for the work that he’s put in this season, and certainly a cause for celebration no matter how much the current situation against Galatasaray is far from ideal.\n\nSo why McKennie here as compared somebody like say, David, who is likely leading the line against Gala? Well, because we’ve seen McKennie be really, really good in the Champions League during his entire career at Juventus and just because if he is in fact fielded as a wingback then that might be taking away form what has made him so good under Spalletti.\n\nWhat is one of the biggest things that McKennie has done so well the last few months playing in a more advanced role? It’s been his ability to run into space and then take advantage of it no matter if it’s setting up goals or getting himself free in the penalty area to score one for himself. It’s shown the versatility to his game — both positionally and when it comes to his skill set.\n\nBut is that the same kind of things that he can bring to the table when he’s playing as a wingback? To an extent, yes. Not to the same kind of degree when he’s playing further up the field behind the striker or out wide as a quasi-winger.\n\nThat makes him all the more important against Galatasaray — which, considering who could start on the opposite wing is that we know at least one wing is likely just going to spam in some crosses and not exactly be a creative force by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nWhen: Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026.\n\nWhere: Juventus Stadium, Turin, Italy.\n\nOfficial kickoff time: 9 p.m. local time in Italy and across Europe, 8 p.m. in the United Kingdom, 3 p.m. Eastern time, 2 p.m. Central time, 12 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nTelevision: CBS Sports Network (United States); TNT Sports 3, TNT Sports 5 (United Kingdom).\n\nOnline/Streaming: Paramount+, Amazon Prime Video USA, fuboTV (United States); DAZN Canada; fuboTV Canada (Canada); Amazon Prime Video UK (United Kingdom); Amazon Prime Video (Italy).\n\nOther live viewing options can be found here, and as always, you can also follow along with us live and all the stupid things we say on Bluesky.

    "fullText": "It is well known at this stage that Manchester United will focus on improving their midfield options once the summer transfer window opens.\n\nCasemiro is set to leave, while Manuel Ugarte’s stay at Old Trafford is also likely to be cut short.\n\nGiven Mason Mount’s injury record, it would not be a surprise to see the Englishman moved on as well. To add to this, Bruno Fernandes’ future also remains up in the air.\n\nA pretty sizeable revamp is on the cards, with Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson the top priority to come in and strengthen the middle of the park.\n\nOne player will not be enough, and INEOS are likely to sign two midfielders. Carlos Baleba, and Adam Wharton remain genuine targets, but recently, another Forest ace got linked with a switch to Old Trafford.\n\nIbrahim Sangare would cost much less than both the Crystal Palace ace and Brighton and Hove Albion star, while he has impressed despite Forest’s current predicament.\n\nHowever, Fabrizio Romano has refuted the rumours, claiming there is no concrete interest in the Ivorian.\n\n“Manchester United have a crucial plan for the midfield in summer 2026.\n\n“They love Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest and there is nothing concrete in the links with Ibrahim Sangare.”\n\nThe Italian journalist also added that INEOS are locked in talks with Kobbie Mainoo’s camp over a new contract.\n\nThat is indeed great news after former head coach Ruben Amorim came dangerously close to selling the Carrington graduate in two successive windows.\n\nOn the pitch, the Red Devils stretched their unbeaten run under Michael Carrick to six games with a narrow 1-0 win away at Everton on Monday night.\n\nIt was far from a vintage display, but a breathtaking counter-attack finished off by Benjamin Sesko proved to be the difference between the two sides.\n\nThey return to action again on Sunday when Crystal Palace visit the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nFeature image Naomi Baker via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "Pacers coach Rick Carlisle calls out league on $100,000 tanking fine, league pushes back",
    "description": "Carlisle said the league didn't talk to him or the team physician about Aaron Nesmith missing time.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this month, the NBA fined the Indiana Pacers $100,000 for \"violating the Player Participation Policy in connection with the team's game against the Utah Jazz on Feb. 3.\" On the second night of a back-to-back, Indiana sat All-Star Pascal Siakam as well as Bennedict Mathurin (who was traded within days), T.J. McConnell, Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith for the game (a loss to the Jazz). The league said that, in consultation with an independent physician, it determined that Siakam and two others could have played, although possibly in reduced roles.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle didn't hold back when addressing the fine during a radio appearance on 107.5 The Fan on Tuesday (hat tip The Athletic).\n\n\"I didn't agree with it. There was a league lawyer that was doing the interview that kind of unilaterally decided that Aaron Nesmith, who had been injured the night before and couldn't hold the ball, should have played in the game, which just seems ridiculous.\n\n\"During the interview process – I was not on it, but I heard details – we asked them if they wanted to talk to the doctors, our doctors, about it because it was something that was documented by our doctors and trainers. They said no, they didn't need to. They talked to their doctors, who did not examine Aaron Nesmith. And we asked them if they wanted to talk to (Nesmith), and they said, no, they didn't need to.\n\n\"This was shocking to me. And during the interview, they also asked if we considered medicating him to play in a game when we were 30 games under .500. So I was very surprised. Obviously didn't agree with it.\"\n\nAs you might expect, a league spokesman had a different spin on this when Sam Amick of The Athletic reached out.\n\n\"Coach Carlisle's description of the process that went into the decision to fine the Indiana Pacers is inaccurate. An independent physician led the medical review. In addition, the Pacers' general manager and the team's senior vice president (of) sports medicine and performance were interviewed as part of the process. The Pacers confirmed that it had provided all of the information requested by the league and the team reported that an interview with Coach Carlisle or a team physician wasn't necessary.\"\n\nFirst, what Carlise accurately sums up is the vibe around the NBA — the league's approach to limiting tanking is random. Scattershot. Utah and Indiana (and likely a couple of teams in the future) will be hit with fines, while other teams sit out stars — with what seems, from the outside, to be very slow-healing injuries (to be generous) — and go unpunished. I have no doubt that the league feels there is an internal logic and they are following the CBA, but outside the New York NBA HQ, the feeling is Utah in particular (because they played stars but sat them in the fourth quarter), but Indiana as well, were singled out for things a whole bunch of other teams are doing. Utah basically said, \"Okay, we'll play your game,\" and came up with surgeries for Jaren Jackson Jr. and Jusuf Nurkic that will sit two key rotation players for the remainder of the year.\n\nSecond, if the price for Indiana of a top-four pick is a $100,000 fine, they will pay it with a smile. That is the price of doing business. Utah will feel the same way about a $500,000 fine.",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A.J. Brown and Maxx Crosby are two of the best NFL players who could be on the move this offseason.\n\nTheir teams just aren’t saying they’re on the trade block.\n\nBrown, the Philadelphia Eagles’ star wide receiver, wasn’t happy with the offense or his role in it last season after helping the team win the Super Bowl in 2024. But the Eagles will have a new system with offensive coordinator Sean Mannion.\n\n“There’s a lot of conversations in the offseason about players on your team, on other teams,” Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said Tuesday at the NFL scouting combine. “That’s really the job. That’s the fun part about the offseason is the opportunities to improve your team, the opportunities to make trades but at the end of the day, again, we’re trying to get better. It’s hard to do that if you’re just subtracting great players.\n\n“We’ll do whatever is in the best interest of our team to be better for this year and going forward. Anything that puts us in position that we think to potentially win another championship so every decision will be made with that no matter who the player is.”\n\nCrosby, the five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher for the Las Vegas Raiders, finished last season on injured reserve after being shut down for the final two weeks due to a knee injury, despite his desire to play. He’s said he wants to play for a contender.\n\nRaiders GM John Spytek said he anticipates Crosby being on the team and added he had a “great conversation” with him. He also pointed to the New England Patriots going from 4-13 in 2024 to playing in the Super Bowl in 2025 as an example of a team that can dramatically improve from one season to the next.\n\nHowever, when asked if Crosby is an “untradeable player,” Spytek said: “We’re always listening, man.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "In celebration of AJ Styles' in-ring career, legends and active wrestlers gathered for a special tribute in the closing segment of \"WWE Raw,\" with Styles himself getting choked up on the microphone. After \"Raw\" went off the air, several others did as well.\n\nAs seen in the near-five minute YouTube exclusive, a string of heartfelt moments unfolded in the ring as Styles said goodbye to colleagues from WWE, New Japan Pro-Wrestling, and TNA. Amongst those from Styles' TNA history were Frankie Kazarian, Drake Maverick (formerly known as Rockstar Spud), Bobby Roode, and Abyss, the former two of whom now serve as backstage producers for WWE. When embracing Roode, Styles remarked \"You got me good, dude,\" referencing his surprise at the news of his WWE Hall of Fame induction. Roode, however, admitted then that he had no prior knowledge of it.\n\nKarl Anderson and Luke Gallows, who worked with Styles across WWE and NJPW, were also present for the tribute show, marking their first WWE appearances after being released from the company in February 2025. Like them, Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa, Finn Balor, and Cody Rhodes served as the night's former Bullet Club representatives. Balor and Styles even greeted each other with a Too Sweet.\n\nAmongst Styles' WWE family, Cathy Kelley, Stephanie Vaquer, Michin, and Asuka appeared visibly emotional. Before it all, Rhodes and Sami Zayn hoisted \"The Phenomenal One\" on their shoulders.\n\nStyles' last match took place at the 2026 Royal Rumble, where \"The Career Killer\" GUNTHER made him pass out to the sleeper hold. Prior to that, Styles notably met Shinsuke Nakamura, his former NJPW rival, in a match at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event. Equipped with his camera, Nakamura later took photos of Styles' sendoff on \"Raw\" as well.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Chris Youngblood registered his second 30-point performance of the season in the G League on Tuesday, leading the OKC Blue to a win over the Austin Spurs.\n\nYoungblood finished with a career-high 35 points, eight rebounds, five assists and two steals in the 109-100 victory at the Paycom Center. He shot 9-of-14 from the field, including three 3-pointers, and was a plus-13 in 40 minutes, 41 seconds of action.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 guard tallied 14 points in the first quarter alone to help the Blue jump out to a 37-16 lead. He stayed in attack mode throughout his time on the court, getting downhill to the free-throw line, while also mixing in some mid-range shots and 3s.\n\n35 PTS ⚡️ 8 REB ⚡️ 5 AST ⚡️ 9/14 FG\n\nChris Youngblood was on a HEATER! The @okcblue rookie scored a career-high to lead his team to victory over the Spurs. This was his second 30+ point game this season. pic.twitter.com/cybK6iyG0M\n\n— NBA G League (@nbagleague) February 24, 2026\n\nYoungblood is averaging 20.8 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.2 steals while shooting 43.7% from the field in 16 appearances with the Blue. His previous career high was set on Dec. 27 with 34 points and eight rebounds in a win over the South Bay Lakers.\n\nThe 24-year-old began the season on a two-way contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder after going undrafted out of Alabama. He was waived on Feb. 6 after exhausting his 50-game active service limit and joined the Blue full-time on Feb. 9.\n\nYoungblood has had a productive year with the Blue and further showcased his overall ability and skill set on Tuesday. With one month left in the G League schedule, Youngblood will look to finish out the year on a high note and build positive momentum heading into next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rookie Wire: G League: Chris Youngblood drops career high in OKC Blue victory",

    "fullText": "Gary Player has never done things by halves, and at 90 years old, that still appears to be the case.\n\nThe nine-time major champion posted an eye-catching workout video this week, showing himself powering through a series of demanding core exercises.\n\nFor most golfers, staying active at that age would be impressive enough.\n\nPlayer, however, looked fully committed as ever, using the clip to send a clear message about what he believes is the foundation of a great golf swing.\n\nPlayer has long been regarded as one of the original fitness pioneers in golf.\n\nAt a time when many professionals paid little attention to conditioning, the South African great was already building strength and endurance into his routine. His latest post underlined that philosophy.\n\n“A strong core is the engine of a powerful golf swing,” he posted. “If you want balance, speed, and longevity in this game, you must train your center every day.”\n\nPlayer has consistently credited his longevity in the sport to disciplined training habits and an unwavering commitment to fitness. Even at 90, he continues to practise what he preaches.\n\nThe emphasis on core strength is particularly relevant in modern golf, where rotational power and stability are central to generating clubhead speed while avoiding injury.\n\nFitness is only part of the equation. Player also acknowledged how advances in golf technology have helped him maintain a high standard of play into his later years.\n\n“Technology in golf is incredible,” he added. “Hybrids have been an incredible development for golf and have certainly allowed me to maintain a high level of golf as I have gotten older. Absolutely loving my PXG hybrids.”\n\nHybrids have become a staple in many golfers’ bags thanks to their forgiveness and versatility, and Player is no exception. Rather than resisting modern equipment, he has embraced it.\n\nBetween his relentless dedication to fitness and his willingness to adapt to new technology, Player continues to set an example.\n\nAt 90, he remains one of golf’s most enduring ambassadors — and a reminder that longevity in the sport requires both hard work and evolution.\n\nWWE Superstar Trick Williams has brilliant response to Tom Brady’s ‘cute’ comments about wrestling\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown gets real about emotional NFL game in Germany with Detroit Lions\n\nNick Sirianni gives cryptic answer about A.J. Brown’s future with Philadelphia Eagles",

In other words, Hurts likes throwing to his TE1,” Kiper wrote.\n\n“Sadiq had eight touchdown receptions last season, and he's explosive and does a lot of damage after the catch.

    "fullText": "Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is reportedly sparing no expense for its unprecedented, one-of-one White House event this summer.\n\nAccording to Puck News, the promotion’s parent company, TKO Group Holdings, could spend “as much as $60 million” to stage the event tentatively scheduled for Fri., June 26, 2026, on the South Lawn. The event is being positioned as part of the United States’ 250th anniversary celebration — and the price tag reflects the scale.\n\nFor comparison, UFC 306 at Sphere in Las Vegas reportedly cost around $21 million to produce. The White House show could triple that figure. UFC CEO Dana White has already revealed that between $700,000 and $1 million alone may be required to replace the South Lawn grass after the event.\n\nPresident Donald Trump previously floated the idea of building a temporary stadium structure on-site to accommodate a massive crowd. However, Puck reports that those plans “are not remotely possible.”\n\nThe UFC head honcho has described a more controlled setup: approximately 3,000 to 4,000 invited guests cageside, with no public ticket sales, and a secondary viewing area at The Ellipse (President’s Park South), roughly a tenth of a mile away, where 85,000 fans could gather.\n\nRenderings of the proposed layout have already surfaced, suggesting the promotion is moving forward with its large-scale outdoor production.\n\nAs for the fight card, White recently said the lineup is already “built,” with two options mapped out with 6-7 fights. One notable omission: Conor McGregor is not expected to be involved.",

    "description": "Despite production questions, Brian Gutekunst surprisingly indicates that Rashan Gary is expected back with the Green Bay Packers in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Green Bay Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst sat down with members of local media on Tuesday while at the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nHe touched on a variety of topics, including Rich Bisaccia's surprise decision to step down as special teams coordinator and assistant head coach. That was big news. The Packers were basically caught between a rock and a hard place by Bisaccia's resignation, and they didn't see it coming.\n\nAnother topic that's going to start making its way across Packer Nation like wildfire is Gutekunst's thoughts on pass-rusher Rashan Gary.\n\nGary has been tabbed as a shoo-in to be cut this offseason because of his drop in production, as well as the $18 million in base salary and $28 million cap hit he's going to represent in 2026.\n\nGary finished the season with just 7.5 sacks and he didn't notch a single sack over the last 10 games, including the playoffs.\n\nHe was a dissapointment both considering the money the Packers have paid him as well as his draft slot (No. 12 overall in 2019).\n\nWith that said, surprisingly, Gutekunst did speak about Gary as if the Packers are expecting him back in  2026.\n\n\"Sometimes, there is an ebb and flow with production with sacks,\" Gutekunst said, according to Zach Kruse of Packers Wire. \"He was impactful towards the second half of the season. Maybe not as much as the first, but he was impactful. Rashan has all the talent in the world. And he's produced at a high level for us since he's been here. We would expect that next year as well.\"\n\nGary has been with the Packers for seven seasons now. His high-water mark for sacks was 9.5 in 2021, but he's tallied just 7.5 sacks in each of the last two seasons, and he's averaged 6.64 sacks per season.\n\nThat's alright production from a role player or a mid-round pick, but it's abysmal production from a former first-round pick and a player who is expected to have the second-highest cap hit on the team next season behind only Jordan Love.\n\nThat's just not acceptable, and it's not sustainable, so if Gutekunst and the Packers are going to bring Gary back, you can almost guarantee they'll find a way out of that high cap number.\n\nThey could restructure Gary's deal by converting salary into a signing bonus, but that would still be paying him a ton of money despite the fact that he has not produced.\n\nThey could ask him to take a pay cut, which he wouldn't have to do, but it could keep him employed in Green Bay through the end of the 2027 season -- when his current deal ends.\n\nThe smartest move would be cutting Gary before June 1 and taking the nearly $11 million in savings. If they want him back in 2026, they could cut him and then re-sign him, though it's worth noting that at that juncture, he just may decide to try the open market.\n\nWith all that in mind, the only way forward that makes any sense here for the Packers is a pay cut. In fact, it's the only responsible and reasonable option, because Gary can't come back with a nearly $30 million cap hit next season.\n\nThis situation isn't ideal, but it's the mess that Gutekunst got himself in when he reached for a raw player with unrealized upside at No. 12 in the draft.\n\nPackersRoundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "fullText": "Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker has all but confirmed a big career change.\n\nWhittaker has been contemplating a light heavyweight move for a while now and is looking to make his divisional debut this summer. Whittaker is coming off back-to-back losses to current middleweight champion Khamzat Chimaev and Reinier de Ridder.\n\nWhile Whittaker (26-9 MMA, 17-7 UFC) never has missed weight as a welterweight and middleweight, he wonders if the cut could be hindering his performance.\n\n\"I'm locking in now,\" Whittaker told Submission Radio. \"I'm locking in for June. I want to get in there. I want to fight again. I want to fight in June at 205 most likely. I'm going to give it a go. I know a lot of naysayers, small this, small that. Shut up, dude. I want to give it a go. I'm on the tail end of my career, so I've got to try rather than just thinking about what ifs. ... I've been playing with the idea for a long time. During the break, I was kind of training at a heavier weight.\n\n\"I want to lock in and move in to this weight division. There's no doubt in my mind I could make middleweight. I can make it still. I can lose the weight, but I just don't know if it's like, if I'm getting the best out of myself, you know, having to cut that weight because the camp performance kind of really suffers on the backend of a weight cut, and a lot of fighters can testify that. I don't know. Try something different. It's my life.\"\n\nWhittaker revealed that his walk-around weight is over light heavyweight.\n\n\"I'm going to try and put on a little bit of muscle, but I'm not going to put too much,\" Whittaker said. \"I walk around heavy anyway. I'm heavy. I walk around like 107, 108 (kilos), just cruising. Obviously that's not shredded, so I want to try and bring that back, shred up, just train fed, train fully fueled, and get the most out of my camps, and come into fight week feeling good for once.\"\\\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC's Robert Whittaker locking in toward light heavyweight move",

    "fullText": "Chicago Cubs All-Star Pete Crow-Armstrong shaded Los Angeles Dodgers fans in an interview with Chicago Magazine.\n\nCrow-Armstrong — who broke out as a star for the Cubs in 2025 — grew up in the Los Angeles area, going to Harvard-Westlake School. The star praised fans in Chicago, but in doing so chose to take a shot at Dodgers fans.\n\n“I love Chicago more and more. It’s just an incredible city. The people are great,” he said. “They give a s—. They aren’t just baseball fans who go to the game like Dodgers fans to take pictures or whatever. They are paying attention. They care.”\n\nWhile he’s from the area, Crow-Armstrong is far from a Dodger fan. His dad grew up in Illinois and forbid him from rooting for either the Dodgers or the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n“Growing up in L.A., my dad gave me a couple of rules. 1) I couldn’t root for the Dodgers. 2) I couldn’t root for the Cardinals,” PCA wrote in The Players’ Tribune last year.\n\nWhile Crow-Armstrong speculates Dodger fans don’t care, they ultimately have bragging rights as the current holders of the World Series.\n\nPCA and the Cubs will look to establish themselves as serious contenders in the coming season, though, and they’ll get an early shot at the Dodgers during the regular season. L.A. hosts the Cubs from April 24-26, and LA Sports Report’s Doug McKain believes the Dodgers will show the All-Star just how much they “give a sh*t.”\n\nThe post Cubs All-Star Takes Shot at Dodger Fans appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "Bodo/Glimt knock out last year's finalists Inter Milan in one of the biggest upsets in Champions League history and now the team from the Arctic Circle is dreaming of how far they can go after reaching last 16.",
    "fullText": "Bodo/Glimt just keep on defying the odds.\n\nThe Norwegian team, based around 200 miles into the Arctic Circle, have forged a reputation for upsets, but on Tuesday night in Milan they produced one of the biggest in Champions League history.\n\nFacing three-time winners Inter Milan - beaten by Paris St-Germain in the final of this competition just over nine months ago - Bodo had a daunting task, even if they held a 3-1 lead from the first leg.\n\nYet they rose to the occasion once more - just like they had done in beating Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in the group phase.\n\nIt was another resolute and determined display in Italy to complete a home and away double over Cristian Chivu's men, first to repel the numerous first-half Inter attacks before scoring twice to ultimately leave the Serie A leaders with too much to do.\n\nWinners 2-1 on the night, Bodo's 5-2 aggregate success secured their place in the Champions League last 16 for the first time, where they will face either Manchester City or Sporting.\n\n\"It is a historical moment for Bodo and I think also for Norwegian football,\" said boss Kjetil Knutsen.\n\nJens Petter Hauge was again inspirational, scoring his sixth goal in the competition this season for the opener, before setting up Hakon Evjen's lovely finish for the second.\n\n\"It sounds not true, but we are there, among the last teams in the competition,\" added the forward, who was back in the San Siro where he had a two-year spell at AC Milan.\n\n\"It will be really exciting to see what the next two games bring.\"\n\nBodo/Glimt stun Inter in Milan to reach last 16\n\nBodo/Glimt are the first Norwegian side to progress in a knockout-stage tie in the Champions League and the first overall in the European Cup since Lillestrom in the first round in 1987-88.\n\nThe Norwegians are the first team from outside of Europe's big five leagues to win four consecutive games in a European Cup/Champions League campaign against opponents from those leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy & France) since Ajax in 1971-72, who went on to win the European Cup that season.\n\nJens Petter Hauge has scored six goals for Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League this season; the most ever by a Norwegian player for a Norwegian club in a single edition of the European Cup/Champions League.\n\nThis fairytale run to the knockouts will have felt unlikely for Bodo after failing to win their first six league phase games, meaning they were left needing results against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to qualify for the play-offs.\n\nAnd, against the odds, they provided them.\n\nA 3-1 victory over Pep Guardiola's men brought deserved attention and acclaim, but it was no one-off as Bodo overcame Atleti 2-1 in Madrid to claim a play-off spot.\n\nKnutsen's side lost to Spurs in the Europa League semi-finals last season, having become the first Norwegian side to reach the last four of a major European competition.\n\nKey to their success has often been their ability to make their home games as tough as possible.\n\nIn the north of Norway, Bodo can often be bitterly cold, snowy and windy during the long winter months, with temperatures deep into minus figures.\n\nThe difficult weather conditions mean the team play on an artificial pitch made of plastic, something many sides used to playing on grass find difficult to deal with.\n\nThose aspects, coupled with the players' determination and strong belief in their ability, means many have left Bodo defeated.\n\nThey famously thrashed Jose Mourinho's Roma 6-1 at home in the Europa Conference League five years ago, while Celtic, Besiktas, Porto and Lazio have also been victims in recent years.\n\nManchester City won't relish another meeting in the last 16 if they are drawn together, with Bodo buoyant after proving they have nothing to fear against Europe's top sides.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" captain Patrick Berg told Canal+.\n\n\"For the club and city it's unbelievable. I don't think people thought we could beat Manchester City, Atletico and now Inter two times.\n\nThis is a step into the unknown for Bodo as they prepare to play in the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time.\n\nBut their run to the Europa League semis in the previous campaign will give them belief - and provide hope to every small club of what can still be achieved in Uefa's major competitions.\n\nAnd, for however long this journey continues, they will be backed by the now familiar sight of their vocal fans, who were unmissable at the San Siro decked out all in yellow and with scarves held in the air.\n\n\"I am so proud, we are a team from a small town,\" added Knutsen.\n\n\"I really hope we show if we can do it, then everyone can do it. For me that's the most beautiful thing of the whole story.\"",

    "fullText": "Sarasota (Fla.) Cardinal Mooney four-star quarterback Davin Davidson has quickly become one of the most coveted signal-callers in the 2027 cycle.\n\nAfter stacking myriad big-time offers over just a couple of months, Davidson has officially trimmed his list of top schools down to eight. He told Rivals’ Hayes Fawcett on Tuesday that he’s down to Auburn, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Miami, Mississippi State, Notre Dame and Virginia Tech.\n\nDavidson is the No. 208 overall prospect and No. 19 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 21 recruit in Florida.\n\nOn Monday, Davidson made a move up the Rivals300. He’s now the No. 120 recruit and No. 11 QB in Rivals’ 2027 rankings.\n\nThis week, Davidson updated his recruitment with Rivals’ Chad Simmons. His top schools are no surprise. A decision for the blue-chipper could come sooner rather than later, too.\n\n“In a perfect world, I’d take these spring visits and commit shortly after, then take one official,” Davidson told Simmons. “If it needs to go longer, I’ll take as many officials as I need. On these visits, I want to see if I’m truly a priority, how they treat me and how the relationships feel. Ultimately, I want to know if it feels like home.”\n\nAt the end of January, Davidson was in Gainesville. Florida, led by new head coach Jon Sumrall, has made an impression on the rising gunslinger.\n\n“I like Florida a lot,” Davidson said. “The new staff has been great and they’ve poured a lot into me. I’ve been there so much that I feel like I really know the program. The energy they bring and their focus on winning stand out. I like the strong culture at Florida.”\n\nIt remains to be seen who will come out on top for Davidson, but things are moving fast for the four-star. Upcoming visits will be crucial.\n\nRivals’ Director of Scouting and Rankings Charles Power recently wrote this of Davidson as a prospect:\n\n“Davin Davidson is another physically-talented 2027 passer who has seen his profile rise coming out of his junior season, as he helped Sarasota (Fla.) Cardinal Mooney to a state title. Davidson pairs immense size at around 6-foot-6, 215 pounds with a very live arm. He’s more of a fastball thrower right now and will need to continue adding nuance as a passer. The size, arm, and movement skills are very projectable and his physical upside has created a considerable buzz. Davidson visited Florida for a junior day in January and has landed offers from the Gators, Florida State, Miami, and several others over the last month.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby has been a huge talking point of the offseason, and we bet that it won't stop anytime soon.\n\nWith Crosby reportedly disgruntled, there are some who think teams like the Dallas Cowboys could swoop in for the star pass rusher and lure him out of the AFC West.\n\nBut we know that players like Maxx don't come around too often, which makes a trade tough, but not impossible, with the franchise rumored to be wanting a Micah Parsons-like compensation of two first-round picks and a player.\n\nBut Raiders general manager John Spytek, in speaking at the scouting combine, might have just ended all of the trade speculation.\n\n\"Maxx is an elite player and I'm been very upfront that we're in the business of having really good players on the team, and we need a lot more of them,\" Spytek said via CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. \"It's hard to build a great team without elite players.\"\n\nMore: Steelers make eye-opening statement on potential Aaron Rodgers return\n\nIn truth, Spytek can say all he wants about wanting Crosby to stay, but if a godfather-like offer comes in and Maxx isn't 100 percent sold on staying, then the franchise will be hard-pressed to say no.\n\nSpytek is right, you can't build a great team without elite players, but as we know in the NFL, everything has a price, and for Crosby, it would be high.\n\nStill, we know several teams are willing to take a flyer on Maxx, despite Spytek's comments.\n\nAnd until this situation is resolved one way or another, Crosby and those trade talks will be the main headline of the offseason.\n\nWhy Chiefs are in ideal place to deal with big Travis Kelce decision\n\nBrett Veach's latest Chiefs quote should terrify the NFL\n\nTexans GM Nick Caserio goes scorched earth on C.J.

    "fullText": "One of the biggest talking points of the 2025 season was that the Minnesota Vikings, who had just gone 14-3 with Sam Darnold at the helm in 2024, decided to release the now-Super Bowl champion in favor of a questionable prospect, J.J. McCarthy. At the time, however, it seemed like a no-brainer for the Vikings.\n\nDarnold’s performance against the Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card round was abysmal. When you pair that with the high-end draft capital that the front office had just invested in McCarthy not even a year prior, it seemed like the right decision to make. Unfortunately, the Michigan product has yet to justify both his first-round draft status and the Vikings’ decision to release Darnold.\n\n“I understand their thought process of going with the younger kid,” Darnold noted in a recent interview with Colin Cowherd. “There’s a lot of potential there, and I think J.J. is going to be a really, really good player in this league… That was a little bit of a tough pill to swallow, but when I really stood back and looked at it from afar, I really understood the decision, and I’m thankful that I landed in Seattle,” Sam said, justifying the move.\n\nSuffice to say, you won’t find any sour grapes here with Darnold, as he’s likely more aware than anyone else of the amount of egg that was left on the face of Minnesota all throughout his turnover-less playoff run. Throw in the early struggles of McCarthy, which included an 11:12 touchdown-to-interception ratio and a pass completion percentage of just 57.6%, and it seems fair to suggest that Darnold knows that there’s no need to kick a man while he’s down.\n\nAs far as his personal transition from Minnesota to the Seattle Seahawks is concerned, the 28-year-old explained that it’s a lot easier to do your job as a quarterback when you’re throwing to a player like Jaxson Smith-Njigba, who can only be described as a phenom at this point in his career. “From the start of OTAs, he was special,” Darnold remarked.\n\n“I remember we came out to L.A. in the offseason and we did some throwing with the guys right before training camp, and I had kind of seen him move around for the last couple months… One of my other buddies came to throw with us just because I needed an extra arm, and he was like ‘Dude, this guy is different,‘” Sam observed.\n\nThe 2025 Offensive Player of the Year played a critical role in Seattle’s path towards the championship, and now that we’ve seen what they are capable of, both he and Darnold figure to be at the forefront of every conversation that involves the NFC for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe post Seahawks’ Sam Darnold Explains Why Vikings’ Decision to Prioritize J.J.

    "description": "Trump wasn't willing to honor the U.S. women's team, but Jack Hughes can make sure their accomplishment isn't forgotten.",
    "fullText": "Jack Hughes has an opportunity for another gold-medal-worthy moment, and this time, he won’t have to beat a world-class goaltender to make it happen.\n\nThe Devils star only needs to use his massive platform as the new face of American hockey to make sure the other U.S. Olympic champions in his sport aren’t forgotten for what they accomplished in Milan.\n\nHe needs to do what President Donald Trump couldn’t do, inexplicably, with his callous dismissal of the U.S. women’s team during a locker room phone call as the men celebrated their historic victory over Canada. Trump made a dumb joke about needing to invite the women to the White House for the State of the Union address, too, as if they deserved that honor less than the men.\n\n“I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team, you do know that,” Trump told the men’s team before adding that if he didn’t, “I do believe I probably would be impeached.”\n\nSeveral men gathered around the phone laughed, and while that sparked outrage, it feels unfair to hold that against them. This was a joyous atmosphere just moments after the signature victory of their careers. Let’s give them some grace for that initial reaction.\n\nWhat happens now, though, is on them. The U.S. women — surprise! — turned down Trump’s half-hearted invitation to the State of the Union address, while Hughes and 19 of his teammates were expected to be in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday night for the speech.\n\n“No matter what your views are, we’re super excited to go to the White House tomorrow and be a part of that,” Hughes told The Daily Mail.\n\nThat sentiment sounds nice, but in these divided times, it falls flat. From the moment the players invited FBI director Kash Patel into the locker room to awkwardly chug a beer as if he himself had scored the winning goal, the gold-medal moment went from a unifying time to something else that we can yell at each other about on social media. That’s just the reality of the world we’re living in now.\n\nOn one point, though, there should be universal agreement: The U.S. women’s team deserves as much attention and credit for their gold-medal victory over Canada as the men do. Hughes, whose mother, Ellen, is a player development consultant for the women’s team, should make sure he never misses an opportunity to talk about them in the same breath as he does his own team’s accomplishment.\n\nThis should come naturally. Hughes was asked in the chaos of his team’s overtime victory what his first thought was after he sent the puck past Canadian goaltender Jordan Binnington. He didn’t talk about how this goal would ensure his immortality in U.S. hockey, or how the next generation of American kids might be emulating him in their driveways or ice rinks.\n\n“Honestly, first thought was, ‘We just won. How do I get my gloves and helmet off?’” Hughes said. “And surprisingly enough, one of the first people I thought of was Megan Keller, who had the gold-medal goal the other night.”\n\nKeller isn’t some stranger. The players on the two U.S. teams became friendly in the athletes’ village, with Hughes and his brother, Quinn, in a group of men’s team players who attended the women’s gold-medal game. The two teams hung out in the cafeteria after their Closing Ceremony, packing their bags and reminiscing.\n\n“If you could see what we see from the inside, and the men and women sharing, you know, dorm rooms and halls and flex floors and the camaraderie and the synergy and the way the women cheered on the men and the way the men cheered on the women — that’s what it’s all about,\" Ellen Hughes told the Today Show. “And the other things they cannot control. They care about humanity. They care about unity and they care about the country.”\n\nClearly, Ellen Hughes has raised her kids the right way. In 2023, Jack voiced his unequivocal support for the Devils’ decision to hold a Pride Night when other teams were canceling their celebrations. The LGBTQ community cheered when Hughes declared, “There was never a thought to not do it.”\n\nHe can own this fraught moment in a similar fashion. That doesn’t mean challenging Trump or angering either side of the political divide. It means doing the right thing and using his platform to remind this country — and, yes, the president himself — that we have the two greatest hockey teams in the world.",

    "description": "Bengals director of personnel Duke Tobin weighs in on if the Bengals would be willing to make a trade for Raiders All-Pro Maxx Crosby.",
    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS – Former Cincinnati Bengals offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth set the NFL rumor mill on fire when he proposed a mega trade proposal for his former team ahead of the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\n“Go get Maxx Crosby at all costs,\" Whitworth said on his “Fitz and Whit” podcast when discussing what the Bengals should do this offseason.\n\nFor the Bengals to acquire a player of Crosby’s caliber, they would need to be ready to take a big swing like giving up a future first-round pick and taking another major contract on the books.\n\nMore: Where Bengals stand with Trey Hendrickson at NFL combine\n\nSo, is Cincinnati willing to make a bold move like that?\n\nBengals fans shouldn’t get their hopes up as it seems unrealistic at this point. Here’s what the Bengals’ director of personnel Duke Tobin had to say on the subject.\n\n“We're always looking if there's an opportunity that we feel warrants it,” Tobin said on Feb. 24. “You have to give up things, and when you take a big swing, there's a big chance you miss. And it can stay with you for a long time and keep you in the dugout, if we're staying with baseball. We don't want to stay in the dugout. That's not a place we want to be.\n\n\"You don't get to take a big swing for free. Big swings take big compensation.”\n\nThe Bengals say they’ve proven they are all in with other decisions i.e. paying top dollar for wide receivers Tee Higgins and Ja’Marr Chase last season and making a rare in-season trade for Joe Flacco.\n\nCincinnati puts a premium on draft picks. Bengals owner Mike Brown and Tobin strongly believe in building through the draft, and giving up a first-round pick isn’t something they do often.\n\n“It's got to be worth it… we don't ignore opportunities that are out there,” Tobin said. “There are a lot of opportunities out there, and I think the offseason is the time to build your football team from the ground up. And that's what we're gonna try to do this offseason.”\n\nYou can never say never in the NFL. Crazy things happen all the time.\n\nTobin’s response makes it hard to believe the Bengals would be inclined to give up a first-round pick or make a splash move the likes of which fans are clamoring for.\n\nTobin believes given the cap space they have available this year and owning the No. 10 draft pick, they can get back to being a contender in 2026. Cincinnati ranks No. 7 in the NFL in most cap space available with $53 million.\n\n“We're excited about attacking this offseason,” Tobin said. “We have resources to attack the offseason in a big way, and we want to do that.”\n\nIt’s exactly what they’ll try to do, starting with an important week in Indianapolis. The Bengals must hit on their free agency signings and draft more players who can make an impact right away.\n\nThey believe they can achieve all of that without mortgaging their future.\n\n“We're trying to put the best roster together every year, and this year is no different,” Tobin said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Maxx Crosby trade rumors at 2026 NFL Scouting Combine for Bengals",

    "fullText": "Tyler Black went 3 for 3 with a home run and six runs batted in to power the Brewers to their first Cactus League victory, a 10-0 shutout of the Athletics at Hohokam Stadium in Mesa, Arizona, on Tuesday, Feb. 24.\n\nBlack hit a two-run blast in the first, a bases-clearing single and capped his day with a run-scoring double in the fifth. He also stole a base.\n\nThe three-run single was a statistical oddity, with only two such cases occurring in the major leagues last season.\n\n\"I decided to throw on the parachute there,\" said Black, noting the presence of A's center-field whiz Denzel Clarke.\n\nAmong the four pitchers in major league camp to see action was right-hander Coleman Crow, who allowed a single and hit a batter but came back with a strikeout and then finished the fifth by inducing a groundout.\n\nCrow was added to the Brewers' 40-man roster in the offseason and after starting for the entirety of his minor league career could factor in as a long relief option in the bullpen at some point in 2026.\n\n– Brice Turang worked a 14-pitch walk in the third inning from Mason Barnett. He fouled off nine pitches total, including four straight and seven of eight during one stretch.\n\n– David Hamilton and Akil Baddoo both experienced some buzzard's luck after crushing balls to straightaway center field that hit off the batter's eye and dropped back into the field of play for doubles, which goes according to the ground rules at Hohokam Stadium.\n\nHamilton's shot (425 feet) would have been a homer in 28 of 30 major league ballparks while Baddoo's (434) would have gone out of all 30.\n\n– It's spring training for everyone, apparently, as the headshot on the scoreboard throughout the entirety of the game for Blake Perkins was actually that of former Brewers right-hander Freddy Peralta.\n\n— Todd Rosiak (@Todd_Rosiak) February 24, 2026\n\n\"That's something to work with, huh?\" manager Pat Murphy on 6-foot-3, 250-pound Wande Torres, a left-hander who threw a scoreless seventh inning against the San Diego Padres on Feb. 23. The 21-year-old was 1-10 last season at Class A Carolina but averaged a strikeout an inning and was reaching 97 mph against the Padres.\n\nLuke Adams, starting at third base, had moments both in the field and at the plate. He opened the bottom of the second by playing a slow chopper by Jacob Wilson, gloving the ball on a tough short hop and then firing an on-target throw on the move to first base for the out.\n\nThen in the fifth, Adams rifled a run-scoring triple down the right-field line. He also walked in his second plate appearance.\n\n\"He's a good baseball player,\" Murphy said. \"You can't play third unless you can make that play.

    "fullText": "Italian football stands on the brink of a Champions League \"debacle\" - with the prospect of no Serie A clubs competing in this season's last 16.\n\nSince the reintroduction of the last-16 knockout round to Europe's showpiece competition in 2003-04, there has always been at least one Italian representative - on 12 occasions in the past 22 years, there have been three.\n\nIn fact, there has been at least one Italian side in the last 16 of the competition - or first knockout round when it took other formats - every year since 1987-88, when Napoli went out in the first round of the European Cup to Real Madrid.\n\nBut Inter Milan's shock play-off exit to Norwegian debutants Bodo/Glimt on Tuesday means either Juventus or Atalanta will have to overcome first-leg deficits to keep that run going.\n\nJuventus trail Galatasaray 5-2 heading into a return meeting in Turin, while Atalanta are 2-0 down on aggregate before Wednesday's home leg with Borussia Dortmund.\n\nInter - finalists last season - lost 2-1 at San Siro against Bodo, having suffered a 3-1 defeat in the first leg.\n\nIt is the first time the Milan giants have been knocked out of the Champions League by a team from outside Europe's top five leagues, those from England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France.\n\n\"This is a big wake up for Italian football,\" said Italian football journalist Daniele Verri.\n\n\"Juventus will need to win 4-0 and Atalanta need to win 3-0. [For them all to go out] would be a complete debacle, a disaster for our clubs.\n\n\"Tonight Ronaldo and Christian Vieri were guests at San Siro, and this is a symbolic clash with what has been and what is.\"\n\nInter signed Ronaldo and Vieri for world-record fees in the late 1990s, when Serie A was the envy of world football, blessed with the game's most talented stars.\n\nAC Milan then beat Juventus to win the Champions League in 2003, losing to Liverpool on penalties in the final two years later, before defeating the Reds to become European champions again in 2007.\n\nWhile there have been more recent successes in Europe's other competitions - Atalanta won the Europa League in 2024, Roma won the Conference League in 2021 - Jose Mourinho's Inter were the last Italian side to win the Champions League in 2010.\n\nInter's European exit comes despite being 10 points clear of rivals AC Milan in Serie A and a further four ahead of defending champions Napoli, who failed to make it out of the Champions League's league phase.\n\n\"It is a piece of history,\" said journalist Vincenzo Credendino. \"Speaking about Italy and Inter, this is one of the worst pieces.\n\n\"Inter are the best in Italy, but maybe it is time to think not about what can happen in one or two years, but about 10 or 15 years - and on that side we can see generally Italian football is not on the same level of top European leagues.\"\n\nThe national team must also win through a play-off in March to avoid missing out on a third successive World Cup this summer, having last lifted the trophy in 2006.\n\n\"It is a difficult time for Italian football and this shows it,\" added European football expert Julien Laurens on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"Today, Inter Milan put pressure on but it was not enough from them. They have been the best team in Italy for the last few years. And Napoli as well, they haven't even come close.\n\n\"It's terrible for Italian football at the moment.\"\n\nInter won five of their opening eight league phase games in Europe to finish 10th, with Juventus 13th and Atalanta 15th.\n\nYet in the play-offs, all have come unstuck against sides who finished lower in the table but play a more intense brand of football.\n\n\"What does it say about Italian football? That something needs to be changed,\" added Verri.\n\n\"The level of Italian football is poor. It is a structural issue. We play very slow football. You can ask any manager in Italy and they will all say the same.\n\n\"I was talking to Claudio Ranieri the other day and he said: 'Look, when I was in England at Leicester... people don't train more than in Italy. They just do it with another intensity, and then they keep up that intensity during the games.'\n\n\"We play slow, and in Europe you suffer.\"\n\n'We really messed up' - does European football need more balance?\n\nWhile Inter boast a much more expensively assembled squad on far bigger wages than Bodo, who had nine Norwegians in their starting XI at San Siro, Verri says Italian clubs are seeing their best players move abroad.\n\nLast season's Serie A top goalscorer Mateo Retegui left for Al-Qadsiah in Saudi Arabia, for example, while former team-mate Ademola Lookman joined Atletico Madrid and Tijjani Reijnders left AC Milan for Manchester City.\n\nWhile the majority of Italy's national squad still play in the country, stars such as Gianluigi Donnarumma, Riccardo Calafiori, Sandro Tonali and Retegui are elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, Laurens believes Serie A clubs are no longer producing good enough youngsters.\n\n\"Sporting CP, Club Brugge and Bodo have similarities in their success this season. Their scouting is great and their academies perform well,\" he explained.\n\n\"The academies in Italy are not producing enough players or players who are fit to play in their first team. The way they spend their money is not what we are used to from Italian clubs.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "description": "\"The battle of the mind can be dark and hard and unrelenting,” the Olympic athlete said",
    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn speaks candidly about her mental and physical recovery\n\nThe professional athlete suffered a horrific injury while skiing at the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nShe required a medical airlift and five surgeries, and is now expected to be in a wheelchair for the next two months\n\nLindsey Vonn is beginning to process the severity of her injury at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Feb. 24, the alpine ski racer, 41, admitted, “Today was a hard day.”\n\n“My physical battle began the second I got hurt but the mental battle started today,\" Vonn wrote. \"It hit me like a ton of bricks. It’s a battle I’m used to because I’ve done it so many times. I have always learned from every injury. Each one has made me a better and stronger person in different ways… but the battle of the mind can be dark and hard and unrelenting.\"\n\nThe athlete — who won four World Cup overall championships with titles in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012 — added that someone close to her likened her to a “master at the psychological game of life…”\n\n“I don’t know if that’s true…. I do know hard days are coming but I will find a way back to the top of the mountain of life,” she concluded.\n\nOn Feb. 8, just 13 seconds into her run in the women’s downhill event during the Milan Cortina Games, Vonn suffered a horrifying crash one week after tearing her ACL.\n\nAfter approximately 15 minutes of medical staff tending to the skier, she was placed on a stability board before being airlifted by helicopter to a hospital.\n\n\"Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would,\" Vonn said, breaking her silence on social media the following day. \"It wasn’t a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\"\n\nElsewhere in her lengthy Feb. 9 Instagram post, the Olympian said her \"ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever,\" adding that she \"sustained a complex tibia fracture\" that would “require multiple surgeries to fix properly.\"\n\nLast week, following her fifth surgery, Vonn confessed that she was “struggling a bit” due to “the extent of the trauma.”\n\nIn keeping with her promise to keep her fans updated on her recovery, on Monday, Feb. 23, she said the crash was so bad that it almost resulted in her leg being amputated.\n\n\"After two weeks, I finally made it out of the hospital. It has been quite the journey and by far the most extreme and painful and challenging injury I've ever faced in my entire life times one hundred. I'll give you the full rundown,\" Vonn said in her Instagram video.\n\nShe added that because of her complex tibia fracture, in which “everything was in pieces,\" including her \"muscles, nerves and tendons,” extreme measures needed to be taken.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n\"Dr. Tom Hackett saved my leg. He saved my leg from being amputated,\" she said, becoming emotional.\n\nVonn, who won a gold medal at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games in the women's downhill event, is expected to be in a wheelchair for the next couple of months as she recovers. However, she ended her video on a positive note.\n\n\"It's going to be a long road, but I always fight,\" she said. \"I'll keep going. No regrets. I just appreciate all the love and support. It's been amazing. Overwhelming to an extent. I wish it had ended differently, really, but I'd rather go down swinging than not trying at all.\"",

    "fullText": "Closed mouths don't get fed. Shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll be amongst the stars. Whatever your favorite saying may be, apply it to contract negotiations in the NFL. On Tuesday, it was revealed that Cowboys restricted free agent Brandon Aubrey, the best kicker in the league, is looking to reset the kicker market in a major way.\n\nNot only is he looking to surpass the average salary of the current highest-paid kicker. That's certainly to be expected and is the basis for Cowboys Wire's prediction of a four-year extension for Aubrey. However word emerged on Tuesday that he doesn't just plan to surpass the $6.4 million per-year ceiling established by Kansas City's Harrison Butker, but obliterate it.\n\nDallas Morning News' Calvin Watkins is reporting that Aubrey turned down the club's $7.5 million a year offer is seeking a $10 million per year salary.\n\nThe Cowboys offered Aubrey the largest contract for a kicker in NFL history, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.\n\nAubrey, a restricted free agent, was offered a deal with an average salary of close to $7.5 million but is looking for nearly $10 million per season.\n\nAubrey is represented by Todd France, the agent who got Dak Prescott $5 million more a season than Joe Burrow was making atop the QB totem pole.\n\nFortunately for the Cowboys, they don't have to acquiesce. As Aubrey is a restricted free agent, the Cowboys have a lot of control over the situation, though not total.\n\nDallas will be given the opportunity to place one of two (three actually, but the third is unrealistic) tenders on Aubrey that would guarantee him a one-year salary. Aubrey would still be able to shop for a deal elsewhere, but if he signed an offer sheet with another team, the Cowboys would be allowed to match the offer.\n\nIf Dallas refused to match, the acquiring club would have to send the Cowboys either a first or second-round pick, depending on the amount of the Cowboys' tender.\n\nIf Dallas offered Aubrey a $5.8 million tender for 2026, an acquiring team would have to send the Cowboys a second-round pick. If Dallas offered Aubrey an $8.1 million tender, the acquiring team would have to send the Cowboys a first-round pick.\n\nIn many situations, where a tender is placed but the player doesn't want to return, a trade for slightly less compensation is often worked out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Cowboys FA Aubrey looking to make kicker a 7-figure salary position",

    "description": "The LA Galaxy return to Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday to face Panamanian club Sporting San Miguelito in the second leg of the opening round of Concacaf Champions Cup.",
    "fullText": "After a frustrating draw with NYCFC that felt more like a loss Sunday, the LA Galaxy are back in action at Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday night. This time, for the second leg of their Concacaf Champions Cup opening round against Sporting San Miguelito.\n\nAfter the first leg, LA hold the advantage, last week's 1-1 draw in Panama means a win, or any scoreless draw, sends the Galaxy through to the round of 16, where Jamaican club Mt. Pleasant, the 2025 Caribbean Cup champion, awaits.\n\nIn Concacaf Champions Cup play, the away goals rule acts as the primary tiebreaker for two-legged knockout rounds (Round One through Semifinals). If the aggregate score is tied after two legs, the team with more away goals advances. If away goals are also equal, the tie goes directly to penalties.\n\nBut as head coach Greg Vanney made clear, the away goal conceded in the first leg makes this a precarious lead.\n\n“I think it's really up to them. It's a catch-22,” Vanney said of San Miguelito’s approach. “Ninety minutes is a long time, so I don't think you necessarily have to come out flying... It's really up to us to have the solution to whichever way they come.”\n\nFor a Galaxy side still trying to find its rhythm, that unpredictability is the central challenge. The team returned from Panama and looked sharp early against NYCFC, with new striker João Klauss scoring inside two minutes. But as Vanney noted, that sharpness faded.\n\nYour @LARiotSquad Player of the Match, João Klauss ⭐️ pic.twitter.com/2uKGPBkqbA\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 24, 2026\n\n“We haven't had two back-to-back training sessions in a row since somewhere in Coachella,” Vanney explained. “We're actually trying to evolve a little bit inside of these games and solve some different looks.”\n\nThe \"look\" in Panama was a disciplined, bunkered approach from San Miguelito that the Galaxy couldn't fully break down, surrendering a goal that gave the visitors a precious away tally.\n\nThe \"look\" against NYCFC was a high press that the Galaxy solved early, only to stall after going down to ten men following a lengthy VAR review. The result was another draw, leaving the Galaxy with more questions than answers.\n\nNext up: @TheChampions at home on wednesday ⏭️ pic.twitter.com/aUmWrPJrLN\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 23, 2026\n\n“We got off to a great start, and we just didn't deal with the ball well. I thought we defended really well for large stretches,” Vanney reflected on the NYCFC match. “We're evolving, and tomorrow is another opportunity to take a step.”\n\nThat step will require the Galaxy to dictate the tempo against a San Miguelito team that now has a clear objective: find a goal and hunker down defensively.\n\nVanney believes these dense, high-stakes fixtures are the perfect classroom for his squad.\n\n“What's beautiful about these moments is the team is facing different challenges,” he said. “Playing against a low block in Panama, your team has to change its mentality because they have to add speed into the game with the ball... These are great opportunities for our guys that are going to build a solid foundation.”\n\nThe Galaxy's midfield is slowly getting replenished, Vanney told reporters Isaiah Parente and Elijah Wynder are progressing and could be \"part of the group\" on Wednesday. He added Erik Thommy could make his debut Saturday against Charlotte and defender Chris Rindov was \"a little further behind\"\n\nKickoff is set for 8:30 p.m. from Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nLocation: Dignity Health Sports Park, Carson, Calif.\n\nRadio: LA Galaxy Youtube Channel.",

    "fullText": "The NFL has revealed that one of the more controversial calls from the Pittsburgh Steelers' 2025 season — Aaron Rodgers' near-interception ruled catch in Week 14 — was an officiating mistake.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Talk's Michael David Smith, a league spokesman confirmed that the replay review of Rodgers' Week 14 catch was incorrect and it should've been ruled as an interception made by Baltimore Ravens linebacker Teddye Buchanan.\n\nWith the Steelers leading the Ravens 27-22 with around six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Rodgers' pass attempt was batted down by Ravens defensive tackle C.J. Okoye and was ruled an interception by Buchanan. Replay review overturned the play in favor of Pittsburgh.\n\nAdditionally, NFL Executive VP of Football Operations Troy Vincent suggested that another replay reversal from the game, on Isaiah Likely's touchdown, was also wrong. Lamar Jackson quickly took to social media to celebrate the report.\n\nSo technically we won? 10-7 1st offseason win ever🤣🤣 https://t.co/vGbkhWJ4Fo\n\n— Lamar Jackson (@Lj_era8) February 24, 2026\n\nIt hardly matters whether or not Rodgers was intercepted or Likely caught the touchdown two months later, but it's interesting timing as the league criticizes calls with the NFLRA collective bargaining agreement set to expire in a few months.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, including any offseason moves, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers' Aaron Rodgers subject of recent NFL officiating controversy",

    "description": "San Francisco might be in trouble.",
    "fullText": "How the 49ers' contract dispute with Trent Williams could impact the NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers cannot afford to lose Canton-bound left tackle Trent Williams.\n\nThe only problem is that they cannot afford to pay him, either.\n\nSan Francisco is dealing with the consequences of an aging roster and an unfulfilled competitive window. With stars demanding raises and a Super Bowl in sight, the 49ers have kicked the cap can down the road long enough. It has come back to bite them, and as Williams inches closer to free agency, San Francisco may have to look to the NFL Draft for his replacement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Adam Schefter reported that releasing Williams is on the table.\n\n\"With five-time All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams scheduled to carry a $39 million cap number this season, he and the 49ers currently are struggling to find a contractual solution, per league sources,\" he posted. \"If the two sides can’t bridge their differences in their standoff, Williams would be expected to join this year’s free-agent class, making him one of the premier players available.\"\n\nOf course, that's not a guarantee of Williams' departure. But Williams is perhaps the most valuable offensive lineman in the sport, appearing bulletproof into his late-30s. He's a stalwart in the game's preeminent rushing attack. And as a crux of Kyle Shanahan's scheme, there's reason to believe the 49ers view the position at a premium.\n\nThe first and most obvious pivot from Williams is an early-round selection in the 2026 NFL Draft. In a tackle class that has fallen short of expectations, a handful of candidates have fallen toward the back of Round 1.\n\nAmong them is Alabama's Kadyn Proctor. At 360 pounds, there are questions about how consistently his athleticism will play at the next level, but high-level play against SEC defensive lines has kept his stock high. Elsewhere, Caleb Lomu held down the blindside for Utah's elite offensive line, offering a more natural fit into Shanahan's zone scheme (at least physically). He's a work in progress as a run blocker, but a first-round pass protector with traits that inspire upside.\n\nLate in Round 1, San Francisco is also in range to capture upward momentum on a prospect like Monroe Freeling, who is bound to rise when athletic testing becomes the most recent source of information.\n\nMORE: 49ers get bad news on Trent Williams amid looming $39 million decision\n\nTaking a first-round tackle could reverberate throughout the NFL's toughest division. The Los Angeles Rams are unsteady at offensive tackle. Right tackle Rob Havenstein has retired, and Warren McClendon Jr. isn't necessarily the long-term answer in his place. The positional difference could render this moot, but the 49ers pick before Los Angeles' second pick in the first round.\n\nThere's a world in which the Rams lose out on their preferred tackle prospect because the 49ers feel they can turn Blake Miller -- or a similarly-valued prospect -- into their franchise left tackle.\n\nFurthermore, it may become clear that replacing Williams isn't a one-man job, but a structural one. San Francisco isn't drafting an upgrade at left tackle in Round 1. Baking in that regression could mean a greater emphasis on other positions, like drafting a receiver for Brandon Aiyuk's vacant snaps or a defensive X-factor to compensate for a step back offensively.\n\nUltimately, teams do an excellent job of keeping their best players in-house for as long as possible. There's little reason why Williams should retire in another team's jersey, and he's enough of a difference-maker to gamble on, even at 37 years old. Losing Williams would be the biggest transaction of San Francisco's offseason, leaving awfully big shoes to fill for whoever the 49ers take at No. 27.\n\nKyle Shanahan has slim pickings to develop next castoff quarterback\n\n49ers get good news on Mac Jones trade rumors\n\nA.J. Brown's best trade fits, from Steelers to Patriots\n\nTrade proposal sends Mac Jones to Steelers for 7.5-sack pass rusher",

    "fullText": "An Italian athlete who competed in the 2026 Winter Olympics pulled out before his competition was over\n\nTommaso Giacomel underwent heart surgery after “struggling to breath and to move” during the sporting event\n\nThe 25-year-old biathlete is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital later this week, according to the Italian Winter Sports Federation\n\nAn Olympic athlete who competed in the Milan Cortina Games has undergone heart surgery just days after forfeiting.\n\nItalian biathlete Tommaso Giacomel is set to be discharged from Milan's Galeazzi Hospital on Thursday, Feb. 26 following an ablation procedure that was described as a “complete success,” the Italian Winter Sports Federation (FISI) announced Tuesday, Feb. 24.\n\nDays before the FISI shared the update, the 25-year-old athlete shared a post to social media explaining why he felt the need to withdraw from his final ​​biathlon race at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\n“Right after the second prone my body somehow stopped working properly and I was really struggling to breath and to move, therefore I had to stop. Worst feeling I have ever experienced in my life so far,” he wrote in a lengthy Instagram post.\n\nGiacomel’s single photo upload was a selfie of him in a hospital bed with several medical sensors attached to his exposed chest.\n\n“I tried to ski really slow the first part of the third lap but my body wasn’t allowing me to ski anymore,” he continued.\n\nThe athlete added that in the moment, he felt “frustration, anger, [and] disappointment.”\n\n“It’s devastating. It’s devastating to stop but there wasn’t anything I could do against my own body today. Absolutely not the end of the games I was hoping for but I will never give up. 4 years fly by fast and I will try again in France,” Giacomel said.\n\nHe ended his post by letting his supporters know that doctors would continue running medical checks in the coming days to find the root cause of his health issues.\n\n“Get well soon, Tommy! You’ll come back stronger,” the official account for the International Biathlon Union commented.\n\n​​Biathlon is a winter sport that merges cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. It began in 19th-century Scandinavia, originating in ski warfare, and developed from the sport of military patrol.\n\nOn Tuesday, the FISI said their organization’s medical commission completed a series of diagnostic tests on Giacomel in collaboration with Professor Daniele Andreini.\n\nGiacomel “underwent a CT scan, an MRI scan, and a maximal exercise test, all of which were normal.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“A subsequent electrophysiological study revealed an atrial conduction abnormality, which recommended a subsequent ablation, which has already been performed and was a complete success,” the FISI said.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the hospital on Thursday, the Italian athlete who has competed in the Biathlon World Cup since 2019, will have routine check-ups in two weeks.\n\nGiacomel is expected to return to regular training following the completion of those check-ups, FISI said.",

The victory sparked celebrations across the country, but the team went viral after FBI Director Kash Patel was seen celebrating in their locker room and later calling President Donald Trump on the phone so that he could congratulate the athletes and invite them to his State of the Union address.\n\nHowever, the president earned a bit of backlash when a video of the call caught him begrudgingly telling the gold medal-winning team, “I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team,” adding that he “probably would be impeached” if he didn’t invite them. The Women’s U.S. Hockey Team also brought home the gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nWhile the majority of the men’s team made the trip Tuesday to Washington, D.C., visiting Trump at the White House before the SOTU address, five players notably did not attend.\n\nJake Guentzel of the Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nBrock Nelson of the Colorado Avalanche\n\nKyle Connor of the Winnipeg Jets\n\nJake Oettinger of the Dallas Stars\n\nJackson LaCombe of the Anaheim Ducks\n\nMost of the players just returned to their respective homes ahead of more games in the upcoming NHL season. It was reported that Nelson wanted to spend time with family before more travel with the Avalanche in the coming days.\n\nTrump did end up inviting the women’s hockey team as well, but they declined, citing “timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments” for missing the State of the Union.\n\n“We are sincerely grateful for the invitation extended to our gold medal-winning U.S. Women’s Hockey Team and deeply appreciate the recognition of their extraordinary achievement,” a USA Hockey spokesperson said. “Due to the timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games, the athletes are unable to participate.”\n\nThe majority of the players that ended up making the trip to D.C. on Trump’s invite went on a tour of the White House. They snapped photos on the grounds, looked through the West Wing and then got more pictures with President Trump in the Oval Office while sporting USA sweaters and their Olympic gold medals.\n\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) February 24, 2026\n\nThe post Here’s Which US Men’s Hockey Players Skipped the State of the Union Address appeared first on TheWrap.",

Santos is now set to clash with Guto Inocente in one of the opening round matchups for the 16-man tournament that also features Anthony Smith coming out of retirement to face Chase Sherman on the same card.\n\nPromotion officials confirmed the news to MMA Fighting on Tuesday.\n\nUsman’s exit comes after he was released from the UFC following news that he was facing an 18-month suspension for violating the company’s anti-doping policy.\n\nWith Usman out, Santos takes his place after booking his first fight since 2024 when he faced Denis Goltsov in the PFL. At his peak, Santos ranked as one of the top light heavyweights in the UFC, which included his run for the title when he took Jon Jones to a split decision back at UFC 239 in 2019.\n\nUnfortunately after his razor-close fight against Jones, Santos struggled to get back on track with a 1-7 record with one no contest over his next nine fights.\n\nBut Santos attempts to right the ship when he returns in April to face Inocente in an opening round matchup for the Gamebred FC heavyweight tournament.\n\nThe event takes place in the Dominican Republic with the card airing live on Masvidal’s YouTube channel in April.",

They won their ninth championship in franchise history and third in six years.\n\nEven with all of the success during the mid-way point of the decade, manager Dave Roberts is still more excited about what's ahead compared to their past victories.\n\n\"I'm more excited about this year than I was last year or the year prior...

    "fullText": "It’s that time again, time for the annual NFL Scouting Combine, where the top players in college football who have declared for the NFL draft and are specifically invited are brought to Indianapolis, Indiana’s Lucas Oil Stadium. Each player is then run through a variety of drills and tests based on their position, unless they opt out of a certain phase of the testing. The individual teams’ staff also hold personal interviews with various players that they may be interested in drafting during the annual NFL draft held the following April.\n\nThe Combine can make or break an individual player’s draft status and where they are actually selected. Even the highest-rated players can damage their draft stock with poor testing numbers or a poor personal interview. The reverse is also true: guys who are assumed to be picked much later before the combine can move up the draft, sometimes by a substantial amount, if they are better than expected in their testing and interviews.\n\nWith all of that in mind, this evening’s question is something that I have wondered and at times for sure believed as a long-time (like a very long time) Miami Dolphins fan. So this evening’s question of the day is:\n\nDo you think that our own Miami Dolphins or even the NFL in general has, in the past, relied too much on combine numbers and interviews as opposed to what the players have put on tape in college, in the past, when deciding who to draft, especially in the higher rounds?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

    "fullText": "No. 2 Oregon Responds with Statement Win Over No. 3 Quinnipiac\n\nThe second-ranked Oregon acrobatics and tumbling team delivered a sharper, more complete performance in its home opener Saturday, defeating No. 3 Quinnipiac, 270.640–265.425, at Matthew Knight Arena.\n\nOregon set the tone immediately. A perfect 10.0 in the toss heat of the compulsory event gave the Ducks an early edge, and they controlled the meet from start to finish in a wire-to-wire victory between two top-three programs.\n\nThe win marked clear progress from Oregon’s season-opening score of 267.325 at Missouri State. The Ducks improved by more than three points overall and saw a significant jump in the team event, climbing from 89.100 to 92.290.\n\nHow It Happened\nOregon opened strong in compulsory, winning three of four heats. The highlight came in toss, where the Ducks earned the program’s first perfect 10.0 in the skill since 2020. The side-by-side precision of two quintets delivered the milestone score: Shea Barnes, Kamryn Horiuchi, Charlotte Lippa, Ashlyn Parlett and Emily Rezner; and Selah Bell, Molly Dahlager, Makenna Guidish, Angelica Martin and Blessyn McMorris.\n\nThe Ducks exited the opening event with a 38.000–37.700 lead and built on it in acro, outscoring Quinnipiac 65.100–63.300. Cassidy Cu and Angelica Martin anchored the effort with a 9.800 in the five-element heat and a 9.750 in the seven-element heat.\n\nEveryone's effort! #GoDucks | #Power pic.twitter.com/aaYoucAVUI\n\n— Oregon Acro&Tumbling (@OregonAcroTumb) February 22, 2026\n\nOregon maintained a narrow advantage after pyramid, leading 94.300–92.350. Quinnipiac gained ground in toss, but the Ducks responded in tumbling. Nya Womack posted a 9.800 in the aerial pass, and Morgan Willingham matched that mark in the six-element pass, helping Oregon steady its momentum.\n\nEntering the team event with a slim 178.350–177.175 lead, the Ducks closed emphatically. Oregon outscored the Bobcats 92.290–88.250 in the final event to secure the five-point victory.\n\nUp Next\nOregon hits the road next Saturday for a marquee matchup at No. 1 Baylor, scheduled for 3 p.m.\n\nErickson Blazes to Indoor PR, Ducks Put Two Under 1:47 at Arkansas Qualifier\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Matthew Erickson continued to build momentum toward the postseason Friday night, racing to an indoor personal best of 1:45.93 in the 800 meters at the Arkansas Qualifier.\n\nNew PBs for the 800m men.\nMatti Erickson 1:45.93 (PB, UO No. 2 All-Time)\nJames Harding: 1:46.44 (PB, UO No. 4 All-Time)#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/rfGBlAo1ol\n\n— oregontf (@OregonTF) February 21, 2026\n\nThe reigning NCAA indoor champion finished second overall and became just the second man in Oregon history to break 1:46 indoors, joining school-record holder Charlie Hunter (1:45.59). Based on marks entering the weekend, Erickson moves to No. 7 on the NCAA descending order list.\n\nJames Harding added to the Ducks’ strong showing, clocking a lifetime best of 1:46.44 to place third. His performance elevates him into the top 16 nationally and improves his standing in Oregon’s record book, moving from sixth to fourth all-time indoors. Harding bettered his previous season best of 1:46.83, set earlier this year at the Razorback Invitational.\n\nWith the qualifying window open through conference weekend, the top 16 declared individuals in each event and top 12 relays will advance to the NCAA Indoor Championships, set for March 13–14 in Fayetteville.\n\nFriday Results\nArkansas Qualifier (Fayetteville, Ark.)\nMEN\n800 Meters\n2. Matthew Erickson – 1:45.93 (PB, UO #2*)\n3. James Harding – 1:46.44 (PB, UO #4)\n*already held that ranking, improved mark\n\nOregon DMR Rewrites Record Book, Climbs to No. 2 in NCAA\n\nBOSTON — Oregon’s men’s distance medley relay delivered a historic performance Sunday night, breaking the school record and surging to No. 2 on the NCAA descending order list at the Saucony Battle in Boston.\n\nCompeting at Boston University’s Track & Tennis Center, the quartet of Simeon Birnbaum, Fuad Omer, Elliott Cook and Tomas Palfrey combined for a blistering 9:14.88, making them the second-fastest collegiate DMR team in history.\n\nDQ Friday ➡️ School record Sunday. \nTom Palfrey brings home the Ducks for redemption. #GoDucks pic.twitter.com/RfSbLxIlhw\n\n— oregontf (@OregonTF) February 23, 2026\n\nThe Ducks’ time marks a significant milestone. Oregon becomes just the second program ever to run sub-9:15 on a banked, 200-meter track, joining Virginia, which clocked 9:14.19 earlier this season. Overall, only four programs in NCAA history have broken 9:15 indoors.\n\nSunday’s effort eclipsed the previous school record of 9:17.57, set at last year’s NCAA Indoor Championships in Virginia Beach. Cook, Omer and Palfrey were also members of that record-setting squad, making this latest performance both a breakthrough and a continuation of Oregon’s distance tradition.\n\nThe race proved to be one of the fastest in the country this season. Based on marks entering the meet, three of the top five times nationally were produced Sunday, including Virginia Tech at 9:15.05 and Virginia at 9:16.75.\n\nThe performance came just two days after Oregon competed at the Arkansas Qualifier, underscoring the group’s depth and resilience during a demanding weekend.\n\nWith the NCAA qualifying window open through conference weekend, the top 12 relays will advance to the NCAA Indoor Championships, set for March 13–14 in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

    "fullText": "Note: I currently work with a Payments Engineering team and wrote this as we are introducing spec-driven development into our development workflow.\n\nIf you've used an AI coding tool in the last year, you've probably had the experience: you describe what you want, the AI generates something that looks right, you run it, and... it doesn't quite work. You refine your prompt. The AI fixes one thing and breaks another. Three iterations later you're debugging code you didn't write and don't fully understand.\n\nThis is the failure mode of what Andrej Karpathy called \"vibe coding\" and it's become the default way most developers interact with AI. Spec driven development (SDD) is the emerging counter movement. Instead of throwing prompts at an LLM and hoping for the best, you write a structured specification first, then let the AI implement against it.\n\nThe idea isn't new. We've been writing requirements documents since forever, but the tooling is new. Tools like GitHub's Spec Kit, Amazon's Kiro, and Fission AI's OpenSpec are attempting to formalize this workflow into something repeatable. Whether that formalization helps or hinders depends entirely on what you're building, how you're building it, and the tradeoffs you're willing to make.\n\nOur team uses OpenSpec, so most of the practical examples in this post come from that experience. But the principles apply regardless of which tool you pick.\n\nThe pitch for AI assisted coding is attractive: describe what you want in English and get working code back. And for simple tasks, a helper function, a config change, renaming a module, it works remarkably well. The challenges starts when changes aren't trivial but require edits to multiple files or packages/modules.\n\nThe core issue is context loss. When you're five prompts deep into a feature, the AI has no persistent memory of the architectural decisions you made in prompt one. It doesn't know you chose a specific idempotency strategy for a reason. It doesn't remember that you explicitly avoided storing raw card data outside the tokenization boundary. Every new prompt starts from a partial view of the world, and the AI fills in the gaps with whatever patterns it's seen most in training data.\n\nIn payments systems, this produces particularly dangerous failures. Reconciliation logic scattered across three different modules because each prompt generated its own approach. A refund handler that doesn't account for partial captures. Currency conversion applied twice because the AI didn't know about the upstream normalization step. And perhaps most critically in our domain, security flaws: API keys committed to source, missing input validation on transaction amounts, authorization checks that live on the client instead of the server. Studies have found that roughly 45% of AI generated code contains security vulnerabilities. In a payments context, that's more than just a bug but a compliance issue.\n\nThe other failure is architectural drift. Without a shared plan, each prompt/response cycle makes locally reasonable decisions that are globally incoherent. The AI can't refactor itself out of architectural problems it doesn't understand. You ask it to add retry logic to a payment gateway call and it builds a standalone retry mechanism, unaware that you already have a circuit breaker pattern in your infrastructure layer. Once the codebase reaches a certain size, the context window can only see fragments of it. You end up with a system that processes transactions but that nobody, including the AI, fully understands anymore.\n\nThis isn't the AI being dumb. It's the natural consequence of building without a map.\n\nAt its simplest, spec driven development means: write down what you're building before you write the code, and make that written artifact the thing your AI agent works from.\n\nThat might sound like waterfall but It's not, or at least, it doesn't have to be. The key differences are timescale and scope. Traditional waterfall specs were project level documents written over weeks and often carved in stone. SDD specs are feature level documents written in minutes and meant to evolve. You're not planning an entire system upfront; you're planning the next meaningful chunk of work in enough detail that an AI can implement it without guessing.\n\nA typical SDD workflow looks like this:\n\nYou're not writing all of this yourself. You describe the intent in natural language, and the AI generates the spec artifacts: the proposal, the requirements, the design, the task breakdown. Your job is to review, refine, and correct. You steer and the AI does the heavy lifting. This is what makes the process fast enough to be practical. Writing a 200 line spec by hand for every feature would be painful. Having the AI draft it in 30 seconds and then spending 5 minutes reviewing and adjusting it is a different proposition entirely.\n\nThe spec becomes a persistent artifact, a \"super prompt\" that doesn't disappear when your chat session ends. It lives in version control alongside your code. When the AI drifts, you point it back to the spec. When requirements change, you update the spec and regenerate.\n\nThe fundamental shift is that the specification becomes the source of truth, and code becomes the derived artifact. Traditional documentation describes code that already exists. SDD inverts that relationship. You define the behaviour, constraints, and architecture in the spec, and the AI produces code that conforms to it. The spec isn't something you write after the fact to explain what was built but the input that determines what gets built. Code is the output.\n\nThree tools have emerged as the most prominent in this space. Each takes a different philosophical approach.\n\nSpec Kit is an open source CLI from GitHub that scaffolds a spec driven workflow into your existing project. It's agent agnostic, working with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others. The workflow follows rigid phases driven by slash commands: /speckit.constitution to establish project principles, /speckit.specify to create feature specs, /speckit.plan for a technical plan, /speckit.tasks for work items, and /speckit.implement to execute.\n\nStrengths: Thorough documentation output, the \"constitution\" concept for project wide principles, works with many agents.\n\nWeaknesses: Heavyweight. Sometimes it get generate a lot of artifacts for simple changes. Rigid phase gates mean you can't easily jump back and forth between planning and implementing.\n\nKiro is a full IDE (a VS Code fork) with spec driven development baked into the editing experience. The workflow follows a similar shape (requirements → design → tasks → implement) but is tightly integrated with the editor. It generates user stories with acceptance criteria, creates technical design documents, and produces task lists. It also introduces \"Hooks,\" user defined prompts triggered by file changes.\n\nStrengths: Most polished integrated experience. The Hooks system is excellent and something you'd have to configure manually if you decide to do it on your own. No context switching between planning and editing because of the IDE integration.\n\nWeaknesses: You're locked into their IDE and limited to Claude models. Can be overkill for small changes. One developer reported a simple bug fix generating 4 user stories with 16 acceptance criteria. The overhead can be significant.\n\nOpenSpec is the most lightweight of the three. It's a TypeScript CLI with a fluid, iterative workflow and no rigid phase gates. Where Spec Kit enforces a strict sequence and Kiro wraps everything in an IDE, OpenSpec gets out of your way and lets you move between planning artifacts freely.\n\nIts distinguishing philosophy is \"brownfield first.\" While the other tools are optimized for building new things from scratch, OpenSpec is designed to work with existing codebases. Each change produces a \"spec delta,\" a document that captures what's being added, modified, or removed relative to the existing system. Over time, these deltas merge into a living specification that reflects the current state of the system.\n\nOpenSpec also handles change history better. Every completed change is archived with its full artifact set: the original proposal, the spec deltas, the design, and the task list. This means you can go back and see not just what changed in the system, but why it changed, what alternatives were considered in the design, and what the original acceptance criteria were. Spec Kit and Kiro generate artifacts during planning but don't have the same structured archive and merge cycle. In OpenSpec, the openspec/changes/archive/ directory becomes a chronological record of every significant change to the system, and the openspec/specs/ directory is always the merged, current truth. For regulated environments where auditability matters, this distinction is significant.\n\nStrengths: Works with 20+ AI tools including Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, and many others. The brownfield focus is valuable in our context as most real work is on existing codebases. Fluid workflow lets you update any artifact at any time and you are not forced into a linear way of working. The archive/merge cycle produces both a living spec and an auditable change history.\n\nWeaknesses: Less hand holding in the spec writing process is the trade-off it makes while allowing you to navigate back-and-forth between spec and implementation. The tool is newer and the ecosystem is still growing.\n\nOpenSpec requires Node.js 20.19.0 or higher.\n\nThen navigate to your project directory and initialize:\n\nThe init process will ask which AI tool you're using and configure the appropriate slash commands or agent instructions for your environment.\n\nOpenSpec also works with pnpm, yarn, bun, and nix. See the official installation docs for alternative paths.\n\nThen refresh agent instructions in each project:\n\nUnderstanding the full lifecycle of an OpenSpec change is worth the time, because the artifacts it generates serve different roles on the team in different ways.\n\nOpenSpec's workflow is built around the opsx slash commands. Here's the complete set, the ones you interact with the most are bolded:\n\nThe typical flow is new → ff → apply → archive, but the power of OpenSpec is that you can break out of that sequence at any point. Need to revisit the design after you've started implementing? Just edit design.md. Want to add acceptance criteria while coding? Update the spec delta. There are no phase gates forcing you to \"finish\" one stage before moving to another.\n\nOne of the first decisions in any OpenSpec workflow is how you enter it. There are two entry points, and choosing the right one makes a real difference in the quality of what comes out the other side.\n\n/opsx:new is for when you know what you're building. You have a clear feature in mind, you understand the requirements well enough to describe them, and you're ready to start generating planning artifacts. Maybe you've already discussed this in a planning meeting. Maybe you've built something similar before. Maybe the ticket is well defined and you just need to formalize it. In these cases, /opsx:new add-feature-name followed by /opsx:ff gets you from zero to a full set of planning documents in minutes.\n\nThis works well when the problem space is familiar and constraints are understood. You've implemented retry logic before, you know the gateway's behavior, you just need to formalize it.\n\n/opsx:explore is for when you're still figuring things out. Maybe you have a vague idea but the requirements aren't clear. Maybe you're investigating a production anomaly and you don't know where the root cause is yet. Maybe a stakeholder said \"we need to support instant payments\" and you need to figure out what that actually means for your settlement architecture before you can spec anything.\n\nExplore opens a broader, open ended conversation with the AI before any change folder is created and before any artifacts are generated. There's no structure imposed, no proposal template to fill out, no pressure to define acceptance criteria. You're just thinking out loud with an assistant that has context on your codebase.\n\nThe explore conversation might last five minutes or an hour. It might branch into several tangents before converging on a clear problem statement. That's intentional. You're doing the messy, nonlinear thinking that produces good requirements, and you're doing it before the spec exists rather than discovering gaps during implementation.\n\nThis is also where existing requirements documents from business analysts become valuable. In payments organizations, BAs often produce detailed feature requirements independently of any SDD tool: field mapping spreadsheets, business rule matrices, sample ISO 20022 payloads (pain.001, pain.008, pacs.008), regulatory constraint documents, and workflow diagrams. These artifacts are the raw material that explore turns into actionable specs.\n\nRather than asking the AI to invent requirements from scratch, you feed it the BA's work:\n\nThe explore phase becomes a bridge between the BA's domain knowledge and the engineering reality of the codebase. The BA doesn't need to know about your GenServer architecture or your Ecto schema conventions. The developer doesn't need to memorize the ISO 20022 payload structure. Explore lets both perspectives converge into a proposal that reflects both business intent and technical feasibility.\n\nWhen you've reached clarity, you transition naturally into the structured workflow:\n\nNow the proposal and specs will be grounded in both the BA's requirements and the technical understanding you built during exploration, rather than being generated from a one line prompt.\n\nUse /opsx:new when you can describe the feature or fix in a sentence and you're confident in the scope. Use /opsx:explore when any of the following are true: you're unsure what the root cause of a problem is, the requirements are ambiguous or underspecified, you need to evaluate multiple approaches before committing to one, or you want to pressure test an idea before investing in formal planning. In practice, we find ourselves using explore more often than we initially expected. The few minutes spent thinking before speccing consistently produce better specs, which in turn produce better code.\n\nWhen you run /opsx:new add-idempotent-refunds, OpenSpec creates a change directory:\n\nRunning /opsx:ff (or stepping through with /opsx:continue) generates the planning artifacts:\n\nEach of these artifacts has a specific purpose and a specific audience. Let's look at what goes into them.\n\nproposal.md is the \"why\" document. It describes the motivation for the change, the scope of what's included and excluded, and any constraints or dependencies. This is the document you'd share in a planning meeting or attach to a ticket. It answers the question: \"Why are we doing this, and what does 'done' look like at a high level?\" For a refunds feature, this might capture that the driver is duplicate refund incidents costing the business money, that the scope includes full and partial refunds but excludes chargebacks, and that the constraint is backwards compatibility with the existing refund API contract.\n\nspecs/ contains the spec delta, the functional requirements for this specific change. Requirements are marked as ADDED, MODIFIED, or REMOVED relative to the current system. Each requirement uses structured language (\"The system SHALL...\") with clear acceptance criteria and scenarios. This is where edge cases live. This is where you define what happens when a refund is submitted with the same idempotency key as a previous request, what the system does when the gateway returns a timeout mid refund, or how partial refunds interact with the original transaction's settlement status.\n\ndesign.md is the technical blueprint. It covers the data model, API contracts, component architecture, sequence flows, and any technology choices specific to this feature. For the refunds example, it's where you'd document the idempotency key storage strategy, the state machine transitions for refund lifecycle, and the gateway adapter interface for multi acquirer support.\n\ntasks.md breaks the work into discrete, ordered implementation steps. Each task is small enough to verify independently, ideally something that can be implemented in under 30 minutes. Tasks have clear completion criteria so both the developer and the AI know when they're done.\n\nWhen all tasks are complete and verified, /opsx:archive does something important: it merges the spec deltas from the change back into the main openspec/specs/ directory. The change folder moves to openspec/changes/archive/, preserving the history. The main specs now reflect the updated state of the system.\n\nThis is the mechanism that turns specs into a living document. After a dozen features have been built and archived, openspec/specs/ contains a comprehensive, up to date description of what the system does. Not what it was designed to do originally, but what it actually does right now.\n\nOne of the underappreciated aspects of spec driven development is that the artifacts aren't just for the developer writing the code. They create value across every role that touches the project.\n\nThe immediate benefit is implementation quality. Instead of translating a vague Jira ticket into code via a series of increasingly frustrated prompts, you're working from a spec that already captures requirements, edge cases, and technical decisions. The AI produces better code because it has better context. You spend less time debugging and reworking because misunderstandings surface during spec review, not during code review.\n\nThe longer term benefit is onboarding and maintenance. When you come back to a feature six months later, or when a new developer joins the team, the spec explains not just what the code does but why it was built that way. The proposal captures the business motivation. The design doc captures the technical rationale. The spec captures the behavioral contract.\n\nThe proposal and spec artifacts are written in structured natural language, not code. A BA or PM can read proposal.md and immediately understand the scope, motivation, and acceptance criteria for a change without needing to parse a pull request.\n\nMore importantly, they can contribute to these documents. If the spec says \"The system SHALL retry failed direct debit collections up to 3 times\" and the BA knows the scheme rules mandate a maximum of 2 retries with specific interval requirements, they can flag that in the spec before any code is written. The spec becomes a shared contract between product and engineering, reviewable by both sides.\n\nBAs in payments organizations often produce detailed requirements documents that exist outside of any development tool: field mapping spreadsheets between internal formats and ISO 20022 messages, business rule matrices for transaction routing, sample payloads for pain.001 or pacs.008 messages, regulatory constraint documents, and scheme specific validation rules. These documents don't need to be rewritten into OpenSpec format. Instead, they serve as input to the /opsx:explore conversation and as reference material that the proposal and specs can point to. The spec might say \"Field mappings follow the BA's pain.008 mapping document (see docs/ba-requirements/sepa-dd-field-mappings.xlsx)\" rather than duplicating that content. OpenSpec captures the engineering requirements; the BA's documents capture the domain requirements. The two reference each other.\n\nFor teams practicing any kind of requirements analysis, the spec delta format (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED) maps naturally to how BAs think about change impact. You can see at a glance exactly what existing behavior is changing and what's new.\n\nThe specs are essentially test plans waiting to happen. Each requirement with its acceptance criteria maps directly to test cases. \"WHEN a refund is submitted with an idempotency key matching a previously completed refund, THEN the system SHALL return the original refund response without processing a duplicate\" is a test case in all but name.\n\nQA can review specs before implementation begins, catching gaps in test coverage at the cheapest possible point in the development cycle. In payments, where edge cases around timeouts, partial failures, and concurrent operations are where bugs hide, having QA eyes on the spec early is especially valuable. They can also use specs to verify completeness: does the implementation actually cover every scenario in the spec? OpenSpec's /opsx:verify command automates part of this check, but human QA review of the spec itself is where the real value lies.\n\nThe design document is where architectural oversight happens. A principal can review design.md to ensure the proposed approach fits the system's overall architecture, without needing to wait for a code review to discover that someone introduced a new database table that duplicates an existing one, or bypassed the payment gateway abstraction layer by calling the acquirer API directly.\n\nThe proposal document is equally valuable at this level. It provides enough context to make prioritization decisions, estimate impact on downstream systems like settlement and reconciliation, and flag dependencies before work begins.\n\nFor organizations running architecture review boards or design review processes, OpenSpec artifacts slot directly into those workflows. The artifacts are markdown in version control, which means they can be reviewed through the same pull request process as code.\n\nThe openspec/specs/ directory, the living spec that accumulates as changes are archived, becomes something like institutional memory for the project. It captures not just the current state of the system but the evolution of requirements over time. New team members can browse the specs to understand the system. Archived changes provide an audit trail of what changed, when, and why.\n\nThis is especially valuable for distributed teams where not everyone is in every meeting. The spec is always available, always current, and always in the repo.\n\nIn most payments organizations, business analysts produce detailed requirements documents long before any developer opens an IDE. These documents are the product of weeks of domain analysis: field mapping spreadsheets that map internal data structures to ISO 20022 message formats like pain.001 or pacs.008, business rule matrices that define transaction routing logic, validation rules derived from scheme specifications, sample XML payloads, regulatory constraint summaries, and workflow diagrams for processes like mandate lifecycle management or chargeback dispute flows.\n\nThese artifacts are enormously valuable. They represent concentrated domain knowledge that no AI model has in its training data. But they exist outside of any development tool, usually in Confluence pages, shared drives, or Excel files. The question is: where do they plug into the SDD workflow?\n\nRather than asking the AI to invent payment domain requirements from scratch (which it will get wrong in subtle, dangerous ways), you feed the BA's existing documents into the explore conversation. The AI reads the BA's field mappings, business rules, and sample payloads, then maps them against your actual codebase. The explore conversation becomes a structured dialogue about feasibility: which business rules can be implemented directly, which ones require architectural changes, where the BA's requirements conflict with existing behavior, and what edge cases the BA may not have considered from a technical perspective.\n\nThis conversation might reveal that 70% of the BA's requirements map cleanly to existing patterns and 30% require new design decisions. Those design decisions then flow into the proposal and spec with full context, rather than being invented by the AI from a one sentence prompt.\n\nThe key principle: the BA's documents are input to the spec, not replaced by it. The OpenSpec proposal can reference them directly (\"Field mappings follow the BA's pain.008 mapping document, see docs/ba-requirements/sepa-dd-field-mappings.xlsx\"). The spec captures the engineering interpretation of business requirements, while the BA's artifacts remain the authoritative source for domain rules. The two complement each other.\n\nFor teams with a strong BA function, this workflow turns explore into the most valuable step in the entire process. It's where domain expertise meets technical reality, and where misunderstandings between product and engineering get caught before they become expensive.\n\nFor years, the standard way to decompose work in software organizations has been the Agile hierarchy: Epics break into Features, Features break into User Stories, User Stories break into Tasks. Each layer adds structure, and each layer adds overhead. Grooming sessions to refine stories. Estimation ceremonies to assign points. Sprint planning to negotiate what fits. Story splitting when something is \"too big.\" Acceptance criteria written in Given/When/Then format.\n\nThis process was designed for a world where humans wrote every line of code, and work needed to be decomposed into pieces small enough for one developer to complete in a sprint. The granularity served a coordination function: if three developers are working on the same feature in parallel, you need clearly bounded units of work to avoid stepping on each other.\n\nWith AI agents handling the bulk of code generation, developers now work in significantly larger chunks. A feature that would have been split into 8 user stories with 24 tasks can be described as a single spec and implemented in one session. The AI doesn't need two week sprints to context switch between stories. It doesn't need story points to estimate effort. It doesn't care whether a unit of work is a 3 or a 5. It needs a clear description of what to build and enough context to build it correctly.\n\nThe overhead of the old hierarchy was always significant. Ceremonies consume 15-30% of a team's time. The BA writes detailed requirements and translates them into epics and stories. The tech lead estimates them. The developer re-interprets them during implementation. Each translation step is an opportunity for information loss.\n\nSDD collapses this. Instead of an Epic with 5 Features containing 20 User Stories containing 60 Tasks, you have a proposal that captures the business intent, a spec that defines the requirements, a design that describes the technical approach, and a task list that the AI executes against. The entire chain from \"why are we doing this\" to \"what code gets written\" lives in one change folder, reviewable as a single unit. There's no translation loss and the spec is the shared artifact that all of those roles read, review, and contribute to.\n\nThis doesn't mean you abandon planning. It means the unit of planning shifts from \"what can one developer finish in two days\" to \"what is the next coherent change to the system.\" That change might be small (fix a settlement rounding error) or large (add multi currency support). The spec scales to fit either. And because the AI generates the task breakdown from the spec, you don't need to spend planning meetings debating granularity. The tasks exist to guide the AI's implementation, not to fill a sprint board.\n\nSDD offers a natural landing spot for a switch to AI-first development. You keep the parts that matter (clear requirements, technical review, incremental delivery) and shed the parts that were only ever coordination scaffolding.\n\nLet's walk through a concrete example using OpenSpec to add multi currency settlement support to a payment processing platform.\n\nStep 1: Explore (optional but useful)\n\nIf the requirements aren't fully clear, or if you have BA created documents that need to be digested before planning, start with exploration:\n\nThis step is for thinking, not committing. No change folder is created yet.\n\nStep 3: Generate planning artifacts\n\nIf you have a clear picture of what to build, fast forward through all planning stages:\n\nAlternatively, use /opsx:continue to step through one phase at a time, reviewing and refining each artifact before moving to the next.\n\nStep 4: Review and refine the artifacts\n\nThis is the most important step. Read the generated proposal, specs, and design. Push back on anything that doesn't match your intent:\n\nReal work isn't linear. OpenSpec handles context switches gracefully because your plan lives in the artifacts, not in the AI's memory.\n\nOne important detail: during /opsx:apply, you can stop the AI at any point while monitoring its output. If you see it heading in the wrong direction on task 1.3, you stop it, correct course, and resume. The task list in tasks.md tracks what's been completed, so nothing about your plan is lost. This is fundamentally different from vibe coding, where stopping mid stream means losing context and hoping you can reconstruct where you were.\n\nThe same principle applies to bigger interrupts. You can pause an entire feature to handle something urgent:\n\nThe multi currency feature picks up exactly where it left off. The artifacts held the plan while you were away, whether that was five minutes or five days.\n\nSDD is not appropriate in all cases. Here are some cases where the overhead isn't worth it:\n\nQuick bug fixes. If you know exactly what's wrong and the fix is a one line change to a gateway timeout value, writing a spec is like filing a building permit to hang a picture frame. Just fix it.\n\nExploratory prototyping. When you're trying to figure out what to build, not how to build it, specs slow you down. Vibe coding is genuinely great for rapid exploration. If you're prototyping a new merchant dashboard layout to see what feels right, just build it iteratively.\n\nHighly visual or interactive work. SDD tools are text based. If your feature is primarily about UI layout, animation, or interaction design, you'll spend more time describing the visual result in markdown than you'd spend just building it with visual feedback (though pairing SDD with TideWave can work wonders for UI work).\n\nTrivial features. Updating an error message string, renaming a config key, bumping a dependency version. These don't need a spec. Use your judgment about the complexity threshold.\n\nRapidly changing requirements. If you're in a phase where the payment scheme keeps revising the spec and requirements shift weekly, maintaining your own specs becomes overhead that fights against your pace. Get to stability first, then spec the features that need to stick.\n\nThe general rule: if you can hold the entire change in your head and verify it by looking at it, you probably don't need a spec. If the change involves multiple files, multiple concerns, or behavior you can't verify visually, a spec starts paying for itself.\n\nHaving used these tools and studied the experiences of others, here are the traps:\n\nSpec bloat. The AI loves to generate exhaustive specifications. A feature that would take you 30 minutes to implement can produce 800+ lines of markdown. You have to be disciplined about trimming specs to what's actually useful. If you're not reading the spec carefully, it's worse than not having one because you'll have false confidence that edge cases are covered when they're not.\n\nThe waterfall trap. SDD can slide into big design up front if you're not careful and start bundling many features into one spec. If changing the spec feels expensive or bureaucratic, you've over formalized. OpenSpec's fluid workflow helps here since there are no phase gates, but you still need the discipline to keep specs lightweight enough to throw away and rewrite if you find yourself going down the wrong path.\n\nSpec drift. The spec says one thing; the code does another. This happens when you make implementation fixes outside the spec workflow. Either update the spec when you deviate, or accept that the spec is aspirational rather than authoritative. OpenSpec's /opsx:sync command can help keep specs aligned during long running changes.\n\nThe AI ignores its own spec. This is a real and documented problem. Context windows are larger, but that doesn't mean the AI attends to everything in them equally. People have reported that AI agents generate code that contradicts the spec they just wrote, creating duplicate classes, ignoring constraints, or implementing patterns the spec explicitly avoided. The /opsx:verify step exists specifically to catch this.\n\nReview fatigue. SDD adds a new category of artifact to review. You're now reviewing specs AND code. If your team doesn't value spec review as highly as code review, specs become rubber stamped documents that provide an illusion of rigour.\n\nOver application to small changes. The tooling doesn't scale down well. Applying the full SDD workflow to a minor feature creates overhead that dwarfs the implementation time. You need a personal threshold for when to spec and when to just build.\n\nEvery discussion of SDD eventually arrives at the same question: isn't this just waterfall with better marketing?\n\nThe comparison is fair to raise and unfair to leave unexamined. Traditional waterfall failed because of long feedback loops: months of design, months of implementation, and discovery at the end that the design didn't match reality. The feedback cycle was measured in quarters.\n\nSDD, practiced well, has feedback cycles measured in minutes to hours. You write a spec for a single feature, not an entire system. You review the generated design before implementation starts. You implement in small, verifiable tasks. And critically, changing the spec and regenerating is cheap. The whole point is that code is a derived artifact you can throw away and recreate.\n\nSDD can slide into waterfall like rigidity if you treat specs as immutable, if the spec writing phase becomes its own bottleneck, or if you use SDD as a substitute for iterative discovery. As Gojko Adzic observed, the movement builds on solid intent-first ideas but could reintroduce rigidity if practitioners aren't thoughtful about it.\n\nThe Thoughtworks perspective captures the nuance well: the problems of vibe coding come from being too fast, spontaneous, and haphazard, while the problems of waterfall come from being too slow, rigid, and disconnected from reality. SDD, when practiced well, occupies the middle ground. It provides a mechanism for shorter and more effective feedback loops than either extreme.\n\nThe honest answer is that SDD sits on a spectrum. At one end, you have \"spec as lightweight sketch,\" a quick outline that gives the AI direction without constraining it. At the other end, you have \"spec as source of truth,\" a comprehensive document that the code must conform to. OpenSpec's fluid approach leans toward the lighter end of that spectrum, which is why it appeals to teams who want discipline without ceremony.\n\nReduced rework. Catching misunderstandings at the spec level is dramatically cheaper than catching them in code. When a BA's field mapping is wrong, you want to discover that while reviewing a proposal, not while debugging a failed settlement file at 2 AM.\n\nPersistent context. Specs survive session boundaries, tool switches, and team changes. Six months from now, when someone asks why the FX rate locking works the way it does, the spec and its proposal explain both the what and the why.\n\nReviewable intent across roles. You can review a spec without reading any code. Product managers, BAs, QA, and principals can participate in spec review and catch requirement gaps before implementation begins. In a payments context, this means compliance can review the spec for regulatory alignment without needing to read Elixir.\n\nTime upfront. Writing and reviewing specs takes time that vibe coding doesn't require. For simple tasks, this overhead is pure cost with minimal benefit.\n\nFalse precision. Detailed specs can create an illusion of completeness. Just because the spec covers edge cases on paper doesn't mean the AI will implement them correctly. You still need to test.\n\nTool immaturity. These tools are all early stage. Expect rough edges, breaking changes, and workflow gaps. The ecosystem is moving fast, which means today's best practices may be obsolete in six months.\n\nSpec driven development is less than a year old as a named practice, and the tooling is evolving fast. The fundamental insight, that AI agents produce better code when given structured intent rather than ad hoc prompts, seems durable even if the specific tools don't survive.\n\nWhat's interesting is the convergence. BDD (Behavior Driven Development), TDD (Test Driven Development), and now SDD all share the same DNA: define the desired behavior before writing the implementation. SDD is that idea adapted for a world where the implementer is an AI agent rather than a human developer.\n\nThe open question is whether specs will remain the domain of dedicated tools, or whether this discipline gets absorbed into the AI coding tools themselves. We're already seeing Cursor, Claude Code, and Copilot add planning and multi step reasoning capabilities that accomplish some of what SDD tools do, without the explicit spec writing step.\n\nFor now, the practical takeaway is simple: if you're doing anything more complex than a quick prototype with AI coding tools, some form of structured planning, whether you call it SDD or just \"thinking before prompting,\" will produce better results than vibing your way through it. The tools can help enforce that discipline, but the discipline itself is what matters.\n\nThe spec isn't the point. The thinking is.",

    "description": "Court documents show how investigators can track digital activities, and reveal ways to harden journalists’ devices",
    "fullText": "The January FBI raid of the home of Washington Post federal government reporter Hannah Natanson, in connection with a leak probe involving a government contractor, was a dangerous escalation against press freedom and likely runs afoul of the Privacy Protection Act. It shouldn’t have happened at all.\n\nA judge has since ordered that the government preserve, but not review, the materials seized during the raid. We’ve recently examined a court document that shines light on some specifics of the case, and think journalists can learn something from what it reveals.\n\nThe court filing suggests Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, the government contractor, allegedly viewed a document later published by Natanson and took screenshots before pasting those images into a new Microsoft Word document.\n\nIf you use a work-issued computer or phone at any well-resourced organization, like a government agency, it’s quite likely that there are a handful of technologies to track employee activities baked into your device.\n\nServices like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 provide administrators with audit logs of employees’ activities, such as the user who opened a given document, actions taken in the document, and when they were taken.\n\nIn practice, this means investigators could see a list of everyone who accessed a leaked document and make a short list of likely sources of the leak.\n\nMany workplaces also use mobile device management services to equip workplace devices with security monitoring, control, and visibility into those devices.\n\nIn this case, we see that investigators were able to detect Perez-Lugones’ screenshot, which likely would have removed some metadata — information about the original document — before he printed it out as a new document.\n\nA well-resourced work environment, unfortunately, has an extraordinary level of visibility into employees’ activities on their devices. Sources should therefore generally assume what they do on workplace laptops, phones, networks, and physical spaces is being recorded.\n\nThe document suggests investigators were authorized to force the reporter to use biometrics to unlock devices, using her fingerprints or the face scanners built into her devices.\n\nAfter seizing her MacBook Pro, Natanson was told to unlock it with her fingerprint.\n\nWhile rare, we have seen other examples of law enforcement actors obtaining permission and attempting to use biometric unlocks with tools like Face ID and Touch ID to force reporters to unlock their devices.\n\nThere is a place for biometrics — the alternative would be typing in your passcode dozens or even hundreds of times each day, which would encourage weaker passcodes. (And we hope you use a long, unique passcode!)\n\nBut if you are going into a scenario where you expect it’s possible your phone may be seized, such as when going through airport security, disabling biometrics doesn’t hurt.\n\nNatanson probably couldn’t reasonably have predicted that her devices were about to be seized, and it’s therefore harder to prepare for a situation like this.\n\nWe do know that many raids happen before dawn, so this points to a benefit in shutting down your computer before bed and when not in use.\n\nYou can also quickly disable biometrics at any time by holding the power button and the volume-up button on your phone at the same time. This will immediately disable biometrics on an iPhone, but on Android, you may need to click “Lockdown” afterward. Android users may need to enable this from the Settings app.\n\nIf you feel comfortable simply typing in your passcode on your desktop computer, consider disabling biometrics on your desktop and using a passcode to unlock the device. You can always continue using biometric features like Touch ID on your laptop with other services after the device is unlocked.\n\nOnce investigators unlocked her workplace laptop, they took photos and audio recordings of the conversations in the laptop’s Signal application.\n\nThis also brings up the challenging question of when to use Signal for Desktop. Signal for Desktop is convenient — I use it every day. But Signal is only as secure as your devices.\n\nIt first needs to be installed on your mobile device, which comes with its own risk of being infected with malware that could compromise your messages.\n\nIf you link your Signal account to your desktop, you are introducing even more risk. That’s a choice you’ll have to make.\n\nRegardless, you need to keep your Signal app up to date, along with every device using Signal, to ensure you’re receiving the newest security patches.\n\nLikewise, there are situations where journalists may need to retain their messages, but not all messages need to live on your device indefinitely.\n\nWhen possible, reporters may want to enable Signal’s disappearing messages to minimize the risk of your messages being read if someone snatches your phone, or simply in case of loss or theft. Read our guide to locking down Signal to learn how to set it up.\n\nIt appears data on the reporter’s iPhone could not be extracted using forensic devices, at least in part because Apple’s Lockdown Mode was enabled.\n\nWhat’s Lockdown Mode, you ask? It’s an optional feature built into Apple devices that allows you to harden your device by disabling some features, such as certain forms of message attachments.\n\nImportantly, when your iPhone is locked, it also disables connections from accessories, such as USB devices. Many forensic devices plug directly into your phone in order to connect, and this means they appear to have a tougher time connecting when Lockdown Mode is enabled.\n\nIf you feel at risk, consider trying out Lockdown Mode, or if you have an Android phone, enable Advanced Protection. Disabling some technologies to harden your device may affect how your phone works slightly. But you may appreciate the added assurance.\n\nResearch from forensic companies like Cellebrite shows that they have a tougher time breaking into newer and up-to-date phones. So while you’re at it, download your updates as soon as you can. Read more about mobile device safety.\n\nWe understand that investigators seized multiple devices, including an audio recorder and an external hard drive.\n\nUsually, there is no straightforward way to encrypt certain devices, such as dedicated cameras and recording devices. However, you can off-load information from these devices immediately to a device that you can encrypt, such as your computer.\n\nYou can encrypt your computer’s drive by enabling FileVault for Macs, and BitLocker for Windows Pro’s Enterprise and Education editions. On Linux, you can encrypt your device with LUKS. A modern, up-to-date iPhone or Android device will be encrypted by default by simply having a passcode.\n\nNote that disk encryption is fully enabled until you type in your passcode to decrypt the device. The easiest way to enable disk encryption is therefore to simply power down your device.\n\nThis raid was extraordinary, but the things we can do to protect the data on our devices are not, and may apply to more routine security issues, like the potential for loss or theft. Take some time to learn about things you can do to protect your device by reading our guide to mobile maintenance. And journalists can always reach out to our digital security team for assistance.",

CGIT 1.3 is the first new release in six years and comes with a lot of changes.\r\nFor those not needing to manage pull requests or other features from your Git web interface but simply needing a web-based viewer for reading Git repositories, CGIT remains one of the best options around. CGIT is lightweight, doesn't depend upon JavaScript and is very efficient in being written in C, and also powers the likes of git.kernel.org.\r\nWith CGIT 1.3 there are many bug fixes, updating against the latest Git 2.53 functionality, updates to the CSS styling for CGIT, and also the very first (optional) JavaScript based functionality. JavaScript is being used for CGIT's dynamic aging feature. The JavaScript feature is to dynamically update the \"ages\" of GIt commits and the like on client side. So not too scary and no fundamental loss if blocking JavaScript in your browser.\r\nMore details on CGIT 1.3 can be found via the mailing list release announcement.\n\n 5 Comments",

    "fullText": "\"What an interesting Black History month this has turned out to be,\" Instagram user Danny Price captioned the post revealing the offensive alert.\n\nGoogle is apologizing after publishing a news alert about Sunday's BAFTA Awards racial slur incident, with the N-word written out.\n\nA screenshot of the notification was shared online by Instagram user Danny Price, who shared several photos to his page. The alert linked out to an article by The Hollywood Reporter, which had the headline: \"How the Tourette's Fallout Unfolded at the BAFTA Film Awards.\" The notification then invited readers to \"see more on [the N-word].\"\n\nAlongside the several slides showing the Google alert, Price wrote that the occurrence was \"absolutely f---ed.\"\n\n\"What an interesting Black History month this has turned out to be,\" Price added in the caption of his post.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Entertainment Weekly: \"We're deeply sorry for this mistake. We've removed the offensive notification and are working to prevent this from happening again.\"\n\nThe tech giant told EW that the \"system error did not involve AI\" and was a case of safety filters not catching an error, adding, \"This was a mistake that shouldn't have happened. We're working on improved guardrails for our push notification systems, which are designed to accurately characterize content from across the web.\"\n\nThe tech company shared that its systems recognized \"a euphemism for an offensive term\" on several web pages, and \"accidentally\" used the offensive term in the notification text. \"We caught the mistake quickly, and immediately removed it from people's devices,\" the company added. \"Only a very small subset of Google app users who get push notifications received it. This system error did not involve AI. Our safety filters did not properly trigger, which is what caused this.\"\n\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\nThe upset follows a bevy of reactions in the aftermath of Tourette syndrome activist John Davidson — who attended the BAFTAs in honor of I Swear, a film about his experience living with Tourette's — shouting the N-word when Sinners stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented the Best Visual Effects award to Avatar: Fire and Ash. Afterwards, the show continued on, and host Alan Cumming addressed the incident with a brief statement.\n\nSinners' production designer and nominee Hannah Beachler alleged on X that she had also had a racial slur directed at her, and criticized what she called a \"throw away\" apology from the BAFTAs.\n\nBeachler also alleged that she heard Davidson use the word for a \"third time\" directed \"at a Black woman\" at the event.\n\nMany have called out the BBC for its handling of the situation, considering the broadcast aired this moment unaltered on BBC One with a two-hour delay. BBC typically airs the ceremony with alterations and indeed made edits, but this moment went untouched.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Warner Bros. raised immediate concerns after the incident on Sunday and requested that the incident be removed from the BBC broadcast within minutes. A source told Deadline that the studio received assurances that its concerns would be passed to the BBC and producer Penny Lane TV during the recording of the ceremony.\n\nLindo even claimed that nobody from the British Academy of Film and Television approached him or Jordan to offer an apology or acknowledge the incident directly after. While speaking to Vanity Fair at a Warner Brothers' after-party, Lindo said that he and Jordan \"did what we had to do\" when they were on stage, but added that he wishes \"someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, BBC removed the show from its streaming platform, iPlayer, and announced plans to re-edit and cut this moment.\n\nThe British Academy of Film and Television also took \"full responsibility\" for the incident in a statement shared with EW, which read, \"We take the duty of care to all our guests very seriously and start from a position of inclusion. \"\n\nThe British Academy went on to \"apologize unreservedly\" to Jordan and Lindo, thanking them for \"their incredible dignity and professionalism.\"\n\nIt concluded, \"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologize to all. We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\"\n\nDavidson addressed the incident on Monday, sharing a statement that reiterated that his verbal tics and uncontrollable swearing, which are symptoms of Tourette's, are involuntary. He stated that he is and always has been \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I have spent my life trying to support and empower the Tourette’s community and to teach empathy, kindness and understanding from others and I will continue to do so.\"\n\nDavidson additionally noted that he \"chose to leave the auditorium early\" of his own volition in acknowledgement of \"the distress my tics were causing.\"\n\nEW has reached out to representatives for Davidson, Cumming, Jordan, and Lindo for comment.",

    "title": "Anthropic Drops Flagship Safety Pledge",
    "description": "In an abrupt shift, the company may release future AI models without ironclad safety guarantees",
    "fullText": "Anthropic, the wildly successful AI company that has cast itself as the most safety-conscious of the top research labs, is dropping the central pledge of its flagship safety policy, company officials tell TIME.\n\nIn 2023, Anthropic committed to never train an AI system unless it could guarantee in advance that the company’s safety measures were adequate. For years, its leaders touted that promise—the central pillar of their Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)—as evidence that they are a responsible company that would withstand market incentives to rush to develop a potentially dangerous technology.\n\nBut in recent months the company decided to radically overhaul the RSP. That decision included scrapping the promise to not release AI models if Anthropic can’t guarantee proper risk mitigations in advance.\n\n“We felt that it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models,” Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan told TIME in an exclusive interview. “We didn't really feel, with the rapid advance of AI, that it made sense for us to make unilateral commitments … if competitors are blazing ahead.”\n\nThe new version of the policy, which TIME reviewed, includes commitments to be more transparent about the safety risks of AI, including making additional disclosures about how Anthropic’s own models fare in safety testing. It commits to matching or surpassing the safety efforts of competitors. And it promises to “delay” Anthropic’s AI development if leaders both consider Anthropic to be leader of the AI race and think the risks of catastrophe to be significant.\n\nBut overall, the change to the RSP leaves Anthropic far less constrained by its own safety policies, which previously categorically barred it from training models above a certain level if appropriate safety measures weren’t already in place.\n\nThe change comes as Anthropic, previously considered to be behind OpenAI in the AI race, rides the high of a string of technological and commercial successes. Its Claude models, especially the software-writing tool Claude Code, have won legions of devoted fans. In February, Anthropic raised $30 billion in new investments, valuing it at some $380 billion, and reported that its annualized revenue was growing at a rate of 10x per year. The company’s core business model of selling direct to businesses is seen by many investors as more credible than OpenAI’s main strategy of monetizing a vast consumer user base.\n\nKaplan, the Anthropic executive and co-founder, denied the company’s decision to change course was a capitulation to market incentives as the race for superintelligence accelerates. He framed it instead as a pragmatic response to emerging political and scientific realities. “I don’t think we’re making any kind of U-turn,” Kaplan says.\n\nWhen Anthropic introduced the RSP in 2023, Kaplan says, the company hoped it would encourage rivals to adopt similar measures. (No rivals made quite as overt a promise to pause AI development, but many published lengthy reports detailing their plans to mitigate risk, which Kaplan chalks up as Anthropic exerting a good influence on the industry.) Executives also hoped the approach might eventually serve as a blueprint for binding national regulations or even international treaties, Kaplan claims.\n\nBut those regulations never materialized. Instead, the Trump Administration has endorsed a let-it-rip attitude to AI development, even going so far as to attempt to nullify state regulations. No federal AI law is on the horizon. And while a global governance framework may have seemed possible in 2023, three years later it has become clear that door has closed. Meanwhile, competition for AI supremacy—between companies but also between nations—has only intensified.\n\nTo make matters worse, the science of AI evaluations has proven more complicated than Anthropic expected when it first crafted the RSP. The arrival of powerful new models meant that, in 2025, Anthropic announced it could not rule out the possibility of these models facilitating a bio-terrorist attack. But while they couldn’t rule it out, they also lacked strong scientific evidence that models did pose that kind of danger, which made it difficult to convince governments and rivals of what they saw as the need to act carefully. What the company had previously imagined might look like a bright red line was instead coming into focus as a fuzzy gradient.\n\nFor nearly a year, Anthropic executives discussed ways to reshape their flagship safety policy to match this new environment, Kaplan says. One point they kept coming back to was their founding premise: the idea that to do proper AI safety research, they had to build models at the frontier of capability—even though doing so might accelerate the arrival of the dangers they feared.\n\nIn February, according to Kaplan, Amodei decided that keeping the company from training new models while competitors raced ahead would be helpful to nobody. “If one AI developer paused development to implement safety measures while others moved forward training and deploying AI systems without strong mitigations, that could result in a world that is less safe,” the new version of the RSP, approved unanimously by Amodei and Anthropic’s board, states in its introduction. “The developers with the weakest protections would set the pace, and responsible developers would lose their ability to do safety research.”\n\nChris Painter, the director of policy at METR, a nonprofit focused on evaluating AI models for risky behavior, reviewed an early draft of the policy with Anthropic’s permission. He says the change is understandable — but also a bearish signal for the world’s ability to navigate potential AI catastrophes. The change to the RSP shows Anthropic “believes it needs to shift into triage mode with its safety plans, because methods to assess and mitigate risk are not keeping up with the pace of capabilities,” Painter tells TIME. “This is more evidence that society is not prepared for the potential catastrophic risks posed by AI.”\n\nAnthropic argues the retooled RSP is designed to keep the biggest benefits of the old one. For example, by constraining itself from releasing new models, Anthropic’s original RSP also incentivized it to quickly build safety mitigations. (Because otherwise the company would be unable to sell its AI to customers.) Anthropic says it believes it can maintain that incentive. The new policy commits the company to regularly release what it calls “Frontier Safety Roadmaps”: documents laying out a list of detailed goals for future safety measures it hopes to build.\n\n“We hope to create a forcing function for work that would otherwise be challenging to appropriately prioritize and resource, as it requires collaboration (and in some cases sacrifices) from multiple parts of the company and can be at cross-purposes with immediate competitive and commercial priorities,” the new RSP states.\n\nAnthropic says it will also commit to publishing so-called “Risk Reports” every three to six months. The reports, the company says, will “explain how capabilities, threat models (the specific ways that models might pose threats), and active risk mitigations fit together, and provide an assessment of the overall level of risk.” These documents will be more in-depth than the reports the company already publishes, a spokesperson tells TIME.\n\n“I like the emphasis on transparent risk reporting and publicly verifiable safety roadmaps,” says Painter, the METR policy official. But he said he was “concerned” that moving away from binary thresholds under the previous RSP, by which the arrival of a certain capability could act as a tripwire to temporarily halt Anthropic’s AI development, might enable a “frog-boiling” effect, where danger slowly ramps up without a single moment that sets off alarms.\n\nAsked whether Anthropic was caving to market pressure, Kaplan argued that, in fact, Anthropic was making a renewed commitment to developing AI safely. “If all of our competitors are transparently doing the right thing when it comes to catastrophic risk, we are committed to doing as well or better,” he said. “But we don't think it makes sense for us to stop engaging with AI research, AI safety, and most likely lose relevance as an innovator who understands the frontier of the technology, in a scenario where others are going ahead and we're not actually contributing any additional risk to the ecosystem.”",

    "title": "11 best bralettes for large busts that are both supportive and comfortable",
    "description": "I tested bralettes for large busts to find the styles that deliver real support and feel comfortable under everyday outfits.",
    "fullText": "These days, if a bra isn't comfortable, I'm simply not wearing it. Somewhere in my 30s, the calculus shifted — the lift and structure I once prioritized began to take a backseat to softness and ease. The underwire styles that used to feel essential now sit untouched, while stretchy bralettes have taken over my drawer.\n\nOf course, making that switch isn't as simple when you wear a DD cup. Underwire exists for a reason, and most bralettes aren't engineered to do the same level of support. I've tried plenty that looked promising but didn't hold up past the first hour.\n\nOver time, though, I've figured out what actually works. The bralettes worth buying share a few key traits: a wide, supportive band; adjustable straps; cups cut deep enough to avoid spillover; and fabric with real structure, not just stretch. When those details are right, you get something rare — a bra that feels barely there but still does its job.\n\nFor more of our recommendations for folks with larger chests, see our articles on the best swimsuits for large busts.\n\nThis bralette has it all: adjustable straps, a smoothing back, and even a bonded cradle for maximum support without the wires. I can convert the straps to a criss-cross back, making it versatile enough to wear with a range of tops and dresses, and I really appreciate that it has an adjustable band — something that a lot of bralettes are lacking.\n\nTo be honest, there's not much I don't like about this bralette. It even features removable cups for occasions when I need a little extra coverage — and the mesh and lace detailing add some unexpected sex appeal.\n\n\"The bonded underband lifts the bust without the wires for a perky loo, and the rounded shape makes this a great non-wired t-shirt bra,\" says Katie Weir, the bra fitting expert and founder of Curvy Kate.\n\nSee more of our favorite Honeylove products and hear more about the Crossover bra in our Honeylove review.\n\nI bought this bralette on a whim when I was looking for comfy underthings to sleep in — and I'm so glad I did. In fact, I ended up ordering it in several more colors — and luckily, there are a whopping 21 options to choose from. It's lightweight, seamless, incredibly stretchy, and my go-to for lazy Sundays and Friday nights in.\n\nThis bralette boasts a barely there feel, making it ideal for warmer months since. That said, it is worth noting that because the fabric is so thin and there's no padding, you may want to use nipple covers if you wear it out. (Or don't, you do you!)\n\nI also appreciate that the straps are adjustable on this one. Since the band isn't adjustable, however, make sure you size down if you're between two sizes to make sure you get adequate support.\n\nExecutive Editor Sally Kaplan is deeply passionate about Evelyn & Bobbie's smoothing bralettes. We've featured the V-neck Evelyn Bra above, but she loves the whole collection — the Bobbie scoop-neck, the Beyond bra  and the Defy bra.\n\n\"Evelyn & Bobbie's wireless bras are legitimately the most comfortable I've ever worn. They're supportive, structured, not too constrictive, and they actively take weight off my shoulders,\" says Sally. To hear her full thoughts, see our Evelyn & Bobbie review.\n\nThe comfort of the bralettes is down to a support feature called the \"EB Core,\" which is a patented technology that helps keep the bra's shape while preventing \"pancaking.\" The bralettes also have thicker straps that help with weight distribution.\n\nThe Evelyn Bra, in particular, is fantastic for wearing under lower-cut tops because of the V-neck design. It's smoothing on your back while giving your breasts a lift that doesn't sacrifice comfort.\n\nDespite the fact that this bralette has no cups, underwire, padding, or foam, it offers remarkable lift and separation. Best of all, it's available up to size 6XL, so it accommodates larger band sizes.\n\n\"I love the wide back band, and the fact that [larger sizes] have a higher center gore in front to ensure less spillage,\" says Weir.\n\nThe v-neckline gives this bralette some extra points in the versatility department, and the front-adjusting straps make finding your perfect fit so much easier. Did I mention that the fabric feels as soft as silk?\n\nBuying a bralette in alpha sizing is almost impossible if you have larger breasts. The band is always too tight or too loose, and the cups can create an unflattering squishing effect.\n\nThis bralette solves those issues by offering two cup sizes specifically for those with larger breasts: D/E and F/G. In addition, the pieces come in band sizes from 30 to 42.\n\nThe Cup-Sized Lace Bralette also has convertible straps and, unlike most bralettes, a hook-and-eye closure at the back. This means that you can keep using the piece even as the elastic stretches over time.\n\nIf you're looking for a bralette that's anything but basic, your search is over. This gorgeous little number proves that lingerie doesn't have to be uncomfortable: it's wireless, has plenty of stretch, and offers plenty of support thanks to the longline cut and wide straps.\n\nThis is a great option for larger busts because both the straps and the band are adjustable, making it easier to achieve the perfect fit. Admittedly, it can take some time to fasten all the hook and eye closures in the back, but I like that there are three rows so I can tighten or loosen the band as needed.\n\nIt's the details, though, that really make this bralette stand out — like the scalloped edge tricolor lace and multi-dimensional floral design.\n\nLike so many other SKIMS bralettes, this one is made with buttery soft fabric that's so comfortable you might even forget you're wearing it. I love that it comes in such a wide range of neutrals to accommodate every skin tone, and since it's so lightweight and breathable, you won't have to worry much about that dreaded underboob sweat.\n\nThe only caveat is that you can't adjust the band, and as many reviewers noted, it does run a little small.\n\nAs someone with a 32DD bra size, it's supremely difficult to find bralettes that fit just right because most of them don't cup in band/cup sizes. If I buy a size small, the band fits perfectly but I'm spilling out of the cups. If I buy a medium, the cups fit fine but the band is way too big to offer adequate support. So, I was thrilled when I discovered that every size in this bralette (XXS-XXL) comes in a D/DD cup size option.\n\nBut that's not all there is to love about this bra: it feels super soft against the skin, has adjustable straps, and features a four-row hook and eye closure for max adjustability. Not only that, but the floating cups are designed to mold to your unique bust size and shape.\n\nAnd apparently, I'm not the only one who's a big fan — because this best-selling bralette has garnered hundreds of five-star reviews.\n\nParfait is a lingerie line that specializes in accommodating larger bust sizes — I've owned several of their bras, and the quality speaks for itself: all of them have lasted at least a couple of years.\n\nKaitlin Vachon, a bra fitting expert and founder of Bra Emporium, says this is one of her favorite bralettes for large busts in part because it's available in traditional cup and band sizes. She also notes that the wide band and thick adjustable straps offer ample support, and it's super size-inclusive — in fact, it's available up to a size 42K.\n\nWhile it doesn't have any underwire in the cups, it does feature some side boning for a bit more structure than many other bralettes. Another perk? It can easily be converted into a racerback style, thanks to the J-hook in the back.\n\nI've been enamored with Negative Underwear for a while now — not only because of the minimalist designs, but also because of the brand's focus on sustainability: they only use high-quality fabrics that are free of harmful chemicals, and sourced from OEKO-TEX certified mills.\n\nThe Sieve Non-Wire is arguably the line's most supportive bralette, thanks in part to the Belgian micromesh that holds you up like a firm hug. In her Negative Underwear review, Insider Reviews Executive Editor Sally Kaplan raved about this one.\n\n\"Bralettes like these are really hard to get right for larger chest sizes, but this one worked incredibly well for my DDs (which are sometimes DDDs depending on the time of the month),\" she said. \"Of all the bralettes I've tested in my many years covering women's basics for Insider Reviews, this is my favorite. It lifts them up without separating too much or squishing together — plus, it's the perfect silhouette for V-neck sweaters or shirts.\"\n\nDid you know that a majority of a bra's support comes from the band? I learned this during a bra fitting years ago, and it really stuck with me — I'd always assumed it was the straps or the cups that were holding my girls up. That's what made this Bombas bralette stick out for me: the ribbed band is wider than most, lending ample support and lift without the wires. In fact, it can accommodate up to an F cup size. It's also thoughtfully designed with a tighter knit in the center and around the sides for added support.\n\nI often wear this bra to sleep because the fabric is super stretchy, seamless, and breathable — but it's also great for lounging around the house or running casual errands. Note that this bralette will feel pretty snug when you first put it on, but it stretches out a teeny bit with time.\n\nYes — but with caveats. Traditional bralettes are designed for light support, so not all styles work well for fuller busts. The best options for larger busts include wide bands, structured cups, and supportive fabrics that combine comfort with reliable hold — especially for everyday wear.\n\nA well-fitting bralette should feel snug around the band without squeezing, and your breasts should feel supported without bulging out of the top or sides. If the band rides up or the straps dig in, it's probably not the right fit.\n\nMost bralettes won't replace a proper sports bra for high-impact workouts. However, some structured bralette styles with strong bands and supportive fabrics can work for low-impact activities like yoga or walking. For running or HIIT, stick with a dedicated sports bra.",

    "description": "The AI boom could bring us amazing discoveries — and massive unemployment. Both scenarios are worth taking seriously.",
    "fullText": "You know all that money and effort everyone's putting into AI because they're convinced it's a technology that will change everything? What if they're right?\n\nThat's a kind of fair summary of a Substack post that went viral over the weekend, and then turned into a Wall Street phenomenon Monday, when lots of tech stocks lost value because of AI fears.\n\nI say \"kind of fair\" because the \"what if\" post, published by Citrini Research, isn't just a \"what if\" post, but a \"if it happens, we're in big trouble\" post.\n\nAnd now the blowback: AI boosters are calling the Citrini post \"AI doomerism\" and are poking at some of its doomsday scenarios.\n\nI'm not here to argue whether any of Citrini's individual points are reasonable — I have no idea how AI will affect the likes of, say, DoorDash.\n\nBut this also seems like a forest/trees issue. Maybe the details are wrong, but the big picture should be a sobering one: If the AI future we are being promised comes to pass, it could have a massive effect on our economy, and part of that effect could be meaningful unemployment.\n\nBecause that's not just a wild-eyed anti-AI thesis, but one that's core to the pro-AI thesis, too. It's what accounts for the enormous investments tech companies are making in AI, and the crazy valuations we're seeing for the likes of Anthropic ($380 billion) and OpenAI ($850 billion).\n\nIn short: The only way those companies are going to be worth anything close to those numbers* is if they end up having a massive impact. Yes, some of the value may be justified by amazing innovation AI could unlock, like wonder-drugs that get discovered in a fraction of the time. But a lot of the value will come from the fact that AI will let computers do lots of work humans do now.\n\nYou can't have the upside without the downside. Full stop.\n\nIt's easy to imagine all the ways this ripples through our economy. And every couple weeks or so, we get a new impetus to fire up our imaginations. Right now, for instance, the market is trying to get its head around the notion that AI might dramatically cut into the enterprise software industry, which is why we saw companies like IBM plummet on Monday. But you can do the same exercise for all kinds of work, in all kinds of industries: Lawyers. Consultants. Screenwriters. Truckers. Etc.\n\nNor do you have to be an AI \"doomer\" to think this way — it's baked into the pitch of the biggest AI companies. \"There are cases where entire classes of jobs will go away,\" OpenAI's Sam Altman said last year. His rival, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, is blunter and more pessimistic, predicting that AI will wipe out half of entry-level white collar jobs and send unemployment skyrocketing.\n\nIt is a little weird to see Wall Street whip-sawing as it thinks through how all of this might go. On Tuesday, tech stocks gained again, presumably because investors have now decided they overreacted on Monday. But I won't be surprised to see the markets lurch again down the line when someone else makes a convincing case that computers will disrupt a different industry.\n\nMaybe Citrini is wrong about DoorDash and right about lawyers. Maybe it's the other way around. But the general shape of the problem stays the same: The more AI lives up to the hype, the more it will affect the way people work — or if they work at all. You can be optimistic about that prospect, or terrified. But you can't ignore it.\n\n*Bear in mind these are private companies, which someday expect to be worth much more when they go public.",

    "description": "The State of the Union is not often a market-moving event, but Trump could address two key issues that have impacted markets during his speech.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump will deliver the first official State of the Union address of his term on Tuesday, and there are a few things investors should be listening for that could move markets.\n\nThe State of the Union isn't typically a market-moving event, but uncertainty around Trump's tariff regime following the Supreme Court's ruling and ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran mean investors are looking for signals of what's next from the president.\n\n\"This is usually a non-market-moving event and shouldn't cause a ripple effect on Wall St., with the speech telegraphed with little surprise or fanfare. However, the one constant under President Trump is that we can predict the unpredictable,\" Freedom Capital Markets chief market strategist Jay Woods said ahead of Tuesday evening's address.\n\nThe remarks are expected to be highly watched, with a poll from Scripps News/Talker Research finding that two-thirds of Americans see this State of the Union address as more important than previous years.\n\nHere is what investors should be keeping on their radar during Trump's speech.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that the majority of Trump's tariffs are illegal, finding that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act doesn't justify the import duties.\n\nTrump doubled down, lifting global tariffs to 15% using alternative frameworks to justify his trade war.\n\nLegal battles around tariffs are expected to continue, leaving investors without a clear picture of what's to come. In particular, the fight over tariff rebates for companies may just be getting started.\n\nAny comments from Trump about his trade plans could reshape Wall Street's expectations and move stocks.\n\n\"In his speech, we might learn more of his intent to continue to levy tariffs despite the SCOTUS decision,\" Woods said, adding that these comments could impact markets.\n\nOil prices have been volatile amid tensions between the US and Iran.\n\nWoods says that if Trump were to indicate an escalation of war against Iran, it could move markets.\n\nThe US has been building up its military presence in the Middle East. Updates from Trump about the US presence in Iran could add to volatility in the oil market, putting pressure on a key input for inflation.\n\nIt might be less of a market-moving update than tariffs or military action against Iran, but Trump is also expected to harp on the economy and his push to make life more affordable for everyday Americans.\n\nThe US economy has avoided what many feared would be the worst-case scenario under some of his policies, but worries persist.\n\nAlmost half of Americans are most interested in what Trump says about the economy, the Scripps News/Talker Research poll showed.\n\nComments from Trump about the economy could impact investor perception on inflation and the labor market, which could change expectations for the timing of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.",

It settles into mental tissue like heavy metals, producing chronic low-grade inflammation.\"\n\nEliminating social media entirely isn't realistic, he wrote.\n\n\"'Just put the phone down' is as practical as telling someone in 19th-century London to stop breathing coal smoke,\" he wrote.\n\nJohnson said time away from the apps is the \"only remedy,\" but he also suggested that AI agents could serve as an antidote to social media.\n\n\"An AI layer between you and the feed. Filtering rage, removing vanity metrics and translating sensationalism into calm, factual language. Preserving signal and eliminating noise,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I never want to see the raw feed. I want an AI agent to read it for me, strip the engagement metrics that hijack my judgment, filter the rage, and return only what I actually came for,\" he added.\n\nIn a world where AI agents are already proving to be expert hackers, agreeable coworkers, and custom-built board members — as well as potential security risks — Johnson's push for an AI layer between himself and his feed doesn't seem all that far off.\n\nJohnson has made it his life's focus to try to reverse his biological age to avoid death. He spends around $2 million a year to do so, focusing on extreme treatments such as plasma therapy alongside his strict diet and exercise routine.\n\nHis wish for an AI social media buffer also ties into his quest for a longer life, he says: \"I want social media to become a longevity intervention, not a longevity threat.\"",

The foundational layer of AI remains supply-constrained.\"\n\nWall Street is expecting the chip giant to deliver $65.91 billion of revenue, with $60 billion of that coming from its all-important data center business.\n\nAs the market heads toward the blockbuster report on Wednesday afternoon, here's what analysts say to keep an eye out for.\n\nDan Ives, the bullish Wedbush tech analyst, said he expects Nvidia to handily beat earnings estimates.\n\nBut perhaps above all else, investors will be paying attention to CEO Jensen Huang's tone and outlook for chip demand going forward.\n\n\"There is one company that is the foundation for the AI Revolution and that is Nvidia with the Godfather of AI Jensen having the best perch and vantage point to discuss overall enterprise AI demand and the appetite for Nvidia's AI chips looking forward,\" Ives wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley's analyst covering Nvidia, says he would buy the stock heading into earnings on Wednesday, as his contacts in the industry continue to sound optimistic about the company.\n\nMoore has a $250 a share price target on the stock, implying 29% upside.\n\nIn the weeks following the report, Moore said to keep an eye on Jensen Huang's appearances at Morgan Stanley's TMT conference and a GTC developer event \n\nAnthony Saglimbene, the chief market strategist at Ameriprise, said to keep an eye out for updates on how successfully Nvidia is ramping up production of its new Rubin model.\n\n\"Execution on next-generation platforms, like Rubin, needs to give investors confidence that the company is on track with deployment schedules and that lead times are manageable.\"\n\nHe added that the firm needs to demonstrate that \"it can continue to successfully manage an industrial-scale manufacturing ramp not often seen in history.\"\n\nJoe Mazzola, the head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, said to watch for heightened investor scrutiny on the firm's profit margins as their production costs grow.\n\n\"Though AI spending shows little sign of easing, Nvidia and fellow chip firms face higher bandwidth memory costs amid sector shortages, and this could affect projected margin growth,\" Mazzola said in an email on Tuesday.\n\nOn the revenue front, he said that data centers will be the most important driver to watch, and guidance must also beat the average forecast.\n\n\"Nvidia remains under pressure every quarter not to just exceed quarterly consensus, but to guide for growth exceeding analysts' average estimates.\"\n\nSimilar to Ives, Luke Rahbari, a co-Portfolio Manager for The Rational Equity Armor Fund, said forward guidance is going to be the most important thing to watch. Any hint of negativity could mean trouble for the stock and the rest of the AI trade.\n\n\"They're going to have to say that they're seeing year-to-year growth, and that number has to be healthy. It doesn't have to be as healthy as how it's been growing here, but staying steady and growing at that year-to-year clip is what's going to be important,\" Rahbari wrote. \"If they mention any type of slowdown, if they say that year-to-year growth is going to be significantly lower, or if they pull back on investing in some of their own customers, that's going to signal that demand for the chips is lower.\"",

    "description": "Elon Musk's AI startup alleged in the lawsuit that Sam Altman's OpenAI recruited former xAI employees to steal trade secrets.",
    "fullText": "A California federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk's AI startup xAI, accusing OpenAI of poaching staff to steal trade secrets.\n\nIn a ruling released on Tuesday, US District Judge Rita Lin sided with a request to dismiss the case filed by the Sam Altman-led AI company behind ChatGPT, citing the lack of evidence against it.\n\n\"Notably absent are allegations about the conduct of OpenAI itself,\" Lin wrote in her order. \"xAI does not allege any facts indicating that OpenAI induced xAI's former employees to steal xAI's trade secrets or that these former xAI employees used any stolen trade secrets once employed by OpenAI.\"\n\nInstead of pointing to \"misconduct\" by OpenAI, xAI cited \"eight former xAI employees who left for OpenAI at around the same time,\" the judge said.\n\nLin gave xAI until March 17 to file an amended complaint \"correcting the deficiencies\" outlined in her order — giving Musk's company a chance to try again.\n\nThe ruling is the latest in an escalating feud between tech billionaires Musk and Altman.\n\nLast year, xAI sued Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of monopolistic behavior. Musk has also separately sued Altman and OpenAI — the company the two men cofounded in 2015 — over claims that it betrayed its nonprofit mission by shifting into a for-profit structure. OpenAI countersued, accusing Musk of a \"years-long campaign of harassment.\" That case is scheduled to go to trial in April.\n\nIn a statement in social media platform X, OpenAI said it welcomed the court's decision and called the lawsuit \"yet another front in Mr. Musk's ongoing campaign of harassment.\" Lawyers for x.AI didn't immediately return Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nIn the lawsuit that was dismissed on Tuesday, Musk's company alleged that OpenAI engaged in a \"deeply troubling pattern\" of recruiting former xAI employees to gain access to confidential information related to Grok, xAI's flagship chatbot.\n\nIn an amended complaint filed last year, xAI accused rival OpenAI of violating California and federal law by \"inducing\" several ex-employees to \"steal and share xAI's trade secrets.\"\n\n\"Threatened by xAI's innovations, OpenAI is not merely soliciting or hiring a competitor's employees,\" the lawsuit said. \"OpenAI is waging a coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign: OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI's key technologies and business plans.\"\n\nThe complaint alleged that, in just a few months, OpenAI poached at least eight xAI employees, including early xAI engineer Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive. Two former employees, the lawsuit said, have admitted to stealing xAI's trade secrets.\n\nAltman's OpenAI has denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit the \"latest chapter\" in Musk's \"ongoing harassment\" against the company.\n\nIn OpenAI's motion to dismiss the complaint, the company alleged that Musk and xAI have \"lobbed baseless claims of trade secret misappropriation\" to \"intimidate current and former xAI employees from working at their place of choice.\"\n\n\"XAI's federal trade secret misappropriation claim fails as a matter of law,\" OpenAI's attorneys argued in the motion. \"Remarkably, xAI never alleges that OpenAI actually acquired or disclosed xAI's trade secrets.\"",

    "fullText": "Google apologized on Tuesday for a news alert about a controversial moment at the British Academy Film Awards that contained the unedited N-word.\n\n\"We're deeply sorry for this mistake,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We've removed the offensive notification and are working to prevent this from happening again.\"\n\nThe now-deleted news alert previewed a story about Sunday's BAFTA awards, where an attendee with Tourette syndrome shouted the N-word while \"Sinners\" stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo — both of whom are Black — were on stage to present an award.\n\nDeadline.com initially reported that AI was to blame for the racial slur appearing in the push alert. Google said that was not the case, and Deadline has since clarified its report.\n\nGoogle said it caught the mistake quickly and only a \"small subset of users\" received the alert with the unedited racial slur. The search giant said that its push alert systems recognized a euphemism for the slur used in stories and incorrectly inserted the full word.\n\n\"This system error did not involve AI,\" Google said. \"Our safety filters did not properly trigger, which is what caused this.\"\n\nTourette syndrome advocate John Davidson, whose life story served as the inspiration for the BAFTA-nominated film \"I Swear,\" later said in a statement that he was \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning.\"\n\nAccording to the Tourette Association of America, roughly 10% of the millions of people living with Tourette and tic disorders experience coprolalia, which is \"the involuntary vocalization of obscene or socially inappropriate words or phrases.\"\n\n\"Importantly, these vocal tics are not reflective of the beliefs or values of the person experiencing them,\" the association said in a statement.\n\nThe BBC and the BAFTAs have faced intense criticism for broadcasting the moment, even though the award ceremony was subject to a two-hour tape delay. On Monday, both the BBC and BAFTAs offered separate public apologies for the moment.\n\n\"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologize to all,\" the BAFTAs said in a statement. \"We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\"\n\nKate Phillips, the BBC's chief content officer, said in a note to staff that another racial slur was edited out of the broadcast.\n\n\"We take full responsibility for what happened,\" Phillips wrote on Tuesday in the note, which was provided to Business Insider. \"When I was made aware it was audible on iPlayer, I asked for it to be taken down. As I'm sure you're aware we put out a statement yesterday morning apologising that the remark was not edited out prior to broadcast.\"\n\nDuring the award ceremony, host Alan Cumming made multiple statements about the language the audience might be hearing. Variety reported that \"shut the fuck up\" among other phrases could also be heard during the show.\n\n\"You may have noticed some strong language in the background,\" Cumming told the audience. \"This can be part of how Tourette's syndrome shows up for some people as the film explores that experience.\"",

    "description": "Matthew Breen has been in Puerto Vallarta with his husband and parents since November. They're ending their trip early due to the cartel violence.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Matthew Breen, a 51-year-old podcast producer and talent manager based in New York who's currently in Puerto Vallarta. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm based in New York City most of the year, but for the past couple of winters, I've been coming to Puerto Vallarta with my husband to escape the cold. We rent an apartment year-round in Zona Romántica. My parents eventually decided to winter here, too.\n\nIt started as holiday trips, then gradually grew into staying for a few months at a time. I work remotely as a podcast producer and talent manager.\n\nWe've all loved it for years. I've never felt unsafe until this past weekend, and now we're heading home early.\n\nI've been here this winter since mid-November, and I monitor my parents nearby. They rent an apartment in the same building, just downstairs from us.\n\nFriends who have grown up here said they've seen cartel violence elsewhere, but never in Zona Romántica.\n\nFrom our roof and window, we could see giant plumes of smoke rising a few blocks away. Friends in other parts of town said the explosions were car fuel tanks blowing up.\n\nWe heard from friends, family, and neighbors of two different unrelated acquaintances who were forced out of their cars at gunpoint. The explosions ceased for a while and then resumed early afternoon.\n\nFrom our balcony, we watched a car race down our block with two people on a motorcycle chasing it, a gun aimed at the driver. The car turned the corner and disappeared, the motorcycle close behind, and then we heard a gunshot. We didn't see smoke afterward, so we hoped the car got away.\n\nFrom the same vantage point, we saw five or six guys on motorcycles pull into a mattress store parking lot about 100 feet away. The storefront itself was out of view, but we heard glass shatter, and soon after, huge plumes of black smoke poured from the building. There's nothing left to go inside.\n\nAt around 8:30 Monday morning, people were outside, mostly neighbors talking to each other. We walked the neighborhood and saw one tourist bus still smoldering. There were at least 20 burned-out shells of cars, several burned convenience stores, and a burned hotel around the corner.\n\nThere were a couple of fruit and vegetable stands open and a few smaller local family places, but none of the big chains were open, as far as we could tell. Apart from that, the fires have gone out.\n\nWe haven't heard any more explosions. We've just seen a few military trucks with people in camo and machine guns walking the streets.\n\nMy parents were planning to leave town toward the end of March for the season, and I was going to accompany them and assist with travel. Now we're moving up the dates as soon as possible. I don't feel unsafe here, generally. Sunday was the aberration.\n\nI'll accompany my parents to Denver, then fly home to New York with my husband. We'll monitor what things look like from a distance and come back as soon as we can. Otherwise, we would stay longer. We've been able to rebook the flights we had scheduled for early next week.\n\nThe town is very resilient; we've battled disasters before, like hurricanes. It's important to us locals to patronize companies as they rebuild. It's a wait-and-see kind of thing.\n\nWe're cautious but seeing signs of life in town again, so we feel much better about going out.",

    "title": "I tried Honeylove's internet-famous bras, here's what surprised me",
    "description": "I tested several bras from Honeylove, the shapewear brand behind the viral CrossOver Bra, to see how they fit and feel in real life.",
    "fullText": "Honeylove has shapewear to accommodate every kind of outfit, from smoothing tanks and bodysuits to sculpting shorts and underwear. But without a doubt, the products I've been most excited to test out are the bras. As someone who has a large bust but hates the rigidity of an underwire, I was eager to see if their wireless bras could offer support without sacrificing comfort.\n\nWith that in mind, I tried three of the brand's best-selling items for my Honeylove review: the CrossOver Bra, SoftForm Bra, and Silhouette Bra. I also tested another one of their bestsellers that I'd been seeing all over Instagram: the SuperPower Short.\n\nIf you're looking for more intimates, check out our guides to the best bras and underwear for women.\n\nI found that certain items run a little large in the band, but not quite large enough to advise that you size down completely. I would stick with your usual size, and if you're willing to order an alternative size, try sizing down on the band to see if that works better for you (especially if you tend to be in between band sizes). You can see my thoughts below on the specifics of each style before you decide which ones might work best for you.\n\nBefore trying the Honeylove CrossOver Bra, I had pretty much given up on finding a wireless bra that actually held my chest up. What makes this one work so well is that the straps are fully adjustable all the way from the band to the cup, which allows me to achieve a customized fit. These are key features for me, because most bra straps tend to be far too long on my shoulders, and as a result, fail to provide adequate lift.\n\nAnother advantage of this bra is that it features four rows of hook-and-eye closures, so there's plenty of room to loosen or tighten the band as needed. As someone who's a 32DD, it can be tough to find bras that offer enough coverage but also aren't too loose in the band — and my only concern here is that I'm already wearing it on the tightest hook. That said, it shouldn't be an issue as long as this bra doesn't stretch out too much over time.\n\nThese are just a few reasons why, on my quest for the best bralettes for large busts, this one topped the list.\n\nI'll admit that I was super skeptical about the Honeylove SoftForm bra — mainly because there's no adjustability — but I was pleasantly surprised when I slipped it on. The soft and stretchy microfiber feels like a second skin, and there's just enough firm compression to make me feel secure and supported. I love that it's hardware-free with bonded seams, making it invisible under clothing, and the bonding at the cradle helps to lend a little extra lift.\n\nThe Honeylove SoftForm Bra is a great pick if you're concerned about side or back bulge — thanks to the ample coverage around the back and the thick, compressive fabric, it instantly smooths out any lumps and bumps.\n\nOne thing worth pointing out is that this bra does seem to stretch out a little as you wear it — which is a slight issue since you can't adjust the band or straps. Luckily, though, I did notice that it reverted right back to its original size after washing. This bra also seems to provide less separation than the crossover bra. I certainly wasn't dealing with that dreaded uniboob situation, but I did feel like my bust was pushed inward a bit.\n\nThere are two reasons why I don't usually buy bras with skinny straps. One, they typically aren't supportive enough for my fuller bust. Two, they tend to dig into my shoulders more than wider straps do. So, imagine my shock when this bra — which has extra slender straps — turned out to be my favorite in the Honeylove collection.\n\nMore recently, I learned that the majority of the bra's support actually comes from the band, not the straps. And the main reason why these straps often dig into my shoulders is that I tighten them too much to compensate for the bra's lack of support in the band. Fortunately, the Honeylove Silhouette Bra fits like a glove, and thanks to all the supportive features, I didn't have to tighten the straps so much that they left indentations in my skin.\n\nThe only drawback to this bra is that it has three hook settings on the band as opposed to four (which the Crossover Bra has). Luckily, the bra fit me snugly on the middle hook, meaning I still have room to tighten (or loosen) it as needed.\n\nIt's pretty easy to see why this shapewear piece has garnered thousands of five-star reviews. The SuperPower Short offers waist-to-thigh smoothing, and despite having a high level of compression, they really don't feel restrictive.\n\nIt definitely takes a little shimmying to get the SuperPower Short on, but that's to be expected with shapewear pieces like this. I was able to sit down and move around pretty freely in them, and never felt like I couldn't eat or breathe comfortably. Thanks to the anti-slip silicone strips at the top of the waistband and structured boning down the sides and upper back, I was relieved to find that SuperPower Shorts don't shift around or roll down. Plus, the BoostBands that encircle the upper back of the legs offer a nice, subtle booty-lifting effect.\n\nThe Super PowerShort features a seamless design, and for the most part, they remained undetectable under the variety of dresses, skirts, and jumpsuits I slipped on over them. The only time I saw the waistband show through a little was with a particularly skin-tight dress that's made with ultra-thin fabric.\n\nThe advantage to a shapewear piece like this is that you can wear your own preferred bra with it, making it a little more versatile than a lot of shapewear bodysuits. And since there are strategically placed tabs on both sides of the waistband, you can attach a set of straps for some extra support and staying power. I also really appreciate that there's a slit opening at the gusset so I can pee without having to fully undress.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty impressed with the products I tried from Honeylove. Some of the pieces tend to stretch out somewhat with wear, but I also think that's to be expected with anything that has Spandex in the construction. Fortunately, after washing, they seem to shrink back down again.\n\nThe seamless bras don't show underneath my clothes, and they're so soft and stretchy that I often forget I'm wearing them. Not only that, but they're remarkably supportive considering that they don't have underwire. My favorites are definitely the Silhouette Bra and the CrossOver Bra, both of which are fully adjustable and oh-so-flattering. The SoftForm Bra is nice for lounging around the house, but I personally feel like the other bras offer a little \n\nI can also say with certainty that I'll be using the SuperPower Short under a range of outfits, from fit and flare dresses to pencil skirts. While shapewear is never a necessity, and sometimes I'm more than happy to go without it, I definitely feel a little more confident when I'm wearing this under tighter-fitting garments.\n\nUltimately, what makes Honeylove's pieces stand out is how comfortable they are. As it turns out, beauty isn't pain.\n\nShop all Honeylove bras and shapewear here.\n\nFor bras, Honeylove recommends sizing up if you're in between cup sizes. If you're in between band sizes, it's best to size up if you want a looser and more comfortable fit or size down if you want a more supportive fit.\n\nFor bodysuits, it's best to size down if you're in between sizes since the material is stretchy. They also recommend sizing down if you are petite or if you have a small waist compared to your bust size. The only reason to size up would be if you have notably wider hips.",

    "fullText": "Some US presidents have more of the gift of the gab than others.\n\nThe American Presidency Project has tracked the length of every president's State of the Union address since 1964, with the timer beginning when the president opens with \"Mr. Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker.\"\n\nIn the State of the Union, which is mandated by the Constitution, presidents typically highlight their administration's accomplishments and lay out their legislative agenda in a speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nPresidents usually also introduce their legislative priorities in a joint address during their first year in office, a tradition started by President Ronald Reagan. Though this speech doesn't technically qualify as a State of the Union, it is widely regarded as such and is included in the American Presidency Project's dataset.\n\nOn average, State of the Union speeches from 1964 onwards have lasted 56 minutes and 24 seconds, according to the American Presidency Project. President Richard Nixon gave the shortest-ever State of the Union speech in 1972 at 28 minutes and 55 seconds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and President Bill Clinton have given eight of the top 10 longest State of the Union speeches in history. In 2025, Trump broke Clinton's record when his joint address to Congress clocked in at 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 32 seconds.\n\nIt's a record Trump could break again when he delivers the State of the Union on February 24 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nHere's how the top 10 longest State of the Union addresses stack up.",

    "fullText": "After cartel violence erupted across the Mexican state of Jalisco this week, images and videos of burning cars and buildings, shuttered storefronts, and cities grinding to a halt hit the news. Flights into and out of Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara were canceled. Residents were told to shelter in place and to ensure they had enough food and water. Tourists were on lockdown and frightened.\n\nI watched it all from far away in Seattle, where I'm currently traveling, as my phone lit up every 15 seconds with messages of panic, forwarded video footage, and WhatsApp voice notes from friends and loved ones on the ground in Puerto Vallarta.\n\nFor most people, Puerto Vallarta was just one of several cities mentioned in the news cycle, but for me it was different — it's been my chosen home base for the last five years.\n\nMy relationship with this city on Mexico's Pacific coast began more than a decade ago, on my first visit in 2013. At the time, Puerto Vallarta was just another reporting assignment at a beach destination, but something hit differently, and I kept returning. It became the place I ran to whenever I needed a break from real life. Each visit stretched longer. By much of 2024 and 2025, I was there full-time.\n\nWhen you spend that much time in a place, it stops feeling like an escape and becomes the backdrop of real life. You learn the traffic patterns, see familiar faces at the coffee shops and bars, pick up your mail. Routine sneaks up on you; it becomes home.\n\nYou also build relationships. As I watched footage of a still-smoldering flame-licked car skeleton at an intersection just a few blocks from my last address, I listened to voice notes from friends. Fear sounds different when it comes from people you love.\n\nYou don't need to be a seasoned traveler or an adrenaline seeker to feel comfortable there. There are direct flights, large resorts, familiar comforts, and an infrastructure built around welcoming visitors.\n\nPlus, it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous with that broad, blue curve of the Bay of Banderas and the jungle-covered crown of peaks that rise behind it.\n\nFor many Americans, Vallarta has been shorthand for \"safe Mexico.\" Could incidents like this change that perception? Inevitably, for some.\n\nTravel decisions are rarely driven by data alone. They are fueled by emotion, personal tolerance for uncertainty, and individual experience. As happens after virtually every high-profile incident in Mexico, reactions tend to fall into familiar categories. There will be people who write Mexico off forever as a country to visit or live. Others will decide to wait and see.\n\nAnd there will be people, like me, who are already itching to return because they understand something fundamental about moments like this: They're traumatic precisely because they are disruptions, not constants.\n\nViolence in Mexico is real. It's serious. It's also limited to very specific parts of a massive country. Mexico is vast and regionally complex. Episodes of cartel-related violence, while alarming, do not function as a constant across daily life in most destinations Americans visit.\n\nMoments like Sunday's violence highlight a perception gap that often shapes how Americans think about risk abroad versus risk at home. Americans tend to discuss violence in Mexico as though it exists in a fundamentally different category of danger. Yet in recent years, the US has developed its own unsettling familiarity with public acts of violence, mass shootings, random attacks, and sudden disruptions.\n\nThere is no longer a clean psychological divide between \"safe at home\" and \"dangerous abroad.\" We are, increasingly, navigating variations of the same reality.\n\nLiving in Puerto Vallarta has not made me dismissive of safety concerns. What happened across Jalisco is devastating and serious. But living there has grounded my understanding of the city in lived experience rather than episodic headlines. It has made moments like Sunday's violence feel personal without altering my relationship to Puerto Vallarta.\n\nWatching the videos didn't make me want to run further from Vallarta. If anything, it made me wish I were there with the community I love.\n\nSo, when do I plan to return? Soon. I'll be heading back to Mexico in early March, this time to Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, nearly 1,000 miles away from Puerto Vallarta. (Yes, Mexico is really big.) I have no hesitation about going. And, truthfully, if logistics allowed, I would go back to Puerto Vallarta this week. It's not just a vacation destination to me, and it's not just a clip on the news. It is nearly 13 years of memories, friendships, routines, and a sense of home that I have built over time.\n\nLike any place anywhere, Puerto Vallarta and Mexico are larger than their worst moments. Like any place you love, those moments do not erase the steadier, more enduring reality of everyday life that surrounds them.",

    "description": "The UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup said on Tuesday it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and global automakers.",
    "fullText": "Wayve is revving up its global robotaxi ambitions with fresh funding as it prepares to take on Waymo in London.\n\nThe UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup announced early Tuesday in the UK that it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and major automakers.\n\nThe funding round, which values the startup at $8.6 billion, includes $1.2 billion from investors including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Uber, as well as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis.\n\nIt also includes additional capital from Uber, which is tied to deployments of Wayve-powered robotaxis across the globe. The two companies have a deal to launch self-driving vehicles on Uber's app in over 10 markets worldwide, starting with London this year.\n\n\"We've been learning to drive on British roads for the last eight years, and so this is our home turf,\" Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve, told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nThe CEO said the latest funding round is key to pursuing the company's ambition to license its software to major automakers and robotaxi fleet platforms like Uber.\n\nUnlike Tesla or Waymo, Wayve is solely focused on developing software for other companies looking to deploy self-driving cars. It is not building its own fleet of robotaxis.\n\nKendall said owning a fleet is expensive, and Tesla's approach to building its own car can be a constraint since it limits the company to one vehicle platform.\n\n\"Everyone wants autonomy, but not everyone wants to buy a Tesla,\" he said.\n\nKendall added that Wayve's AI driver is designed to be generalizable — the same way a human can quickly learn to drive different cars and in new cities.\n\nThat allows Wayve's technology to quickly adapt to new driving environments and learn new road rules, from switching to the opposite side of the road to right turns at a red light, without relying on high-definition mapping and sensors, the approach taken by rivals like Waymo. It also allows the AI driver to be adapted by different automakers, which may have different sensor configurations on their cars, such as lidar or cameras.\n\n\"Because that's what we've built, it enables us to take this business model that enables high-margin software revenues,\" Kendall said.\n\nWayve says that over the past year, its fleet of Ford Mach-Es outfitted with its AI driver has driven in more than 500 cities across Europe, North America, and Japan without being trained on city-specific data.\n\nThe company is also planning to license its technology to carmakers as an advanced driver-assistance system like Tesla's Full Self-Driving, which handles most driving tasks with human supervision. Wayve has a deal with Nissan that will see its AI tech power the Japanese carmaker's ProPilot driver assistance system from 2027.\n\nThe UK-based startup has been testing its tech in London since 2017, and its public debut comes as the city's robotaxi scene gets increasingly crowded.\n\nWaymo is aiming to begin operating its autonomous vehicles in London, its first international location, this year, while Wayve vehicles will be joined on the Uber app by robotaxis from Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is also partnering with Lyft.",

    "description": "The HR and finance software company framed the technology as a growth opportunity on its Tuesday earnings call.",
    "fullText": "Workday is betting on artificial intelligence taking over more work.\n\nWhile software stocks — including Workday's — have sunk recently amid concerns over AI advancements, the company framed the technology as a growth opportunity on its Tuesday earnings call.\n\n\"We're working really hard to figure out how do we improve business process execution for our customers at a lower cost,\" CEO Anil Bhusri said.\n\n\"I think that's where the agentic model fits in. What can agents do to replace human labor?\" he said. \"And then obviously longer term, we've got to figure out what we're going to do with those humans that are displaced.\"\n\nBhusri's remarks came after Workday reported revenue and net-income growth for the January-ended quarter. Shares fell around 10%, however, as the company projected slower subscription revenue growth than Wall Street expected for the fiscal year ahead.\n\nA spokesperson for Workday said that Bhusri's comments were not about Workday planning to replace its employees or its customers' employees, but rather about industry-level shifts.\n\nBhusri said the outlook reflects that the AI products Workday is building aren't expected to generate meaningful revenue until later in the year.\n\nWorkday's stock drop marks another setback for the company, whose shares have slid in recent weeks amid a broader software selloff driven by fears that artificial intelligence could upend the industry.\n\nThe rout began in early February, tipping the sector into a deep bear market and spilling into adjacent industries as investors grapple with AI's disruptive potential. Other companies affected include LegalZoom, Thomson Reuters, and Okta.\n\nOn the call, Workday didn't directly address those concerns directly and instead emphasized its investments in agentic products to expand its footprint in HR and finance software.\n\nEarlier this month, Workday said it was laying off about 400 employees, citing a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities. A week later, Bhursi was renamed CEO, succeeding Carl Eschenbach, who stepped down. \n\nBhusri has held the top job three times before. He told analysts on Tuesday's earnings call that while he's optimistic about the business, he tends to set guidance cautiously and aim to outperform it.\n\n\"I don't know if you know you remember me when I was a CEO before, but I do try to be conservative on the guide and then beat it,\" he said.",

    "description": "The State of the Union will be broadcast across several major networks. Learn how to live stream the 2026 address online.",
    "fullText": "All eyes are on the Capitol ahead of the annual State of the Union address. Below, you can find everything you need to know about how to watch the State of the Union in 2026, including free live streaming options.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver the 2026 State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress beginning at 9 p.m. ET on Tuesday evening. The presidential address typically lasts at least an hour, especially in recent years, and is expected to cover a variety of policy subjects. The address typically serves as a reflection on the past year and looks ahead to the agenda for the year to come. After the speech, Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response. TV guides have the event blocked out until 11 p.m. ET.\n\nThe State of the Union will be held in the House of Representatives Chamber at the US Capitol building, and the event will be available to watch live across most major news networks and several streaming services. We've outlined some of the best ways to stream the event below, featuring international options.\n\nThe good news is that pretty much every major news network will carry full coverage of the event, including ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX, Fox News, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC), and NBC, among others.\n\nYou can watch these networks through one of the best live TV streaming services we've tested, such as DirecTV, Fubo, or Sling TV. DirecTV carries all of these channels in its MyNews genre pack, which costs $40 a month. Subscriptions come with a five-day free trial for new users.\n\nFubo and Sling TV are also solid options, though each is missing a few key channels. Fubo is a good option for ABC, CBS, FOX, and Fox News, but it's missing CNN, NBC, and MS Now. Subscriptions start at $56 a month for the Fubo Sports + News pack. New customers can get a five-day free trial and save on their first month of service.\n\nSling TV's Blue plan carries CNN, Fox News, and MS NOW, along with ABC, FOX, and NBC in select regions. Local channel coverage varies by region, so you should check what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. CBS is missing from all Sling plans. Sling Blue costs $50 a month with local channels.\n\nYou can live stream CBS directly through Paramount Plus Premium, which costs $14 a month. FOX and Fox News are available to live stream directly through FOX One, which costs $20 a month. At $17 a month, Peacock Premium Plus offers a live stream of NBC.\n\nSeveral of the networks' free counterparts — like ABC News Live, CBS News 24/7, LiveNOW from FOX, and NBC News NOW — will also carry coverage of the event. You can live stream most of these options directly on their respective websites, without creating an account.\n\nIn the UK, coverage will be available for free on the BBC website and TV channel. Special coverage will be available beginning at 8 p.m. ET or 1 a.m. GMT.\n\nIf you'll be traveling away from home, you can still keep up with your usual viewing options with the help of a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs are handy cybersecurity tools that let users temporarily change the virtual location on their electronic devices, so they can access their go-to websites and apps from anywhere. They're also instant ways to upgrade online security and privacy.\n\nNordVPN is one of the best options on the market. It's user-friendly, offers a massive selection of international servers, and has a 30-day money-back guarantee if you find that it's not what you're looking for. You can learn \n\nNote: VPN use is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content may constitute a breach of the terms of use for some services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

In a TruthSocial post, he wrote:\n\n“As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs. It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!”\n\nWithin hours, Trump signed a proclamation invoking Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose a new 10% global tariff for up to 150 days, later stating he would raise it to 15%.\n\nMajor gold giant shrinks as Trump-linked firm surges\n\nRich Dad Poor Dad buys Bitcoin again\n\nViral AI agent bans ‘Bitcoin,' ‘crypto’ mentions\n\nUS stock futures turned lower, with S&P 500 futures down roughly 0.8% and Nasdaq futures off about 1% following the renewed tariff push.

    "fullText": "The only thing better than one pair of Bose earbuds is getting two for the same price. Right now, the company is running a BOGO sale of sorts: When you buy a pair of either the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds ($299) you'll get a free pair of refurbished Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (a $249 value). Or, you can get the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds for $299 and get a free refurbished pair of first-gen QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (a $249 value).\n\nI've reviewed the Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen), and they have the best ANC I've ever tried. As the name implies, they're comfortable and offer a friendly, minimalistic user experience that I've come to appreciate after testing so many earbuds. The audio is nothing less than what I expect from Bose, and the immersive mode is incredible, making the music truly come to life. I also love their practical features, like the transparency mode coming on when you take one earbud out. Simple, yet so appreciated.\n\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have the sort of open-ear design that has been growing in popularity, likely because active noise-canceling tech has gotten so good that people have forgotten what nature sounds like. The Ultra Open Earbuds are Bose's stab at the trending tech, and they're pretty decent. But when you get a free refurnished pair of QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (1st Gen) along with them, they become a great option for those looking for an open-ear feel.\n\nThis BOGO deal is perfect for people who want to experience both ANC and an open-ear design. Both have very different uses: ANC is great when trying to focus or really get into your media. The open ear design is great for outdoor activities when you need to be aware of your surroundings, or when you want to interact with your environment, like in an office, or working with people. This is an affordable way to get earbuds for either situation.",

    "description": "These Galaxy devices can install Samsung's latest patches.",
    "fullText": "This is going to be a big week for Samsung. The company is making some major announcements at Galaxy Unpacked 2026 on Wednesday, revealing the next generation Galaxy S Series devices (which almost assuredly means the Galaxy S26), as well as some new AI updates. In the lead up to this event, Samsung is also now rolling out its latest security updates for its Galaxy devices—at least, some of its devices.\n\nSamsung's February security update contains 37 patches for issues the company discovered since the January update. This time, there are no critical patches, but there are plenty of fixes for \"High\" severity issues. According to SamMobile, 25 of these patches were provided by Google, which fix issues with Android in general, while the other 12 were specific to Samsung to patch issues within its own ecosystem. That includes issues for Emergency Sharing, Knox Guard Manager, Samsung Dialer, Samsung's Settings app, face and fingerprint authentication systems, and the PACM module—things that only apply to Samsung's own OS.\n\nNot all Galaxy phones are getting this update right away. Samsung is kicking things off with its Galaxy S25 series, meaning the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. It also appears to be rolling out to its latest foldable devices as well, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and Z TriFold. If you bought Samsung's latest and greatest—at least until the S26 series launches—you'll likely see the update in your Settings app imminently. If your Galaxy device is on the older side (or even one year older than the S25 series), you may need to wait a bit before the patches appear.\n\nSpeaking of waiting, Samsung started rolling this update out to Korean users first, so if you're in another region, you might not see it right away. But it does seem evident the patch is on its way, especially with Unpacked airing Wednesday.\n\nOnce the security update hits your device, open the Settings app, then choose either Software update or System updates. (This may differ depending on your device.) From here, depending on your carrier, tap either Download and install, Check for system updates, or Check for software updates. The latest update may begin downloading automatically, but if it doesn't, tap Download now. Finally, follow the on-screen instructions to install the update.",

    "fullText": "Samsung Unpacked 2026 is nearly upon us. On Wednesday, Feb. 25, Samsung will take the stage in San Francisco to make some pretty major product and feature announcements. Unlike some other big tech companies, however, Samsung isn't being 100% secretive here. The company has already told us that it will reveal the next Galaxy S Series, and while they haven't said exactly what it will be called, it's pretty safe to assume this will be the Galaxy S26 series. The rumors suggest Samsung has plenty of other updates up its sleeve, too, including the new Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy AI announcements.\n\nBased on the leaks and rumors, it seems the S26 series will likely be a small year-over-year update to the S25 series, which is largely to be expected from a smartphone OEM as big as Samsung. While there may not be too much incentive to update from the S25 series, users of older Galaxy devices, or older smartphones in general, may find the processor and camera upgrades worthwhile. There may also be unique features, like Privacy Display, which can make it more difficult for others to see your screen when they're not looking at it head-on. We'll have to see exactly which rumors pan out to know for sure.\n\nYou don't need to be seated in San Francisco in order to keep up with all the Samsung news, though. We'll be covering the event live as it happens, posting to this live blog throughout the day. That means we'll be reporting when Samsung reveals the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra; all the new features those devices come with; and any new accessories and AI advancements you can expect from the Samsung ecosystem.

    "title": "Two New Features in YouTube Premium Lite Just Made the Pricier Tier Unnecessary",
    "description": "Unless you're really into YouTube Music, you probably don't need to upgrade.",
    "fullText": "As Lifehacker has previously argued, YouTube Premium is probably the best streaming service for most people. Ads can eat into your free time faster than you might realize, and because YouTube's user-generated videos can be quite short, they're especially annoying there—and blocking them without a paid subscription is tough.\n\nYouTube Premium is also a bit pricey as streaming services go, at $14/month. Fortunately, the company also offers a \"Premium Lite\" plan that's much cheaper—and thanks to the recent addition of a few key features, it no longer pales in comparison to a full subscription. In fact, the $8/month YouTube Premium Lite may now be the best paid YouTube tier for most people.\n\nStarting today, YouTube Premium Lite now offers both background play and download options on most videos, features that were previously exclusive to a full YouTube Premium plan. The update is currently rolling out, so it might take a little bit for it to reach you, but the change essentially gives you parity with a full YouTube Premium plan on the vast majority of YouTube content. According to YouTube, the company has \"heard feedback about wanting these additional features included in the service,\" which prompted the change.\n\nNow, for the same $8/month price, you can get most of the full YouTube Premium experience, normally a $14/month value. The only catch? You'll still get ads when streaming music and music videos, hence the \"most videos\" disclaimer. Ads also \"may appear when you search or browse,\" but as for interruptions while watching non-music content? You should be in the clear.\n\nEssentially, unless you're a big YouTube Music user, getting YouTube Premium Lite instead of a full-cost subscription is now a no-brainer. There are a few smaller bonuses you'll be leaving behind, like the ability to \"Jump Ahead\" (instantly skip frequently skipped parts of a video, usually ad reads), but your subscription will also be around half the price. You win some, you lose some.\n\nThe only real gap now, at least for me, is for households with lots of different YouTube viewers YouTube Premium Lite still only applies to one profile at a time, so if everyone in your household wants to have their own separate algorithms instead of sharing a profile, you'll need to get YouTube Premium Family, which costs $23/month, giving six people in the same household the benefits of a full YouTube Premium subscription. My husband and I have pretty different viewing habits, so we're unlikely to switch to this cheaper tier any time soon. But if you live alone or you're OK sharing a profile, you might as well save yourself some moolah.\n\nAlternatively, you can also still get a YouTube Music Premium plan for $11/month. That removes ads and allows background play and downloads, but only for music and music videos. It's essentially the opposite of YouTube Premium Lite, and faces stiff competition from the likes of Spotify and Apple Music. Personally, I'd just pay the extra for a full YouTube Premium subscription, which has all the same benefits of YouTube Music Premium, but also works for non-music content and only costs $3/month more.\n\nStill, while adding new features to Premium Lite is ultimately a discount, it does follow a move from YouTube to block people from accessing background play for free. Perhaps this is Google's attempt at a compromise?",

    "title": "Now Discord Is Saying It's Delaying Global Age Verification",
    "description": "Discord is taking its age verification rollout back to the drawing board.",
    "fullText": "Since it was announced a little over a week ago, Discord's global age verification rollout has been a bit of a mess. First, the chatroom and voice chat company had to clarify that it won't require all adults to upload an ID or facial scan to prove how old they are, as the initial post left many users with that impression. Second, the announcement came shortly after one if its existing customer service partners was breached, which lead to hackers getting a hold of user information, including government IDs provided for age verification. Third, users discovered that Discord had partnered with Peter Thiel-backed company Persona for an experiment in the UK, which raised flags about surveillance and security, and saw some personal identifying information being uploaded to the cloud when users thought it would be processed on-device. Now, Discord is admitting that it messed up, and is trying to make amends.\n\nIn a post on its website, titled \"Getting Global Age Assurance Right: What We Got Wrong and What's Changing,\" Discord admitted that its new \"teen-by-default\" age settings haven't had the warmest reception. The company said that it \"knew this rollout was going to be controversial,\" but added that \"we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we're doing and why.\" It then reiterated that \"over 90% of users will never need to verify their age to continue using Discord exactly as they do today,\" while still doubling down on providing \"real safeguards\" for teenage users. That said, corporate damage control aside, the company also said it's going to delay the global age verification rollout, and is going to make concrete changes to attempt to address user concerns.\n\nTo that end, Discord is making the following changes to its controversial global age verification rollout:\n\nGlobal age verification will now be delayed from March to the \"second half of 2026.\" Until that point, age verification will only remain active in areas where it is legally required, like the UK and Australia.\n\nOn launch, Discord will provide a list of every age verification vendor it works with and their practices.\n\nAll age verification partners will only offer facial scanning on-device.\n\nBefore global age verification launches, Discord will develop alternative age verification methods beyond scanning your face or providing an ID, like providing credit card information instead. However, such methods might not be legally allowed in certain area, like Australia, the UK, and Brazil.\n\nDiscord will add spoiler channels as an option for communities, so they don't need to use age-restricted channels to hide age appropriate, but still sensitive, content anymore. This will allow accounts that aren't able to age verify to access these channels.\n\nThe company will publish a technical blog once age verification launches going into detail on how its systems work, and will add age verification metrics, including how many users were asked to verify or which age verification methods they used, to ongoing transparency reports.\n\nEssentially, the idea is that if you're an adult Discord user (and you live in a region that allows it, which Discord says may not be everywhere), Discord will likely be able to use factors like your signup email, your account age, and your activity to guess your age. If so, you'll be automatically filtered into the correct age group and will be able to keep using the app as usual. Otherwise, you'll be labeled a teen, and will need to verify by either scanning your face, providing a government ID, or using one of Discord's new alternative methods. Or, you could keep using the app unverified, but you'll lose access to age-restricted channels and any content Discord thinks is inappropriate enough to block for you.\n\nTo that end, not much has changed about Discord's end goals, and the company did acknowledge that \"we know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all.\" However, Discord also said that its hand is being forced in regions including the UK, Australia, and Brazil, with \"Europe and multiple US states close behind.\" In scaling age verification globally, Discord says it wants to \"show regulators that it's possible to verify age without collecting identity,\" also stating that \"we don't want to know who you are. We just need to know whether you're an adult.\"\n\nTo be fair, that still seems to involve knowing who users are to some extent, as you'll still need to hand over some type of personal identifying information to verify, or rely on Discord's age prediction to collect information to estimate your age in the background. But as a show of good faith, Discord acknowledged its \"experiment\" with Persona, and that Persona's use of off-device facial scanning did not meet its bar for privacy.\n\nWhat happens next is unclear. Discord's made a lot of promises, but now it has to follow through on them. The company also didn't provide a strict deadline for its age verification rollout, so its possible it could continue to get pushed back in regions that don't legally require it. However, Discord is also up for for an IPO sometime this spring. Certainty and a happy consumer base will likely make investors happy, but that probably also means keeping regulators and concerned parents appeased. Continue to expect compromises, especially when Discord has already come under fire for exposing teens to sensitive material and adult conversations before.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that Americans can't sue the U.S. Postal Service, even when employees deliberately refuse to deliver mail.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing for a majority of five conservative justices, said the federal law that generally shields the Postal Service from lawsuits over missing, lost and undelivered mail includes “the intentional nondelivery of mail.”\n\nIn dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that while the protection against lawsuits is broad, it does not extend to situations when the decision not to deliver mail “was driven by malicious reasons.” Justice Neil Gorsuch joined his three liberal colleagues in dissent.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Republican administration had warned that a ruling for Konan would have led to a flood of similar lawsuits against the cash-strapped Postal Service.\n\nKonan, who's also a real estate agent and an insurance agent, claims two employees at a post office in Euless, Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, deliberately didn’t deliver mail belonging to her and her tenants because, she alleges, they didn’t like that she is Black and owns multiple properties.\n\nAccording to court documents, the dispute began when Konan discovered the mailbox key for one of her rental properties had been changed without her knowledge, preventing her from collecting and distributing tenants’ mail from the box. When she contacted the local post office, she was told she wouldn’t receive a new key or regular delivery until she proved she owned the property. She did so, the documents say, but the mail problems continued, despite the USPS inspector general instructing the mail to be delivered.\n\nKonan alleges the employees marked some of the mail as undeliverable or return to sender. Konan and her tenants failed to receive important mail such as bills, medications and car titles, according to the lawsuit. Konan also claims she lost rental income because some tenants moved out due to the situation.\n\nAfter filing dozens of complaints with postal officials, Konan finally filed a lawsuit under the 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows some lawsuits against the government. The case focused on the reach of the special postal exemption to the law.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA new Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests that Americans are increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump’s age and state of mind.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted online between February 18 and 23, measured the attitudes of 4,638 American adults. It found that 89% of Democrats, 30% of Republicans, and 64% of independents believe that the president is becoming “erratic with age.” Taken altogether, 61% of respondents described Trump that way.  Forty-five percent, meanwhile, still believe that he “is mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges.” Forty-nine percent say he is not.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of respondents indicated that “elected officials in Washington, D.C.” more generally “are too old to represent most Americans.”\n\nTrump’s approval rating ticked up two points to 40% and net approval rating went up by four points to -18%. The former number had  stood pat at 38% in the previous two Reuters/Ipsos polls, which were conducted in mid-February and late January, when his net approval rating came in at -22% and -21%, respectively.\n\nThe president’s approval rating has slipped with among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics since February of last year, but most precipitously with that last group, from 36% to 29%. His economic approval rating has also taken a notable dip over that timeframe, from 41% to 36%.\n\nThe post Most Americans — Including 30% of Republicans — Believe Trump Is Becoming ‘Erratic With Age’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Larne extended their lead at the top of the Irish Premiership but by just one point as they played out a 1-1 draw with Linfield at Inver Park.\n\nLeroy Millar gave the leaders a first-half lead, but the Blues hit back after the break through Adam Frizzell with Millar later shown a red card.\n\nThe result means Gary Haveron's side, without a win in four league games, hold a three-point advantage on Coleraine with Linfield five behind.\n\nGlentoran made ground on the leaders as Pad Hoban and Jordan Stewart hit two goals apiece in a 4-0 win at Cliftonville to move to within eight points of Larne with two games in hands.\n\nBottom of the table Glenavon claimed away to 2-2 draw at Ballymena United with Kian Corbally giving the hosts the lead late in the first half before Paul McGovern levelled minutes later.\n\nNathaniel Ferris gave the Lurgan Blues the advantage in the second period, but they were pegged back by Sean Murray with the game ending level.\n\nLarne opened the scoring on 13 minutes as, after Rohan Ferguson produced a stunning save to deny Kirk Millar, Larne broke up the other end of the pitch and Leroy Millar was played in behind by Matty Lusty and confidently slotted past the onrushing Chris Johns.\n\nLinfield had the better of the chances after falling behind most notably from Kyle McClean who had a low volley well saved before Millar failed to get the necessary power on a back post header. For Larne, Matt Ridley glanced a header just wide from a Chris Gallagher corner.\n\nDavid Healy brought on Adam Frizzell at the break and that turned into an inspired move as the former Derry City man appeared to get the final touch on a Sam Taylor corner albeit it could well have been an own goal.\n\nEither way, the Blues were level but the game turned somewhat niggly and bitty with free-kicks being dished out at great frequency by referee Chris Morrison.\n\nThe game was simmering away and it all boiled over on 80 minutes when goal-scorer Milar was sent off for a studs-up lunge on Ethan McGee.\n\nUltimately, the best chance for the visitors was another effort from Frizzell but his looping volley dipped too late to trouble Ferguson meaning it was honours even at Inver Park.\n\nAfter a quiet opening at Solitude, the Glens came closest to breaking the deadlock after Ryan Cooney let fly from 25 yards, but his dipping, curling effort was pushed to safety by an alert Lewis Ridd.\n\nDeclan Devine's men continued to threaten from set plays and went close as MJ Kamson Kamara met Danny Amos's inviting corner, but failed to hit the target.\n\nThat pressure should have told minutes later when Pat Hoban out-muscled Shaun Leppard and raced through with Lewis Ridd to beat, only for the Cliftonville goalkeeper to stand tall and deny the former Derry City striker.\n\nAfter the interval, the away side maintained their momentum as Ross Clarke cut in from the right to exchange passes with Aaron McEneff before seeing his right-footed strike from 20 yards tipped behind by Ridd.\n\nThe breakthrough arrived just after the hour mark when Pat Hoban converted coolly from the penalty spot after Joe Toole's high challenge on Aaron McEneff prompted Tim Marshall to point to the spot.\n\nThe visitors doubled their advantage midway through the second half as MJ Kamson Kamara diverted Ryan Cooney's corner into the path of substitute Stewart, who pounced to head home from close range.\n\nThe points were effectively secured five minutes later when Stewart collected possession from McEneff under no pressure and curled into the far bottom corner.\n\nDeep into injury time, Hoban rounded off a memorable night for Declan Devine's men after latching onto a mistake from the Cliftonville rearguard and slotting home his 19th league goal of the season.\n\nBallymena almost struck within the opening two minutes when Kian Corbally's pass split the Glenavon defence but keeper Jacob Carney was quickly off his line to block Success Edogun's effort with his body.\n\nGlenavon's best opening of the first half came when full-back Paddy Burns whipped in a cross from the left which Paul McGovern met with a glancing header and Ballymena keeper Brad Wade was relieved to see the effort whistle narrowly wide.\n\nBallymena broke the deadlock a minute before the interval when Matthew Clarke got to the bye-line and stood up a cross which David Toure headed back towards the far post, leaving Kian Corbally with a close-range headed tap-in.\n\nRemarkably, Glenavon levelled in first-half injury time when Paul McGovern kept his cool to drill home a low shot through a ruck of players after United keeper Brad Wade had kept out a couple of initial efforts.\n\nBallymena had the ball in the net again before the half-time whistle but Aaron Jarvis' effort from a Dylan McGeouch free kick was ruled out for offside.\n\nThe Lurgan Blues went in front on 57 minutes as they broke quickly with Luke McGerrigan feeding Peter Campbell. He tried to curl a low shot into the far corner with the ball eventually breaking for Nathaniel Ferris to slide home from close range.\n\nBallymena levelled on 62 minutes when half-time substitute Sean Murray's low shot trundled past Carney and into the net with the aid of a couple of deflections.\n\nGlenavon almost won it in the closing stages when Ferris' low shot was cleared off the line by Ballymena defender Daithi McCallion.",

    "description": "Elon Musk has never been one to hold back on social media, and his latest outburst has the internet buzzing. The Tesla CEO took to ... Read More",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been one to hold back on social media, and his latest outburst has the internet buzzing. The Tesla CEO took to X, the platform he owns, to blast The New York Times over a decade-old opinion piece that recently popped back into the spotlight.\n\nThe article in question suggested viewing pedophilia through a mental health lens rather than purely as criminal behavior. Musk's sharp words have reignited debates about media responsibility and child safety, drawing in politicians, influencers, and everyday users. Let's break down what happened, why it matters, and the wave of reactions it sparked.\n\nBack in October 2014, The New York Times published an op-ed by Margo Kaplan, a law professor at Rutgers University. Titled \"Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime,\" the piece argued that attractions to children should be treated as a psychiatric issue.\n\nKaplan pointed out that the DSM-5, the manual used by mental health professionals, classifies pedophilia as a paraphilic disorder when it causes distress or leads to harmful actions. She stressed that while any abuse of children remains illegal, recognizing the attraction as a disorder could help people get therapy before they act on impulses.\n\nThis wasn't a news story from the paper's reporters; it was an opinion column meant to spark discussion. Kaplan used examples from other mental health conditions, like substance abuse disorders, where treatment focuses on prevention rather than punishment for thoughts alone. At the time, it drew some criticism, but it faded from headlines.\n\nFast forward to early 2025, and the piece resurfaced amid broader talks about child exploitation cases, including references to high-profile figures like Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. Senator Mike Lee from Utah shared a screenshot of the headline on X, calling the idea \"delusional\" and insisting, \"No, it's a crime.\" His post quickly gained traction, setting the stage for Musk's involvement.\n\nMusk didn't hesitate to jump in. Replying to Lee's post, he labeled The New York Times \"utterly disgusting\" for running the op-ed. In another related comment, he went further, calling the outlet \"evil propaganda.\"\n\nThis fits Musk's pattern of clashing with mainstream media; he has accused them of bias and sensationalism on multiple occasions. For instance, he has previously criticized The Times for their coverage of Tesla and his personal life, once even tweeting that he might create a site to rate journalists' credibility.\n\nWhat made this slam stand out was the timing. Musk has positioned himself as a vocal advocate for child protection online. He has pushed for stricter content moderation on X to combat child exploitation material, and he often shares posts highlighting threats to kids. Users on the platform amplified his words, with his response racking up millions of views in hours.\n\nOne X user echoed Musk by saying the framing was \"dangerous\" and eroded trust in legacy media. Musk's history adds layers here; he once faced a defamation lawsuit after calling a British cave explorer \"pedo guy\" during the 2018 Thai cave rescue drama. A jury cleared him in 2019, ruling the term was an insult, not a factual claim.\n\nKaplan's piece wasn't defending child abuse; it made clear that actions like molestation are crimes deserving punishment. Instead, she highlighted how stigma prevents people with these attractions from seeking help.\n\nShe cited studies showing that many pedophiles never offend, but fear of legal repercussions keeps them silent. For example, she referenced Germany's Dunkelfeld project, which offers confidential therapy to non-offenders and has reportedly reduced risks.\n\nCritics, however, argue this approach blurs lines. They say labeling it a disorder risks normalizing something society views as morally wrong. Senator Lee's post captured this sentiment, rejecting any nuance and focusing on protection.\n\nThe op-ed also discussed legal barriers, like mandatory reporting laws that might deter therapy seekers. Kaplan suggested reforms to balance help with safety, such as better access to treatment without automatic criminalization for attractions alone. Despite these points, the headline's stark phrasing has fueled misinterpretations, leading some to claim The Times was soft on pedophilia.\n\nThe online response split sharply, with many echoing Musk's disgust. One X user wrote, \"Elon calling out NYT’s disgusting 2014 piece loud & clear — pedophilia is a CRIME, not a disorder to normalize. No debate. No excuses. Protect kids first, always.\"\n\nNot all agreed, though; some defended the op-ed's intent to promote treatment and reduce harm. A commenter noted, \"If The New York Times thought they were publishing nuance, they ended up serving nonsense. Elon calling them 'utterly disgusting' is blunt but when the subject is pedophilia, there’s no room for clever spin.\"\n\nOthers brought up unrelated scandals, like Epstein files, to question media priorities. The debate spilled into broader talks on U.K. policies releasing offenders for space, with Musk previously saying, \"I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.\"\n\nThis episode highlights ongoing tensions between free speech, mental health advocacy, and zero-tolerance for child harm. Musk's platform amplified the debate, showing how old content can fuel new fires in today's fast-paced online world. As discussions continue, one thing is clear: topics like this touch deep nerves, prompting calls for accountability from all sides.",

    "fullText": "The family of a toddler murdered by his grandparents has criticised the delay of a review into social services' contact with the little boy.\n\nEthan Ives-Griffiths, two, was murdered by Michael and Kerry Ives at their home in Garden City, Flintshire, in August 2021. Their daughter, Shannon Ives – Ethan's mother – was convicted of child cruelty and of causing or allowing his death.\n\nThe North Wales Safeguarding Board had expected to receive a report in early 2026, looking into agency contact with Ethan. However, the board said further interviews were still needed, and it is not known when the report will be published.\n\nEthan's paternal grandmother, Kellie Shone, said any delay was \"another failure\".\n\nToddler murdered by grandparents 'failed' by system\n\n'My son was killed by his evil grandparents'\n\nCouple guilty of murdering two-year-old grandson\n\nShone, who lives in Flint, said: \"Ethan was failed by social services when he needed the protection the most.\n\n\"Now, after everything our family has been through, the delay in releasing the review feels like another failure.\n\n\"Not just to us, but to the public who also deserve answers - and so does every child who relies on the system to keep them safe.\n\n\"When a child dies after system failures, delaying the independent review only deepens concern and undermines confidence in those responsible for protecting vulnerable children.\n\n\"There must be accountability when the system meant to protect children fails.\n\n\"The public deserves clear answers about what went wrong and what will change moving forward.\"\n\nEthan died in August 2021 after suffering a catastrophic brain injury which the prosecution claimed was caused by one, or both, of his maternal grandparents.\n\nDuring the seven weeks he lived with them, he became severely malnourished and dehydrated, and had more than 40 injuries on his body when he died.\n\nEthan was placed on the child protection register after his mother, Shannon, and father, Will Griffiths, split in June 2021.\n\nThe toddler, his siblings and his mother went to live with the Ives.\n\nA trial at Mold Crown Court in 2025, heard Ethan should have been seen every 10 days because he was on the register.\n\nHowever, the last time he was seen by a social worker was 22 July 2021 - more than three weeks before he died on 16 August.\n\nSocial workers and health visitors made a number of attempts to see Ethan in the weeks before his death, but were given excuses.\n\nDuring one visit, on 5 August, a social worker remained on the doorstep for about 45 minutes - because of Covid restrictions - but did not see Ethan because his mother said he was napping.\n\nThere was no answer when the social worker and a health visitor attempted to visit Shannon Ives and Ethan on 12 August.\n\nShannon Ives did not respond to a call the next day either.\n\nAt the conclusion of the trial last year, Flintshire Council said: \"In keeping with our determination to protect those who need us most\", it was \"co-operating with the North Wales Safeguarding Board, who are leading a multi-agency review of this tragic case\".\n\nThe North Wales Safeguarding Board is overseeing a Child Practice Review. It had anticipated the report being presented to the board in the early part of 2026.\n\nBut following a \"learning event\" held earlier this month, further work is needed.\n\nThe safeguarding board told BBC Wales: \"At present, the board is unable to provide an exact publication date.\n\n\"It's always difficult to predict exactly when a Child Practice Review will be published as the reviewers will always be led by the information which comes forward.\n\n\"On this occasion, and following the initial learning event held in February, the panel identified the need to undertake further interviews to ensure that the knowledge that informs the review is as robust as possible.\n\n\"As a result, the publication is likely to be later in 2026.\"\n\nMichael Ives was jailed for life in October 2025, with a minimum term of 23 years. His wife Kerry was also jailed for life, with a 17-year minimum term. Ethan's mother, Shannon, was jailed for 12 years.\n\nBBC Wales has learned there will be a hearing next month to decide whether to increase the sentences of Michael and Kerry Ives.\n\nA spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said: \"We received a request for this sentence to be considered under the Unduly Lenient Sentence (ULS) scheme.\n\n\"The Law Officers referred Michael and Kerry Ives' sentences to the Court of Appeal as they agree that both their sentences appear unduly lenient. It is now for the court to decide whether to increase the sentences.\"\n\nLast surviving teacher of Aberfan disaster still remembers faces of the children who died\n\nI'm a doctor but will never be able to pay off my ever-growing student debt\n\nSon lived with mum's body for months after Covid lockdown let him hide murder",

    "fullText": "All teams in The Hundred are \"committed to selection being based solely on performance\", said the competition's eight franchises and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\n\nIt comes after sources told BBC Sport last week that Pakistan cricketers are not being considered for this summer's tournament by Indian-owned sides at next month's auction.\n\nPlayers from Pakistan have not featured in the Indian Premier League (IPL) since 2009 because of diplomatic tensions between the two countries.\n\nThe ECB has now reiterated its commitment to tackling discrimination and said \"players must not be excluded on the grounds of their nationality\" in a joint statement with The Hundred team franchises.\n\n\"All eight teams commit to selection being based solely on cricketing performance, availability, and the needs of each team,\" read the statement.\n\n\"The ECB is committed to ensuring there is no place for discrimination, and has regulations in place to take robust action to tackle any such conduct.\n\n\"Players must not be excluded on the grounds of their nationality.\"\n\nIn messages seen by the BBC, a senior ECB official indicated to an agent that interest in his Pakistan players would be limited to sides not linked to the IPL.\n\nFour of The Hundred's eight franchises - Manchester Super Giants, MI London, Southern Brave and Sunrisers Leeds - are now at least part-owned by companies that control IPL teams.\n\nAnother agent described the situation as \"an unwritten rule\" across T20 leagues with Indian investment.\n\nThe ECB and the franchise teams said they were committed \"to ensuring The Hundred continues to be a competition that is inclusive, welcoming and open to all\".\n\n\"We want The Hundred to feature the very best talent from across the world, and will continue working proactively to ensure that the competition is a benchmark for inclusivity,\" it added.\n\nHundred deals 'not in our hands' - Pakistan's Farhan\n\n'A shame' if Pakistan players excluded from Hundred\n\nThe ECB has come under pressure to address the reports since England limited-overs captain Harry Brook said it would be \"a shame\" if Pakistan players were excluded from playing in The Hundred this year.\n\nSixty-seven players from the country are among those to have registered for next month's auction, with the competition due to run from 21 July-16 August.\n\nThe UK government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have held discussions with the ECB over the issue.\n\nA DCMS spokesperson told BBC Sport: \"The Hundred plays a significant role in attracting new audiences and inspiring grassroots participation.\n\n\"It is important that the tournament remains free from discrimination and nationality should not be a deciding factor in the selection of players.\n\n\"The ECB has assured us that it has reminded teams of the same expectation.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London also told BBC Sport: \"Cricket should be open to everyone, and excluding players for no other reason than their nationality would be unacceptable.\n\n\"The Mayor calls on the ECB to take action to address the situation ahead of the auction.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight in September in a rematch of their 2015 blockbuster, but with both men nearning 50 years old, is it a fight that can deliver?",
    "fullText": "Floyd Mayweather, 49, and Manny Pacquiao, 47, will contest their rematch in a professional bout in Las Vegas on 19 September.\n\nIt is a weird fight, \"a carnival\" as Steve Bunce aptly puts it. It is not one that boxing fans have been clamouring for. Nor were they ever considering how the first fight went in 2015 – delivered five years too late and as stale as feared.\n\n\"Carnival\" boxing events, however, have become Netflix's trademark. The streaming platform values one-off, big impact fights that may have little shelf life but burn bright in the moment.\n\n\"It's not the first carnival fight on Netflix,\" 5 Live Boxing expert Bunce told 5 Live Breakfast.\n\n\"We've had Mike Tyson against Jake Paul. We've had Jake Paul against Anthony Joshua.\n\n\"We're so far down the freak fight road that this one doesn't actually raise any alarms bells.\n\n\"It'll just be two men, way past their best in a legitimate fight that is nothing more than an ego-driven sparring session.\n\n\"This circus just gets deeper and deeper and deeper.\"\n\n'White humiliated Aspinall' - Hearn warns Benn after exit\n\nBoxing has a long history of carefully constructed mismatches. Mayweather championed and perfected the genre, fighting UFC star Conor McGregor in a competitively pointless but massively lucrative bout in 2017.\n\nMcGregor was a novice and Mayweather carried him through ten rounds before bringing an end to the contest.\n\nNormally, exhibitions and \"freak fights\" were confined to the top of some luxury building with the wealthy paying a massive fee to see their favourite boxer up close.\n\nThe great Muhammad Ali reaped the benefit of this custom, fighting Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976 in front of 14,00 in Tokyo.\n\nIrish boxer Mick Conlan believes money will be the driving factor for both men.\n\n\"They are two of the greatest of their generation but they are very old and must need money or this fight wouldn't be happening,\" he tells BBC Sport Northern Ireland.\n\nThis is the sell, an anything can happen event where anything is definitely not going to happen.\n\nMayweather brought this tradition to the big stage when he fought McGregor on pay-per-view at the T-Mobile Arena and people have been following his example ever since.\n\nWith Jake Paul turning the art into the biggest industry in boxing with Netflix in recent years, it is perhaps no surprise Mayweather has returned to get in on the act.\n\nBut unlike many of these weird and worrying events - see Paul v 58-year-old Mike Tyson - this contest seems at least from a health point of view, easy to digest.\n\n\"They are both similarly aged,\" Bunce says.\n\n\"One's 49, one's 47. They've had similar amount of fights.\n\n\"In theory, that's a good thing. They are equal in decay or decline. So they're not going in with a young dangerous fighter.\"\n\nIt is yet to be confirmed what exactly the rules will be, but the rematch will be a professional bout and count to each man's record.\n\nPacquiao has been in and out of the ring professionally and in exhibitions for years.\n\nHe was the oldest welterweight champion at the age of 40 in 2019 and came close to making it aged 46 when he drew with WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in the summer of 2024.\n\nMayweather has not fought professionally since becoming 50-0 by beating McGregor in 2017, but he has competed in eight exhibition bouts since then, including against YouTuber and WWE star Logan Paul.\n\nBoth men will be subject to extra tests as they are over the age of 40, but neither will be expected to fail.\n\n\"The claims are that this will be a real fight,\" Bunce adds.\n\n\"They'll wear 10oz gloves, 12, three-minute rounds and there will be no special rules – allegedly.\"\n\n\"[In boxing] we either have exhibition fights or a real fight. This one is a blend of the two.\"\n\nDespite the fact a fight between two boxers nearing 50 is unlikely to set the sporting world alight, the competitive aspect seems secondary to the product.\n\n\"[The first fight] generated unbelievable sums of money. The gate itself, the tickets, generated $72m,\" Bunce says. \"[But] it was a dreadful fight. It was a stinker.\"\n\nMayweather, however, is a master promoter, Pacquiao is loved by millions – the build-up will be as much the offering as the fight night.\n\nNetflix has over 200m households globally and the bout will take place at the Sphere in Las Vegas which can hold 20,000.\n\nAfter what the UFC achieved visually with their event there in 2024, it could be a completely new kind of viewing experience for a boxing fight.\n\nNetflix has offered a fresh approach to fights, blending a big-show American style broadcasting with big-name expert analysts and presenters and drawing in the entertaiment world.\n\nAnd these are two legends of the sport reviving one of boxing's most famous rivalries of the last 50 years.\n\nThe appetite, as proven by Paul and Netflix's past success, is absolutely there.\n\n\"You wll naturally watch it,\" Bunce says and Conlan agrees.\n\n\"It's unwanted but then people will think, 'it's Pacquiao v Mayweather - of course I will watch',\" Conlan says.\n\n\"I would love Pacquiao to win,\" he adds.\n\n\"If he did, they'll probably do another one.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Scientists believe they’ve uncovered the meaning of some of the Moai stone monoliths found on Rapa Nui, better known as Easter Island. Here's the truth.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nScientists believe they’ve uncovered the meaning of some of the Moai stone monoliths found on Rapa Nui, better known as Easter Island.\n\nThe scientists analyzed soil in the vicinity of two of the Moai statues and found traces of banana, taro, and sweet potato, according to research published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.\n\nThese traces indicate the statues could have been used to celebrate the crop fertility of soils in the region.\n\nThe famed stone monoliths that tower over the island of Rapa Nui—colloquially known as Easter Island—have puzzled scientists for centuries.\n\nBut archaeologists and soil scientists studying the ancient Moai believe they’ve uncovered the meaning of the famous statues. Clues in nearby soils suggest the statues may have been placed there to celebrate the fertility of crops in the area.\n\nFor more than three decades, Jo Ann Van Tilburg, of the University of California, Los Angeles, has studied the origins of the Moai along with Rapanui artist Cristián Arévalo Pakarati and other members of the local community. They recruited soil scientist Sarah Sherwood, of the University of the South in Tennessee, to analyze the soil the base of two statues found peculiarly perched upright in the Rano Raraku quarry on the eastern part of the island, where most of the more than 1,000 Moai statues originated. (The scientists suspect that work in the quarry began around A.D. 1455.)\n\nThe team analyzed soils at the foot of two of the structures, which archaeologists believe were erected by or before A.D. 1510 to A.D. 1645, and found chemical evidence of common food crops. The soils revealed traces of foods like taro, banana, and sweet potato, according to research published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.\n\nThe findings suggest locals on the island may have actually utilized the quarry itself as a place to grow food.\n\n“When we got the chemistry results back, I did a double take,” Sherwood said in a statement. Soils across much of Rapa Nui are in poor shape—either highly eroded or leeched of the vital nutrients that help plants grow. Analysis showed that soils within the quarry are far more fertile than previously thought, with plenty of water and elevated levels of elements like calcium and phosphorus, which are essential in increasing crop yields.\n\n“This study radically alters the idea that all standing statues in Rano Raraku were simply awaiting transport out of the quarry,” Van Tilburg said in the same statement. “That is, these and probably other upright Moai in Rano Raraku were retained in place to ensure the sacred nature of the quarry itself. The Moai were central to the idea of fertility, and in Rapanui belief their presence here stimulated agricultural food production.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

Wrexham are owned by Hollywood actors and Swansea count former Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric and US television personality and billionaire Martha Stewart among their minority investors.\n\nIn terms of fame and worldwide reach, however, Snoop is on another level.\n\nFans had been lining up outside the stadium five hours before kick-off to get a glimpse of Snoop, who signed autographs and posed for photographs in the kind of sunshine that will have made the Californian feel at home.\n\nInside the ground, he had arranged for every single seat to have a Snoop and Swansea-branded towel inspired by those waved by supporters of his beloved American football team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOnce darkness had fallen, the show began.\n\nSwansea and Preston's players were still warming up when Snoop emerged to an explosion of noise and colour.\n\nThe visitors did not seem fazed, though.\n\nPreston had only brought around 200 fans for what was a sell-out. With tickets in the away end sold to Swansea supporters, this was a record number of home fans at a game in this stadium.\n\nYet the away fans were loudest during a first half in which their team led to puncture the party atmosphere.\n\n\"Snoop Dogg, what's the score?\" sang Preston's travelling contingent, before later chanting: \"Where's your towel gone?\"\n\nSat in the directors' box in a long Swansea puffer coat, which would not have looked out of place on the slopes of the Winter Olympics in northern Italy, this was Snoop's first experience of football's tribal fan culture.\n\nFortunately for him, he got to sample the soaring high of an injury-time equaliser as well, as substitute Liam Cullen headed the Swans level in the 95th minute.\n\n\"After the game, he [Snoop] came to the dressing room, spoke with the players,\" said Swansea head coach Vitor Matos.\n\n\"He's someone that likes to be involved. He was involved not only with us, but as well with the [US] Olympic team. He really loves sports.\n\n\"It's good for him to be involved. I'm happy that we have someone like him who loves the club, loves the city, wants to be here.\"\n\nWhen Swansea's American owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen brought Snoop in as a minority investor in July, the idea was not that the rapper would spend large amounts of his own enormous wealth on the club.\n\nInstead, the Swans wanted to increase their global appeal by tapping into Snoop's huge reach which includes more than 100m social media followers.\n\nSome at the club believe that could create business and sponsorship opportunities which could outstrip those they had when they were in the Premier League.\n\nGetting back to the top flight is the aim. After such a spectacular preamble, this first act at least produced a dramatic finish.\n\nNow Swansea and Snoop wait to see what the next episode brings.",

The new machine design directly targets growing demand for next generation AI chips, an area that has become a key focus across the semiconductor industry.\n\nFor investors watching ENXTAM:ASML, the bigger question is how this technology shift could influence customer investment plans and the competitive gap with other equipment makers. The reported 50% efficiency potential by 2030 may shape long term capacity decisions across foundries and integrated device manufacturers that rely on EUV tools.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for ASML Holding by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on ASML Holding.\n\n2 things going right for ASML Holding that this headline doesn't cover.\n\nThis EUV light-source breakthrough goes straight to the economics of chip production. If a tool can process around 50% more wafers per hour without needing extra floor space or duplicate systems, it can change how customers such as TSMC and Intel think about their long term fab build outs. For ASML, that can translate into a stronger case for its most advanced EUV platforms as fabs push to supply AI and high performance computing chips. It also reinforces why ASML is often treated as a way to get exposure to AI chip demand without choosing a specific chip designer. At the same time, a more productive tool could slow the need for incremental units at the margin if customers can get more output from each system, so investors may want to watch how pricing, service and upgrade revenues evolve alongside unit volumes, especially as U.S. and Chinese equipment makers work on competing technologies.\n\nThis EUV advance aligns with the narrative that ASML’s EUV and High NA platforms support productivity and cost reductions for chipmakers, which can support equipment adoption tied to AI demand.\n\nIf High NA adoption timing or tool maturity proves more complex than expected, the focus on current generation EUV power gains could delay some of the earnings contribution that narrative writers associate with future platforms.\n\nThe news puts more weight on ASML’s installed base and upgrade potential, which is mentioned in the narrative, but the specific impact of higher light output on long term service and upgrade revenue may not yet be fully reflected.",

    "description": "After an immature winter, Harry Brook's mature and majestic century against Pakistan proved he is England's leader for the future, writes Matthew Henry.",
    "fullText": "Leaders in English cricket have come in many varieties.\n\nThere was Michael Vaughan the man-manager and Sir Andrew Strauss the strategist, who carefully planned England's route to the top.\n\nSir Alastair Cook and Heather Knight led through pure determination. Ben Stokes is as inspiring as they come.\n\nIt is unlikely Harry Brook will ever have the poise of Strauss or the aura of Stokes.\n\nBrook's penance in Pallekele - a T20 international century as good as any by an England batter, which secured victory over Pakistan and a place in the World Cup semi-finals - was the moment he truly became a leader for England.\n\nStunning Brook century leads England into semis\n\nBrook century blasts England into semi-finals\n\nYou know the story of Brook's winter by now.\n\nAn altercation with a nightclub bouncer in Wellington, a wasteful Ashes performance and a foolish attempt to hide the truth, for which he later had to come clean.\n\nFew England captains have toured with such oversized baggage.\n\nThousands of England fans travelled to Australia for the Ashes. Thousands more set alarms night after night, day after day back home.\n\nBrook owed them a performance and boy did he repay them here. It was the most mature of knocks after the most immature of winters.\n\nIt is curious that Brook, a man with a T20 World Cup winner's medal from 2022 and a Test triple century, could perhaps have been accused of not having delivered a match-winning knock on the very biggest stage.\n\nHis highest score against Australia is 85 in 10 Tests.\n\nBoth of his hundreds against India last year were in Tests England lost - the second in the fifth Test at The Oval when his careless dismissal opened the door for India's fightback to draw the series 2-2.\n\nBrook's highest score at the last 50-over World Cup was 66 and the previous T20 edition 53. Those doubts are silenced now.\n\nBecause, with his side teetering - Phil Salt out first ball and England soon 58-4 as they chased 165 to win - Brook stood up like never before.\n\nMany have questioned Brook's brainpower during his England career and at times this winter he has made it hard not to wonder.\n\nThere were the drives in Perth and Brisbane and the reverse sweep in Adelaide before even considering the issues off the field.\n\nHis 'beer smash' celebration when making a hundred against Sri Lanka last month showed another flash of childishness.\n\nBut those close to Brook and the England dressing room have always spoken of his sharp cricket brain.\n\nThis innings was the perfect example.\n\nIn 2022 he used a four-month break after the death of his grandmother to shed pounds not because he needed to fill his time or appear on the next series of Love Island.\n\nHe spoke then about how it would help him run twos in the 2024 T20 World Cup, thus getting himself back on strike to hit boundaries in the latter overs.\n\nIn Pallekele, Brook's 100 from 51 balls was destructive, brutal at times, but he also ran nine twos.\n\nIt meant he could both attack - England took 11 from the second over and 17 from both the sixth and the 11th as Brook pushed on - but also go down the gears after wickets fell.\n\nWhen Tom Banton was caught behind off Usman Tariq, Brook calmly took singles off his next five balls.\n\nIt was a perfectly paced innings, showing his wish for batters not to be \"too careful\" does not simply mean whack boundaries from every ball.\n\n\"I know we were losing wickets, but my job was still to try to go out there and put them under pressure throughout,\" Brook said.\n\nThat is the smartness people talk about.\n\nThere is, of course, one other man Brook owed a performance to.\n\nHis coach Brendon McCullum was pushed to the brink by the Ashes defeat. Some will say he has already gone beyond the point from which he can return.\n\nBut in securing a semi-final spot, Brook has nudged England closer to a result that will keep the New Zealander in a job should he want it.\n\nBrook could yet be the Mark Robins to McCullum's Sir Alex Ferguson - granted the New Zealander has a long way to go.\n\nBrook has always been one of Bazball's most devoted believers.\n\nMcCullum is the only Test coach Brook has had, the only permanent coach he has worked under as white-ball captain. He often speaks straight from the McCullum philosophical handbook.\n\nIt was no surprise, therefore, that he credited his coach with the plan to promote Brook from number five to bat at three for the first time in his international career.\n\nIt was McCullum who put the idea to his captain early on Tuesday morning, less than 12 hours before the start of the game.\n\nSome England players, like Jacob Bethell, who was nudged down to number four by Brook's promotion, were told earlier in the day, but the rest were not fully made aware of the plan until McCullum spoke in the pre-match huddle.\n\n\"Baz was the mastermind there,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He had the discussion with me this morning about going up the order and trying to maximise the powerplay.\"\n\nMcCullum's move means England now have a free hit in their final Super 8 match against New Zealand on Friday. After that they will travel to India for a semi-final.\n\nSomehow, after stuttering and struggling to this point, they are the closest side to winning the title. Australia have gone already and defending champions India could follow before the week is out.\n\nIf the co-hosts remain, one of South Africa or West Indies will surely be knocked out.\n\nBrook is two wins from becoming the fourth England men's captain - after Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler - to lift a World Cup.\n\nHe is leading his way, which will bring moments that will leave you scratching your head. Now is the time for Brook to be backed, however.\n\nHe is not only a captain, one sharp tactically on the field and supremely talented with the bat, but a leader.",

Bring on whoever's to come.\"\n\nIt was a mindset shared by his manager.\n\nNewcastle have achieved their initial target of reaching the next round, but head coach Eddie Howe does not want his side's journey to end yet.\n\nHe believes his team can \"raise our game and compete with anybody\".\n\n\"We have to believe in ourselves,\" he said. \"We have seen the best of ourselves when we have gone into cup games and one-off games, where we have been able to rise to whatever challenge we have had in front of us.\n\n\"We will have to go in with that mindset again, whoever we get in the next round.\"\n\nNewcastle are certainly enjoying life back at Europe's top table.\n\nHowe's side are the top scorers in the Champions League with 26 goals, and have won six games in a single campaign in the competition for the first time.\n\nIt has been quite a turnaround in the last two-and-a-half weeks.\n\nHowe was the first to admit he was not doing his job \"well enough\" after his side were booed off by a section of supporters following a 3-2 defeat against Brentford in the Premier League in their previous game at St James' Park earlier this month.\n\nThe Newcastle head coach embarked on some soul searching in the aftermath of the loss, while his players set out to \"fight for the manager\".\n\nNewcastle have won four of their last five games in all competitions since, and secured a place in the knockout stage proper.\n\nGiven the revenue gap between the Premier League and a number of clubs on the continent, and the competitiveness of the top-flight, outsiders may question whether that should necessarily come as a huge surprise.\n\nEven beleaguered Tottenham Hotspur, who are hovering above the relegation zone in the Premier League, finished in the top eight of the league phase.\n\nYet the manner of Newcastle's six Champions League victories against Qarabag, Benfica, PSV Eindhoven, Athletic Club and Union Saint-Gilloise were far from foregone conclusions.\n\nQarabag, for instance, had drawn against Chelsea and defeated Benfica, Eintracht Frankfurt and Copenhagen. Newcastle hammered the Azerbaijan Premier League champions.\n\nAlthough Howe wanted more from his much-changed side in the 3-2 second-leg win on Tuesday night, Newcastle have shown they can battle the continent's elite on their day.\n\nNewcastle drew 1-1 against holders Paris St-Germain in the French capital last month and suffered a narrow 2-1 defeat at the hands of Barcelona in their opening game of the competition.\n\nNo wonder, then, defender Dan Burn feels Newcastle can \"compete with anybody\" at their best.\n\n\"We've shown that, especially against Paris St-Germain, how good we can be,\" he wrote in his programme notes.\n\n\"I think we elevate our game going into those games because there are bigger, better teams at this stage of the competition.\"\n\nNewcastle have a lot of work to do in the Premier League, where they currently lie in 11th place.\n\nBut they are no longer stargazed by life in the Champions League.\n\nEven playing in the opening round of the competition was a new experience for the majority of those at the club last time around.\n\nThis was a stage these players dreamed of playing on – nothing said that quite like Murphy's wide-eyed wonder as he lined up for the Champions League anthem for the first time at the San Siro in 2023 – but they now feel like they belong.\n\nNot only are the squad able to draw on the experiences of their last campaign, when they faced Paris St-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan in the group of death, they have also accumulated big-game experiences in the interim. This includes, of course, ending a 70-year wait to win a major domestic trophy by beating Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final last March.\n\nThat is why Friday's last 16 draw will bring eager anticipation rather than trepidation as former Newcastle striker Dwight Gayle knows better than most.\n\n\"Knowing all of the boys in the dressing room, they will be excited about who they get in the next round,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"They will buzz off someone like Barcelona and that will create an unbelievable tie.

    "title": "A Secret Soviet Plan to Nuke America From the South Pole Was Working. Until UFO Hunters Looked Up.",
    "description": "When a glowing crescent appeared over Moscow in 1967, alien enthusiasts panicked—unaware they were tracking a 3-megaton weapon meant to bypass American radar.",
    "fullText": "During the late 1960s, a top-secret Soviet program to sneak nuclear weapons around U.S. early warning radars was mistaken for a rash of UFO sightings by Moscow’s citizens. The weapon, known as FOBS, created a mysterious pattern in the night sky that many mistook for signs of alien visitation.\n\nIn the spring of 1967, people living in the western Soviet Union noticed something odd in the sky at dusk: a mysterious crescent-shaped sliver of light, about the size of the moon from most directions but larger from others. The crescent appeared six times in 1967, always at the same time of day, before it finally disappeared.\n\nAccording to veteran space expert James Oberg at Air & Space Magazine, the Soviet press speculated they were UFOs, and UFO enthusiast groups sprang up across the country to record the sightings.\n\nSuddenly, after the sixth incident, Soviet press coverage of the incidents abruptly stopped. Someone in Moscow with the right clearance realized that the crescents in the sky at sundown were actual evidence of a top-secret weapons test—one that violated existing treaties on the deployment of nuclear weapons into space.\n\nThe “UFO” sightings were actually test launches of the R-36 Orb, a secret nuclear space missile. Developed from the SS-9 Scarp intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-36 Orb was designed to rocket into low-Earth orbit and de-orbit over the United States. Launched in a southern direction, the weapon could pass over the South Pole and then come at the United States from the direction of Mexico, bypassing the network of early warning radars facing north.\n\nThe trip would be longer, but would catch the Americans by surprise, allowing the Soviets the chance to detonate a 2-3 megaton thermonuclear weapon wherever they might choose.\n\nThe R-36 was a so-called “first strike” weapon. The only logical reason to have such a weapon was to use it first in a nuclear war, as a surprise weapon meant to destroy American leadership and nuclear command and control systems. The problem? The R-36 was not accurate.\n\nOn average, half of R-36s launched in a war would land within three miles of their target. That’s not a deal breaker with a 5-megaton warhead, but it does rule out destroying enemy missile silos. Still, the R-36 would retain use when it came to wiping out the White House, Pentagon, U.S. nuclear bombers sitting on the tarmac, and other vital U.S. installations in a surprise attack.\n\nThe Soviet military conducted six tests of the R-36, each at the exact time of day when the missiles were illuminated but the recording cameras were in shadow. The illuminated crescent was caused by the weapon’s braking maneuver, in which the de-orbit engine fired up and spewed exhaust as the weapon turned 180 degrees. This created a clearly visible letter “C” in the early evening sky. This slowed the R-36 down so that it entered low earth orbit, and would be fired back up again later to begin the de-orbiting process.\n\nAlthough the Soviets initially explained away the tests as launches of “scientific research satellites,” American intelligence eventually figured out what they were up to and called the USSR out on it. Within eight months of the first test, according to Oberg, the U.S. claimed the R-36 was a first-strike weapon that used an orbit/de-orbit scheme.\n\nThis would run afoul of the Outer Space Treaty, which was nearing completion and which would ban the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit. It would also run counter to U.N. Resolution 1884, passed in 1963, which called on the U.S. and U.S.S.R. not to place nuclear weapons in space.\n\nThe Soviet Union never came clean about the R-36. Eighteen of the weapons were based in silos near Tyuratam, and later banned by the SALT II arms control treaty. The weapons had long since been obsolete, foiled by the deployment of new, southward-facing American early warning radars and Soviet ballistic missile submarines that could launch an attack from that direction much more quickly. The UFOs, it turned out, were not so unidentified after all.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

An NPR investigation, published the morning of the president’s State of the Union address, alleges that the DOJ withheld dozens of documents from its Epstein release that may pertain to a woman who accused Trump and Jeffrey Epstein of sexually abusing her when she was a minor. The FBI took the allegations against the president so seriously that it reportedly sent agents to interview his accuser a total of four times in 2019. However, only documents regarding the first interview have been released, independent journalist Roger Sollenberger revealed this month.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal authorities are barred from conducting an “unsupervised, wholesale search” of electronic devices that they seized from a Washington Post reporter’s Virginia home while investigating allegations that a Pentagon contractor illegally leaked classified information to the journalist, a magistrate judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Porter said he will independently review the contents of Post reporter Hannah Natanson's devices instead of allowing a Justice Department “filter team” to perform a search. Porter said he balanced the need to protect Natanson's free speech rights with the government's duty to safeguard top secret national security information.\n\n“The Court finds that seizing the totality of a reporter’s electronic work product, including tools essential to ongoing newsgathering, constitutes a restraint on the exercise of First Amendment rights,” he wrote.\n\nThe case has drawn national attention and scrutiny from press freedom advocates who say it reflects a more aggressive posture by the Justice Department toward leak investigations involving journalists.\n\nFederal agents seized a phone, two laptops, a recorder, a portable hard drive and a Garmin smart watch when they searched Natanson’s home in Alexandria, Virginia, on Jan. 14. Last month, Porter agreed to temporarily bar the government from reviewing any material from Natanson’s devices. Tuesday's order extends that prohibition.\n\n“The Court’s genuine hope is that this search was conducted — as the government contends — to gather evidence of a crime in a single case, not to collect information about confidential sources from a reporter who has published articles critical of the administration,” he wrote.\n\nThe Post sought an order requiring the government to immediately return the devices to its reporter, but Porter denied that request. He said it is reasonable for the government to keep nothing more than the “limited information” responsive to the search warrant. The rest of the contents must be returned to Natanson, he ruled.\n\nAllowing the government to search a reporter’s work material, including unrelated information from confidential sources, “is the equivalent of leaving the government’s fox in charge of the Washington Post’s henhouse,” Porter wrote.\n\nPentagon contractor Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones was arrested on Jan. 8 and charged with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents. Perez-Lugones is accused of taking home printouts of classified documents from his workplace and later passing them to Natanson.\n\nThe newspaper’s attorneys accused authorities of violating legal safeguards for journalists and trampling on Natanson’s First Amendment rights.\n\nJustice Department attorneys argued that the government is entitled to keep the seized material because it contains evidence in an ongoing investigation with national security implications.\n\nThe FBI began investigating after the Post on Oct. 31 published an article containing classified information from an intelligence report, according to the government. The Post reporter co-wrote and contributed to at least five articles that contained classified information provided by Perez-Lugones, authorities said.\n\nNatanson has been covering Republican President Donald Trump’s transformation of the federal government. The Post published a piece in which she described gaining hundreds of new sources from the federal workforce, leading one colleague to call her “the federal government whisperer.”\n\nThe Post says the seized material spanned years of Natanson’s reporting across hundreds of stories, including communications with confidential sources.\n\nThe Justice Department has internal guidelines governing its response to news media leaks. Last April, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued new guidelines restoring prosecutors’ authority to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to hunt for government officials who make “unauthorized disclosures” to journalists.\n\nThe new guidelines rescinded a policy from Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration that protected journalists from having their phone records secretly seized during leak investigations.\n\nPerez-Lugones, 61, of Laurel, Maryland, has remained jailed since his arrest. He held a top-secret security clearance while working as a systems engineer and information technology specialist for a government contractor.\n\nInvestigators found phone messages between Perez-Lugones and the reporter in which they discussed the information that he provided, authorities said. “I’m going quiet for a bit ... just to see if anyone starts asking questions,” Perez-Lugones wrote after sending one of the documents, according to the government.",
