    "fullText": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Dejounte Murray converted a slashing layup fewer than 20 seconds into his first game in nearly 13 months.\n\nHe capped off his 13-point performance with another driving layup off the glass to give the New Orleans Pelicans a five-point lead with 1:04 to go in a 113-109 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night.\n\n“I’ve been through a lot,\" Murray said. \"I keep my chest out, chin up, smiling. And I’m just ready to see where it goes from here.”\n\nMurray's playing time was limited to 25 minutes in his comeback from a ruptured right Achilles tendon, but Pelicans coach James Borrego made sure to save some of those minutes for closing time, or, in this case, winning time.\n\n“He looked like his old self. He didn’t miss a beat,\" Borrego said. \"For that to be his first game, I felt him on both ends of the floor. ... He was fantastic. Really proud of him and just happy for him to embrace this moment.”\n\nMurray assisted on three baskets, grabbed a couple of rebounds and had a steal, but also committed five turnovers.\n\nZion Williamson, who scored a team-high 26 points, made note of Murray's on-court communication and leadership.\n\n“He has a way of just keeping everybody engaged, even when you get frustrated,” Williamson said.\n\nWhen the game ended, Murray's daughter ran onto the court and hugged her father. When Murray reached the locker room, “his teammates just shouted him out,\" Borrego said.\n\nThe coach described it as \"a massive celebration in there for him — the journey he's been on, the year he had.”\n\nMurray said his teammates' celebration of him “was great, but I'm ready for the next game.\"\n\nThe Pelicans have 23 games left this season. Murray left little doubt about the role he expects to play in all of them.\n\n“I'm hungry,” Murray said. \"I'm starving.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's not every day you can talk to a basketball.\n\nMORE:Can anyone break Glen Rice's insane NCAA record this year? Glen Rice weighs in\n\nBut that's exactly what The Sporting News did last week, having been granted the unique opportunity to chop it up with animatronic internet sensation Old Ball — as well as the three-headed brain trust behind his operation.\n\nThat brain trust is Funny or Die alums Ben Bayouth, Adam Aseraf and Christian Heuer, who now handle Old Ball's shenanigans via their own Benched Studios.\n\nOld Ball got a chance to hang out with NBA royalty at the Los Angeles Clippers' home arena, Intuit Dome, during All-Star Weekend.\n\nAs of this writing, Old Ball has notched over 438,000 Instagram followers and close to 250,000 TikTok fans.\n\nAfter talking with Bayouth, Aseraf and Heuer, The Sporting News got into it with Old Ball himself.\n\nThe Sporting News: Old Ball, what was your favorite moment of All-Star Weekend? Did you like the new All-Star game tournament format?\n\nOld Ball: \"Loved the new format. Ty Lue and Ballmer must have found the reboot button on Kawhi because that guy was automatic. My favorite moment was housing a bacon-wrapped hot dog outside Intuit Dome. My least favorite moment was discovering I am not built for street meat at 2 a.m.\"\n\nHow did you feel about this year’s Slam Dunk Contest?\n\n\"Look, Gary Payton Senior once told me there’s guys who dunk on people and guys who CREATE dunks. Gordon, LaVine, McClung – those are creators. I think we gotta get more creative with the dunks. Give me a Superman over a 7-footer. Give me a 360 windmill over a bonfire. Hang glide from the rafters and crater the Earth with your dunk supremacy. \"\n\nWould you have been comfortable being dunked? There were a lot of misses this year. It would probably not be ideal to have been Jase Richardson’s ball.\n\n\"Dunked? I watched the warmups and started updating my will. I need two pumps and a pep talk just to stay inflated.\"\n\nThere’s been a lot of chatter recently that All-Star Weekend is washed and needs a change. What would you alter about the format?\n\n\"I actually liked the format this year. Felt like those guys were playing hard. I think it’s all about having that one dude that doesn’t want to lose. This year, it was Wemby. He set the tone. You got in the lane with the Frenchman, you were gettin’ smeared into Creme Brulé.\"\n\nI’ve read in other interviews that you had a shot at the pros in the ’90s, and subsequently were in a shed for three decades. What do you miss most about ’90s basketball? What do you miss most about the shed?\n\n\"How about the mid-range jump shot? How about a 130-point game being a rarity? But I digress, these cats today have game – you can’t hate on that. As far as the shed, I miss those cold winter nights where I had nothing to entertain me except a rogue cob web the wind blew onto my face that wouldn’t fall off for months. Oh wait, I don’t miss that at all. Nah, dude. My shed days are over.\"",

    "fullText": "Braves manager Walt Weiss proves he was the right hire with one simple Ronald Acuna Jr. move originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are looking to right the wrongs of the 2025 season. Injuries were the biggest problem last year, preventing the team from finding a rhythm — and the same issue has already surfaced in 2026 with Spencer Schwellenbach sidelined.\n\n“The Braves opened camp this morning with an unwelcome update on talented young righty Spencer Schwellenbach. He’s been placed on the 60-day injured list due to inflammation in his right elbow, per Mark Bowman of MLB.com. The team’s hope is that the 25-year-old is dealing with bone spurs and not something more nefarious,” MLB Trade Rumors’ Steve Adams wrote.\n\nThe Braves also face future challenges when it comes to Ronald Acuña Jr., particularly regarding how to manage payroll.\n\n“The Braves must also account for future extensions for other core players, making payroll allocation a delicate exercise. Retaining Acuña long term is a priority, but accomplishing it will not be easy. Bellinger pulled in $162 million despite his up-and-down career thus far. Signing Acuña will almost certainly require more, both in total dollars and years,” HTHB’s Chase Owens wrote. “With each big-money contract we see like Bellinger or Kyle Tucker or Bo Bichette, it feels increasingly likely that Ronald would have no trouble finding a deal worth at least $300 million if not significantly more.”\n\nNew manager Walt Weiss is already setting the tone for the team, making subtle but impactful moves in Spring Training.\n\n“A three-run first the day after benching the regulars. Walt is a genius,” Braves reporter Mark Bowman wrote.\n\nThis type of decision from Weiss has set a tone not just for the preseason, but for the regular season as well. Atlanta struggled offensively last year, and some believe former manager Brian Snitker’s laid-back approach may have been part of the problem.\n\nThe Braves are aiming for a big season, and moves like these will be critical for Weiss. Atlanta is determined to return to the playoffs after missing them for the first time in a long while.",

    "fullText": "Chiefs GM Brett Veach has broken the silence on speculation surrounding Travis Kelce’s retirement. Notably, the Chiefs missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014 and finished with a disappointing 6–11 record. Since then, the media has speculated that Kelce will retire soon. However, the Chiefs’ tight end has expressed his desire to continue his NFL career.\n\nChiefs GM Brett Veach gives an update on Travis Kelce amid retirement buzz and ahead of the 2026 NFL season. Interestingly, Veach’s comments come less than a week after the team’s head coach, Andy Reid, discussed Kelce’s retirement plans.\n\nVeach revealed that the team is focusing on regrouping and re-strategizing as Kelce’s future with the Chiefs remains undecided. On February 24, Veach shared in a press conference, “I think we’ve kind of taken a different approach with Travis in the sense that I think we’ve kind of prepared for either scenario.”\n\nThe Chiefs’ general manager also emphasized that they are in continuous contact with Kelce and are managing the situation through dialogue. Veach said, “Coach had mentioned on Friday that he’s had great dialogue with Travis on our end, myself, Chris Shea, Travis’ crew, we’ve had some good dialogue there — and I’m sure we’re going to see him here just like we will all the other players’ agents and we’ll continue that dialogue.”\n\nVeach recently wrapped up his 19th year in the NFL and ninth year with the Kansas City Chiefs. Towards the end, he lavished praise on the 36-year-old tight end and hoped that he would return to the Chiefs.\n\nVeach expressed, “Travis is the best, he’s an icon, hopefully he comes back and we’ll just kind of let that process play out.”\n\nPreviously, Coach Andy Reid disclosed that Kelce had casually discussed the matter with him but hadn’t conveyed his final decision yet. Reid said (via NFL Media), “No, there is communication, though. That’s the main thing. I’ve said this before: As long as there’s communication, I’m good. That means people want to move forward. I think that’s where Trav is. I’m not trying to put words in his mouth at all, and I try to give him some space here.”\n\nThe post Chiefs GM Gives Update on Travis Kelce Ahead of 2026 Season appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Four Arizona Cardinals are set to get raises in 2026, and it isn't because of a contract extension. These players have earned league \"proven performance\" salary escalators.\n\nPlayers not orginally drafted in the first round can earn fourth-year salary escalators, based on playing time and/or recognition.\n\nThe details come from the collective bargaining agreement, via Over the Cap.\n\nThe Level One PPE is earned if a player participates in a certain percentage of a team's offensive or defensive snaps in two of his first three seasons, or averages that percentage of offensive or defensive snaps over his entire first three years. For 2nd round picks, the average is 60%, and (as was the same in the 2011 CBA) for 3rd-7th round picks it is 35%.\n\nThe Level Two PPE is earned if a player participates in at least 55% of a team's offensive or defensive snaps in all of his first three seasons.\n\nThe Level Three PPE is earned if a player is selected to a Pro Bowl on the original ballot (not as an alternate) in any of his first three seasons.\n\nA level-one player will make the salary of a restricted free agent original-round tender — about $3.6 million.\n\nA level-two escalator will get the level-one salary, plus $250,000 (about $3.85 million)\n\nA level-three escalator will earn the salary of a second-round restricted free agent tender, more than $5.8 million.\n\nThree players earned level-one escalators.\n\nWilliams, Stills and Higgins will make about $3.6 million in salary in 2026. Stills and Higgins were scheduled to make the league minimum of $1.145 million.\n\nOne player — receiver Michael Wilson — qualified for level 2, so he will make more than $3.85 million in 2026.\n\nWilliams will likely start the season on injured reserve. The rest will have their roles again.\n\nWilson could see a contract extension.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "“Few newly promoted sides have managed what we have recently; there are even fewer fan bases that could ever be as passionate as we are, week in, week out. It is important that we remember this”, writes Milo Challis.",
    "fullText": "Sunderland’s second home loss of the season came against Fulham in what was a pretty terrible spectacle. However, the reaction to the loss – and not the poor performances on the pitch – are arguably the main talking point from a disappointing weekend.\n\nThe 3-1 loss to Fulham was a poor watch. Two dismal performances came from two teams who showed precious little quality for much of the game. Fulham eked out a win from being the more clinical of the two teams, but 4 goals flattered what was perhaps the worst game of football we’ve seen at the SoL this season.\n\nYet despite the poorness of the performance, some perspective is necessary. Sunderland sit 12th in the table with 9 wins, 9 draws, and 9 losses – perfectly balanced, some might say. This is, by no means, an awful place to be, and whilst this predicament is less than ideal considering our excellent start to the season, we need to remain level-headed in our expectations.\n\nSunderland have exceeded expectations all season. We have played well and deserve every one of the 36 points we have won so far. Whilst there are doubts creeping in from the fanbase regarding our defensive acumen of late, it’s important to stick behind the team and trust that we will return to the form we showed at the start of the season.\n\nIt was saddening, therefore, to see people streaming out of the ground well before the whistle – especially considering how well we’ve played in every other game at home this season. For a club who have a penchant for scoring last-minute goals and whose slogan is literally ‘Til the End’, it was frustrating to see the stands almost empty by the time the final whistle eventually sounded.\n\nAs the club’s recent season ticket renewal drive has highlighted, the home crowd this season has been vital to our impressive season. This showed at times during the Fulham game: this crowd is loud and brutal and a genuine fear for teams visiting.\n\nBut it needs to be present for the entire game. These lads on the pitch are only human, and watching thousands of fans stream out after conceding a third goal doesn’t bode well for the confidence on the pitch.\n\nMany fans will argue with this sentiment. I’m sure many will tell me that as loyal fans they felt let down by the performance and wanted their frustrations acknowledged. I can understand this, but I can’t agree with it. Whilst it is fair to feel let down and frustrated by a game where we were so off the pace from our normal form, it hardly feels fair on the team that the ground empties after one poor performance.\n\nInterviews from Ballard and O’Nien support this notion. As a club, we knew we were in for a tough ride at times in our first season back. The players and playing staff have admitted as much themselves, but it is to their testament – and ours as a loyal fanbase – that these big losses have come few and far between this season.\n\nSunderland will bounce back. Xhaka’s return will make certain of that, but it is important to remain strong and as committed as ever. Once again, the lads are human. Form is temporary and will fluctuate; that’s natural, but it will be much easier for the lads to regain with the full voice and confidence of the 12th man behind them.\n\nContinuing on the vein of humanity, it has been tough to see the horrendous abuse Mundle has received in the light of Sunday’s loss. It is tough to see a young player scapegoated, yet a worrying trend has begun – especially with a culture of outing specific players.\n\nUnfortunately, it feels like the abuse Mundle has been getting has been the natural escalation of an unacceptable smear campaign. Criticism will always be a natural part of the game, but an unhealthy obsession with pointing out one player’s flaws should not be.\n\nFortunately, it will only ever be a minority of people who feel the need to react so poorly. Furthermore, it is still to be seen whether the abusers are genuinely Sunderland fans or chancers who don’t understand enough about our game to know or comprehend that football isn’t played by one man alone but a team of people of backgrounds and origins from far and wide.\n\nPlayers like Mundle bring immense value to the team because they bring different styles and different abilities. He will always be a valued member of this team for two simple reasons: the first being the role he played in our success last season, the effort and passion he brought in the fallout of losing our best player at the time and what he did to make the position his. The second is that he has so much more yet to give.\n\nMundle was electric against Oxford and showed us what a talent he really is. What he needs now is the weight of the world’s best fanbase behind him – arms around him and lifting him up. With the wages these players are on, it is often easy to lose ourselves in the performance side of football, which too often makes us forget that lads like Mundle are only 22 – all young men doing their best to kick on and grow.\n\nRomaine is also representative of a larger group of players in this Sunderland squad: a band of players with those diverse backgrounds I alluded to earlier. If Mundle is receiving abuse based on the colour of his skin, his ethnicity and his background, what impression does that give the other players on our side?\n\nSunderland AFC is wonderfully diverse. The city and its fans welcomed me as someone who had fallen in love with the place, despite being born outside the city’s boundaries. It is important that we look at this situation and realise our influence as the Red and White army. This piece does not serve as a rant, nor is it a demand for better. But it’s a reminder of actually quite how brilliant we are. Few newly promoted sides have managed what we have recently; there are even fewer fan bases that could ever be as passionate as we are, week in, week out. It is important that we remember as much, it is important that we now circle around our own, and it is imperative that we do what we can to push our lads onwards and upwards. Haway the lads.",

    "title": "On This Day (25th Feb 1961): Ralphy Goodchild’s Hat-Trick Heroics at Elland Road",
    "description": "Goodchild’s first-half hat-trick may have sent shock waves to White Hart Lane, but fear not Spurs he will probably not be selected!",
    "fullText": "Spurs wily manager Bill Nicholson watched from the Elland Road stands as Sunderland blew Leeds away in a first-half display of skill, pace and power.\n\nWith his Spurs side making the journey to Roker Park the following Saturday in the 6th Round of the FA Cup and with the Black Cats having already seen off Arsenal and Liverpool as well as Norwich, Nicholson had plenty to think about if his dream of being the first manager to steer a side to the double of league and FA Cup winners was to materialise.\n\nHe would not have known whether to laugh or cry upon hearing the news after the game that Sunderland’s hat-trick hero Ralphy Goodchild (who could have easily scored five let alone three), would probably not be selected for the cup tie if young maestro Willie McPheat had recovered from his ankle injury. The Spurs boss must have wondered how good McPheat was, given Goodchild had a magnificent game and took his three goals with some style.\n\nBoth Leeds and Sunderland were hovering just below Liverpool, Ipswich, Middlesbrough and Sheffield United who were jostling for the two promotion spots.\n\nLeeds had beaten Sunderland at Roker Park earlier in the season when two former players — player/coach Don Revie and Colin Grainger (the Singing Winger) — had inspired a two-goal half-time lead that Sunderland could not claw back as they lost a nip-and-tuck game by three goals to two.\n\nRevie was not fit for this game, but Colin Grainger would be playing, alongside future Scotland captain Billy Bremner and future England centre-half Jack Charlton (who would go on to spend his entire playing career with Leeds from 1950-1973).\n\nSunderland’s results had improved as the season had progressed and the side (especially the defence) became more settled. Injuries in the forward line meant that apart from nineteen-year-old Ralphy Goodchild coming in for his first game of the season for McPheat, eighteen-year-old John Dillon retained his place on the wing for the experienced Jack Overfield, who was still making his way back after injury. The young Scot had made his debut against Middlesbrough in September of this season and had taken his chance in mid-January with Overfield’s injury, getting better game on game to the point of which it was not a foregone conclusion that Overfield would start once fit again!\n\nThe game got off to a rip-roaring start (if you were a Sunderland fan). Sunderland ripped Leeds apart in a first half that had the Black Cats positively purring and the Peacocks running around like frantic chickens.\n\nGoodchild might have scored in the very first minute as he missed a ‘sitter’ only a few yards out and with only goalkeeper Humphries to beat.\n\nWith Stan Anderson and Jim McNab pulling the strings Sunderland took the lead with a well-worked goal on four minutes. Dillon found Goodchild with an inside pass, he squared it to Ian Lawther whose powerful shot deflected off Charlton on the way into the net.\n\nTwo minutes later Lawther charging down the left wing slid a pass to McNab who managed to stab the ball forward to Goodchild as he was tackled. ‘Ralphy’ was on this in a flash and hit an accurate low shot past the despairing dive of Humphries to take a two-goal lead.\n\nIt only took four further minutes for Lawther to feed Goodchild racing into the box. His powerful shot cannoned off the post and into the back of the net. Three goals in eight minutes was devastating football, Leeds responded by giving Jack Charlton licence to roam upfield but this only served to create more space for the eager Sunderland forwards.\n\nOn twenty-four minutes Leeds did pull a goal back. Colin Nelson was having a right old tussle with Colin Grainger (honours even at the end of this game). Nelson was harshly adjudged to have fouled Grainger just outside the box. The singing winger hit the right note with Leeds fans as he got up to blast the free-kick at goal. His shot hit an outstretched Nelson leg but fell kindly to Smith lurking three yards out, who prodded the ball past Wakeham in the Sunderland goal.\n\nFor the next quarter of an hour there was no further scoring, but the Lads created two very good chances that were spurned and Jack Charlton had a powerful header well saved by Wakeham. Had this gone in it could have made the second half quite interesting to say the least. It was Sunderland though who scored just before half-time to put the game almost out of Leeds reach. This goal started with a great pass out of defence from McNab to Lawther. The Belfast-born centre-forward fed the ball on to Goodchild, who speeding forward, beat his marker and slammed the ball past Humphries for a first-half hat-trick.\n\nAfter such a devastating first half, the second half was a tamer affair. Sunderland with one eye on the big game to come the following weekend contained Leeds to the extent that it was not until the eighty-third minute that a shot was registered on Wakeham’s goal. It was a very good shot from Billy Bremner from twenty yards out and did angle past Wakeham for United’s second goal, but it did not affect the result of this game.\n\nAlf Greenly, writing in the Journal, was full of praise for the team’s performance. Claiming the first-half performance would have demolished better teams than Leeds, who for forty-five minutes were completely outclassed. Stan Anderson and Jim McNab were singled out for the effective manner in which they broke up Leeds attacks and kept feeding their forward line with a good range of long and short passes. There were honourable mentions for Len Ashurst and his total domination of Leeds winger Francis and Colin Nelson’s battle with Colin Grainger. Greenly of course donated much print to the hat-trick hero Ralphy Goodchild, describing him as “the happiest man in the Sunderland party”. Greenly went on to praise the attitude of the team in general and Goodchild in particular who he explained did not expect to be playing in the big cup tie against Spurs the following weekend but had no complaints! In fact, Ralphy anticipated (correctly) that he would be turning out at Barrow in the North Regional League for Sunderland reserves rather than a packed Roker Park against the best team in the top tier!\n\nSunderland went on to play an historic cup tie against Spurs the following week in front of 61,000 fans. Willie McPheat not only returned from injury for this game, but scored the equaliser that prompted Spurs captain Danny Blanchflower to say “I have never known a crowd atmosphere like the one here at Roker. I could not hear myself think let alone shout instructions. We were very relieved to hear the final whistle and to still be in the competition…..It was almost as if they sucked the ball into the net”.\n\n1960/61 saw Spurs historically do the double that season for the very first time, Bill Nicholson would acknowledge the closest his team came to failing that season was in the cup tie at Roker Park.\n\nMeanwhile on a field far away (in Barrow) Ralphy Goodchild would not know that his hat-trick for Sunderland at Elland Road would be his last game for the Lads. Despite a very healthy 21 goals in 45 appearances he was transferred to Brighton in May 1961. He went on to score 44 goals in 163 games for the Seagulls between May 1961 and June 1966 having helped Albion win promotion from the fourth division. He then returned to the North East spending a season with York (1966/67) and a brief cameo with Darlington in 1967/68.\n\nSunderland finished the 1960/61 season in sixth position, their challenge fading in the final ten games which saw five defeats and a draw. Leeds faded badly and finished in fourteenth position. Both teams would eventually fight out a titanic struggle for promotion and the second division title in 1963/64.\n\nIt seems to have been a case of what might have been for the likable Goodchild who passed away aged seventy-two in 2011. Reflecting on his career in a Northern Echo article in 2005 Ralphy was humble and generous about his career. He acknowledged Willie McPheat as a very good player and emphasised he was “still very proud to have played for Sunderland”.\n\nDivision Two (25.02.1961) — Elland Road (15,100)\n\nGoal-scorers – Lawther 4 mins; Goodchild 6, 8 & 40 mins.\n\nSmith 24 mins; Bremner 83 mins.\n\nLeeds – Humphries; Jones; Hair; Cameron; Charlton; Goodwin; Francis; Smith; McCole; Bremner; Grainger.\n\nSunderland – Wakeham; Nelson; Ashurst; Anderson; Hurley; McNab; Hooper; Fogarty; Lawther; Goodchild; Dillon.",

    "title": "Lasses Spotlight: Sunderland Women On The International Stage",
    "description": "There’s an international break coming up for Sunderland Women - how will this affect Mel Reay’s squad?",
    "fullText": "International breaks can sometimes feel like an interruption to the rhythm of a club season, but for Sunderland Women, this one serves as a powerful reminder of who they are becoming. Seven players have been called up across four nations, spanning senior World Cup qualifiers and youth international fixtures. Not one of these selections is unexpected. Every player involved is already a recognised figure within their national programme, and their call-ups reflect continuity, trust and the calibre of footballer Sunderland now attract and develop.\n\nFor a club that has rebuilt itself with patience and purpose, this international window is not merely a point of pride. It is a statement about Sunderland’s trajectory. The squad is no longer a collection of promising Championship players quietly working under the radar. It is a group whose influence stretches across continents, whose talent is acknowledged at the highest levels, and whose presence on the international stage feels entirely natural.\n\nKatie Kitching’s involvement with New Zealand is a perfect example. Her selection for the Football Ferns’ World Cup qualifiers is not a surprise, nor is it a sudden breakthrough. Kitching has been part of New Zealand’s plans for some time, and her performances for Sunderland have only reinforced her standing. She has been one of the club’s most consistent and influential players since she arrived, combining technical quality with intelligence and a relentless work ethic. Her ability to link midfield and attack, to carry the ball with purpose, and to dictate tempo has made her indispensable on Wearside.\n\nFor New Zealand, she offers versatility and composure in high-pressure fixtures. For Sunderland, her international involvement is another layer in her development, exposing her to different tactical demands and the intensity of knockout-style football. Her call-up is not a reward for a purple patch; it is a continuation of her established role within a national team preparing for a crucial qualifying campaign.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland contingent reflects a group of players who are already firmly embedded in their national setup, each at different stages of their international journey. Jamie Finn, Grace Moloney and Marissa Sheva are all familiar figures within the Irish squad, and their call-ups for World Cup qualifiers are entirely consistent with their standing.\n\nFinn, with more than twenty caps to her name, has long been a trusted figure for Ireland. Her versatility, tactical intelligence and composure have made her a reliable presence in green, just as they have in red and white. At Sunderland she has been a model of consistency, adapting seamlessly to different roles and offering a level of maturity that anchors the team around her. Her selection is not news; it is simply the continuation of a career that has already earned significant international respect.\n\nMoloney’s inclusion reflects her growing importance within the Irish goalkeeping group. With nine caps, she is still in the earlier stages of her international career, but she has quickly established herself as a dependable option. Her performances for Sunderland have shown her authority and shot-stopping qualities that translate naturally to the international stage. Her call-up is a recognition of her upward trajectory and the trust she has earned in recent windows.\n\nSheva, meanwhile, brings twenty caps’ worth of experience to the Irish forward line. Her energy, directness and relentless work rate have made her a valuable asset for Ireland, just as they have for Sunderland. She is a player who stretches defences, presses intelligently and offers versatility across the front line. Her involvement in the qualifiers is entirely expected, reflecting her established role within the squad and the consistency of her contributions.\n\nWales have also turned to Sunderland for their World Cup qualifiers, selecting Rhiannon Roberts and Mared Griffiths. Roberts is one of the most experienced internationals in the squad, a player whose leadership and defensive intelligence have been central to Wales’ progress in recent years. Her presence at Sunderland has already proven invaluable, offering guidance to younger players and stability in key moments. Her call-up is a continuation of a distinguished international career, and her performances in the WSL2 have shown that she remains a player of significant quality.\n\nGriffiths’ selection comes at a very different moment in her club journey. Having only just joined Sunderland on loan from Manchester United in January 2026, she has not yet made her debut for the club. Her call-up, therefore, is not a reflection of her time on Wearside but of her established standing within the Welsh national setup. A talented and composed midfielder, Griffiths has been steadily building her international profile, and her involvement in Wales’ qualifiers is a natural continuation of that trajectory. For Sunderland, her arrival and immediate international involvement underline the calibre of player the club is now able to attract.\n\nNew loan signing, Caragh Hamilton has also been called up for Northern Ireland. Interestingly enough on their announcement graphic as a ‘forward’ which surprise a few fans myself included. Although she is listed as a defender at club level, Northern Ireland have frequently used her higher up the pitch as a midfielder and winger, where her energy, ball carrying and pressing suit the demands of international football.\n\nHamilton’s inclusion in the Northern Ireland squad for the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 qualifiers against Switzerland and Turkiye is a deserved recognition of her consistency and experience at international level. Hamilton has been a senior Northern Ireland international since 2012 and has accumulated 53 caps and 7 goals for her country, making her one of the squad’s most seasoned players. Her versatility, experience and tactical intelligence make her an important asset as Northern Ireland look to build momentum in their World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nMared Griffiths’ call up to the Wales senior squad for their upcoming fixtures is another important step in the rise of one of the most exciting young midfielders in British football. Still only eighteen, Griffiths has already made four senior appearances for Wales and scored once, building on an impressive youth international record that includes fifteen caps and three goals for the under seventeen side and six caps and one goal for the under nineteen team.\n\nShe plays primarily as a midfielder for Wales, operating with intelligence, energy and a natural ability to carry the ball through tight spaces. Her recent performances at club level, including her sensational long range goal on her Sunderland debut, have only strengthened her reputation as a player with enormous potential. Wales have used her in central and advanced midfield roles, trusting her creativity and composure in possession. Her ongoing development at Sunderland, combined with her growing international experience, makes her an increasingly important figure for Wales as they build towards future qualification campaigns.\n\nCompleting the list is Ella West, called up to Scotland’s Under-19 squad for a series of friendlies. While youth international fixtures may not carry the same weight as senior qualifiers, they are crucial in shaping the careers of young players. West has been on Scotland’s radar for some time, and her selection is a continuation of her involvement at youth level. For her, this is an opportunity to test herself against high-quality opposition, to experience the demands of international football, and to continue her development in an environment designed to challenge and elevate young talent.\n\nHer call-up also reflects Sunderland’s long-standing commitment to youth development. The club has a proud history of producing players who go on to represent their countries, and West’s inclusion continues that tradition. She is a player with significant potential, and her international involvement will only enrich her understanding of the game.\n\nTaken together, these call-ups paint a picture of a squad that is both diverse and deeply talented. Sunderland Women are no longer a team quietly rebuilding in the Championship; they are a club whose players are shaping international campaigns, influencing World Cup qualifiers, and representing their nations with pride. The breadth of call-ups, spanning New Zealand, Ireland, Wales and Scotland, speaks to the global reach of the squad and the quality that runs through it.\n\nFor the club, this international break is a moment to reflect on the progress made in recent years. Sunderland have built a squad that blends experience with youth, international pedigree with domestic promise. The players called up are not fringe figures or occasional squad members; they are central to their national teams’ plans. That level of recognition is not accidental. It is the result of careful recruitment, strong coaching and a culture that encourages players to grow, compete and aspire.\n\nThere is also a practical benefit. Players who compete internationally return with sharpened instincts, heightened confidence and a deeper understanding of the game. They bring back lessons learned from facing different styles, different systems and different pressures. That experience filters into the squad, raising standards and enriching the team’s tactical awareness.\n\nOf course, international duty also brings challenges. Travel, fatigue and the risk of injury are always considerations. But for Sunderland, the positives far outweigh the concerns. Having so many players involved in international football enhances the club’s reputation, attracts new talent and reinforces the message that Sunderland is a place where careers can flourish.\n\nAs the league resumes, the returning internationals will bring with them the momentum of representing their countries. They will return to a squad that has grown in confidence and cohesion, ready to push forward in the WSL2. And they will carry with them the pride of having worn their national colours, knowing that they are part of a club that supports and celebrates their ambitions.\n\nThis international break is not a pause for Sunderland Women. It is a milestone, a marker of how far the club has come and a glimpse of where it is heading. With players competing on the world stage, the future looks bright, ambitious and full of possibility. And when they return to Wearside, they will do so not just as Sunderland players, but as representatives of nations, carrying experience that will only strengthen the team’s journey ahead.",

    "description": "A video of influencer RJ Princy Parikh with David Miller went viral after India’s loss, but she claimed she received rape threats and body-shaming abuse, prompting her to delete it from Facebook and plan a police complaint. On the field, South Africa beat India by 76 runs, bowling them out for 111. David Miller starred with 63, while Jansen and Maharaj led the bowling.",
    "fullText": "In the clip, Parikh was seen circling Miller, with the caption “David Miller! What a player” and the on-screen line “I thought we were friends, David.”\n\nSoon after, Parikh claimed she started receiving serious online abuse, including rape threats and body-shaming comments. Because of this, she deleted the video from Facebook but kept it on Instagram, and said she plans to file a police complaint over the threats.\n\nSouth Africa crushed India by 76 runs in their first Super Eight match of the T20 World Cup 2026 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, leaving India in a must-win situation for their remaining two games to reach the semifinals. \n\nChasing 188, India were bowled out for just 111 in 18.5 overs, ending their 12-match T20 World Cup winning streak.\n\nIndia’s chase collapsed early, with Ishan Kishan and Tilak Varma falling cheaply. Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma tried to rebuild, but Sharma was dismissed in the fifth over. \n\nWashington Sundar and Yadav also failed to build partnerships, and although Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube added 35 runs, regular wickets kept India under pressure. Dube’s dismissal for 42 sealed India’s fate.\n\nSouth Africa’s bowlers dominated, with Marco Jansen taking 4/22, Keshav Maharaj 3/24, and Lungi Ngidi conceding just 15 runs in four overs. \n\nEarlier, David Miller anchored South Africa’s innings with a match-winning 63 off 35 balls after they were 20/3, sharing a 97-run stand with Dewald Brevis (45 off 29). Tristan Stubbs added a quick 44* to help South Africa post 187/7. Jasprit Bumrah took 3/15.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL Draft is still close to two months away, but some fan bases have been looking ahead to the draft since December or earlier. After a long wait, the NFL Combine will offer the best look yet at the top players available in April.\n\nWhile it wouldn't be surprising to see some of the elite-level talent atop big boards sit out of drills at the combine, the weekend annually helps some prospects build their stock. Others, meanwhile, can raise more questions than answers about their NFL potential.\n\nIt was a year ago that South Carolina safety Nick Emmanwori put on a show at the NFL Combine, proving to be every bit the athletic freak many were hoping to see. While it wasn't enough to push him into the first round, his athleticism wasn't worth overlooking: Emmanwori helped the Seahawks win a Super Bowl and looks like yet another young building block for their loaded defense.\n\nThe next Emmanwori could announce himself to the football world in Indianapolis this weekend.\n\nHere's what you need to know to watch the NFL Combine, including TV channel and live streams.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Combine workouts and drills will air live on the NFL Network and can be streamed with Fubo, which offers a free trial.\n\nThe on-field portion of the NFL Combine will again be held at Lucas Oil Stadium, the home of the Indianapolis Colts. The events begin with media availabilities for coaches and general managers on Tuesday, and players from each position group are also set to speak to the media the day before their on-field workouts.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Combine's on-field drills get underway on Thursday, Feb. 26 with the defensive linemen, linebackers and kickers, with the bulk of the skill position groups set to take the field on Saturday.\n\nDefensive linemen, linebackers, kickers\n\nQuarterbacks, wide receivers, running backs",

    "description": "Despite recent results, RR reader Peter Milton is confident that we can turn it around soon!",
    "fullText": "I have been reading with interest the comments regarding the crowd during certain matches at the Stadium of Light, and most of the comments are bang on the button.\n\nI don’t know what it is, but we seem to become a bit fatigued as the season wears on.\n\nI think we maybe got caught up in the hype about how brilliant we are and once the home record went against Liverpool, we fell somewhat flat. We were noticeably unremarkable against Fulham — disrespect meant whatsoever, but had we been playing Arsenal at home after Liverpool, I have no doubt the rafters would’ve been coming off. However, we have to do our bit on the terraces.\n\nLet’s not forget that the team is made up largely of kids, albeit they’re cracking players on their day.\n\nThey thrive on the support we give them, and if we are flat, they will unfortunately feed off that. We’re still not mathematically safe and we need to focus on that and forget all the nonsensical talk of Europe. If it happens, wonderful, but let’s get realistic first; let’s all get our second wind and make it as uncomfortable as we possibly can for Brighton.\n\nFor the first time since Reidy was here, I genuinely believe we’re all in this together. We have to get this team across the line, and we need to be cheering every tackle, every ball won and every pass made, so let’s frighten Brighton to death.\n\nWe can do it. We all know we have the most intimidating atmosphere in the Premier League when we are all up for it. Let’s get at them and make it known we’re all back at full force.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Peter. Thank you for your letter.\n\nYou raise some very interesting points and I do agree that against Fulham in particular, we did look a bit jaded and disjointed — a far cry from the team we’ve been for much of the season.\n\nWas that due to fatigue, tactical issues or just a lack of confidence? It’s difficult to say and it was a very disappointing day all round, but I do think the fact that we have two challenging away games before we return to the Stadium of Light could be beneficial.\n\nIf we can find the solutions to our troubles on the road and pick up positive results against Bournemouth and Leeds, the visit of Brighton will take on a different feel altogether and hopefully everyone will be bang up for it. There’s still a lot for us to play for this season and I hope that message is being reiterated by Granit Xhaka and Régis Le Bris.\n\nWhat’s with all the negativity?\n\nWe’re fine. Stop being ridiculous.\n\nSome of our fans are in danger of spoiling this season.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi Gerald. Thank you for getting in touch.\n\nI agree that there have been some slightly over-the-top reactions to recent results and performances, but at the same time, it’s fair to say that the Lads aren’t hitting the standards they’ve previously set for themselves and that we need to fix the issues we’re currently facing.\n\nIt’s not a crisis but it is a slump, and we need to turn it around if 2025/2026 is to end on the same kind of positive note on which it started back in August.",

    "description": "From a courtside meeting in Los Angeles to a September superfight in Las Vegas, the inside story of how Mayweather vs. Pacquiao 2 finally came together.",
    "fullText": "In 2019, the Los Angeles Clippers were cruising toward a routine win over the Charlotte Hornets at Staples Center. Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell were cooking, and at some point the lead extended to a 20-point margin.\n\nBut the moment that would travel furthest that night had nothing to do with basketball.\n\nClad in Gucci, Floyd Mayweather Jr. — sitting close enough he could have jabbed a Hornet if he wanted — turned and smirked when he spotted Manny Pacquiao right behind him.\n\nPacquiao stopped, smiled at him and then dapped his old rival.\n\nOne camera caught the interaction from point-blank range and the clip was soon slowed down, mythologized, and replayed like a deleted scene from a saga that never quite reached its final act.\n\nThey meet again. Only here.@mannypacquiao | @FloydMayweather | #ClipperNation pic.twitter.com/OQrezLim14\n\n— LA Clippers (@LAClippers) January 9, 2019\n\nFour years earlier, the welterweight greats produced 4.7 million pay-per-view buys by engaging in one of the most meaningful sporting events of all time. Mayweather won convincingly, and has fought professionally just once since. Pacquiao, now age 46, improbably continues to look threatening in the ring.\n\nThat night courtside in Los Angeles, Pacquiao met someone else, too — someone who would help shape his business, and everything that followed.\n\nEnter Jas Mathur, the CEO of Pacquiao Promotions and a pivotal figure in finally getting their second fight across the line.\n\n\"This rematch has been talked about for a long time,\" Mathur told Uncrowned on Tuesday, one day after Netflix's announcement that it is airing the spectacle live, worldwide, on Sept. 19.\n\nMathur said \"many deals\" for a Mayweather rematch were put forth to Manny Pacquiao Promotions since their chance meeting in 2019, but \"nothing was ever serious,\" with too many \"middle men trying to skim off of it, twist and turn words, or just block the deal because they wanted to be the ones to present it.\"\n\nIt took the right performance — and the right platform — to finally change that.\n\nThe right performance was Pacquiao’s comeback in 2025, when he rolled back the clock to put a pace on Mario Barrios the then-champion was only able to contain in the latter part of their WBC title fight.\n\nWhile Pacquiao fell controversially short of making history as the second-oldest world champion ever in boxing, Mayweather, 49, watched July's majority draw with interest. As did Netflix.\n\n\"Netflix wouldn't want him [this year] if the performance [against Barrios] wasn't good,” Mathur said. \"Floyd saw Manny come back and obviously got the itch himself. In Floyd's mind, he's 50-0, and one of the greatest boxers ever … but so is Manny.\n\n\"Netflix feels this is going to be their biggest event in sports history, and it's going to open up whole new markets internationally.\"\n\nRegardless, there were still obstacles in dragging the rematch across the finish line, and the first was non-negotiable: A pro fight, or nothing at all.\n\n\"Manny had no interest in doing an exhibition with Floyd,\" Mathur said. \"Either [Mayweather's undefeated record] is on the line, or there was no deal.\"\n\nThere was no deal more than a decade ago when drug-testing continually torpedoed the initial conversations around the first Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, “but there’s no issue” on drug-testing this time, per Mathur, with Mayweather’s preference being the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).\n\nMayweather also experienced licensing issues when he had to take a Logan Paul exhibition in 2021 to Miami after the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) refused to sanction it as a Las Vegas show. But Pacquiao isn’t Paul, and the NAC “have no concerns whatsoever,” said Mathur.\n\n\"It's a sanctioned fight and the date's already reserved with [NAC]. They're both cleared and have had their medicals done.\"\n\nNetflix, he says, is what made all the difference.\n\n\"One of the biggest factors in it being a smoother negotiation this time around than last is because it's Netflix,” he said. “A partnership that gives us access to 325 million-plus global subscribers, and international exposure.\"\n\nAdd Las Vegas' famed Sphere to the equation, which showcased its potential as a blockbuster fight venue with UFC 306 in late 2024, and you have \"a great venue for entertainment … that allows Netflix to show off the quality of the production of what they can do, amplifying everything on another level.\"\n\nAs the fight is not until September, both boxers have been linked with warm-up exhibitions.\n\nBut while Mayweather appears set to box a glorified spar with Mike Tyson in April, it's unlikely Pacquiao will engage his former training partner Ruslan Provodnikov in a previously-reported exhibition bout.\n\n\"That fight is not confirmed, and there's a breach,” Mathur said. “So we're in the process of dealing with it.\n\n“Is there a possibility of a Manny exhibition prior to Mayweather? Yes. Do I personally feel it's going to be that fight? No.\"\n\nWhatever warmup bout Pacquiao lands, it won't be one that risks compromising what comes next. Those sorts of challenges will come after — whether it’s a world title shot or something else.\n\nPacquiao himself told Uncrowned last year he intends to be active in this surprising late-career run. And though he was seemingly screwed out of a win against Barrios — which would have broken his own record as the oldest welterweight champion in boxing history — he still has world title aspirations.\n\n\"If the opportunity presents itself, he definitely wants to [fight for a championship],\" Mathur said. \"There was the whole thing of him fighting [WBA welterweight world champion] Rolly [Romero] in a pro fight — that's something that can always get done at some point.\"\n\nThat opportunity vanishes, though, with a loss to Mayweather.\n\nBut for Pacquiao and Mathur, there’s only one result in mind. They want that win in September so they can force Mayweather to experience something he's never had to previously consider: Defeat.",

That's one of the beauties about this team, any guy can get it going,\" added Harden.\n\nThey drew level on 37 wins and 22 losses with the Knicks -- third in the Eastern Conference -- who were poor with their shooting accuracy, making just 11 points in a shocking third quarter.\n\nElsewhere, Anthony Edwards poured in 34 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves earned a hard-fought 124-121 win against the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nEdwards -- MVP at this month's All-Star Game -- managed 25 of his points in an explosive first half.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets beat the Chicago Bulls 131-99, with rookie Kon Knueppel racing to his 200th three-pointer.\n\nAged 20, the Hornets prodigy is the fastest player to reach that mark in NBA history, requiring just 58 games.\n\nTyrese Maxey sank 32 points plus nine rebounds and eight assists as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Indiana Pacers 135-114.\n\nThe Pacers reached last year's NBA Finals, but have struggled badly this campaign, sinking to the very bottom of the East.\n\nCongolese forward Jonathan Kuminga scored 27 points on his debut for the Atlanta Hawks in a 119-98 win over the Washington Wizards.\n\nThe Western Conference-leading Thunder racked up another win, seeing off the Toronto Raptors 116-107.\n\nAnd the Boston Celtics consolidated their grip on second spot in the East with a 97-81 win over the Phoenix Suns.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are inching closer to keeping one of their leaders at the club beyond the current season.\n\nCasemiro’s expected departure will come as a big blow, both on and off the pitch, considering the experience and winning mentality he brought to the squad.\n\nTom Heaton, another of the leaders in the group, could also be let go. To make matters worse, the contract of Harry Maguire was also up in the summer, with INEOS dilly-dallying over an extension.\n\nNaturally, plenty of clubs were eyeing the soon-to-be free agent, with a few even attempting an audacious January raid.\n\nMichael Carrick held firm, and blocked all exits, but with the co-owners yet to agree a new deal, it seemed like the former club captain would be on his way out.\n\nBut according to Teamtalk, there has been a breakthrough in talks between the club and the defender.\n\nINEOS wanted the Englishman to take a pay cut, and as things stand, that is likely to happen. Also, the new deal will be a short-term one, likely to be for a year, which suits INEOS.\n\n“Sources have highlighted positive developments in talks between Maguire and Man Utd.\n\n“Sources close to the situation, describe “positive signs” that a compromise could be reached, likely involving a wage reduction from his current £180,000 per week and a short-term extension of perhaps one additional season.\n\n“They are the ideal terms for United, given we’ve all seen how quickly players deep into their thirties can decline.\n\n“With Casemiro set to depart, Maguire’s experience and recent solid performances have bolstered his case to remain, earning support from the dressing room and interim manager Michael Carrick.”\n\nHarry Maguire has been in top form for the caretaker head coach, and his teammates all want him to stay. So this will please both Carrick and the players.\n\nFeature image Shaun Botterill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The 2026 league year is coming next month. It officially begins on March 11, with the legal negotiating period beginning on March 9.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have many roster decisions to make before then.\n\nLeading up to the new league year, we will profile every player on the roster, go over what they did last season, what their contract status is and what they face in 2026.\n\nNext up is wide receiver Zay Jones.\n\nJones was re-signed in 2025 for a second season with the team. After a disappointing eight-catch season in 2024, the 2025 season was also disappointing. He had only 12 catches for 183 yards in eight games, and then tore his Achilles against the Seattle Seahawks and missed the rest of the season.\n\nJones is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent when the new league year begins on March 11.\n\nThis is going to be a tough offeason for Jones. He will have to get healthy first, but after a total of 20 catches over two seasons, teams will not be banging down the door for his services.\n\nHe likely will land a league-minimum deal around training camp. As for the Cardinals, don't expect him back.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Morocco are weighing up a sensational move to hire Xavi Hernandez as doubts intensify over the future of head coach Walid Regragui just months before the 2026 World Cup, per The Athletic.\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has publicly denied that Regragui has left his post, but senior figures have sounded out potential replacements.\n\nFormer Barcelona midfielder and head coach Xavi is among the names being discussed.\n\nNo agreement has been reached, and sources close to the Spanish tactician suggest he would prefer to take on a new role after this summer’s tournament rather than immediately.\n\nRegragui made history by guiding Morocco to the semi-finals of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the furthest any African nation has progressed in the competition.\n\nThat remarkable run increased expectations at home, fuelled by significant investment in facilities and infrastructure over the past decade.\n\nHowever, subsequent tournaments have failed to match that high.\n\nMorocco exited at the last-16 stage of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations and then fell agonisingly short in last month’s 2025 final, losing in extra time to Senegal on home soil.\n\nCriticism of Regragui’s pragmatic style has grown louder, with pressure mounting despite his previous achievements.\n\nMorocco have been drawn alongside Brazil, Scotland and Haiti at the expanded 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the FRMF could make a coaching change before the tournament begins.\n\nXavi would be a bold appointment. The 46-year-old impressed during his stint as Barcelona head coach, winning the league and Spanish Super Cup while blooding many young players.\n\nA World Cup winner with Spain in 2010, he enjoyed a glittering career at Barcelona, lifting four Champions League titles and eight La Liga crowns.\n\nHe moved into coaching with Al-Sadd and later returned to manage Barcelona between 2021 and 2024.",

    "description": "The Lakers come up short when LeBron James misses a last-second shot that sends L.A. to a 110-109 loss to the Magic.",
    "fullText": "In a topsy-turvy fourth quarter, the Lakers came up short when LeBron James missed a last-second shot that sent them to a 110-109 loss to the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nLuka Doncic had 22 points to lead the Lakers but was just eight for 24 from the field and two for 10 from three-point range. He was wide open behind the arc after taking the inbounds pass in the closing seconds, but he didn't shoot, passing to James with the clock running down.\n\nJames took a turnaround three that missed. He finished with 21 points, six rebounds and four assists.\n\nThe lead went back and forth most of the fourth quarter, each play more important than the previous one, each moment more intense, each possession more meaningful.\n\nWhen Rui Hachimura drilled a three-pointer from the corner off a pass from Doncic for a 106-103 lead with 2 minutes 14 seconds left, the Lakers (34-23) looked to be in pretty good shape.\n\nBut Magic star Paolo Banchero scored in the paint, giving him a game-high 36 points, and was fouled by Deandre Ayton. Banchero missed the free throw, leaving the Lakers ahead 106-105 with 1:18 left.\n\nJames went to work in the post over the smaller Anthony Black, drawing a foul. But James made just one of two free throws for a 107-105 lead\n\nMagic guard Desmond Bane (22 points) answered with a three-pointer for a 108-107 lead that forced the Lakers to call a timeout with 34.6 seconds left.\n\nHachimura missed a three but the Lakers retained possession, and on the ensuing inbounds play Doncic found James cutting down the lane for a dunk for a 109-108 Lakers lead.\n\nBanchero missed a jumper, but Wendell Carter Jr. grabbed the rebound and scored for a 110-109 Orlando lead with 6.7 seconds left. The Magic finished with 12 offensive rebounds.\n\nThe Lakers called another timeout and had one last opportunity, but this time they couldn’t get a good shot and time expired.\n\nThe good news was the Lakers sawa more engaged Ayton, a more active big man, a more involved player.\n\nDoncic passed the ball inside to Ayton in the midpost early in the third quarter and watched his big center turn and shot over a smaller defender. Ayton missed the shot, but he collected the rebound and scored on a layup.\n\nAyton had 17 points on six-for-eight shooting and six rebounds in the first half and 21 points for the game to go along with 13 rebounds.\n\nDoncic went down late in the first quarter after getting poked in his eye by Mo Wager, a red mark developing beneath his eye. Doncic stayed down for a while before eventually getting up with one minute and 59 seconds left in the first.\n\nOn the very next possession, Doncic drilled a three-pointer, a sign that his vision was clear.\n\nHe finished the first quarter with 11 points on four-for-eight shooting, four rebounds and four assists.\n\nAfter the end of the first, Doncic went to the Lakers’ locker room, but he returned to the bench early in the second quarter.\n\nEarly in that second quarter, the Lakers displayed hustle and defense.\n\nJames ran down Anthony Black and blocked his shot off the backboard. Banchero got the rebound, but he had his shot blocked by a hustling Marcus Smart.\n\nThe Lakers started the third quarter by giving their fans a highlight moment.\n\nIt began with Ayton getting the defensive rebound and passing the ball to James, who then whipped the ball to Austin Reaves and filled the lane on the fast break.\n\nReaves threw a lob to James for a dunk, bringing the crowd to its feet.\n\nThe Lakers even opened a 12-point lead in the third quarter, their defense on point and their offense looking good.\n\nBut the Magic didn’t stop coming after the Lakers.\n\nOrlando closed out the third quarter hard and got to within 80-79 entering the fourth.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Canadian soccer federation doesn’t know if FC Bayern’s Alphonso Davies will play for them in March yet or not…",
    "fullText": "It’s been one step forward and two steps backward for Bayern Munich’s Alphonso Davies. He sustained a muscle fiber tear in his right hamstring during Bayern’s recent 3-2 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga and was forced to come off in the 50th minute to be replaced by Hiroki Ito. He’s now set for a considerable spell on the sidelines for the German Rekordmeister and a combination of Ito, Konrad Laimer, Josip Stanišić, Tom Bischof, and Raphaël Guerreiro will have to fill in at left back for Vincent Kompany.\n\nThe injury blow for the Canadian international unfortunately comes just over two months after he had made his return to action from his cruciate ligament injury that he had suffered last March whilst on international duty with the Canadian national team for the CONCACAF Nations League. At the time, Davies’ injury was the subject of controversy because he had injured his knee in the semifinals match against Mexico and should not have played in the third place, dead rubber match against the United States that ultimately lead to the cruciate ligament tear and its severity.\n\nAhead of Canada’s upcoming March friendlies against the likes of Iceland and Uzbekistan, the Canadian Soccer Federation released a statement saying they’re currently unsure whether or not Davies will take part in the pair of matches. They also express that they’re in contact with Bayern reharding the matter.\n\nThe statement (via @iMiaSanMia):\n\nOur Men’s National Team’s medical staff continues to be in close communication with FC Bayern München’s medical staff concerning Alphonso Davies. A determination on his availability for the upcoming March international window has not yet been made. In the coming weeks, we will announce the full team roster.\n\nIt’s all in perspective. For the Canadian national team and Davies, pride is always at play and he’ll want to play every match he can for his country, rightfully so. For Bayern, they’d be watching with nervous eyes if Davies plays a part in the friendlies at such a crucial stage of the season for the Bundesliga champions and losing him again to another long-term injury could prove to be costly.",

    "fullText": "BYU quickly goes from scoring an upset to suffering one.\n\nAfter notching what seemed to be a rejuvenating win over No. 6 Iowa State this past weekend, the Cougars fell 97-84 Tuesday night to unranked UCF in the most disappointing performance of the Kevin Young era.\n\nThe Cougars are now 20-8 on the season and 8-7 in Big 12 play.\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) February 25, 2026\n\nUCF dominated from start to finish. BYU never led at any point on Tuesday, falling into a 10-point hole after less than four minutes and going into halftime trailing by 24.\n\nAny sliver of hope for dramatic late comeback vanished once UCF opened the second half on a 12-0 run.\n\nThe Cougars may have only lost by 13 points, but it felt much more like 30 — a margin by which they trailed for the majority of the second half before UCF took its foot off the gas.\n\nWith the loss, BYU broke a 16-game win streak against unranked opponents at home.\n\nBut more concerningly, such a setback could cause a significant slide for the Cougars’ NCAA tournament seeding a few weeks from now.\n\nBYU couldn’t stop UCF. When the Cougars fell 99-92 at Oklahoma State earlier this month, it felt as if their defense had hit rock bottom.\n\nHowever, giving up 97 points at home to UCF is clearly much more alarming, especially considering the Knights were playing without their leading scorer Riley Kugel, who missed the game with an injury.\n\nUCF made five of its first six 3-pointers and never slowed down, having a separate stretch of nine of 12 makes and finishing the night shooting 58% from behind the arc.\n\nIn all, the Knights shot 56% from the field, scored 44 paint points, 19 points in transition and averaged 1.31 points per possession.\n\nA stronger second half couldn’t salvage BYU’s poor offensive showing. The Cougars did score 56 points after halftime, but considering their second half scoring didn’t begin until being down by 36 points, it’s safe to say the whole period was essentially just garbage time.\n\nIn all, BYU shot 41% from the field and 33% from 3-point range. In the first half, those marks were 31% and 27%, respectively, for a meager 28 points.",

    "title": "Utah no match for No. 4 Iowa State’s pressure defense in 16-point loss",
    "description": "Utes commit season-high 18 turnovers as Cyclones bounce back from loss to thump Utah.",
    "fullText": "No. 4 Iowa State looked like a team that was ready for a bounce back when the Cyclones met up with Utah on Tuesday night at the Huntsman Center.\n\nThe Cyclones were coming off a 79-69 loss at BYU three days before, just their fourth loss of the season.\n\nSeven minutes into the matchup with the Runnin’ Utes, though, Iowa State seized control and never let go.\n\nUtah led 12-10 early, but the Cyclones used a 12-0 run to build a double-digit lead for the first time, and from there, Iowa State’s pressure defense was simply too much for the Utes to realistically hope that they could keep pace.\n\nUtah ended up turning the ball over a season-high 18 times against the Cyclones, who converted those takeaways into 20 points.\n\n“The pressure, it’s hard to replicate that pressure in practice. We let our guys know it was coming, but it’s hard to stay in a game with a team like that when you turn the ball over, especially that many times in the first half, I think it was 11,” Utah coach Alex Jensen said.\n\n“But (there’s) a lot of things to learn for us, again. We made some good plays, but then we struggled to keep replicating that. All the credit to Iowa State, a good team.”\n\nIowa State also had the edge in points in the paint (38-26) and bench scoring (26-8), two signs of the Cyclones’ superior physicality and depth.\n\nEventually, the Utes wore down.\n\n“Across the board, our guys took a lot of pride in guarding the basketball and making sure that we continue to be disruptive throughout the course of the game,” Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “For us, that’s when we’re at our best, and our guys did a great job with that.”\n\nUtah still made it interesting for a minute in the second half after trailing 41-31 at halftime.\n\nOver the first 3:09 of the second half, Utah went on a 9-4 run, trimming that deficit in half.\n\nThe final field goal in that stretch was particularly impressive — just 20 seconds after Don McHenry scored to make it 45-38, Keanu Dawes came up with a steal, then the Utes moved the ball quickly around before it went back to Dawes, whose slam made it 45-40.\n\nThat brought the Huntsman Center crowd to life.\n\nUnfortunately, the Cyclones had an answer.\n\nIowa State clamped down defensively again, and Utah — who shot just 38.1% in the second half — only scored four points over the next six and a half minutes as the Cyclones (24-4, 11-4 Big 12) pushed their way to a game-high 17-point lead at 61-44.\n\nThat stretch squelched any hopes that Utah (10-18, 2-13 Big 12) could pull the upset.\n\nForward Joshua Jefferson, an All-Big 12 second-teamer a year ago, paced Iowa State in the second half. He had 13 of his 21 points after the break and also had six rebounds, three assists and two steals.\n\n“It felt pretty good,” Jefferson said, when asked about his ability to bring the fight in a physical game. “You know, (I’ve) been dealing with physicality all season, so I expect it at this point. People are just going to try to muscle me up, but it’s just on me to outmaneuver them every single time I can.”\n\nMilan Momlicovic hit three of his four 3-pointers in the second half and had 14 points for Iowa State, who shot 47.5% for the game.\n\nJamarion Batemon (13 points) and Blake Buchanan (10) also scored in double-figures for the Cyclones.\n\nEarly on, it looked like Utah might make a game out of it. The Utes made five of their first nine field goals, on a night where Utah shot 45.7%, including a four-point play from McHenry on the Utes’ opening possession.\n\nOnce Utah got out to that 12-10 lead, though, the Cyclones’ swarming defense got Utah to speed up, and Iowa State used a 18-5 run to go up 28-17.\n\n“I think everybody saw it, the full-court pressure,” Jensen said of Iowa State’s suffocating defense. “Again, hard to replicate it. … I think it just got us sped up and out of our game plan a little bit, and then, you know, (it) gets discouraging when it’s hard to pass the ball.”\n\nThe Utes got the crowd back into the contest with an 8-0 spurt, headlined by back-to-back 3-pointers from Seydou Traore and Terrence Brown, to cut the Iowa State lead to 29-27.\n\nIowa State, though, again had a response, going on a 6-0 run over the next minute, including a fastbreak layup off a steal, to push its lead back out to 35-27.\n\nThe Cyclones took a 41-31 lead into halftime, after forcing 11 first-half turnovers from Utah and converting those into 14 points.\n\nUtah’s guards led the way for the home team, as Brown, McHenry and Obomate Abbey combined to score Utah’s first 21 points and 24 of their 31 in the first half.\n\nBrown scored 18 points and shot 6 of 10 from the field and 6 of 8 from the free-throw line. He added four rebounds and three assists, but Brown also had a seven-worst seven turnovers.\n\nMcHenry put up 14 points and added two assists and a steal.\n\nDawes, meanwhile, had his fifth double-double in the past eight games, finishing with 10 points and 12 rebounds. He also had two assists and a steal.\n\nFor the Utes, there was plenty to learn from the loss — including how they can attack the pressure that teams like Iowa State will throw at them.\n\n“You got to use the aggressiveness against them, get a lot of back door cuts,” Dawes said. “And I think we got them a little, especially in the second half. We just got to do that more and figure out what works more earlier on in the game.”\n\nUtah will be on the road for two of its final three games of the regular season.\n\nThat starts with a trip to Arizona State on Saturday (1:30 p.m. MST, TNT).\n\nAfter Utah faced another physical team in Iowa State — its the fifth top 5 Big 12 defense the Utes have had to deal with the past three weeks, along with Houston, Kansas, West Virginia and Cincinnati — Jensen simply tipped his cap to the effort from Iowa State.\n\n“Give a lot of credit to T.J. and Iowa State, it’s a good team, well assembled. They play hard, their guys play their roles. They sustain effort, and they get better as the game goes on,” he said.",

In the second half, he pulled off an impressive flying save to deny the home side a second after a wonderful scissor kick attempt.\n\nHe also denied Blackburn late on when an effort was slid in from a cross, but Vitek stood tall to repel the effort. The Manchester United academy player was not finished yet, though, as he saved from close range after a fine mazy run from the Blackburn attacker.\n\nHe made a total of six saves, with five of them coming from shots inside the area.\n\nVitek also made two high claims and two clearances in the game. He also came out on top in his only aerial duel of the match.\n\nBristol City will be back in action on Friday evening at home to Watford.\n\nWheatley was substituted on in the 24th minute but then left the pitch again after 74 minutes in Bradford City’s 1-0 win over Rotherham United.\n\nHe had one shot that was blocked and failed in both his dribble attempts.\n\nWheatley did well in his passing, though, making two key passes and completing 72% of his overall attempts.\n\nHe also won a total of five duels in the match as he put himself about well with the Rotherham defence.\n\nBradford will next be in action away to Reading on Saturday afternoon.\n\nFeature image Ed Sykes via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Liverpool could hit two birds with one stone if they are to sign the latest name being linked with the club.\n\nAccording to the father of Roland Sallai, Szoboszlai's international teammate, Liverpool have already made contact to sign the Galatasaray winger.\n\n\"Liverpool could be such a destination, and I admit, I wouldn't be surprised if this club change happened now, in the winter,\" Tibor Sallai told Blikk.\n\n\"I know that contact has already been made through a management office. I don't want to and I don't want to shout anything, but my son will really have a good chance in the summer, if there is an offer that is also beneficial for Galatasaray, to change country and level. It wouldn't be just any moment if Liverpool were to run out onto the Anfield Road turf with three Hungarians in the starting lineup.\"\n\nSallai's father is referencing the fact that Liverpool already have Milos Kerkez and Szoboszlai playing for them.\n\nHere's why this could be a really good move for Liverpool. While Sallai is a little bit on the more experienced side he is an extremely versatile player.\n\nPredominantly, he is a winger. He has been playing that position ever since he started his career in senior football.\n\nBut this season Sallai has also become a right-back at Galatasaray. He's played really well in that position, impressing against Juventus and Manchester City in the Champions League, while coming up against some really tricky wingers.\n\nSo, there should be no surprise that he would be on Liverpool's radar. Sallai is the type of player Liverpools' recruitment team have loved over the last few years.\n\nHe can solve a problem at right-back, he can provide depth on the wings, and on top of that he's even played through the middle for Hungary's national team, so he could potentially be used as a false nine, too.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle United claimed a 3-2 win (9-3 on aggregate) over Qarabag at St James’ Park to send the Azerbaijani champions packing out of the UEFA Champions League.\n\nSandro Tonali, Joelinton, and Sven Botman scored as Newcastle advanced comfortably on aggregate and into the last 16 of the tournament for the first time.\n\nThe Geordies had done most of the work in the first leg and took the opportunity to rest a few key players and blood some new ones.\n\nWith the Premier League run-in looming, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe unsurprisingly rested first-choice left-back Lewis Hall, starting Alex Murphy in his place.\n\nThe 21-year-old has featured on the bench in several Newcastle games this season but eventually received the chance to prove his mettle. He grabbed it with both hands.\n\nMurphy won 3/4 ground and 2/3 aerial duels. He made two interceptions and two clearances. He made five recoveries and seven defensive contributions.\n\nOn the offensive side, he made 13 carries and played one key pass. Tonali was the star of the show, but Murphy was just as good.\n\nNewcastle writer Lee Ryder gave Murphy an 8/10 rating, saying (via Chronicle Live), “Has waited patiently for his chance and did well. Stuck to his task and did not shirk a tackle.”\n\nHall has struggled with some injury setbacks this term, but Murphy has shown that he can deputise for the England international.\n\nNewcastle’s coming games are ridiculously difficult, and it is hard to envisage Murphy getting another chance to strut his stuff anytime soon.\n\nThe FA Cup would have been perfect for a run-out, but with Manchester City coming to St James’ Park, Howe might opt for the more experienced Hall.\n\nThe Annaghdown native joined Newcastle from Galway United in May 2022 and will hope to establish himself behind Hall before playing a more prominent role next season.\n\nNewcastle take on Chelsea or Barcelona in the Champions League round of 16.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are understood to be tracking Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson as the Blues look to bolster their engine room, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nLauded by former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and as an elite player, he is attracting keen interest in the market.\n\nChelsea could use a midfielder who can seamlessly transition between defensive midfield and central midfield roles.\n\nNew manager Liam Rosenior is using a three-man midfield of Andrey Santos, Moises Caicedo, and Enzo Fernandez, but outside those options, he needs a deeper squad.\n\nRomeo Lavia has been persistently injured, and Dario Essugo has also endured a season filled with setbacks.\n\nThe Blues need another midfielder to bolster the roster, and Anderson fits the bill.\n\nHowever, Chelsea are not alone in the race for his signature, with Newcastle United, Manchester United and Manchester City also pursuing a deal for the 23-year-old.\n\nForest are also poised to demand upwards of £80 million for his signature, making any deal difficult to complete.\n\nIf Chelsea are serious about mounting a genuine Premier League title challenge next season, Anderson is exactly the calibre of signing they must prioritise.\n\nThe England international is no raw project or speculative punt.\n\nAnderson is already a hardened top-flight performer who understands the tempo, intensity, and tactical demands of English football.\n\nHe would not need two seasons of adaptation or careful shielding. He would arrive ready to contribute immediately.\n\nToo often in recent windows, Chelsea have leaned toward youthful potential over proven pedigree.\n\nThat strategy has its merits, but title races are not won on promise alone. They are won with depth, reliability, and players who can deliver from day one.\n\nIf the Blues bypass Anderson in favour of another long-term project to plug the gap, it would signal that they are not truly ready to compete for the crown.",

They’re just doing dumb things to create [net interest income], or say they’re winning in the mortgage business.”\n\nHe also said he expects the credit cycle will eventually deteriorate again, potentially as a result of AI related disruption to software companies.\n\n“There’s always a surprise in a credit cycle … And this time around, it might be software, because of AI … There’s moving tectonic plates underneath it, it causes the industry to be challenged.”\n\nDimon warned in October about weakness in the credit market after the collapses of auto lender Tricolor Holdings and car-parts supplier First Brands Group. He told investors at the time: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more, and so everyone should be forewarned of this one.”\n\nDimon’s latest warning came as a Bank of America client survey found that, for the first time, an “AI bubble” is the biggest concern of credit investors, who noted the high levels of borrowing of cloud service providers, known as “hyperscalers”, including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Google.\n\nInvestors expect hyperscaler debt issuance of $285 billion this year, up from the $210 billion expected in December’s survey. Some 23 per cent of respondents saw the threat of an AI bubble as their top concern, up from 9 per cent in Bank of America’s previous survey in December.\n\nFears of a potentially unsustainable surge in investment and valuations of AI companies overtook “bubbles in credit” as the top concern, according to the survey.\n\nMeanwhile, “few worry about geopolitics or a central bank policy error”, the bank’s analysts wrote.\n\nHowever, investors were less worried about the ultimate tech disruption ahead, with only 10 per cent saying that AI-driven corporate obsolescence is their big worry.",

    "fullText": "I don't mean \"what does the symbol 3 look like\" or \"how do you count to ten.\" Where does the number three actually live? You can hold three apples, but you can't hold threeness. You can write the digit 3, but that's ink on paper. So what is it?\n\nYou can swap apples for stars or boxes, but the count stays the same. \"Three\" is whatever all groups-of-three have in common. But that's circular. What is the thing they have in common?\n\nThere are so many numbers: 1, 3/7, pi, 3.12. Where did these come from? Mathematics is people making up a rule and following it to see what happens.\n\nWe'll do that here. We start with nothing: no numbers, no arithmetic, no assumptions. By the end we'll have built the natural numbers, the integers, the rationals, the reals, and the complex numbers.\n\nWe need a starting point. Say there is one thing, a starting object we'll call zero. Not zero the quantity you already know, but just a name for where we begin.\n\nNow one rule. Given any object, you can produce the next one. Write this as a function SS, where S(n)S(n) means \"the successor of nn.\" S(0)S(0) is the first object we generate, S(S(0))S(S(0)) is the second, and so on. There's no addition and no multiplication yet. All you can do is say \"give me the next one.\"\n\nThat's all counting is. Keep applying the one rule. You don't need to know what 7 \"means\" to get there. Apply SS seven times and you land on the seventh object.\n\nThis chain never stops. There's no largest natural number, because every number has a successor. Mathematicians call this infinite: the process of taking successors has no end. We write this unbounded behavior with symbols like ∞\\infty in limits and extended settings. But ∞\\infty itself is not a natural number. A finite value is any specific natural number you can reach by stopping at some point, like 7, 400, or a trillion. When we say something \"goes to infinity,\" we mean it keeps increasing past every finite value, never arriving anywhere.\n\nYou can always go forward, but you can't go back. There's no predecessor of zero, and there's no shortcut. To reach 5 you have to pass through 1, 2, 3, and 4 first.\n\nBut how do we know this chain is all there is? Our rules say \"there's a starting point\" and \"every object has a successor.\" Nothing prevents a rogue cluster of objects (say A, B, C) forming their own loop, each one the successor of the previous, disconnected from zero. The successor rule would still be satisfied. We need something extra.\n\nInduction. Picture a chain of dominoes. Show that domino 0 falls (the base case). Then show that whenever domino nn falls, it knocks over domino S(n)S(n) (the inductive step). If both hold, every domino in the chain falls, and no domino outside the chain can claim to be part of the system.\n\nOnce domino 0 falls, and each domino tips the next, the whole chain goes down. In the strongest version of this idea, the natural numbers are exactly the things you can reach from 0 by repeating successor. A rogue cluster disconnected from zero? This rule excludes it, because the chain from 0 never reaches it. (Logic side note: in some weaker rule systems, mathematicians can build versions with extra \"numbers\" beyond this chain.)\n\nMathematicians call this the natural numbers, written N\\mathbb{N}. A standard axiom list (axioms are just starting rules) for this is called the Peano axioms. The core ingredients are a starting point (zero), a rule (successor), and induction (nothing else sneaks in), plus two guardrails: 0 is not anyone's successor, and different numbers have different successors.\n\nCounting is fine, but we need arithmetic. Addition comes from SS and two rules:\n\na+S(b)=S(a+b)a + S(b) = S(a + b)\n\nAdding zero changes nothing. Adding the successor of bb is the same as taking the successor of a+ba + b. It's recursive, meaning the rule calls itself on a smaller input until bb hits 0.\n\nTo compute 2+32 + 3, the rules unwind: 2+S(2)=S(2+2)2 + S(2) = S(2 + 2), then 2+S(1)=S(2+1)2 + S(1) = S(2 + 1), then 2+S(0)=S(2+0)=S(2)2 + S(0) = S(2 + 0) = S(2). Each step peels off one SS from bb and wraps one SS around the result, until the base case a+0=aa + 0 = a stops the recursion.\n\nMultiplication follows the same recursive pattern, defined in terms of addition:\n\na×S(b)=a+(a×b)a \\times S(b) = a + (a \\times b)\n\nMultiplying by zero gives zero. Multiplying by the successor of bb means computing a×ba \\times b and adding one more aa. Recursive again, where each layer adds one copy of aa. So 3×S(S(S(0)))3 \\times S(S(S(0))) unwinds to 3+(3+(3+0))3 + (3 + (3 + 0)).\n\nEvery operation reduces to repeated applications of simpler ones. Multiplication is repeated addition, and addition is repeated successor. The whole thing rests on the successor function.\n\nAdding any two natural numbers always produces another natural number. Multiplying them does too. This property is called closure, meaning the naturals are closed under addition and multiplication. Every operation stays inside the system, and the next operation we try won't.\n\nThe natural numbers feel complete. Add or multiply any two of them and you always get another natural number.\n\nBut addition raises a question. If a+b=ca + b = c, can you recover bb from aa and cc? \"I had some apples, you gave me 3, now I have 8. How many did I start with?\" That's subtraction.\n\n5 minus 3 is 2, that works. 7 minus 7 is 0, still works. Try 3 minus 5.\n\nIn the natural numbers, 3 minus 5 has no answer. You can't go below zero, so the operation just fails. Subtraction breaks closure. You can set up a subtraction with two natural numbers, but the result might not be one.\n\nSubtraction produces results our system can't represent. We could ban it when it fails, or expand the system so it always works.\n\nHow do you represent \"below zero\" when all you have are natural numbers? Represent every integer as a pair (a,b)(a, b), where the pair means \"aa minus bb.\"\n\nSo (5,2)(5, 2) means 3. But (6,3)(6, 3) also means 3, and so does (7,4)(7, 4), and (100,97)(100, 97). All these pairs represent the same integer.\n\nThis is an equivalence class, a collection of representations that all behave identically. The integer 3 is the whole collection of pairs whose difference is 3.\n\nDefining integers as pairs is only useful if we can do arithmetic with them. Adding two pairs: (a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d). Combine the positives and the negatives separately. If different pairs representing the same integer produce the same answer, the definition is consistent.\n\nThis consistency isn't obvious. Different pairs represent the same integer, so arithmetic has to give the same result no matter which representative you pick. It does. Mathematicians call this well-definedness: the answer doesn't depend on which equivalent form you started with.\n\nThis gives us the integers, Z\\mathbb{Z}. Every natural number is still here (write it as (n,0)(n, 0)), but now we also have negative numbers. Subtraction demanded they exist.\n\nThe number line extends left of zero, and the operations that broke before work.\n\n3 minus 5 kicked us out of ℕ, but in ℤ it's just −2, a point on the number line two steps left of zero. Every subtraction lands somewhere.\n\nNow that we have negative numbers, what happens when we multiply them? Negative times negative being positive isn't a convention. It follows from rules we already have. Multiplication distributes over addition: a×(b+c)=a×b+a×ca \\times (b + c) = a \\times b + a \\times c. This is the distributive law. Since multiplication is repeated addition, a×(b+c)a \\times (b + c) means \"jump by aa a total of b+cb + c times.\" Do all those jumps at once, or bb first then cc more, and you end up at the same spot either way:\n\nTry applying it. (−1)×(1+(−1))=(−1)×0=0(-1) \\times (1 + (-1)) = (-1) \\times 0 = 0. Distributing the left side gives (−1)×1+(−1)×(−1)=0(-1) \\times 1 + (-1) \\times (-1) = 0, which simplifies to −1+(−1)(−1)=0-1 + (-1)(-1) = 0, forcing (−1)(−1)=1(-1)(-1) = 1. The distributive law leaves no room for a negative result.\n\nThe integers handle subtraction. Subtract any two integers and you stay inside Z\\mathbb{Z}. Closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. But try dividing.\n\n6 divided by 3 is 2, that works. 10 divided by 2 is 5, still works. What about 1 divided by 3?\n\nThere's no integer equal to one-third. Division breaks closure the same way subtraction broke the naturals.\n\nSame fix as before: pairs. This time (a,b)(a, b) means \"aa divided by bb.\" The top number aa is the numerator, the bottom bb is the denominator. These are the rational numbers.\n\nLike integers, different pairs can represent the same value. (1,2)(1, 2) and (2,4)(2, 4) and (3,6)(3, 6) are all the same rational number.\n\nThe numerator and denominator grow, but the proportion stays constant. Each scaled version is a different pair, same equivalence class. The rational number one-half is the collection of pairs (k,2k)(k, 2k) for every positive integer kk.\n\nArithmetic works like it did for integers. Adding two fractions: (a,b)+(c,d)=(ad+bc,bd)(a, b) + (c, d) = (ad + bc, bd). Cross-multiply the numerators, multiply the denominators.\n\nMultiplying: (a,b)×(c,d)=(ac,bd)(a, b) \\times (c, d) = (ac, bd). Straight across, numerator times numerator, denominator times denominator.\n\nThese are the fraction rules you already know, but we derived them from the pair construction instead of assuming them. And well-definedness holds: different representatives of the same rational give the same results.\n\nTo divide: (a,b)÷(c,d)=(a,b)×(d,c)(a, b) \\div (c, d) = (a, b) \\times (d, c). Flip the second fraction and multiply. Try 7 ÷ 4, the operation that had no integer answer.\n\nThe rationals, Q\\mathbb{Q}, fix division. Add, subtract, multiply, or divide any two rationals (except by zero) and the result is always rational. Closed under all four operations. A system like this is called a field, a number system where these operations behave the usual way.\n\nPick any two rationals, say 1/3 and 1/2. Their average, 5/12, is rational and sits between them. Now pick 1/3 and 5/12. Their average is between those. You can keep going forever and never run out of rationals to wedge in.\n\nMathematicians call this density. Between any two rationals, there's always another one. They seem to fill the number line completely.\n\nEvery crisis so far came from reversing an operation. Subtraction reverses addition, division reverses multiplication. There's one more reversal. You can square a number (3×3=93 \\times 3 = 9), so what number times itself produces a given result? That's the square root. 9=3\\sqrt{9} = 3 because 3×3=93 \\times 3 = 9.\n\nEvery rational number can be written as a decimal. Divide numerator by denominator one digit at a time: take the remainder, bring down a zero (multiply by 10), see how many times the denominator fits. The quotient digit goes after the decimal point, repeat.\n\nWhen the remainder hits zero, the decimal terminates. When a remainder you've already seen comes back, the same digits repeat forever. Try 1/4 (terminates), then 1/3 (repeats).\n\nSome fractions terminate: 1/4=0.251/4 = 0.25, 3/8=0.3753/8 = 0.375. Others repeat forever: 1/3=0.333...1/3 = 0.333..., where the long division produces remainder 1 every step, so digit 3 comes out every step, without end. That trailing \"...\" hides something important. You need infinitely many digits to pin down the value, and no finite string of them lands on it exactly. Fractions and decimals are two notations for the same values.\n\nFor perfect squares this works. 4=2\\sqrt{4} = 2, 9=3\\sqrt{9} = 3, 16=4\\sqrt{16} = 4. But what about 2\\sqrt{2}? What rational number, multiplied by itself, gives exactly 2? Try 1.4: 1.42=1.961.4^2 = 1.96, a little too small. Try 1.5: 1.52=2.251.5^2 = 2.25, too big. So 2\\sqrt{2} is between 1.4 and 1.5. Keep going: 1.412=1.98811.41^2 = 1.9881, 1.422=2.01641.42^2 = 2.0164. Each digit narrows the bracket, and you can zoom in forever. But no fraction will ever land on it exactly. Not because there's an interval with no rationals (there isn't, they're dense), but because this specific limit point is missing from Q\\mathbb{Q}.\n\nNo matter how far you zoom, the square root of 2 sits between rational ticks, never on one. The rationals are dense, meaning between any two of them there's always another one. But they're not complete.\n\nTo see what \"complete\" means, we need two ideas first. A sequence is an ordered list of numbers that never ends. It has a first term, a second term, a third, and keeps going. This is what the \"...\" in 1/3=0.333...1/3 = 0.333... was hiding. The values 0.3, 0.33, 0.333, 0.3333, ... form a sequence of finite decimals that edges closer and closer to 1/31/3 without any single term equaling it. The decimal approximations of 2\\sqrt{2} form a sequence too: 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, ....\n\nA sequence converges when its terms settle toward a single value. The gap between each term and that target keeps shrinking, and it shrinks past any threshold you name. That target value is called the limit of the sequence. The sequence 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, ... converges toward 2\\sqrt{2}. By the fifth term the gap is less than 0.001, and by the tenth it's less than 0.0000000001. It never reaches the limit, but it gets arbitrarily close.\n\nNow we can say what completeness means. If the terms of a sequence keep bunching closer and closer together (mathematicians call this a Cauchy sequence), a complete system guarantees the sequence converges to something in the system. The rationals fail this test. You can write a Cauchy sequence of rationals whose terms squeeze tighter and tighter around 2\\sqrt{2}, but there's no rational for it to land on.\n\nTo fill the holes, we construct the real numbers, R\\mathbb{R}. A real number is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rationals. Just as the integer 3 was the whole collection of pairs with difference 3, the real number 2\\sqrt{2} is the whole collection of rational sequences converging toward it.\n\nEach term below is a fraction. Each one gets closer to 2\\sqrt{2}, but the target itself lives in the gap between all of them.\n\nThat sequence is one representative. But there are infinitely many other rational sequences converging to the same gap. Here are three completely different strategies, each producing a sequence of fractions that closes in on 2\\sqrt{2}:\n\nOne approach is to average guesses. Start with 1. Since 12=11^2 = 1 is too small, 2\\sqrt{2} must be bigger, so 2/1=22/1 = 2 is too big. Average the guess and the correction: (1+2)/2=3/2(1 + 2)/2 = 3/2. Now 3/23/2 is too big ((3/2)2=9/4(3/2)^2 = 9/4), and 2/(3/2)=4/32/(3/2) = 4/3 is too small, so average again: (3/2+4/3)/2=17/12(3/2 + 4/3)/2 = 17/12. Each step squares the error, so the fractions lock onto 2\\sqrt{2} fast.\n\nAnother approach looks for the fraction with the smallest denominator closest to the target. For 2\\sqrt{2}, it produces 1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, .... These are the best rational approximations you can get without using bigger denominators, and they alternate between slightly too small and slightly too big.\n\nThe simplest approach is brute force: chop the decimal expansion at each digit. 1, 14/10, 141/100, 1414/1000, .... Each fraction is just the decimal truncation written as a ratio. It converges, but slowly compared to the other two.\n\nAll three strategies generate different sequences of fractions, but they all close in on the same spot. The real number 2\\sqrt{2} is all of them at once, the whole equivalence class.\n\nThe reals complete the number line. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges to a real number. There are no more holes.\n\nThe reals also include other numbers that the rationals miss. Take a circle whose diameter is exactly 1. How long is its circumference, the distance around it? You can measure a straight line by laying a ruler along it. A shape made entirely of straight sides, called a polygon (triangle, square, hexagon, and so on), is almost as easy since you just measure each side and add them up. But a circle has no straight sides. You can't break it into flat pieces and add their lengths.\n\nYou can get close, though. Inscribe a polygon inside the circle so that every corner touches the edge. A triangle (3 sides) gives a rough underestimate. A square (4 sides) is better. A hexagon (6 sides), better still. Each polygon is made of straight segments you can measure exactly, and as you add more sides the polygon hugs the circle more tightly. Its perimeter creeps toward the true circumference. That value is π≈3.14159...\\pi \\approx 3.14159...\n\nNo fraction equals π\\pi exactly. Like 2\\sqrt{2}, it sits in a gap between rationals. Numbers like this are called irrational (not equal to any ratio of whole numbers). It's another equivalence class of Cauchy sequences: 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ....\n\nAnother irrational number shows up when you ask about growth. Suppose you invest €1 at 100% annual interest. Compounded once at year's end, you get €2€2. Compounded twice (50% every six months), you get (1+1/2)2=€2.25(1 + 1/2)^2 = €2.25. Compounded four times (25% each quarter), (1+1/4)4≈€2.44(1 + 1/4)^4 \\approx €2.44. As you compound more and more often, the result keeps growing but never explodes. It settles toward a specific value. Remember, the value a sequence settles toward is its limit, the number the terms keep getting closer to without overshooting. The limit of (1+1/n)n(1 + 1/n)^n as nn grows toward infinity is e≈2.71828...e \\approx 2.71828...\n\nLike π\\pi, no fraction equals ee exactly. Both sit in gaps between rationals, just like 2\\sqrt{2}. The reals fill all of these gaps at once.\n\nThe reals filled every hole on the number line. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots of positive numbers all work.\n\nBut we've only tested square roots on positive numbers. Every previous operation eventually hit an input that broke the system. Does this one?\n\nTry 4=2\\sqrt{4} = 2. Fine. 0=0\\sqrt{0} = 0. Fine. Now try −1\\sqrt{-1}. What number, squared, gives −1-1?\n\nNo real number does. We saw earlier that the distributive law forces negative times negative to be positive, and squaring zero gives zero, so nothing in the reals has a negative square.\n\nSame pattern. A reasonable operation produces a result the system can't hold.\n\nExtend the system using pairs again. A complex number is a pair (a,b)(a, b) of real numbers, written a+bia + bi, where ii is defined by one rule: i×i=−1i \\times i = -1. Calling it \"imaginary\" is a historical accident, no more imaginary than negative numbers were when people first invented them.\n\nWhere does ii live? No real number squares to −1-1, so ii isn't on the number line. It's genuinely new. Since it's not to the left or right of any real number, put it off the line entirely, one unit above zero on a new vertical axis. Every complex number a+bia + bi is a point on this plane: aa tells you how far along the real line, bb how far along the ii axis. 3+2i3 + 2i sits 3 units right and 2 units up. A one-dimensional line became a two-dimensional plane, because the new object didn't fit on the old line.\n\nAll the arithmetic rules from before still apply. The only new fact is i×i=−1i \\times i = -1. Everything else follows.\n\nWatch what multiplying by ii does. Start at 1 on the real axis. 1×i=i1 \\times i = i, one unit up. i×i=−1i \\times i = -1, one unit left. −1×i=−i-1 \\times i = -i, one unit down. −i×i=−(i×i)=1-i \\times i = -(i \\times i) = 1, back where you started. Four multiplications, a full loop.\n\nSplit a full circle into 360 degrees. Four equal steps make 360, so each step is 90 degrees. Multiplying by ii rotates a point 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nTwo multiplications rotate 90+90=18090 + 90 = 180 degrees, from 1 to −1-1. That's i2=−1i^2 = -1, two quarter-turns. The operation that seemed impossible on the number line becomes a rotation in the plane.\n\n3−5=?3 - 5 = ? had no natural number. 1÷31 \\div 3 had no integer. x2=2x^2 = 2 had no rational. x2=−1x^2 = -1 had no real. Each time we expanded the system. But what about x3−2x+5=0x^3 - 2x + 5 = 0? Expressions like these (adding, subtracting, multiplying a variable by constants, raising to whole-number powers) are polynomials. The complex numbers settle all of them. Every non-constant polynomial (non-constant just means \"not a plain number\") with complex coefficients (the numbers in front of each power of xx) has at least one complex root. Equivalently, over C\\mathbb{C}, you can break any such polynomial into linear factors. That doesn't mean every polynomial has a simple radical formula, but it does mean roots exist in C\\mathbb{C}.\n\nEvery number system followed one cycle:\n\nEach system nests inside the next like concentric rings, with the naturals at the center and each expansion adding a ring around the previous ones.\n\nThe cycle repeats across all five systems.\n\nThe naturals couldn't subtract, so we built the integers. The integers couldn't divide, so we built the rationals. The rationals had holes, so we built the reals. The reals couldn't handle all square roots, so we built the complex numbers.\n\nEach system contains all the previous ones: naturals inside integers, inside rationals, inside reals, inside complex numbers. Nothing is lost, and each step adds something new.\n\nDivision by zero never gets fixed while keeping the usual field laws. If a/0=xa / 0 = x and division is still inverse to multiplication, then a=0×x=0a = 0 \\times x = 0 for every aa, collapsing the distinction between all numbers. (There are alternative algebraic systems that assign values to division by zero, but they give up familiar rules.)\n\nThe expansion doesn't stop at C\\mathbb{C} either. Quaternions (four-dimensional) and octonions (eight-dimensional) go further. But each extension costs something. Quaternions give up commutativity (a×b≠b×aa \\times b \\neq b \\times a), octonions give up associativity ((a×b)×c≠a×(b×c)(a \\times b) \\times c \\neq a \\times (b \\times c)). The pattern continues, but the price gets steeper.\n\nEvery number you use today exists because an earlier system couldn't handle some operation, and someone decided to build a new one rather than accept the limitation.",

    "fullText": "The Paris-born artist reinvented the synthesizer through meditative and feedback-drenched sonic explorations\n\nThe French composer and musique concrète pioneer Éliane Radigue has died at the age of 94.\n\n“It is with immense sadness that we learn of the passing of Éliane Radigue at the age of 94,” the Paris-based experimental music center INA GRM posted on Instagram. “A major figure in musical creation has left us.”\n\nBorn in Paris in 1932, Radigue learned piano as a child, but hearing the electroacoustic compositions of musique concrète godfather Pierre Schaeffer on the radio in the early 1950s unlocked something new, setting the course for her own studies in sound. After meeting Schaeffer by chance in the French capital, she worked an assistant for the composer.\n\n“I was just cutting, splicing and editing tape,” she told the Guardian in a 2011 interview. “Of course, at that time the universe of electronic music was totally male, but I was pleased to do anything they asked of me. I was there to learn, and I was learning by doing, like an apprentice. It wasn’t really electronic music I was studying. The studio was against electronic music in favour of ‘concrete’ music: a simple idea of taking real sounds and manipulating them by cutting, splicing, editing, slowing down and so on.”\n\nIn the early 1970s, Radigue was introduced to the synthesizer and the instrument would go on to define the next 30 years of her work. “I just dug under its skin,” she said, and used the ARP 2500 synth to create much of her shape-shifting, meditative music that incorporated feedback and tape hiss. Beyond France, she caught the attention of US composers such as Philip Glass and Steve Reich, who were captivated by her innovative approach to sound.\n\n“What my generation did wasn’t a revolution,” said Reich. “It was a restoration of harmony and rhythm in a whole new way, but it did bring back those essentials that people wanted, that people craved, but in a way they hadn’t heard.”\n\nOn her celebrated Occam Ocean series, Radigue collaborated with solo musicians and ensembles to create drone soundscapes inspired by the vastness of the sea and as an antidote to hectic modern life. “She carved out her own path with unparalleled freedom and vision,” wrote INA GRM. “Our thoughts are with her family, friends and collaborators.”",

    "fullText": "The Citrini Research report titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis” became a major viral sensation this week across social media platforms. The conversation has been dominated by a significant lean toward the findings as 77% of influencers align with the warnings while 23% express disagreement. The report gained massive traction because it presents a detailed scenario in which the success of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a systemic financial collapse. It specifically targets the stability of the global economy and has influenced market prices for several major technology and payment companies as people evaluate the implications of abundant machine intelligence, says GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.\n\nShreyasee Majumder, Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The overall sentiment among influencers reflects a deep and growing anxiety about the unmodeled risks associated with rapid technological advancement. Most observers view the report as a vital stress test for existing economic assumptions about labor and consumption. Influencers see the current environment as a high stakes game where labs and corporations are forced to automate even if doing so eventually damages the consumer base that supports their revenue.”\n\nBased on an analysis of the tweets, the reaction to Citrini Research’s report is polarized, viral, and highly engaged. Here is a summary of the discussions, divided into opinions of agreement and disagreement:\n\nInfluencers agree with AI displacement spiral\n\nInfluencers disagree with predicted global crisis",

    "fullText": "Learn how SEO, AEO, and AI Visibility scores work together to determine your website's performance in both traditional and AI-powered search engines. Discover free tools to check all three at once\n\nIf you still think SEO is the only number that matters for your website, you're playing last decade's game. The search landscape has shifted dramatically. People now get answers from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and other AI assistants before they ever click a blue link on Google. And that changes everything about how we measure website performance.\n\nThere are now three scores every website owner should care about: SEO, AEO, and AI Visibility. Let me break down what each one means, why they matter, and how to track them all in one place.\n\nYou probably know this one. SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of making your website rank higher in traditional search results. It covers technical stuff like page speed, mobile-friendliness, meta tags, URL structure, and content quality.\n\nSEO is still important. Google isn't going anywhere. But here's the problem: even if you rank #1 for a query, AI assistants might pull the answer from someone else's content and serve it directly to the user. The user never visits your page. Your ranking becomes invisible.\n\nThat's why SEO alone doesn't cut it anymore. You need to think about the full picture.\n\nAEO is a newer concept that focuses on how well your content answers specific questions. Think of it as optimization for featured snippets, knowledge panels, and voice search results, but taken further into the AI era.\n\nWhen someone asks Siri, Alexa, or a chatbot a question, the system looks for content that directly and clearly answers that question. AEO measures how well your site is structured to be that answer.\n\nKey factors that influence your AEO score include structured data (schema markup), clear FAQ sections, concise and direct answers within your content, and proper heading hierarchy that makes it easy for machines to parse your information.\n\nA high AEO score means your content is formatted in a way that answer engines can easily extract and present to users.\n\nAI Visibility is the newest and perhaps most critical metric of the three. It measures how likely your website or brand is to appear in responses generated by AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity.\n\nThis goes beyond traditional crawling and indexing. AI Visibility depends on whether your content is accessible to AI crawlers (like GPTBot or ClaudeBot), whether your robots.txt allows or blocks these bots, whether your content is structured in a way that AI models can learn from, and whether your brand is mentioned across the web in contexts that AI training data would capture.\n\nUnlike SEO, where you can see your rankings directly in Google, AI Visibility has been harder to measure. Until recently, there wasn't a straightforward way to get a score for it.\n\nThink of it this way: SEO gets you found in Google. AEO gets your content selected as the direct answer. AI Visibility gets you mentioned when someone asks an AI assistant about your industry.\n\nA site might score 89 in SEO but only 44 in AI Visibility. That means it ranks well in traditional search but is practically invisible to AI systems. Another site might have great AI Visibility at 93 but lag behind in SEO at 74. That site shows up in AI conversations but struggles in Google results.\n\nThe sweet spot is having all three scores balanced and high.\n\nOne of the tools I've found useful for tracking these metrics is the RepuAI Site Checker. It runs a comprehensive analysis and gives you four scores at a glance: an Overall score plus individual breakdowns for AI Visibility, SEO, and AEO.\n\nWhat I like about this tool is the depth of the analysis. Below the top-level scores, you get a full breakdown across multiple modules: AI Files status, Structured Data, Content Quality, Security, Page Speed, Robots.txt configuration, JS Rendering, URL Structure, and Meta Tags. Each module highlights specific issues and gives you actionable recommendations.\n\nThe report also checks AI Bot Visibility separately, which tells you exactly which AI crawlers can and cannot access your site. This is something most traditional SEO tools completely ignore.\n\nBased on the reports I've seen on the platform, here's a rough benchmark. Scores above 85 across all three metrics put you in solid shape. Anything below 70 in any category means there's real work to do. And if your AI Visibility drops below 60, you're essentially invisible to a growing segment of how people search for information.\n\nFor context, the example in the screenshot above shows an Overall score of 90 with AI Visibility at 93, SEO at 89, and AEO at 85. That's a well-optimized site, though even with those numbers, the report identified 13 issues worth fixing.\n\nNo site is perfect. The goal is continuous improvement.\n\nFor SEO: Focus on page speed, clean URL structures, proper meta tags, and mobile optimization. These are the basics, but so many sites still get them wrong.\n\nFor AEO: Add structured data markup to your pages. Create clear, concise answers to common questions in your niche. Use proper heading tags (H1, H2, H3) to create a logical content hierarchy.\n\nFor AI Visibility: Check your robots.txt file and make sure you're not blocking AI crawlers like GPTBot, ClaudeBot, or PerplexityBot. Create an llms.txt file that helps AI systems understand your site. Make sure your content is accessible without heavy JavaScript rendering.\n\nThe websites that will thrive in the next few years are the ones that optimize for all three dimensions of search: traditional, answer-based, and AI-powered. Ignoring any one of them means leaving traffic and visibility on the table.\n\nIf you haven't checked your scores yet, RepuAI's free site checker is a good starting point. Run the analysis, see where you stand, and start fixing the issues it flags. It takes about 15-30 seconds to get your report.\n\nThe search game has changed. Your optimization strategy should change with it.",

    "fullText": "As I mentioned in Fields Medalists on School Mathematics, school mathematics usually gives a heavily distorted picture of mathematical practice. It's common for bright young people to participate in math competitions, an activity which is closer to that of mathematical practice. Unfortunately, while math competitions may be more representative of mathematical practice than school mathematics, math competitions are themselves greatly misleading. Furthermore, they've become tied to a misleading mythological conception of \"genius.\" I've collected relevant quotations below.\n\nAcknowledgment  - I obtained some of these quotations from a collection of mathematician quotations compiled by my colleague Laurens Gunnarsen.\n\nIn a 2003 interview, Fields Medalist Terence Tao answered the question\n\nWhat advice would you give to young people starting out in math (i.e. high school students and young researchers)?\n\nWell, I guess they should be warned that their impressions of what professional mathematics is may be quite different from the reality. In elementary school I had the vague idea that professional mathematicians spent their time computing digits of pi, for instance, or perhaps devising and then solving Math Olympiad style problems.\n\nIn The Case against the Mathematical Tripos mathematician GH Hardy wrote\n\nIt has often been said that Tripos mathematics was a collection of elaborate futilities, and the accusation is broadly true. My own opinion is that this is the inevitable result, in a mathematical examination, of high standards and traditions. The examiner is not allowed to content himself with testing the competence and the knowledge of the candidates; his instructions are to provide a test of more than that, of initiative, imagination, and even of some sort of originality. And as there is only one test of originality in mathematics, namely the accomplishment of original work, and as it is useless to ask a youth of twenty-two to perform original research under examination conditions, the examination necessarily degenerates into a kind of game, and instruction for it into initiation into a series of stunts and tricks.\n\nIn The Map of My Life mathematician Goro Shimura wrote of his experience teaching at a cram school\n\nI discovered that many of the exam problems were artificial and required some clever tricks. I avoided such types, and chose more straightforward problems, which one could solve with standard techniques and basic knowledge. There is a competition called the Mathematical Olympic, in which a competitor is asked to solve some problems, which are difficult and of the type I avoided. Though such a competition may have its raison d'être, I think those younger people who are seriously interested in mathematics will lose nothing by ignoring it.\n\nIn his lecture at the 2001 International Mathematics Olympiad, Andrew Wiles gave further description of how math competitions are unrepresentative of mathematical practice\n\nLet me then welcome you not only to this event but also to the greater world of mathematics in what many of us believe is now a golden age. However let me also warn you — whatever the route you have taken so far, the real challenges of mathematics are still before you. I hope to give you a glimpse of this. What then distinguishes the mathematics we professional mathematicians do from the mathematical problems you have faced in the last week? The two principal differences I believe are of scale and novelty. First of scale: in a mathematics contest such as the one you have just entered, you are competing against time and against each other. While there have been periods, notably in the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries when mathematicians would engage in timed duels with each other, nowadays this is not the custom. In fact time is very much on your side. However the transition from a sprint to a marathon requires a new kind of stamina and a profoundly different test of character. We admire someone who can win a gold medal in five successive Olympics games not so much for the raw talent as for the strength of will and determination to pursue a goal over such a sustained period of time. Real mathematical theorems will require the same stamina whether you measure the effort in months or in years [...]\n\nThe second principal difference is one of novelty [...] Let me stress that creating new mathematics is a quite different occupation from solving problems in a contest. Why is this? Because you don't know for sure what you are trying to prove or indeed whether it is true.\n\nIn his Mathematical Education essay, Fields Medalist William Thurston said\n\nRelated to precociousness is the popular tendency to think of mathematics as a race or as an athletic competition. There are widespread high school math leagues: teams from regional high schools meet periodically and are given several problems, with an hour or so to solve them.\n\nThere are also state, national and international competitions. These competitions are fun, interesting, and educationally effective for the people who are successful in them. But they also have a downside. The competitions reinforce the notion that either you ‘have good math genes’, or you do not. They put an emphasis on being quick, at the expense of being deep and thoughtful. They emphasize questions which are puzzles with some hidden trick, rather than more realistic problems where a systematic and persistent approach is important. This discourages many people who are not as quick or as practiced, but might be good at working through problems when they have the time to think through them. Some of the best performers on the contests do become good mathematicians, but there are also many top mathematicians who were not so good on contest math.\n\nQuickness is helpful in mathematics, but it is only one of the qualities which is helpful. For people who do not become mathematicians, the skills of contest math are probably even less relevant. These contests are a bit like spelling bees. There is some connection between good spelling and good writing, but the winner of the state spelling bee does not necessarily have the talent to become a good writer, and some fine writers are not good spellers. If there was a popular confusion between good spelling and good writing, many potential writers would be unnecessarily discouraged.\n\nIn his book Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction, Fields Medalist Timothy Gowers writes\n\nWhile the negative portrayal of mathematicians may be damaging, by putting off people who would otherwise enjoy the subject and be good at it, the damage done by the word genius is more insidious and possibly greater. Here is a rough and ready definition of genius: somebody who can do easily, and at a young age, something that almost nobody else can do except after years of practice, if at all. The achievements of geniuses have some sort of magic quality about them - it is as if their brains work not just more efficiently than ours, but in a completely different way. Every year or two a mathematics undergraduate arrives at Cambridge who regularly manages to solve a in a few minutes problems that take most people, including those who are supposed to be teaching them, several hours or more. When faced with such a person, all one can do is stand back and admire.\n\nAnd yet, these extraordinary people are not always the most successful research mathematicians. If you want to solve a problem that other professional mathematicians have tried and failed to solve before you, then, of the many qualities you will need, genius as I have defined it is neither necessary nor sufficient. To illustrate with an extreme example, Andrew Wiles, who (at the age of just over forty) proved Fermat's Last Theorem (which states that if x, y, z, and n are all positive integers and n is greater than 2, then xn + yn cannot equal zn) and thereby solved the world's most famous unsolved mathematics problem, is undoubtedly very clever, but he is not a genius in my sense.\n\nHow, you might ask, could he possibly have done what he did without some sort of mysterious extra brainpower? The answer is that, remarkable though his achievement was, it is not so remarkable as to defy explanation. I do not know precisely what enabled him to succeed, but he would have needed great courage, determination, and patience, a wide knowledge of some very difficult work done by others, the good fortune to be in the right mathematical area at the right time, and an exceptional strategic ability.\n\nThis last quality is, ultimately, more important than freakish mental speed: the most profound contributions to mathematics are often made by tortoises rather than hares. As mathematicians develop, they learn various tricks of the trade, partly from the work of other mathematicians and partly as a result of many hours spent thinking about mathematics. What determines whether they can use their expertise to solve notorious problems is, in large measure, a matter of careful planning: attempting problems that are likely to be fruitful, knowing when to give up a line of thought (a difficult judgement to make), being able to sketch broad outlines of arguments before, just occasionally, managing to fill in the details. This demands a level of maturity which is by no means incompatible with genius but which does not always accompany it.\n\nIn Does one have to be a genius to do maths? Terence Tao concurs with Gowers and expands on the same theme.\n\nFields Medalist Alexander Grothendieck describes his own relevant experience in Récoltes et Semailles\n\nSince then I’ve had the chance in the world of mathematics that bid me welcome, to meet quite a number of people, both among my “elders” and among young people in my general age group who were more brilliant, much more ‘gifted’ than I was. I admired the facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them from the cradle–while for myself I felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things I had to learn (so I was assured) things I felt incapable of understanding the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed, there was little about me that identified the kind of bright student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates almost by sleight of hand, the most forbidding subjects.\n\nIn fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished mathematicians. Still from the perspective or thirty or thirty five years, I can state that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve done all things, often beautiful things in a context that was already set out before them, which they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they would have to rediscover in themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was mine: The capacity to be alone.",

Today, it figures out queries like this in milliseconds. The technology behind this magic has a name - Google RankBrain.\n\nAnd if you think RankBrain is a relic from the SEO history archives, here's some news: this algorithm is not only alive and well, it has become the foundation for everything Google does with artificial intelligence in search today.\n\nLet's break down how it works, why it matters more than ever, and what all of this means for your brand's visibility - in traditional search and in the new AI-powered engines.\n\nGoogle officially confirmed RankBrain's existence on October 26, 2015. It's a machine learning system built into Google's core algorithm (Hummingbird) that helps process search results and understand what users are actually looking for.\n\nAt launch, RankBrain handled roughly 15% of all search queries — specifically, the ones Google had never seen before. That might not sound like much. But when Google processes billions of queries a day, 15% translates to hundreds of millions of searches the engine previously couldn't handle properly.\n\nToday, RankBrain is involved in virtually every query. Google called it the third most important ranking factor — after content and links. And Google's own experiments showed that RankBrain picks the best result more accurately than human search engineers: 80% accuracy for RankBrain versus 70% for humans.\n\nRankBrain isn't a standalone algorithm that replaces everything else. It's a component inside Hummingbird, like a part within a car engine. And it has two main functions.\n\nBefore RankBrain, Google looked at individual words in a query and tried to find pages with exact matches. RankBrain changed the approach: it converts words into mathematical vectors (numerical representations) and searches for connections between concepts.\n\nA simple example: if someone searches \"what to wear in the rain to a business meeting,\" RankBrain understands the query isn't just about \"rain\" or \"clothes\" — it's about a specific situation. It connects the concepts of \"business attire,\" \"rain protection,\" and \"recommendations\" — and serves relevant results, even if no single page contains that exact phrase.\n\nThis became possible through the shift from \"strings\" to \"entities.\" Google stopped seeing text as a collection of characters and started recognizing real-world objects: people, companies, products, places.\n\nHere's what makes RankBrain truly smart: it watches how people interact with search results. Did the user click a result and stay on the page? Good sign. Did they bounce back after 5 seconds and click another result? That means the first page didn't answer their question.\n\nRankBrain uses these signals to continuously fine-tune rankings. It can dynamically adjust the weight of different factors — backlinks, content freshness, text length, domain authority — depending on the specific query. If users show that a new order of results works better, it stays. If not, the system rolls back the changes.\n\nIn essence, RankBrain is a perpetual A/B test at the scale of billions of queries.\n\nSome SEO professionals consider RankBrain outdated — after all, BERT, MUM, and Gemini came along, and RankBrain was supposedly left behind. This is a misconception.\n\nRankBrain hasn't gone anywhere. It evolved into what experts call the \"reasoning layer\" — the connective tissue between all of Google's AI systems. BERT handles deep natural language understanding. MUM processes multilingual and multimodal queries. Gemini powers generative answers. And RankBrain orchestrates all of it, deciding how much weight to give each signal for a specific query.\n\nThink of it as a conductor of an orchestra: each instrument (BERT, MUM, Gemini) plays its part, but RankBrain decides when and how loud.\n\nNow for the really interesting part. Understanding RankBrain isn't just an academic exercise. It's a direct path to understanding how AI search works as a whole.\n\nRankBrain was the first time machine learning was embedded into Google's core search algorithm. Everything that followed — BERT, AI Overviews, AI Mode — grew from the same logic: understand intent, not keywords.\n\nAnd here's the problem for brands: that same logic now operates in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other AI platforms. Except the rules there are even stricter.\n\nIn traditional Google, you get a list of 10 links — even if you're in 7th place, you're at least visible. In AI search, there's one answer. If the AI engine doesn't consider your brand authoritative, relevant, and trustworthy enough — you simply don't exist to the user.\n\nAccording to expert estimates, traditional search will lose up to 50% of its share by 2028. AI answers already appear in 57% of Google results. ChatGPT serves 400 million users weekly.\n\nThe good news: the principles that work for RankBrain also work for the new AI engines. Here's what you should be doing right now.\n\nRankBrain analyzes user intent. Stop thinking in terms of \"which keywords to insert\" and start thinking: \"what problem is this person trying to solve?\" Group queries into intent clusters: informational, transactional, navigational.\n\nAI systems (RankBrain included) prioritize content that explores topics in depth. Not 300-word posts written for SEO, but comprehensive guides that fully address the user's question.\n\nSchema markup helps both Google and AI engines understand what your content is about. FAQ schema, organization markup, product and author markup — all of this increases your chances of being cited in AI responses.\n\nRankBrain factors in behavioral signals. Page load speed, mobile usability, Core Web Vitals — all of these affect how users interact with your site, and therefore your rankings.\n\nAI systems aggregate signals from multiple sources: press mentions, reviews, social media, forums. Brands with a strong presence across multiple channels receive more mentions in AI responses. Estimates suggest roughly 250 quality publications are needed to meaningfully influence how an LLM perceives a brand.\n\nFresh content gets priority in both RankBrain and AI engines. If your last blog post is two years old, AI systems will more likely cite a competitor's more up-to-date source.\n\nYou can't improve what you don't measure. Traditional SEO tools don't show how your brand appears in ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini responses. You need specialized solutions for that — and this is exactly the problem RepuAI solves, tracking mentions, sentiment, and visibility of your brand across AI search engines.\n\nRankBrain ushered in an era where machine learning became an integral part of search. But that era isn't standing still. Today, a new discipline is gaining momentum — Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), optimization for generative search engines.\n\nThe logic of GEO is simple: if you used to optimize for an algorithm that ranks links, now you need to optimize for an algorithm that generates answers. And that's an entirely different game.\n\nIn the world of GEO, your brand needs to be:\n\nAnd here the circle closes: the principles RankBrain established — understanding intent, focusing on the user, continuous learning — have become the foundation for all modern AI search systems.\n\nRankBrain was the first — but far from the last — step Google took toward AI-driven search. Understanding its principles gives you a strategic advantage: you see not individual algorithm updates, but the overall direction the industry is heading.\n\nThat direction points one way: from keywords to meaning, from links to authority, from SERP positions to mentions in AI responses.\n\nBrands that understand this now will find themselves in a winning position. The rest will be playing catch-up.\n\nWant to find out how your brand looks through the eyes of AI right now?

    "fullText": "Japan’s OHISAMA demonstration satellite is scheduled to be launched in fiscal 2026 on a mission that could revolutionize clean energy.\n\nAlthough earlier experiments have detected signals transmitted from orbit, the OHISAMA project aims to be the first in the world to deliver solar power to a receiving site on Earth and convert it into usable electricity.\n\nThe satellite will be carried aboard Space One Co.’s Kairos 5 small rocket.\n\nSpace-based solar power (SBSP) refers to the concept of placing large solar collectors in orbit that can convert sunlight into electricity onboard. That energy is transmitted wirelessly, typically by microwave or in some concepts by laser, to a receiving station on Earth.\n\nThe received energy is then converted back into electricity for distribution through the grid.\n\nSBSP remains an experimental technology and is positioned as a long-term research and development target under the Japanese government’s Basic Energy Plan.\n\nUnlike ground-based solar and wind power, SBSP is largely insulated from weather-related variables and the day-night cycle.\n\nIn addition, the ability to modulate transmission output and redirect power to different locations could make SBSP a flexible option during disasters and periods of fluctuating demand.\n\nA model proposed by Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems), a nonprofit R&D foundation commissioned by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to develop the system, envisions an architecture featuring 2.5-kilometer-square solar arrays deployed in geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometers above Earth.\n\nElectricity generated in orbit would be transmitted by microwave to a ground-based receiving antenna roughly 4 kilometers in diameter and then fed into the power grid.\n\nUnder this model, a single SBSP unit would generate about 1 gigawatt, an output described as sufficient to cover more than 10 percent of Tokyo’s annual electricity consumption.\n\nMICROWAVES BEAMED FROM 450 KM ABOVE\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, the experiment will test whether power transmitted from space as microwaves can be efficiently converted back into electricity on the ground.\n\nThe OHISAMA satellite, weighing about 180 kg, carries an integrated power-generation and transmission panel measuring 70 cm by 2 meters.\n\nIts generating capacity is a modest 720 watts, but the mission aims to use energy received by a 64-meter parabolic antenna at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Usuda Deep Space Center in Nagano Prefecture to light an LED.\n\nThe Usuda facility is used to track and communicate with deep-space spacecraft.\n\nFollowing a successful wireless power transmission test from an aircraft at an altitude of 7 km in 2024, the satellite mission will beam power from a 450-km orbit to assess how transmission distance, the ionosphere and the atmosphere affect efficiency.\n\nA central challenge in SBSP wireless power delivery is limiting diffraction-driven beam spreading, which typically requires very large transmitting apertures and precise phase control.\n\nMany SBSP concepts rely on retrodirective beam control: the ground-based rectenna sends a pilot signal that the satellite uses to steer the microwave beam back toward the receiver.\n\nJapan has extensive R&D experience in microwave power transmission and retrodirective beam pointing.\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, SBSP development is accelerating in the United States, China and Europe, and the U.S. military is also widely believed to be pursuing its own experimental satellites.\n\nFirst proposed in the United States in the 1960s, the SBSP concept holds that space-based systems could deliver as much as 10 times more energy per year than terrestrial solar because cloud cover and the day-night cycle constrain generation on Earth.\n\nIn Japan, SBSP research and development has been under way since the 1980s. Through ground-based trials and other tests, Japan has advanced the demonstration and validation of key component technologies, including high-precision beam control, integrated generation-and-transmission panels, and more efficient conversion of electrical power into microwaves.\n\n“Technologically, Japan is leading the world in this field,” said Hiroki Yanagawa, a senior executive in J-spacesystems’ Satellite System and Earth Observation Division.\n\nSBSP COULD POWER LUNAR EXPLORATION\n\nIn 2023, the California Institute of Technology launched an SBSP demonstrator and succeeded in short‑distance power transmission in space as well as in detecting faint microwave signals on the ground. But it did not deliver usable electricity at meaningful levels.\n\nIf electricity beamed from OHISAMA can be received, converted and used on the ground, it would represent a world first.\n\nSuch a success would likely be followed by additional in-orbit trials, with an eye toward commercialization in the 2040s. Potential longer-term applications include supplying power from orbit to support lunar exploration missions.\n\nThe launch schedule, however, remains contingent on the performance of Space One’s Kairos rocket.\n\nAfter failures of the first two launches, attention has shifted to the flight of Kairos 3 on Feb. 25.\n\n“While overseas rockets were an option, we selected Kairos in line with national policy to support Japan’s private-sector launch capabilities,” said Yanagawa of J-spacesystems.",

    "fullText": "Under Antarctica's miles-thick ice sheet, scientists have identified 207 possible volcanoes that may be speeding up ice melt and raising global sea levels, according to a recent study published in Earth-Science Reviews.\n\nResearchers created the first continent-wide inventory of these hidden volcanoes, called \"ANT-SGV-25.\" By mapping the volcanoes' size, shape, and location, scientists hope to better understand how heat from beneath the Antarctic ice sheet threatens its stability.\n\nResearchers from several universities compiled data from radar surveys, satellite imagery, and earlier volcanic records to document 207 subglacial volcanic structures. Many are clustered in West Antarctica.\n\nLead author Cui Xiangbin told Xinhua: \"Recent research increasingly shows that subglacial volcanoes hidden beneath the massive ice sheet can alter subglacial topography, promote basal ice melting, regulate subglacial hydrological activity, and ultimately affect ice flow dynamics and the stability of the ice sheet.\"\n\nAs Antarctica's ice melts, global sea levels rise. When volcanoes heat the ice from below, meltwater forms and acts as a lubricant, which allows glaciers to slide faster toward the ocean.\n\nHigher seas threaten coastal homes, roads, and drinking water supplies with flooding and saltwater contamination. According to Yale Environment 360, with 6 feet of sea-level rise, about 1.9 million U.S. homes (worth $882 billion) could be underwater by 2100.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency states that coastal flooding hazards such as storm surge, waves, and erosion \"can cause extensive damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.\"\n\nPrevious eruptions have changed the topography and posed a risk to communities. A 1996 eruption in Iceland triggered a sudden glacial flood, which, per a Smithsonian report, was preceded by \"an unusual sequence\" of earthquakes.\n\nThe report notes that extreme events like these have released gases that caused acid haze, which perturbed the weather in Western Eurasia, the North Atlantic, and the Arctic. Some of the impacts of this haze included \"crop failures, livestock and fish deaths, and various illnesses, including fluorine poisoning.\"\n\nThe World Economic Forum has previously stated that, while some melting is now inevitable, humans \"can still avoid the worst impacts by urgently cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Top 10: Most powerful aircraft ever made",
    "fullText": "The power of modern aircraft is staggering, and these incredible machines grow ever more powerful.\n\nWhen the Heinkel He 178, the first pure turbojet aircraft, first flew in 1939, it did so with 4.41 kilonewtons (kN) of thrust; the number 1 entry in our list has a quite bonkers 1776kN. Here are the 10 Most Powerful Planes ever made:\n\nQuick note: Science geeks can rightly be pedantic about the units used to measure thrust; we will use kilonewtons, which measure force, but we will use casual rather than scientific language and sometimes use the word ‘power’ or ‘thrust’. Thrust levels, where possible, are given as static at sea level\n\nThe massive C-5M Galaxy is the US Air Force’s heaviest and largest aircraft. This strategic transport plane has a maximum weight of 840,000 pounds (381,024 kilograms), and moving such a massive bulk requires enormous force, and the C-5M relies on four huge engines.\n\nThe C-5M has four General Electric F-138-GE100 engines, each offering up a thwacking 51,250Ibfs of thrust; this is 227 kilonewtons or 912Kn in total. This is a lot of muscle, and considering the hefty loads the C-5M can take, including two M1 Abrams main battle tanks, this is much needed.\n\nThe C-5 is a giant machine, and until the Soviet An-124 arrived on the scene in 1986, the Galaxy was the world’s largest aeroplane. The C-5 is 75.31 metres (247 ft) long with a wingspan of 67.89 metres (223 ft) and a height of 19.84 m (65 ft).\n\nThough the early C-5 (which first flew in 1968) was fraught with technical issues, the C-5M seems to have rectified most of them. It is more reliable and more powerful. In 2009, it smashed a series of world records, mostly relating to climb rate with a given payload and altitudes reached.\n\nTwo airliners of the 1960s were far faster than their modern equivalents and were even faster than today’s F-35 and Super Hornet fighters: the Anglo-French Concorde and the Soviet Tu-144. While modern airliners travel below the speed of sound (Mach 1), both the Concorde and Tu-144 could go more than double that, exceeding Mach 2.\n\nSuch high speeds demanded an extremely exacting combination of shaping, materials and power, especially as these were not quick dashes into Mach 2 as fighter aircraft do, but prolonged cruises. The Cold War was on during the Tu-144 and Concorde’s development, and there was much international prestige to be won from becoming the leader in the new field of supersonic transport.\n\nThe Soviet equivalent of Concorde was bigger, faster and more powerful. Concorde had a maximum thrust of 677 kN, while the Tu-144 had 960 kN (some sources put the figure as 800kN). This did not make the Tu-144 better, as, in most ways, it was an inferior design.\n\nThe Soviet Tu-144 first flew on 31 December 1968, two months before the Concorde. This made it the first genuinely supersonic airliner to fly, but then went onto crash at the 1973 Paris air show. After a short, disastrous service life, the Tu-144 was withdrawn from passenger service (and later freight service). Surprisingly, one ended its life in the service of NASA. 16 Tu-144s were built.\n\nThe heaviest combat aircraft ever flown, maxing out at 275,000 kg (606,271 lb) the same as 45 adult elephants, the Soviet Tu-160 heavy bomber remains in service today. It is as fast as Concorde was, topping at just over twice the speed of sound. The Tupolev Tu-160 can carry 45,000 kg (99,208 lb) of air-launched weapons, including nuclear missiles.\n\nIn many ways it’s like a scaled-up version of the US B-1 bomber, and the Tu-160 also employs variable geometry ‘swing-wings’ to achieve efficiency for both high-speed flight and benign take-off and landing characteristics at lower speeds. Compared to the B-1B, the Tu-160 has much more thrust, boasting 980 kilonewtons to the B-1B’s 547.\n\nComparison with the US B-1B is hard to resist, and it is interesting to note that the original B-1, the B-1A, was faster than the Tu-160, but the actual aircraft that entered service, the B-1B, traded speed (it is capable of Mach 1.25 from an original Mach 2.2) for a greater degree of stealth through both materials, shaping and mission profile (moving to lower-level attack).\n\nThe Tu-160’s maximum thrust level involves the use of reheat (afterburner) to pump additional fuel into the aft of the engine to generate greater thrust at the cost of greatly reduced fuel efficiency. Each of the four Samara NK-321 afterburning turbofan engines deliver 245 kN with afterburner for a total of 980 kilonewtons.\n\nWhat may come of something of a surprise is the absence of military types from now on in this story, because today’s airliners have staggering amounts of thrust. The Boeing 777 is the most powerful (and largest) twin-engined aircraft ever flown, with 1026 kilonewtons of thrust at its disposal.\n\nTo put the sheer grunt of the 777 into perspective, it has the same thrust as 2.8 Vulcan B.2 bombers, a famously large and loud bomber used by Britain’s Royal Air Force.\n\nKey to the 777’s success was the General Electric GE90, a new generation of very big, very efficient and relatively quiet turbofan engines, the largest diameter then ever seen on an aircraft. It was also the first Boeing aircraft to be planned entirely with computer-assisted design (CAD).\n\nThe Boeing 777, a long-range wide-body airliner, first flew in 1994. Its timing was perfect as older aircraft like the DC-10 and TriStar were beginning to bow out. Here was a new superior aircraft that could do the job, on two rather than the three or four engines of earlier airliners. It proved a massive success, with 1738 made and counting.\n\nThe European Airbus A340-600 is a ‘rocket-ship’ of an airliner, and pilots tend to love it. The baseline A340 is a long-range, wide-body passenger airliner, a project officially launched in 1987. The Airbus A340-300 took its maiden flight on 25 October 1991.\n\nWhen we spoke to former A340 pilot Ian Black, he noted, “You have to remember that this was an aeroplane that had the capacity to carry 300+ passengers, 100+ tons of fuel and stacks of cargo, yet fully loaded it was still powerful; empty it was gloriously overpowered!”\n\nThe A340-600 is the longest member of the A340 series. Just over 75 metres (246 feet) it was for a time the longest airliner (being outdone by the 747-8’s arrival). It is the longest aircraft Airbus has ever made, 1.5 metres (5 feet) longer than the A350-1000 and around three metres (10 feet) more than the A380.\n\nThe A340-600 with the most thrust is the A340-600HGW version with 1080 kN thrust from four Rolls-Royce Trent 560 turbofans. The HGW is a beefed-up aircraft with a strengthened fuselage and more fuel. The charismatic A340 was produced from 1991 to 2018, and was replaced in the Airbus range by the more fuel-efficient twin-engined Airbus A350.\n\nThe ultimate member of the 747 family, the 747-8 is a longer aircraft, offering greater efficiency and harvesting new technology from Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. It is powered by a smaller version of the General Electric GEnx turbofan from the 787 Dreamliner. Each GEnx-2B67B turbofan engine generates 296 kN for a rather exciting total of 1184 kN.\n\nThe 747-8 is a beast, with a maximum take-off weight of 975,000 pounds (442,252kg), making it the heaviest Boeing airliner. The 747-8 is the largest variant of the 747, and Boeing's largest aircraft. It is not, however, Boeing’s longest aircraft, as the Boeing 777-9 is a cheeky 72cm (2 feet) longer.\n\nThe Boeing 747-8 is likely the ultimate in the much-loved Boeing 747 ‘Jumbo’ series, and shares a similar appearance but the superficial similarity hides many differences. For example, while outwardly, the wing appears little different to older 747s, it is a far more advanced design: it's thicker and deeper. The new wing can carry more fuel and fitted raked wingtips for greater efficiency.\n\nThough production ended in 2023 after only 13 years and 155 airframes, the good news for the 747-8 is that the United States Air Force has ordered two to serve as the next presidential aircraft, Air Force One. These will be designated VC-25Bs and are hoped to enter service in 2027.\n\nThe age of wide-body airliners began in 1970 with the American Boeing 747. A wide-body aircraft can accommodate two passenger aisles with seven or more seats abreast. The 747, which initially carried up to 440 passengers, could carry far more people than earlier aircraft. The aircraft proved popular with airlines, and soon many fell in love with the iconic ‘Jumbo-jet’ and its distinctive ‘hump’.\n\nIn 1989 a new version named 747-400 began operating. Enhancements included more efficient engine options, a 10% reduction in operating costs, lighter materials, and a new cockpit not requiring a Flight Engineer, reducing the flight crew to two.\n\nThe current most powerful version of the 747-400, the ER (Extended Range) and Extended Range Freighter (ERF, pictured) boast a whopping 1124 kilonewtons from their four engines. The 747-400ERF has a maximum take-off weight of 910,000 pounds (412,769 kg) and can carry a maximum payload of 248,600 pounds (112,763kg).\n\nThe 747-400ERF freight variant is a capable machine, with a maximum payload of 112,760 kg (248,600 pounds), around the same weight as 19 elephants (though why you would need to move so many elephants is anyone’s guess).\n\nThe Antonov An-225 was a giant, even among giants. Purpose-designed to move booster rockets and Buran orbiters (the Soviet space shuttle) for the space programme, the An-225 needed to be big. Prior to its development, the biggest aircraft in the world at the time, the Antonov An-124, was too small and not powerful enough for this new task.\n\nThe new design took much from the An-124 but added an additional pair of engines, a longer fuselage, and a completely new tail to handle the wake turbulence generated by the massive external loads carried ‘piggy-back ’on the aircraft's upper fuselage.\n\nThe Antonov An-225 Mriya (Ukrainian for ‘dream’) first flew in late December 1988 and was soon smashing a series of world records.  The An-225 set 214 national and 124 world records, including transporting the heaviest payload ever lifting by air, an astonishing 559,577 pounds (253,820 kg) – the same as 42 elephants!\n\nSix massive Progress D-18T turbofans powered it, each pumping out an awe-inspiring 229.5 kN for a grand total of 1377 kilonewtons.  Sadly, the only Antonov An-225 was destroyed at the Battle of Antonov Airport in Ukraine in February 2022, though there is an effort to fund and rebuild this fantastic machine.\n\nWith its full double-deck configuration and capacity to carry up to 853 passengers, The massive Airbus A380 airliner is in a class of its own. The A380’s maximum take-off weight is 1,267,658 pounds (575,000 kg), equivalent to 17 fully-loaded Lancaster bombers.\n\nRival firm Boeing explored double-deck designs, but only Airbus chose to develop a large wide-body double-decked airliner, and the A380 has earned an enviable reputation for comfort and space on long-haul flights. However, it has failed to achieve the commercial success Airbus hoped for.\n\nSuch an impressive aircraft needs a lot of power, and the most powerful A380 is the A380-842s of Qantas (pictured) and Emirates with their Rolls-Royce Trent 972-84 engines. The 972-84 can deliver a rather intense 356kN, but, in service, is limited to 341kN to preserve engine life (and is plenty). Multiply this by four, and you get an extremely hearty 1364 kilonewtons.\n\nDespite its popularity with passengers, the A380 has suffered because of its high price tag, the need to fill the large number of seats for each flight, and the adaptions airports need to make to accommodate this behemoth. Despite production ending in 2021, some predict something of a renaissance for the A380 with aircraft returning into service.\n\nThe incredible Stratolaunch Roc is the biggest aircraft flying and the most powerful. Used for the air launch of space rockets and hypersonic vehicles, this ‘mothership’ is powered by two six Pratt & Whitney PW4000 turbofans combining to give a massive maximum of 1776 kilonewtons of thrust.\n\nThe brainchild of Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen, the Roc is named for a legendary bird of prey big and strong enough to carry elephants in its talon; this is an appropriate name for this gargantuan aircraft. The Roc boasts a wingspan of 117 metres (or 385 feet) the largest of all aircraft, dwarfing the next biggest, the ‘Spruce Goose’ of 1947 with its relatively paltry 97.51 m (319 ft 11 in) wingspan.\n\nLike the twin aircraft of World War II the Roc has a dual-fuselage configuration. It has a high-wing design that allows for the launches of spacecraft and aircraft from the aircraft centreline and below the wing.\n\nThe enormous Roc can carry a payload of over half a million (500,000 lbs or 226,796 kg) and is not built for speed. Despite being the most powerful aircraft on this list, it is also the slowest with a cruising speed, at 250mph, more suitable for a 1940s airliner.\n\nFollow Hush-Kit's incredible aviation stories on Substack and X\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please click the Follow button above to see more like it from Autocar",

    "description": "Trump emphasized his affordability goals during his 2026 State of the Union address.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump zeroed in on what he calls America's \"roaring economy.\"\n\nThe president gave his annual speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. He opened the event focused on his administration's economic agenda, especially inflation rates and consumer prices.\n\n\"I inherited a nation in crisis with a stagnant economy,\" Trump told lawmakers, adding, \"A short time ago, we were a dead country. Now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world.\"\n\nHere are the biggest notes on the economy from the speech.\n\nTrump said his administration has driven down inflation and mortgage rates, along with energy prices. He touted a strong stock market, and said the administration has \"lifted a record number of Americans off food stamps\" with their updated SNAP rules.\n\nHe blamed Democratic leaders for high inflation rates. \"Their policies created the high prices\" his administration was aiming to bring down, he said.\n\nThe consumer price index, a key measure of inflation, cooled slightly in January but remains about the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.\n\nThe president added that he and Republican allies delivered the \"largest tax cuts in American history\" in their latest budget bill, alongside promises to end taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security.\n\nHe did not introduce new tax policies early in the speech, but he did mention Trump Accounts, a newly-launched federal investment account for children that will be available in July.\n\nFor retirees, Trump announced a new plan to offer federal retirement matching contributions to Americans without employer-sponsored plans.\n\n\"My administration will give these oft-forgotten American workers, great people, the people that built our country, access to the same type of retirement plan offered to every federal worker. We will match your contribution with up to $1,000 each year,\" he said.\n\nTrump said he \"wants to stop all payments to big insurance companies.\" He underscored his \"Great Healthcare Plan,\" which outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums, implement cost-sharing programs, and increase cost transparency.\n\n\"I am also ending the wildly inflated cost of prescription drugs,\" he said. The Trump administration officially launched TrumpRx a few weeks ago, a direct-to-consumer prescription platform. The president spoke specifically about affordable IVF drugs.\n\nThe administration and Republican lawmakers opted not to renew enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies at the end of 2025. The credits helped lower-and middle-income families afford marketplace insurance coverage, and millions have dropped their plans so far due to skyrocketing 2026 premium costs.\n\nThe president said his administration is lowering housing prices.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nHe spoke about his January executive order to ban large Wall Street investment firms from buying single-family homes. \"Now I am asking Congress to make that ban permanent, because homes are for people, not corporations,\" he said.\n\nHousing market analysts told Business Insider that this policy is unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, typically in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nTrump also said his administration is boosting jobs in the construction sector, one of the few parts of the labor market alongside healthcare that has seen growth this year.\n\nThroughout his second term, the Trump administration has leaned into affordability issues, especially high prices on consumer goods. The White House has touted budget changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, tax breaks for middle- and higher-income Americans. In some cases, the president has reached across the aisle for economic priorities, like a long-time Democrat-backed policy to rein in credit card rates.\n\nAs for the job market, growth has been the lowest in decades aside from recessions, and Trump's Department of Government Efficiency took a sizable swing at the federal workforce. The administration hopes the pending appointment of former Wall Streeter Kevin Warsh to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be a path toward lower interest rates in 2026, which could juice hiring — at the risk of growing inflation.\n\nA YouGov and MarketWatch poll published February 24 found that 83% of Americans believe affordability has worsened or remained stagnant under Trump's second term.\n\nTrump is expected to speak for at least two hours this evening, covering topics like the Supreme Court tariff ruling, AI investment, immigration, and foreign policy.",

    "title": "Trump calls out 'unfortunate' Supreme Court ruling on his signature tariffs at the State of the Union address",
    "description": "President Donald Trump addressed the nation in front of Congress and touted his economic policies, including the tariffs that SCOTUS struck down.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump called the Supreme Court's decision that overturned his signature tariffs \"unfortunate\" during his State of the Union address.\n\nTrump addressed the nation several days after the Supreme Court ruled against most of his 2025 tariffs that were enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nDespite this setback to his economic agenda, which he touted on Tuesday, Trump said he wouldn't need to make new trade deals, even though he used the now-struck-down tariffs as his primary negotiating tool, because other countries were happy with the deals made so far.\n\nImmediately after the SCOTUS ruling, Trump signed an executive order to impose a 10% \"global tariff\" under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Unlike the IEEPA tariffs, any duties under Section 122 last 150 days before requiring congressional approval.\n\n\"They're a little more complex, but they're actually probably better, leading to a solution that will be even stronger than before. Congressional action will not be necessary,\" said Trump of his new 10% \"global tariffs\" at the State of the Union.\n\n\"It's already time-tested and approved, and as time goes by, I believe the tariffs paid for by foreign countries will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern-day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love,\" Trump added.\n\nAccording to the Customs and Border Protection, the US has collected around $129 billion in revenue under the IEEPA tariffs. Companies large and small have now begun the messy process of litigating for tariff refunds, and some, like FedEx, have filed lawsuits at the Court of International Trade.\n\nRecent studies found that it was companies and consumers who pay for the majority of tariffs, including a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that said, \"90% of the tariffs' economic burden fell on US firms and consumers.\"\n\nThe landmark SCOTUS ruling was made at a time when concerns about affordability and economic health were widespread. Recent data shows that while the US economy grew 2.2% in 2025, job creation stalled. Economists previously told Business Insider that this pattern is widening the gap between the wealthy and everyone else.\n\nAccording to a February poll jointly conducted by ABC News, The Washington Post, and Ipsos, a majority of Americans disapprove of how the president is handling inflation, tariffs, relations with other countries, immigration, and the economy.\n\nAccording to the University of Michigan's monthly consumer sentiment survey, consumer confidence in February is more than 12% lower than in the same month in 2025.\n\nDana M Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board, commented in its February economic sentiment research that though consumers' pessimistic expectations for the future \"eased somewhat,\" confidence remains \"well below\" the four-year peak achieved in November 2024.",

    "description": "Other expat mothers became Roberta Maretti's lifeline. \"Together, we made unfamiliar places feel like home,\" she said.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Roberta Maretti, 50, author of \"Where the World Took Me.\" Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in Italy, and moved around a lot when I was growing up. By the time I finished high school, I'd lived in several countries across Europe and Asia.\n\nAfter that, I moved again on my own, this time to study hotel management in Switzerland.\n\nGrowing up abroad made me inherently multicultural. I absorbed new foods, languages, traditions — and learned early that identity isn't tied to one place.\n\nAfter working at the Manchester Airport Hilton in the UK, I transferred internally to Chicago, then San Juan, Puerto Rico, and later to Shanghai.\n\nIt was in Manchester that I met my now ex-husband, who is German, and together we built a life that spanned countries. After finding out I was pregnant, I decided to step away from the hotel industry to focus on raising our children.\n\nOur daughter was born in Shanghai in 2005, and just a few months later, we moved to Sanya, a small island city in China. By the time she turned 3, we had relocated to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. My son came next, and he was only 1 when we relocated to Beijing and then Singapore.\n\nEven with constant moves, my children made friends, attended school, and learned to adapt almost effortlessly.\n\nThe hardest part was always the goodbyes — leaving friends, routines, and the familiar behind. Yet each move strengthened their resilience, curiosity, and open-mindedness.\n\nFood became our anchor. Shared meals — a curry with roti prata in Little India, dumplings sizzling on Shanghai streets, or a simple bowl of congee in Kuala Lumpur — transported us instantly to the heart of each city, making each place feel like home.\n\nBuilding a sense of belonging took effort, and expat communities were essential. Other expat mothers became my lifeline, supporting one another through playdates, outings, and the ups and downs of life abroad. Together, we made unfamiliar places feel like home.\n\nIn Singapore and Malaysia, where English is widely spoken, our circles often included locals, while in China, expat networks became central. Still, small gestures from locals left a lasting mark — like Mr Wong, our school bus driver in Beijing, who won over my young son. I remember him spreading his arms wide as my son toddled toward him to be picked up.\n\nMoments like these showed me that kindness transcends language, and that home isn't just a place on a map.\n\nChina, especially, pushed me to my limits. Our children's blonde curls and bright eyes made them instant curiosities — strangers would stop us on the street, reach out to touch them, even lift them from their strollers. I remember feeling overwhelmed by the constant invasion of our privacy.\n\nI understood the cultural curiosity and didn't blame anyone, but emotionally, it was challenging. Those years in China tested my personal boundaries and heightened my sense of maternal protectiveness.\n\nFollowing my divorce, staying in Singapore was no longer an option. With the rest of my family based in Belgium, moving to Brussels was the most stable choice for my children and me.\n\nIn 2013, after nearly a decade in Asia, coming \"home\" was disorienting — the food, pace, and climate we'd grown used to were gone. We faced new schools, four distinct seasons, and the challenge of re-establishing myself as a single mother and her children. Yet, over time, we found our rhythm.\n\nAll of these experiences have shaped me as a woman, a mother, and an expat.\n\nIn 2014, back in Brussels, I opened a gelateria, Il Monello, with my brother. Running a small business has been both grounding and rewarding, allowing me to connect with people in a new way.\n\nNow that my daughter is turning 21 and my son is 18, I crave space, light, and a slower rhythm. One thing is certain: I will never stop travelling, it's part of who I am.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad? Contact the editor at akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is appealing a judge's order that blocks him from punishing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot, for participating in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders, according to a court filing on Tuesday.\n\nJustice Department officials filed a notice that they wil ask a panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the Feb. 12 ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon.\n\nKelly, who represents Arizona, said in a social media post that the only reason for Hegseth to appeal is to “keep trampling on the free speech rights of retired veterans and silence dissent.”\n\n“These guys don’t know when to quit,\" Kelly wrote on his X account.\n\nHegseth had vowed to immediately appeal Leon’s decision. “Sedition is sedition, ‘Captain,’” he posted on his X account, referring to Kelly by his rank at retirement.\n\nIn November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration. Republican President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later.\n\nEarlier this month, a Washington grand jury declined to indict the lawmakers over the video.\n\nKelly sued in federal court to block his Jan. 5 censure from Hegseth. Leon’s order prohibits the Pentagon from implementing or enforcing Kelly’s punishment while his lawsuit is pending.\n\nLeon ruled that Pentagon officials not only violated Kelly’s First Amendment free speech rights, but they also “threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees.” The judge invoked an old-fashioned rebuke -- “Horsefeathers!” -- in response to the government’s claim that Kelly is trying to exempt himself from the rules of military justice.\n\n“To say the least, our retired veterans deserve more respect from their Government, and our Constitution demands they receive it!” wrote Leon, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted on a social media account belonging to Slotkin. Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania also appeared in the video. All of the participants are veterans of the armed services or intelligence agencies.",

    "fullText": "Toying with a hypothetical on Tuesday’s “Behind the Table” podcast, “The View” co-host Joy Behar admitted she would bend her knee to President Trump if it meant getting her family out of jail – but only for a bit.\n\nIn conversation with executive produce Brian Teta, Behar touched on recent “The View” guest host Savannah Chrisley and her support for Trump. Chrisley has said she’s identified as Republican for a long time, but turned to Trump after her parents served two years in prison for tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy before he pardoned them.\n\nBehar said it is easy to be a Republican without supporting Trump, but she might also be pro-Trump if her family ever needed an out-of-jail card.\n\n“You can be a Republican and still be anti-Donald Trump,” Behar said. “He’s not a Republican. People are getting hip to that now. You see the polls, they’re going, everybody’s turning on him. He’s going to go out there tonight right behind the eight ball, and he knows it, too, which makes him more hyperbolic. He’ll be bragging about not only can he read, he can run, he can walk.”\n\nShe added after asked by Teta if she would support him for her family’s freedom like Chrisley: “I would do it, of course, for my family. But then I would trash him afterwards … But I don’t come from a family like that.”\n\nWatch the full “Behind the Table” interview below:\n\nAtlanta-based millionaire Todd Chrisley started out in real estate before pivoting to reality TV once the 2008 recession hit his company Chrisley Asset Management. Chrisley and his second wife Julie received a combined 19-year prison sentence for bank fraud and tax evasion in June 2022. Trump gave both a full pardon in May 2025. Savannah fought tirelessly for a presidential pardon to free her parents and even spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2024.\n\nA new Lifetime docuseries titled “The Chrisleys: Back to Reality” premiered in September 2025. It gave viewers an “unfiltered, deeply personal look” at the family’s journey and introduces the real Chrisleys as they navigate this new chapter.\n\nThe post Joy Behar Admits She Would Bend to Trump if He Could Get Her Family Out of Jail: ‘I Would Trash Him Afterwards’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Japan's stock market has been on a red-hot rally after decades of lackluster performance — and Goldman Sachs says it's not done yet.\n\nThe country's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has been hitting record highs since 2024, gaining 52% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the broader Topix index is up 12% this year and 41% over the past 12 months.\n\n\"We believe that we're still very much in the upward phase of the current market cycle, and we think that market cycle started in the autumn of 2022,\" Bruce Kirk, Goldman's chief Japan equity strategist, said on the bank's \"Exchanges\" podcast published on Tuesday.\n\nJapanese stocks have extended their gains this year following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory earlier this month, which investors see as reinforcing political stability and pro-growth policies.\n\nHowever, the next stage may be more challenging. It hinges on whether Japan moves into what he calls the \"delivery phase\" — where policymakers and corporate Japan prove they can follow through on the expectations investors have built up.\n\n\"If that top-down pressure can align with what investors, both foreign and domestic, are trying to do from a bottom-up perspective in terms of engaging with management, then I think we could see a really interesting dynamic moving forward,\" Kirk said.\n\nA recovery in foreign investment is another reason Goldman sees room for the rally to continue.\n\nAfter a sharp 24% peak-to-trough correction in Topix following the massive sell-off of summer 2024 that spooked investors, a wave of foreign money is coming in again.\n\nRecent data showed 1.8 trillion Japanese yen in net buying in the week before the election — the second-highest weekly total on record.\n\nStill, foreign positioning is not stretched, Kirk said. Mutual funds remain underweight Japan, and foreign allocations are only back to levels seen at the start of 2012, when former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policy agenda of aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms first sparked meaningful gains in Japanese equities.\n\nFor the rally to be sustained, investors need proof of improving corporate profitability. Kirk said return on equity has flatlined around 9% to 10%, despite the market's sharp rise.\n\n\"I think the key to the next phase will be ROE improvement,\" Kirk said.",

    "description": "Here's what it was like for one reporter to be in the room for the longest State of the Union in American history.",
    "fullText": "It ended up being the longest State of the Union speech in American history.\n\nI was one of over 100 reporters seated in the House chamber during President Donald Trump's address on Tuesday night, when the president shattered the record for the longest speech at just over 107 minutes.\n\nOver the course of the lengthy speech, the mood gradually devolved, eventually leading to outright bickering. In fact, there was only one strong bipartisan moment — and it happened to involve athletes walking into the press gallery.\n\nThat's just past the 99 minutes he spoke for last year, when he previously set the record for the longest speech to a joint session of Congress.\n\nThe speech hit many of the president's usual talking points, sprinkled in a few policy proposals, and emphasized the theatrics.\n\nJust like in years past, the speech had its share of drama, with lawmakers heckling the president and one even being escorted out.\n\nHere's what it was like, and what I saw during the speech.\n\nIf you're watching the State of the Union from home, you might be wondering where the reporters covering the speech in person are sitting.\n\nThe answer: Behind the president, in a gallery above the floor of the House chamber. It's the same floor where the dignitaries' guests sit.\n\nIn normal times, reporters can come and go freely from the gallery. Due to the high demand to watch this major speech, I had to get a press pass, which gave me access to an assigned seat.\n\nRoughly 140 reporters and photographers were up in the gallery with me — about 90 of them in seats, and another 50 standing.\n\nReporters are also strictly forbidden from taking photos in the House chamber, so I'm not able to share any firsthand look at the gallery.\n\nLast year, Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas was thrown out of the House chamber for loudly protesting during Trump's speech.\n\nThis year, he was thrown out again.\n\nAt the beginning of the speech, Green quietly unfurled a sign declaring that \"Black People Aren't Apes,\" an apparent reference to a video that was briefly posted on Trump's Truth Social account earlier this month that depicted President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nRepublican lawmakers were incensed, with Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma at one point trying to tear the sign out of Green's hand.\n\nUltimately, a staffer led Green out of the chamber.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into Trump's speech, we were met with a surprise — members of the US Men's Hockey team streamed into the press gallery, bringing the room's attention toward an area where all the reporters were sitting.\n\nLawmakers broke into cheers and applause. It was one of the few bipartisan moments of applause of the whole night.\n\nIn the House, the chamber is evenly divided between the Republican side and the Democratic side. But you wouldn't know it from Tuesday night's speech.\n\nThere were noticeably fewer Democrats on hand, with several seats appearing to be empty on their side of the aisle. Several Republicans, apparently taking advantage of the open space, even sat on the Democratic side.\n\nMany of the Democratic women who did attend could be seen wearing white, a color associated with the suffragette movement.\n\nAhead of the speech, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged Democrats to either boycott the speech or sit in silent protest, an apparent effort to avoid the disruptions that marked last year's speech.\n\nRep. Becca Balint of Vermont was among dozens of Democrats who opted to attend the \"People's State of the Union\" — a rally sponsored by the liberal groups MeidasTouch and MoveOn that was held on the National Mall — instead of the speech.\n\n\"I want to be surrounded by positive people who are really thinking about how to bring this country together,\" Balint told me. \"I cannot normalize this anymore. I just can't.\"\n\nOne Democrat who chose to attend, Rep. Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, told me before the speech that he believes it's \"important for me to be there to see what the president has to say.\"\n\n\"People can choose to do what they want, but I feel like it's part of my job to show up,\" Vasquez said.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court voted to strike down many of Trump's tariffs on Friday, many wondered if there would be fireworkers at Tuesday night's speech.\n\nAfter all, Supreme Court justices are seated directly in front of the president.\n\nUltimately, the confrontation never came, but it was a little awkward.\n\nJust four of the nine justices showed up for Trump's speech: John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, and Elena Kagan. All of those justices except Kavanaugh voted to strike down the tariffs.\n\nTrump shook each of the justices' hands before taking the podium, and the justices sat stone-faced when Trump mentioned the court's \"very unfortunate\" ruling.\n\nAs Trump spoke about the tariffs, scattered laughter could be heard throughout the chamber.\n\n\"They're right in front of you!\" someone from the Democratic side could be heard yelling at one point, referring to the justices.\n\nWith the exception of Al Green, the first hour of Trump's speech was relatively free of major disruptions.\n\nA major turning point was when Trump discussed funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota began loudly heckling Trump over the killing of two American citizens by immigration agents in Minneapolis. Trump at one point fired back, saying the lawmakers should be \"ashamed\" of themselves.\n\nThe heckling continued as Trump moved on to election security and transgender issues.\n\n\"These people are crazy,\" Trump remarked at one point.\n\nThe president, along with every member of the House and Senate, is entitled to bring a guest to the speech. Generally, they sit in the gallery, which sits one floor above the chamber.\n\nSen. Rick Scott of Florida brought \"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary. Several Democrats brought Epstein survivors. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina invited David Ellison, Paramount's CEO.\n\nTrump brought Erika Kirk, who succeeded her late husband Charlie Kirk as the head of Turning Point USA, after he was killed in September.\n\nOne person who attended last year, but wasn't there this year: Elon Musk.\n\nAfter the speech, many lawmakers and Cabinet secretaries head to Statuary Hall, where journalists and TV cameras await them.\n\nIt's not unlike the \"spin room\" at a presidential debate, where each side gives its take on what happened that night.\n\nRepublican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee snagged an aisle seat and got to shake Trump's hand, though he wouldn't tell me what the two talked about.\n\n\"It was about our cat, and our barn that we named after him,\" Burchett joked.\n\nBurchett said Trump's speech was so long because he \"had a lot of successes that he needed to talk about.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Sarah McBride of Delaware, on the other hand, told reporters that Trump's speech was full of lies while defending the reaction of lawmakers like Tlaib and Omar.\n\n\"This administration has literally killed American citizens under the guise of addressing immigration,\" McBride said.",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nExperts working in the Tomb of Cerberus in Giugliano, an area in Naples, unsealed a 2,000-year-old sarcophagus.\n\nInside they found the remains of a shockingly well-preserved body lying face-up and covered in a shroud.\n\nOngoing analysis of the contents of the sarcophagus could yield new social, cultural, and scientific insight into ancient life.\n\nAfter initially probing a 2,000-year-old sarcophagus in Naples with a micro camera, archaeologists were encouraged enough by what they saw to step inside this sealed tomb for the first time. But once they opened a passage inside the sarcophagus sealed shut for thousands of years, they were shocked by the condition of what they found.\n\nThe team of archaeologists, led by Simona Formola, investigating the Tomb of Cerberus in the northwest Naples city of Giugliano discovered a person laying face-up in what they considered an “excellent state of preservation,” according to a translated statement from the Superintendent of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape for the Naples Metropolitan Area. The individual was covered by a shroud and surrounded by a litany of goods that included several ointment jars and body-cleaning tools often used in the burial process.\n\nThe team believes the particular care given to the deceased, coupled with the objects found near the body, suggest the person in the sarcophagus was the family member for whom the mausoleum was originally built.\n\n“The Tomb of Cerberus continues to provide valuable information on the Phlegraean territory near Liternum,” Marian Nuzzo, a superintendent with the Italian Ministry of Culture, said in a statement, “expanding knowledge of the past, and offering opportunities for research of a multidisciplinary nature.”\n\nThe team now has a new treasure trove of information to mine. “Laboratory analyses conducted on samples taken from the burials and depositional beds have returned a considerable amount of data regarding the treatment of the body of the deceased and the funerary rituals implanted, considerably enriching the panorama of our knowledge,” Nuzzo said.\n\nThe team believes the shroud was likely mineralized due to the unique climatic conditions inside the burial chamber. Fabric analysis is ongoing, but the archaeologists hopes to determine the structure, type, and quality of the yarn used within the tomb. They hope that information will help glean additional social and cultural details.\n\nAs DNA analysis of the remains is ongoing, the team also continues to analyze the organic substances, including pollen, found within the sarcophagus. They’ve already learned that the body was likely treated with creams based on Chenopodium—also known as goosefoot—and absinthe, meant to improve preservation.\n\nThe ministry hopes continued sampling and analyzing of all the aspects found within the sarcophagus will yield additional details about the surrounding necropolis that can help tell a broader picture of the social and cultural makeup of Naples 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "It’s been more than a decade since we lost Steve Jobs, the mastermind behind some of the biggest technological innovations in history. Today would have been his 71st birthday.\n\nBut Jobs’ outsize influence as Apple’s cofounder and leader leaves a lasting impression on managers and employees alike. And one of his most unwavering beliefs might surprise those who aspire to his level of success.\n\nWho does Jobs believe make the best managers?\n\nWhat was Jobs' approach to recruiting talent?\n\nWhat made Steve Jobs reject professional managers?\n\nHow did Jobs prioritize collaboration at Apple?\n\nWhen Jobs and Apple’s other cofounders, including Steve Wozniak, first realized how big their company would be, they decided to go out and hire what they called “professional management,” or folks who just knew how to manage people. But it quickly backfired.\n\n“It didn’t work at all,” Jobs said in a mid-1980s interview. “Most of them were bozos. They knew how to manage, but they didn’t know how to do anything.”\n\nJobs’ comment gets at the crux of a central debate in management: whether managers should actually want to be managers at all. Jobs argued the people who were least expecting to be leaders ended up being the best managers in the long run. That’s because other employees were more likely to actually learn something from them because they had mastered their skill set—rather than focusing only on management techniques.\n\nThat’s the first of Jobs’ best management tips: elevating to management those who perform at the highest levels.\n\n“You know who the best managers are. They’re the great individual contributors who never ever want to be a manager, but decide they have to be a manager because no one else is going to be able to do as good a job as that,” Jobs said in the same interview.\n\nJobs took a gamble on Debi Coleman, a member of the Macintosh team who was 32 years old at the time he promoted her. She’d studied English literature in college but earned her MBA from Stanford University and proved herself to be an exceptional financial manager.\n\n“There’s no way in the world anybody else would give me this chance to run this kind of operation,” Coleman said in a 1980s interview. “I don’t kid myself about … that there’s an incredible high risk—both for myself personally and professionally, and for Apple as a company—and put a person like myself in this job.”\n\nApple was “betting on a lot of things” when it made her a financial manager, Coleman said. The company was “betting that my skills and organizational effectiveness override” a lack of tech and manufacturing experience. Coleman went on to become chief financial officer of Apple and was referred to as one of Silicon Valley’s “most prominent technology executives.” She died in 2021.",

    "description": "More flights were cancelled Feb. 24 at Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) in Fort Myers, Florida after a blizzard in the Northeast.",
    "fullText": "As the Northeast U.S. begins to dig out from a powerful blizzard, more than two dozen flights in and out of Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) in Fort Myers were canceled on Tuesday, Feb. 24, according to FlightAware.\n\nThe blizzard caused over 2,000 U.S. flights to be canceled Tuesday, with the bulk of disruptions in and around New York, Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nAcross Florida airports, 114 flights were delayed and around 385 canceled, with most at Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 23, the winter storm caused at least 90 cancellations and 15 delays at RSW.\n\nAirlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Southwest and United Airlines, are waiving change fees and fare differences for those who planned to travel to the hardest-hit areas and now need to change plans.\n\nAccording to FlightAware.com, which provides real-time flight information, as of 7:30 a.m., the following delays and cancellations of flights have been reported within, into or out of the United States today, Feb. 24:\n\nFlight cancellations and delays at RSW as of 10 a.m., Feb. 23, according to FlightAware:\n\nHere's the breakdown by airport as of around 7:30 a.m. Feb. 24. Click the airport names for detailed flight info and updated numbers throughout the day.\n\nDon't wait until you're already at the airport to check your flight. Monitor your flight early and often, starting now, as cancellations will increase as the weather conditions worsen.\n\nDownload your airline’s mobile app and turn on push and text notifications for alerts about your flight. Some apps have a “Where’s My Plane?” feature that lets you see whether the aircraft scheduled to operate your flight has arrived, is delayed en route, or hasn’t departed yet from its previous airport. That can be an early signal of trouble.\n\nIf your flight is canceled, use the airline's mobile app to rebook as soon as possible, according to Scott Keyes, founder of Going. If you need to talk to someone, Keyes suggests calling one of the carrier’s international lines.\n\n\"The best thing travelers can do is to be as proactive as possible switching to a new flight,” Keyes told USA TODAY. “When a flight gets canceled, all of a sudden hundreds of passengers need new itineraries. There may only be a handful of seats left on the best flights, and it's a first-come, first-(served) endeavor.”\n\nIf your flight is canceled for any reason, you’re entitled to a full refund if you choose not to fly on alternative itineraries offered by your airline. The same goes for “significant” delays or changes.\n\nYou can get all of Florida’s best content directly in your inbox each weekday day by signing up for the free newsletter, Florida TODAY.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Myers News-Press: RSW airport flight cancellations today after Northeast blizzard",

    "description": "\"Congressional action will not be necessary. It's already time-tested and approved\"",
    "fullText": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) dutifully stood and applauded as President Donald Trump hyped his new mechanism for unilaterally levying tariffs, for which he claimed, “Congressional action will not be necessary.”\n\nTrump slammed the Supreme Court for striking down his unconstitutional global tariffs last week, but promised they will remain in place and foreign countries will continue to negotiate with him.\n\nOther nations “will continue to work along the same successful path that we had negotiated before the Supreme Court’s unfortunate involvement. So despite the disappointing ruling, these powerful country-saving — it’s saving our country, the kind of money we’re taking in — peace-protecting — many of the wars I’ve settled was because of the threat of tariffs,” Trump said, adding:\n\nI wouldn’t have been able to settle them without it. Will remain in place under fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes. And they have been tested for a long time. They’re a little more complex, but they’re actually probably better, leading to a solution that will be even stronger than before.\n\nCongressional action will not be necessary. It’s already time-tested and approved. And as time goes by, I believe the tariffs paid for by foreign countries will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern-day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love. Moving forward, factories, jobs, investment, and trillions and trillions of dollars will continue pouring into the United States of America because we finally have a president who puts America first. I put America first. I love America.\n\nJohnson rose along with Vice President JD Vance and the rest of the Republicans in the chamber to applaud the line, despite the fact that Congress will have to vote to continue Trump’s latest round of tariffs.\n\nTrump used Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to levy an additional 15% global tariff on the U.S.’s trading partners following the Supreme Court’s ruling. Section 122 requires Congress to vote on keeping the levies in place after 150 days and is all but certain to be challenged in court as the Constitution solely empowers Congress to levy tariffs.\n\nWatch the clip above via MS NOW.\n\nThe post Mike Johnson Stands and Applauds After Trump Says ‘Congressional Action Won’t Be Necessary’ on New Tariffs first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Bodo/Glimt knock out last year's finalists Inter Milan in one of the biggest upsets in Champions League history and now the team from the Arctic Circle is dreaming of how far they can go after reaching last 16.",
    "fullText": "Bodo/Glimt just keep on defying the odds.\n\nThe Norwegian team, based around 70 miles into the Arctic Circle, have forged a reputation for upsets, but on Tuesday night in Milan they produced one of the biggest in Champions League history.\n\nFacing three-time winners Inter Milan - beaten by Paris St-Germain in the final of this competition just over nine months ago - Bodo had a daunting task, even if they held a 3-1 lead from the first leg.\n\nYet they rose to the occasion once more - just like they had done in beating Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in the group phase.\n\nIt was another resolute and determined display in Italy to complete a home and away double over Cristian Chivu's men, first to repel the numerous first-half Inter attacks before scoring twice to ultimately leave the Serie A leaders with too much to do.\n\nWinners 2-1 on the night, Bodo's 5-2 aggregate success secured their place in the Champions League last 16 for the first time, where they will face either Manchester City or Sporting.\n\n\"It is a historical moment for Bodo and I think also for Norwegian football,\" said boss Kjetil Knutsen.\n\nJens Petter Hauge was again inspirational, scoring his sixth goal in the competition this season for the opener, before setting up Hakon Evjen's lovely finish for the second.\n\n\"It sounds not true, but we are there, among the last teams in the competition,\" added the forward, who was back in the San Siro where he had a two-year spell at AC Milan.\n\n\"It will be really exciting to see what the next two games bring.\"\n\nBodo/Glimt stun Inter in Milan to reach last 16\n\nBodo/Glimt are the first Norwegian side to progress in a knockout-stage tie in the Champions League and the first overall in the European Cup since Lillestrom in the first round in 1987-88.\n\nThe Norwegians are the first team from outside of Europe's big five leagues to win four consecutive games in a European Cup/Champions League campaign against opponents from those leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy & France) since Ajax in 1971-72, who went on to win the European Cup that season.\n\nJens Petter Hauge has scored six goals for Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League this season; the most ever by a Norwegian player for a Norwegian club in a single edition of the European Cup/Champions League.\n\nThis fairytale run to the knockouts will have felt unlikely for Bodo after failing to win their first six league phase games, meaning they were left needing results against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to qualify for the play-offs.\n\nAnd, against the odds, they provided them.\n\nA 3-1 victory over Pep Guardiola's men brought deserved attention and acclaim, but it was no one-off as Bodo overcame Atleti 2-1 in Madrid to claim a play-off spot.\n\nKnutsen's side lost to Spurs in the Europa League semi-finals last season, having become the first Norwegian side to reach the last four of a major European competition.\n\nKey to their success has often been their ability to make their home games as tough as possible.\n\nIn the north of Norway, Bodo can often be bitterly cold, snowy and windy during the long winter months, with temperatures deep into minus figures.\n\nThe difficult weather conditions mean the team play on an artificial pitch made of plastic, something many sides used to playing on grass find difficult to deal with.\n\nThose aspects, coupled with the players' determination and strong belief in their ability, means many have left Bodo defeated.\n\nThey famously thrashed Jose Mourinho's Roma 6-1 at home in the Europa Conference League five years ago, while Celtic, Besiktas, Porto and Lazio have also been victims in recent years.\n\nManchester City won't relish another meeting in the last 16 if they are drawn together, with Bodo buoyant after proving they have nothing to fear against Europe's top sides.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" captain Patrick Berg told Canal+.\n\n\"For the club and city it's unbelievable. I don't think people thought we could beat Manchester City, Atletico and now Inter two times.\n\nThis is a step into the unknown for Bodo as they prepare to play in the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time.\n\nBut their run to the Europa League semis in the previous campaign will give them belief - and provide hope to every small club of what can still be achieved in Uefa's major competitions.\n\nAnd, for however long this journey continues, they will be backed by the now familiar sight of their vocal fans, who were unmissable at the San Siro decked out all in yellow and with scarves held in the air.\n\n\"I am so proud, we are a team from a small town,\" added Knutsen.\n\n\"I really hope we show if we can do it, then everyone can do it. For me that's the most beautiful thing of the whole story.\"",

    "description": "The Golden Eagles wrap up their home slate for the year with a visit from the Musketeers.",
    "fullText": "I’m going to keep this preview for the final home game on the Marquette women’s basketball schedule pretty straight forward.\n\nFirst, it’s Senior Day at the McGuire Center. Marquette will be honoring seven of the eight seniors listed on the roster in a pregame ceremony as they appear for their final regular season home game. The lone exception to the list is Aryelle Stevens who has been out all year after an Achilles tear last summer. Marquette isn’t explicitly saying she’s returning, merely not saying she’s departing. With seven senior players and five student managers to honor, get yourself to the building early for the festivities.\n\nSecond, Marquette is on a four game losing streak. They shouldn’t be after coughing up a fourth quarter lead at Creighton and letting Seton Hall rally and run away from them in Milwaukee, but that’s where we are. Perhaps more disappointingly, Marquette looked lifeless on the road against Villanova on Sunday after putting up a pretty solid fight against #1 UConn in the third of the four straight losses.\n\nThird, Marquette is trying to stay out of the opening day tripleheader at the Big East tournament. Some of this work may get done for them as 11-8 St. John’s wraps up with UConn, so all the Golden Eagles need to do is avoid dropping either of their final two games, and they will finish ahead of the Red Storm. That alone would be enough to clinch a top five finish in the Big East, as sixth place Creighton already has nine losses with two games to play.\n\nFourth, Marquette is a heavy favorite in their final home game of the year because Xavier is bad. BartTorvik.com says Golden Eagles by 17, 69-52. Part of that is because Marquette beat Xavier 67-54 in Cincinnati on New Year’s Day, and the Golden Eagles did that without Skylar Forbes available. It took a 20/19/5/2 from Halle Vice, but Marquette pushed it across the finish line and led by double digits for the entire second half. The Musketeers have lost nine of their last 10, and their assorted metrics have been getting worse across their current five game losing streak.\n\nThere is zero reason why Marquette should lose this game. Everything points at reasons for Marquette to be motivated to 1) win on Senior Night, 2) win to lock up a bye to the quarterfinals, 3) win to snap their losing streak, and 4) beat a bad Xavier team.\n\nDate: Wednesday, February 25, 2026\nTime: 6:30pm Central\nLocation: Al McGuire Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nStreaming: ESPN+ with Bob Brainerd and Chloe Marotta calling the action\nLive Stats: Stat Broadcast\nBluesky Updates: @AnonymousEagle\n\nMarquette is 26-7 all time against Xavier. The series started back in 1985 and was pretty even through the first nine encounters. The Musketeers won three of the first five meetings between the two teams once XU joined the Big East, but the Golden Eagles have now won 19 straight in the series, after a shorthanded 67-54 win in Cincinnati on New Year’s Day.",

    "title": "Champions League Preview: Juventus vs. Galatasaray",
    "description": "Juventus face a monumental task of trying to reverse a 5-2 aggregate scoreline that was a lot of their own doing in Wednesday night’s second leg against Galatasaray.",
    "fullText": "When Juventus headed into the second leg of their Champions League play-off round tie against PSV Eindhoven last season, they had every chance to qualify for the Round of 16. All they needed to do was avert disaster and then they would be extending their European campaign by another 180 minutes at least.\n\nThe problem about what happened last week is that the disaster has already happened, not taken place in the second leg. It was the second half in which Juve completely self-destructed in Istanbul, seeing all the work they had done to get ahead 2-1 after falling behind early disappear faster than a trick by your favorite magician.\n\nSo now, with just about 99.9% of folks thinking that this tie is pretty much over, there’s a second leg to play.\n\nIt comes after another disappointing performance in the month of February, too.\n\nWe are about to see if Luciano Spalletti’s can muster up something that they didn’t over the weekend against Como: the ability to fight. We saw that fight against Inter Milan in the Derby d’Italia. We saw that fight in the first half in Istanbul as Teun Koopmeiners did the unexpected and scored a brace in a Juve shirt. But ever since everything went to hell and Galatasaray stormed back from a goal down to score four unanswered and take a 5-2 aggregate lead with them to Turin, Wednesday night’s second leg will be the chance to show that the fight still exists no matter what the final aggregate scoreline ends up being after the final whistle sounds.\n\nTo turn the tie in their favor may be too much to ask.\n\nHell, after Saturday’s showing against Como expecting a big response might be, too.\n\nBut at this point, there really is only one thing that Juventus know they can do: they can’t play like they have over the course of their last three halves of football. Or really much of the last month. Because if they repeat any of that, then their Champions League campaign will come to an end and it will be done in just as bad of a fashion as it possibly could. And on their home field.\n\nIf they come out fighting … yeah, they will still probably lose on aggregate because that’s just what happens when you allow four goals in a half and see your 2-1 lead go up in smoke.\n\nThis is a test of Juventus’ character as much as it is to see if they can just make things interesting against a Galatasaray side that also fell to a 2-0 loss over the weekend. Spalletti essentially said that during his pre-match press conference, including a call to the fans in the same stadium that booed the squad before, during and then after the loss to Como on Saturday.\n\n““Some games aren’t just played, but composed,” Spalletti said. “Tomorrow requires the involvement and participation of the whole environment, and we need the spirit of our fans. We know it’s a delicate situation, but we’re asking them to stand by our side tomorrow. With them by our side, we are stronger.”\n\nIt’s also going to be interesting to see how Galatasaray play it considering they will take the field with a three-goal aggregate lead and can still lose by two without being in any danger of advancing to face either Liverpool or Tottenham in the UCL Round of 16. Does Galatasaray manager Okan Buruk pretty much just set up shop and hunker down for much of the night to comfortably defend their lead? Or, knowing what they did in the second half of the first leg last week, come out with their offensive firepower that they will likely field up front and try and put the early nail in Juve’s coffin and make it even more impossible to flip the aggregate scoreline?\n\nEither way, the easy thing to say is that Juventus need to be much more like the team that rallied back from going down 1-0 early in Istanbul rather than the one that squandered that same 2-1 lead a few short minutes later. They will not only have to be just that kind of team, but one that’s even better. It will come at a time in which Spalletti is sh0rt-handed at the back — most notably without both of his natural left back options as well as potentially his best central defender after he came off the field injured last Tuesday.\n\nThe odds are slim that Juventus advance to the Champions League Round of 16. Very, very slim. But there’s one thing Juventus can do regardless of what the aggregate scoreline says: play like they don’t care what said scoreline is. They can play like they give a damn regardless if it’s 2-2 on aggregate or the reality of it being 5-2.\n\nPlay for the pride of the jersey. Play for the personal pride of not being booed off the field yet again.\n\nIf they do, then they can bow out with some modicum of pride. But if they don’t, then it’s looking like a winless February and even worse of an overall vibe surrounding them from the outside as they head to Rome in a few days.\n\nThanks to their respective variety of cards in last Tuesday’s first leg, Juventus will be without both Andrea Cambiaso and Juan Cabal for Wednesday night’s play-off round decider.\n\nThe big news out of Spalletti’s press conference on Tuesday: Bremer will be available and will be available against Galatasaray. The catch is that many of the predicted lineups on Tuesday don’t expect Bremer to be in the starting lineup on Wednesday. Considering what happened after he left late in the first half last week, this is a pretty good thing to actually have him available again.\n\nBremer’s final status for Galatasaray will be assessed Wednesday morning, according to Spalletti.\n\nSpalletti sounded a little more optimistic about Kenan Yildiz’s status to face Galatasaray, saying “He wants to be involved tomorrow at any cost, and today he trained partially with the group.” Spalletti added that Yildiz “could start from the first minute.”\n\nThe other injured players are the ones we know about already, with Dusan Vlahovic, Emil Holm and (or course) Arek Milik all missing out.\n\nThere is a growing feeling in the Italian media that Mattia Perin will start in goal for the struggling Michele Di Gregorio — which, considering what has happened in recent weeks, is completely understandable.\n\nJonathan David is expected to return to the starting lineup after missing the first leg in Turkiye last week.\n\nDespite the lack of fullback options, most predicted lineups has Spalletti going with a 4-3-3 formation.\n\nIf Spalletti does choose to go with a 3-4-2-1 because of limited options at the back, the existence of Filip Kostic will give the Tuscan tactician an actual wingback to have in the starting lineup. That’s right — Kostic in a crucial Champions League fixture in 2026. You didn’t expect that back in August, did ya?\n\nWith all of the absences in defense, this feels like one of those games in which Juventus’ ultimate wild card in terms of where he’s going to be playing is going to take on yet another interesting chapter.\n\nCould he be a left back if Spalletti goes into a back four? Does he play as a wingback opposite Kostic if Spalletti goes with a back three? Is it some kind of whacky hybrid kind of role that will be ever-evolving throughout his time on the field on Wednesday night?\n\nEither way, we know one thing: Weston McKennie will be on the field and battling like all hell.\n\nProbably around the time that Juventus players took the fields at Continassa for Tuesday’s training session ahead of their showdown with Galatasaray, we heard that McKennie was closing in on a contract extension with the Bianconeri. It is certainly a reward for the work that he’s put in this season, and certainly a cause for celebration no matter how much the current situation against Galatasaray is far from ideal.\n\nSo why McKennie here as compared somebody like say, David, who is likely leading the line against Gala? Well, because we’ve seen McKennie be really, really good in the Champions League during his entire career at Juventus and just because if he is in fact fielded as a wingback then that might be taking away form what has made him so good under Spalletti.\n\nWhat is one of the biggest things that McKennie has done so well the last few months playing in a more advanced role? It’s been his ability to run into space and then take advantage of it no matter if it’s setting up goals or getting himself free in the penalty area to score one for himself. It’s shown the versatility to his game — both positionally and when it comes to his skill set.\n\nBut is that the same kind of things that he can bring to the table when he’s playing as a wingback? To an extent, yes. Not to the same kind of degree when he’s playing further up the field behind the striker or out wide as a quasi-winger.\n\nThat makes him all the more important against Galatasaray — which, considering who could start on the opposite wing is that we know at least one wing is likely just going to spam in some crosses and not exactly be a creative force by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nWhen: Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026.\n\nWhere: Juventus Stadium, Turin, Italy.\n\nOfficial kickoff time: 9 p.m. local time in Italy and across Europe, 8 p.m. in the United Kingdom, 3 p.m. Eastern time, 2 p.m. Central time, 12 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nTelevision: CBS Sports Network (United States); TNT Sports 3, TNT Sports 5 (United Kingdom).\n\nOnline/Streaming: Paramount+, Amazon Prime Video USA, fuboTV (United States); DAZN Canada; fuboTV Canada (Canada); Amazon Prime Video UK (United Kingdom); Amazon Prime Video (Italy).\n\nOther live viewing options can be found here, and as always, you can also follow along with us live and all the stupid things we say on Bluesky.

    "fullText": "It is well known at this stage that Manchester United will focus on improving their midfield options once the summer transfer window opens.\n\nCasemiro is set to leave, while Manuel Ugarte’s stay at Old Trafford is also likely to be cut short.\n\nGiven Mason Mount’s injury record, it would not be a surprise to see the Englishman moved on as well. To add to this, Bruno Fernandes’ future also remains up in the air.\n\nA pretty sizeable revamp is on the cards, with Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson the top priority to come in and strengthen the middle of the park.\n\nOne player will not be enough, and INEOS are likely to sign two midfielders. Carlos Baleba, and Adam Wharton remain genuine targets, but recently, another Forest ace got linked with a switch to Old Trafford.\n\nIbrahim Sangare would cost much less than both the Crystal Palace ace and Brighton and Hove Albion star, while he has impressed despite Forest’s current predicament.\n\nHowever, Fabrizio Romano has refuted the rumours, claiming there is no concrete interest in the Ivorian.\n\n“Manchester United have a crucial plan for the midfield in summer 2026.\n\n“They love Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest and there is nothing concrete in the links with Ibrahim Sangare.”\n\nThe Italian journalist also added that INEOS are locked in talks with Kobbie Mainoo’s camp over a new contract.\n\nThat is indeed great news after former head coach Ruben Amorim came dangerously close to selling the Carrington graduate in two successive windows.\n\nOn the pitch, the Red Devils stretched their unbeaten run under Michael Carrick to six games with a narrow 1-0 win away at Everton on Monday night.\n\nIt was far from a vintage display, but a breathtaking counter-attack finished off by Benjamin Sesko proved to be the difference between the two sides.\n\nThey return to action again on Sunday when Crystal Palace visit the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nFeature image Naomi Baker via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "Pacers coach Rick Carlisle calls out league on $100,000 tanking fine, league pushes back",
    "description": "Carlisle said the league didn't talk to him or the team physician about Aaron Nesmith missing time.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this month, the NBA fined the Indiana Pacers $100,000 for \"violating the Player Participation Policy in connection with the team's game against the Utah Jazz on Feb. 3.\" On the second night of a back-to-back, Indiana sat All-Star Pascal Siakam as well as Bennedict Mathurin (who was traded within days), T.J. McConnell, Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith for the game (a loss to the Jazz). The league said that, in consultation with an independent physician, it determined that Siakam and two others could have played, although possibly in reduced roles.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle didn't hold back when addressing the fine during a radio appearance on 107.5 The Fan on Tuesday (hat tip The Athletic).\n\n\"I didn't agree with it. There was a league lawyer that was doing the interview that kind of unilaterally decided that Aaron Nesmith, who had been injured the night before and couldn't hold the ball, should have played in the game, which just seems ridiculous.\n\n\"During the interview process – I was not on it, but I heard details – we asked them if they wanted to talk to the doctors, our doctors, about it because it was something that was documented by our doctors and trainers. They said no, they didn't need to. They talked to their doctors, who did not examine Aaron Nesmith. And we asked them if they wanted to talk to (Nesmith), and they said, no, they didn't need to.\n\n\"This was shocking to me. And during the interview, they also asked if we considered medicating him to play in a game when we were 30 games under .500. So I was very surprised. Obviously didn't agree with it.\"\n\nAs you might expect, a league spokesman had a different spin on this when Sam Amick of The Athletic reached out.\n\n\"Coach Carlisle's description of the process that went into the decision to fine the Indiana Pacers is inaccurate. An independent physician led the medical review. In addition, the Pacers' general manager and the team's senior vice president (of) sports medicine and performance were interviewed as part of the process. The Pacers confirmed that it had provided all of the information requested by the league and the team reported that an interview with Coach Carlisle or a team physician wasn't necessary.\"\n\nFirst, what Carlise accurately sums up is the vibe around the NBA — the league's approach to limiting tanking is random. Scattershot. Utah and Indiana (and likely a couple of teams in the future) will be hit with fines, while other teams sit out stars — with what seems, from the outside, to be very slow-healing injuries (to be generous) — and go unpunished. I have no doubt that the league feels there is an internal logic and they are following the CBA, but outside the New York NBA HQ, the feeling is Utah in particular (because they played stars but sat them in the fourth quarter), but Indiana as well, were singled out for things a whole bunch of other teams are doing. Utah basically said, \"Okay, we'll play your game,\" and came up with surgeries for Jaren Jackson Jr. and Jusuf Nurkic that will sit two key rotation players for the remainder of the year.\n\nSecond, if the price for Indiana of a top-four pick is a $100,000 fine, they will pay it with a smile. That is the price of doing business. Utah will feel the same way about a $500,000 fine.",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A.J. Brown and Maxx Crosby are two of the best NFL players who could be on the move this offseason.\n\nTheir teams just aren’t saying they’re on the trade block.\n\nBrown, the Philadelphia Eagles’ star wide receiver, wasn’t happy with the offense or his role in it last season after helping the team win the Super Bowl in 2024. But the Eagles will have a new system with offensive coordinator Sean Mannion.\n\n“There’s a lot of conversations in the offseason about players on your team, on other teams,” Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said Tuesday at the NFL scouting combine. “That’s really the job. That’s the fun part about the offseason is the opportunities to improve your team, the opportunities to make trades but at the end of the day, again, we’re trying to get better. It’s hard to do that if you’re just subtracting great players.\n\n“We’ll do whatever is in the best interest of our team to be better for this year and going forward. Anything that puts us in position that we think to potentially win another championship so every decision will be made with that no matter who the player is.”\n\nCrosby, the five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher for the Las Vegas Raiders, finished last season on injured reserve after being shut down for the final two weeks due to a knee injury, despite his desire to play. He’s said he wants to play for a contender.\n\nRaiders GM John Spytek said he anticipates Crosby being on the team and added he had a “great conversation” with him. He also pointed to the New England Patriots going from 4-13 in 2024 to playing in the Super Bowl in 2025 as an example of a team that can dramatically improve from one season to the next.\n\nHowever, when asked if Crosby is an “untradeable player,” Spytek said: “We’re always listening, man.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

After \"Raw\" went off the air, several others did as well.\n\nAs seen in the near-five minute YouTube exclusive, a string of heartfelt moments unfolded in the ring as Styles said goodbye to colleagues from WWE, New Japan Pro-Wrestling, and TNA. Amongst those from Styles' TNA history were Frankie Kazarian, Drake Maverick (formerly known as Rockstar Spud), Bobby Roode, and Abyss, the former two of whom now serve as backstage producers for WWE. When embracing Roode, Styles remarked \"You got me good, dude,\" referencing his surprise at the news of his WWE Hall of Fame induction. Roode, however, admitted then that he had no prior knowledge of it.\n\nKarl Anderson and Luke Gallows, who worked with Styles across WWE and NJPW, were also present for the tribute show, marking their first WWE appearances after being released from the company in February 2025. Like them, Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa, Finn Balor, and Cody Rhodes served as the night's former Bullet Club representatives. Balor and Styles even greeted each other with a Too Sweet.\n\nAmongst Styles' WWE family, Cathy Kelley, Stephanie Vaquer, Michin, and Asuka appeared visibly emotional. Before it all, Rhodes and Sami Zayn hoisted \"The Phenomenal One\" on their shoulders.\n\nStyles' last match took place at the 2026 Royal Rumble, where \"The Career Killer\" GUNTHER made him pass out to the sleeper hold. Prior to that, Styles notably met Shinsuke Nakamura, his former NJPW rival, in a match at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event. Equipped with his camera, Nakamura later took photos of Styles' sendoff on \"Raw\" as well.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Gary Player has never done things by halves, and at 90 years old, that still appears to be the case.\n\nThe nine-time major champion posted an eye-catching workout video this week, showing himself powering through a series of demanding core exercises.\n\nFor most golfers, staying active at that age would be impressive enough.\n\nPlayer, however, looked fully committed as ever, using the clip to send a clear message about what he believes is the foundation of a great golf swing.\n\nPlayer has long been regarded as one of the original fitness pioneers in golf.\n\nAt a time when many professionals paid little attention to conditioning, the South African great was already building strength and endurance into his routine. His latest post underlined that philosophy.\n\n“A strong core is the engine of a powerful golf swing,” he posted. “If you want balance, speed, and longevity in this game, you must train your center every day.”\n\nPlayer has consistently credited his longevity in the sport to disciplined training habits and an unwavering commitment to fitness. Even at 90, he continues to practise what he preaches.\n\nThe emphasis on core strength is particularly relevant in modern golf, where rotational power and stability are central to generating clubhead speed while avoiding injury.\n\nFitness is only part of the equation. Player also acknowledged how advances in golf technology have helped him maintain a high standard of play into his later years.\n\n“Technology in golf is incredible,” he added. “Hybrids have been an incredible development for golf and have certainly allowed me to maintain a high level of golf as I have gotten older. Absolutely loving my PXG hybrids.”\n\nHybrids have become a staple in many golfers’ bags thanks to their forgiveness and versatility, and Player is no exception. Rather than resisting modern equipment, he has embraced it.\n\nBetween his relentless dedication to fitness and his willingness to adapt to new technology, Player continues to set an example.\n\nAt 90, he remains one of golf’s most enduring ambassadors — and a reminder that longevity in the sport requires both hard work and evolution.\n\nWWE Superstar Trick Williams has brilliant response to Tom Brady’s ‘cute’ comments about wrestling\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown gets real about emotional NFL game in Germany with Detroit Lions\n\nNick Sirianni gives cryptic answer about A.J. Brown’s future with Philadelphia Eagles",

In other words, Hurts likes throwing to his TE1,” Kiper wrote.\n\n“Sadiq had eight touchdown receptions last season, and he's explosive and does a lot of damage after the catch.

    "fullText": "Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is reportedly sparing no expense for its unprecedented, one-of-one White House event this summer.\n\nAccording to Puck News, the promotion’s parent company, TKO Group Holdings, could spend “as much as $60 million” to stage the event tentatively scheduled for Fri., June 26, 2026, on the South Lawn. The event is being positioned as part of the United States’ 250th anniversary celebration — and the price tag reflects the scale.\n\nFor comparison, UFC 306 at Sphere in Las Vegas reportedly cost around $21 million to produce. The White House show could triple that figure. UFC CEO Dana White has already revealed that between $700,000 and $1 million alone may be required to replace the South Lawn grass after the event.\n\nPresident Donald Trump previously floated the idea of building a temporary stadium structure on-site to accommodate a massive crowd. However, Puck reports that those plans “are not remotely possible.”\n\nThe UFC head honcho has described a more controlled setup: approximately 3,000 to 4,000 invited guests cageside, with no public ticket sales, and a secondary viewing area at The Ellipse (President’s Park South), roughly a tenth of a mile away, where 85,000 fans could gather.\n\nRenderings of the proposed layout have already surfaced, suggesting the promotion is moving forward with its large-scale outdoor production.\n\nAs for the fight card, White recently said the lineup is already “built,” with two options mapped out with 6-7 fights. One notable omission: Conor McGregor is not expected to be involved.",

    "description": "Despite production questions, Brian Gutekunst surprisingly indicates that Rashan Gary is expected back with the Green Bay Packers in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Green Bay Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst sat down with members of local media on Tuesday while at the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nHe touched on a variety of topics, including Rich Bisaccia's surprise decision to step down as special teams coordinator and assistant head coach. That was big news. The Packers were basically caught between a rock and a hard place by Bisaccia's resignation, and they didn't see it coming.\n\nAnother topic that's going to start making its way across Packer Nation like wildfire is Gutekunst's thoughts on pass-rusher Rashan Gary.\n\nGary has been tabbed as a shoo-in to be cut this offseason because of his drop in production, as well as the $18 million in base salary and $28 million cap hit he's going to represent in 2026.\n\nGary finished the season with just 7.5 sacks and he didn't notch a single sack over the last 10 games, including the playoffs.\n\nHe was a dissapointment both considering the money the Packers have paid him as well as his draft slot (No. 12 overall in 2019).\n\nWith that said, surprisingly, Gutekunst did speak about Gary as if the Packers are expecting him back in  2026.\n\n\"Sometimes, there is an ebb and flow with production with sacks,\" Gutekunst said, according to Zach Kruse of Packers Wire. \"He was impactful towards the second half of the season. Maybe not as much as the first, but he was impactful. Rashan has all the talent in the world. And he's produced at a high level for us since he's been here. We would expect that next year as well.\"\n\nGary has been with the Packers for seven seasons now. His high-water mark for sacks was 9.5 in 2021, but he's tallied just 7.5 sacks in each of the last two seasons, and he's averaged 6.64 sacks per season.\n\nThat's alright production from a role player or a mid-round pick, but it's abysmal production from a former first-round pick and a player who is expected to have the second-highest cap hit on the team next season behind only Jordan Love.\n\nThat's just not acceptable, and it's not sustainable, so if Gutekunst and the Packers are going to bring Gary back, you can almost guarantee they'll find a way out of that high cap number.\n\nThey could restructure Gary's deal by converting salary into a signing bonus, but that would still be paying him a ton of money despite the fact that he has not produced.\n\nThey could ask him to take a pay cut, which he wouldn't have to do, but it could keep him employed in Green Bay through the end of the 2027 season -- when his current deal ends.\n\nThe smartest move would be cutting Gary before June 1 and taking the nearly $11 million in savings. If they want him back in 2026, they could cut him and then re-sign him, though it's worth noting that at that juncture, he just may decide to try the open market.\n\nWith all that in mind, the only way forward that makes any sense here for the Packers is a pay cut. In fact, it's the only responsible and reasonable option, because Gary can't come back with a nearly $30 million cap hit next season.\n\nThis situation isn't ideal, but it's the mess that Gutekunst got himself in when he reached for a raw player with unrealized upside at No. 12 in the draft.\n\nPackersRoundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "fullText": "Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker has all but confirmed a big career change.\n\nWhittaker has been contemplating a light heavyweight move for a while now and is looking to make his divisional debut this summer. Whittaker is coming off back-to-back losses to current middleweight champion Khamzat Chimaev and Reinier de Ridder.\n\nWhile Whittaker (26-9 MMA, 17-7 UFC) never has missed weight as a welterweight and middleweight, he wonders if the cut could be hindering his performance.\n\n\"I'm locking in now,\" Whittaker told Submission Radio. \"I'm locking in for June. I want to get in there. I want to fight again. I want to fight in June at 205 most likely. I'm going to give it a go. I know a lot of naysayers, small this, small that. Shut up, dude. I want to give it a go. I'm on the tail end of my career, so I've got to try rather than just thinking about what ifs. ... I've been playing with the idea for a long time. During the break, I was kind of training at a heavier weight.\n\n\"I want to lock in and move in to this weight division. There's no doubt in my mind I could make middleweight. I can make it still. I can lose the weight, but I just don't know if it's like, if I'm getting the best out of myself, you know, having to cut that weight because the camp performance kind of really suffers on the backend of a weight cut, and a lot of fighters can testify that. I don't know. Try something different. It's my life.\"\n\nWhittaker revealed that his walk-around weight is over light heavyweight.\n\n\"I'm going to try and put on a little bit of muscle, but I'm not going to put too much,\" Whittaker said. \"I walk around heavy anyway. I'm heavy. I walk around like 107, 108 (kilos), just cruising. Obviously that's not shredded, so I want to try and bring that back, shred up, just train fed, train fully fueled, and get the most out of my camps, and come into fight week feeling good for once.\"\\\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC's Robert Whittaker locking in toward light heavyweight move",

    "fullText": "Chicago Cubs All-Star Pete Crow-Armstrong shaded Los Angeles Dodgers fans in an interview with Chicago Magazine.\n\nCrow-Armstrong — who broke out as a star for the Cubs in 2025 — grew up in the Los Angeles area, going to Harvard-Westlake School. The star praised fans in Chicago, but in doing so chose to take a shot at Dodgers fans.\n\n“I love Chicago more and more. It’s just an incredible city. The people are great,” he said. “They give a s—. They aren’t just baseball fans who go to the game like Dodgers fans to take pictures or whatever. They are paying attention. They care.”\n\nWhile he’s from the area, Crow-Armstrong is far from a Dodger fan. His dad grew up in Illinois and forbid him from rooting for either the Dodgers or the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n“Growing up in L.A., my dad gave me a couple of rules. 1) I couldn’t root for the Dodgers. 2) I couldn’t root for the Cardinals,” PCA wrote in The Players’ Tribune last year.\n\nWhile Crow-Armstrong speculates Dodger fans don’t care, they ultimately have bragging rights as the current holders of the World Series.\n\nPCA and the Cubs will look to establish themselves as serious contenders in the coming season, though, and they’ll get an early shot at the Dodgers during the regular season. L.A. hosts the Cubs from April 24-26, and LA Sports Report’s Doug McKain believes the Dodgers will show the All-Star just how much they “give a sh*t.”\n\nThe post Cubs All-Star Takes Shot at Dodger Fans appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "Bodo/Glimt knock out last year's finalists Inter Milan in one of the biggest upsets in Champions League history and now the team from the Arctic Circle is dreaming of how far they can go after reaching last 16.",
    "fullText": "Bodo/Glimt just keep on defying the odds.\n\nThe Norwegian team, based around 200 miles into the Arctic Circle, have forged a reputation for upsets, but on Tuesday night in Milan they produced one of the biggest in Champions League history.\n\nFacing three-time winners Inter Milan - beaten by Paris St-Germain in the final of this competition just over nine months ago - Bodo had a daunting task, even if they held a 3-1 lead from the first leg.\n\nYet they rose to the occasion once more - just like they had done in beating Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in the group phase.\n\nIt was another resolute and determined display in Italy to complete a home and away double over Cristian Chivu's men, first to repel the numerous first-half Inter attacks before scoring twice to ultimately leave the Serie A leaders with too much to do.\n\nWinners 2-1 on the night, Bodo's 5-2 aggregate success secured their place in the Champions League last 16 for the first time, where they will face either Manchester City or Sporting.\n\n\"It is a historical moment for Bodo and I think also for Norwegian football,\" said boss Kjetil Knutsen.\n\nJens Petter Hauge was again inspirational, scoring his sixth goal in the competition this season for the opener, before setting up Hakon Evjen's lovely finish for the second.\n\n\"It sounds not true, but we are there, among the last teams in the competition,\" added the forward, who was back in the San Siro where he had a two-year spell at AC Milan.\n\n\"It will be really exciting to see what the next two games bring.\"\n\nBodo/Glimt stun Inter in Milan to reach last 16\n\nBodo/Glimt are the first Norwegian side to progress in a knockout-stage tie in the Champions League and the first overall in the European Cup since Lillestrom in the first round in 1987-88.\n\nThe Norwegians are the first team from outside of Europe's big five leagues to win four consecutive games in a European Cup/Champions League campaign against opponents from those leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy & France) since Ajax in 1971-72, who went on to win the European Cup that season.\n\nJens Petter Hauge has scored six goals for Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League this season; the most ever by a Norwegian player for a Norwegian club in a single edition of the European Cup/Champions League.\n\nThis fairytale run to the knockouts will have felt unlikely for Bodo after failing to win their first six league phase games, meaning they were left needing results against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to qualify for the play-offs.\n\nAnd, against the odds, they provided them.\n\nA 3-1 victory over Pep Guardiola's men brought deserved attention and acclaim, but it was no one-off as Bodo overcame Atleti 2-1 in Madrid to claim a play-off spot.\n\nKnutsen's side lost to Spurs in the Europa League semi-finals last season, having become the first Norwegian side to reach the last four of a major European competition.\n\nKey to their success has often been their ability to make their home games as tough as possible.\n\nIn the north of Norway, Bodo can often be bitterly cold, snowy and windy during the long winter months, with temperatures deep into minus figures.\n\nThe difficult weather conditions mean the team play on an artificial pitch made of plastic, something many sides used to playing on grass find difficult to deal with.\n\nThose aspects, coupled with the players' determination and strong belief in their ability, means many have left Bodo defeated.\n\nThey famously thrashed Jose Mourinho's Roma 6-1 at home in the Europa Conference League five years ago, while Celtic, Besiktas, Porto and Lazio have also been victims in recent years.\n\nManchester City won't relish another meeting in the last 16 if they are drawn together, with Bodo buoyant after proving they have nothing to fear against Europe's top sides.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" captain Patrick Berg told Canal+.\n\n\"For the club and city it's unbelievable. I don't think people thought we could beat Manchester City, Atletico and now Inter two times.\n\nThis is a step into the unknown for Bodo as they prepare to play in the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time.\n\nBut their run to the Europa League semis in the previous campaign will give them belief - and provide hope to every small club of what can still be achieved in Uefa's major competitions.\n\nAnd, for however long this journey continues, they will be backed by the now familiar sight of their vocal fans, who were unmissable at the San Siro decked out all in yellow and with scarves held in the air.\n\n\"I am so proud, we are a team from a small town,\" added Knutsen.\n\n\"I really hope we show if we can do it, then everyone can do it. For me that's the most beautiful thing of the whole story.\"",

    "fullText": "Sarasota (Fla.) Cardinal Mooney four-star quarterback Davin Davidson has quickly become one of the most coveted signal-callers in the 2027 cycle.\n\nAfter stacking myriad big-time offers over just a couple of months, Davidson has officially trimmed his list of top schools down to eight. He told Rivals’ Hayes Fawcett on Tuesday that he’s down to Auburn, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Miami, Mississippi State, Notre Dame and Virginia Tech.\n\nDavidson is the No. 208 overall prospect and No. 19 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 21 recruit in Florida.\n\nOn Monday, Davidson made a move up the Rivals300. He’s now the No. 120 recruit and No. 11 QB in Rivals’ 2027 rankings.\n\nThis week, Davidson updated his recruitment with Rivals’ Chad Simmons. His top schools are no surprise. A decision for the blue-chipper could come sooner rather than later, too.\n\n“In a perfect world, I’d take these spring visits and commit shortly after, then take one official,” Davidson told Simmons. “If it needs to go longer, I’ll take as many officials as I need. On these visits, I want to see if I’m truly a priority, how they treat me and how the relationships feel. Ultimately, I want to know if it feels like home.”\n\nAt the end of January, Davidson was in Gainesville. Florida, led by new head coach Jon Sumrall, has made an impression on the rising gunslinger.\n\n“I like Florida a lot,” Davidson said. “The new staff has been great and they’ve poured a lot into me. I’ve been there so much that I feel like I really know the program. The energy they bring and their focus on winning stand out. I like the strong culture at Florida.”\n\nIt remains to be seen who will come out on top for Davidson, but things are moving fast for the four-star. Upcoming visits will be crucial.\n\nRivals’ Director of Scouting and Rankings Charles Power recently wrote this of Davidson as a prospect:\n\n“Davin Davidson is another physically-talented 2027 passer who has seen his profile rise coming out of his junior season, as he helped Sarasota (Fla.) Cardinal Mooney to a state title. Davidson pairs immense size at around 6-foot-6, 215 pounds with a very live arm. He’s more of a fastball thrower right now and will need to continue adding nuance as a passer. The size, arm, and movement skills are very projectable and his physical upside has created a considerable buzz. Davidson visited Florida for a junior day in January and has landed offers from the Gators, Florida State, Miami, and several others over the last month.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby has been a huge talking point of the offseason, and we bet that it won't stop anytime soon.\n\nWith Crosby reportedly disgruntled, there are some who think teams like the Dallas Cowboys could swoop in for the star pass rusher and lure him out of the AFC West.\n\nBut we know that players like Maxx don't come around too often, which makes a trade tough, but not impossible, with the franchise rumored to be wanting a Micah Parsons-like compensation of two first-round picks and a player.\n\nBut Raiders general manager John Spytek, in speaking at the scouting combine, might have just ended all of the trade speculation.\n\n\"Maxx is an elite player and I'm been very upfront that we're in the business of having really good players on the team, and we need a lot more of them,\" Spytek said via CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. \"It's hard to build a great team without elite players.\"\n\nMore: Steelers make eye-opening statement on potential Aaron Rodgers return\n\nIn truth, Spytek can say all he wants about wanting Crosby to stay, but if a godfather-like offer comes in and Maxx isn't 100 percent sold on staying, then the franchise will be hard-pressed to say no.\n\nSpytek is right, you can't build a great team without elite players, but as we know in the NFL, everything has a price, and for Crosby, it would be high.\n\nStill, we know several teams are willing to take a flyer on Maxx, despite Spytek's comments.\n\nAnd until this situation is resolved one way or another, Crosby and those trade talks will be the main headline of the offseason.\n\nWhy Chiefs are in ideal place to deal with big Travis Kelce decision\n\nBrett Veach's latest Chiefs quote should terrify the NFL\n\nTexans GM Nick Caserio goes scorched earth on C.J.

    "description": "One of the biggest talking points of the 2025 season was that the Minnesota Vikings, who had just gone 14-3 with Sam Darnold at the helm in 2024, decided to release the now-Super Bowl champion in favor of a questionable prospect, J. J.",
    "fullText": "One of the biggest talking points of the 2025 season was that the Minnesota Vikings, who had just gone 14-3 with Sam Darnold at the helm in 2024, decided to release the now-Super Bowl champion in favor of a questionable prospect, J.J. McCarthy. At the time, however, it seemed like a no-brainer for the Vikings.\n\nDarnold’s performance against the Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card round was abysmal. When you pair that with the high-end draft capital that the front office had just invested in McCarthy not even a year prior, it seemed like the right decision to make. Unfortunately, the Michigan product has yet to justify both his first-round draft status and the Vikings’ decision to release Darnold.\n\n“I understand their thought process of going with the younger kid,” Darnold noted in a recent interview with Colin Cowherd. “There’s a lot of potential there, and I think J.J. is going to be a really, really good player in this league… That was a little bit of a tough pill to swallow, but when I really stood back and looked at it from afar, I really understood the decision, and I’m thankful that I landed in Seattle,” Sam said, justifying the move.\n\nSuffice to say, you won’t find any sour grapes here with Darnold, as he’s likely more aware than anyone else of the amount of egg that was left on the face of Minnesota all throughout his turnover-less playoff run. Throw in the early struggles of McCarthy, which included an 11:12 touchdown-to-interception ratio and a pass completion percentage of just 57.6%, and it seems fair to suggest that Darnold knows that there’s no need to kick a man while he’s down.\n\nAs far as his personal transition from Minnesota to the Seattle Seahawks is concerned, the 28-year-old explained that it’s a lot easier to do your job as a quarterback when you’re throwing to a player like Jaxson Smith-Njigba, who can only be described as a phenom at this point in his career. “From the start of OTAs, he was special,” Darnold remarked.\n\n“I remember we came out to L.A. in the offseason and we did some throwing with the guys right before training camp, and I had kind of seen him move around for the last couple months… One of my other buddies came to throw with us just because I needed an extra arm, and he was like ‘Dude, this guy is different,‘” Sam observed.\n\nThe 2025 Offensive Player of the Year played a critical role in Seattle’s path towards the championship, and now that we’ve seen what they are capable of, both he and Darnold figure to be at the forefront of every conversation that involves the NFC for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe post Seahawks’ Sam Darnold Explains Why Vikings’ Decision to Prioritize J.J. McCarthy Over Him Made Sense appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Trump wasn't willing to honor the U.S. women's team, but Jack Hughes can make sure their accomplishment isn't forgotten.",
    "fullText": "Jack Hughes has an opportunity for another gold-medal-worthy moment, and this time, he won’t have to beat a world-class goaltender to make it happen.\n\nThe Devils star only needs to use his massive platform as the new face of American hockey to make sure the other U.S. Olympic champions in his sport aren’t forgotten for what they accomplished in Milan.\n\nHe needs to do what President Donald Trump couldn’t do, inexplicably, with his callous dismissal of the U.S. women’s team during a locker room phone call as the men celebrated their historic victory over Canada. Trump made a dumb joke about needing to invite the women to the White House for the State of the Union address, too, as if they deserved that honor less than the men.\n\n“I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team, you do know that,” Trump told the men’s team before adding that if he didn’t, “I do believe I probably would be impeached.”\n\nSeveral men gathered around the phone laughed, and while that sparked outrage, it feels unfair to hold that against them. This was a joyous atmosphere just moments after the signature victory of their careers. Let’s give them some grace for that initial reaction.\n\nWhat happens now, though, is on them. The U.S. women — surprise! — turned down Trump’s half-hearted invitation to the State of the Union address, while Hughes and 19 of his teammates were expected to be in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday night for the speech.\n\n“No matter what your views are, we’re super excited to go to the White House tomorrow and be a part of that,” Hughes told The Daily Mail.\n\nThat sentiment sounds nice, but in these divided times, it falls flat. From the moment the players invited FBI director Kash Patel into the locker room to awkwardly chug a beer as if he himself had scored the winning goal, the gold-medal moment went from a unifying time to something else that we can yell at each other about on social media. That’s just the reality of the world we’re living in now.\n\nOn one point, though, there should be universal agreement: The U.S. women’s team deserves as much attention and credit for their gold-medal victory over Canada as the men do. Hughes, whose mother, Ellen, is a player development consultant for the women’s team, should make sure he never misses an opportunity to talk about them in the same breath as he does his own team’s accomplishment.\n\nThis should come naturally. Hughes was asked in the chaos of his team’s overtime victory what his first thought was after he sent the puck past Canadian goaltender Jordan Binnington. He didn’t talk about how this goal would ensure his immortality in U.S. hockey, or how the next generation of American kids might be emulating him in their driveways or ice rinks.\n\n“Honestly, first thought was, ‘We just won. How do I get my gloves and helmet off?’” Hughes said. “And surprisingly enough, one of the first people I thought of was Megan Keller, who had the gold-medal goal the other night.”\n\nKeller isn’t some stranger. The players on the two U.S. teams became friendly in the athletes’ village, with Hughes and his brother, Quinn, in a group of men’s team players who attended the women’s gold-medal game. The two teams hung out in the cafeteria after their Closing Ceremony, packing their bags and reminiscing.\n\n“If you could see what we see from the inside, and the men and women sharing, you know, dorm rooms and halls and flex floors and the camaraderie and the synergy and the way the women cheered on the men and the way the men cheered on the women — that’s what it’s all about,\" Ellen Hughes told the Today Show. “And the other things they cannot control. They care about humanity. They care about unity and they care about the country.”\n\nClearly, Ellen Hughes has raised her kids the right way. In 2023, Jack voiced his unequivocal support for the Devils’ decision to hold a Pride Night when other teams were canceling their celebrations. The LGBTQ community cheered when Hughes declared, “There was never a thought to not do it.”\n\nHe can own this fraught moment in a similar fashion. That doesn’t mean challenging Trump or angering either side of the political divide. It means doing the right thing and using his platform to remind this country — and, yes, the president himself — that we have the two greatest hockey teams in the world.",

    "description": "Bengals director of personnel Duke Tobin weighs in on if the Bengals would be willing to make a trade for Raiders All-Pro Maxx Crosby.",
    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS – Former Cincinnati Bengals offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth set the NFL rumor mill on fire when he proposed a mega trade proposal for his former team ahead of the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\n“Go get Maxx Crosby at all costs,\" Whitworth said on his “Fitz and Whit” podcast when discussing what the Bengals should do this offseason.\n\nFor the Bengals to acquire a player of Crosby’s caliber, they would need to be ready to take a big swing like giving up a future first-round pick and taking another major contract on the books.\n\nMore: Where Bengals stand with Trey Hendrickson at NFL combine\n\nSo, is Cincinnati willing to make a bold move like that?\n\nBengals fans shouldn’t get their hopes up as it seems unrealistic at this point. Here’s what the Bengals’ director of personnel Duke Tobin had to say on the subject.\n\n“We're always looking if there's an opportunity that we feel warrants it,” Tobin said on Feb. 24. “You have to give up things, and when you take a big swing, there's a big chance you miss. And it can stay with you for a long time and keep you in the dugout, if we're staying with baseball. We don't want to stay in the dugout. That's not a place we want to be.\n\n\"You don't get to take a big swing for free. Big swings take big compensation.”\n\nThe Bengals say they’ve proven they are all in with other decisions i.e. paying top dollar for wide receivers Tee Higgins and Ja’Marr Chase last season and making a rare in-season trade for Joe Flacco.\n\nCincinnati puts a premium on draft picks. Bengals owner Mike Brown and Tobin strongly believe in building through the draft, and giving up a first-round pick isn’t something they do often.\n\n“It's got to be worth it… we don't ignore opportunities that are out there,” Tobin said. “There are a lot of opportunities out there, and I think the offseason is the time to build your football team from the ground up. And that's what we're gonna try to do this offseason.”\n\nYou can never say never in the NFL. Crazy things happen all the time.\n\nTobin’s response makes it hard to believe the Bengals would be inclined to give up a first-round pick or make a splash move the likes of which fans are clamoring for.\n\nTobin believes given the cap space they have available this year and owning the No. 10 draft pick, they can get back to being a contender in 2026. Cincinnati ranks No. 7 in the NFL in most cap space available with $53 million.\n\n“We're excited about attacking this offseason,” Tobin said. “We have resources to attack the offseason in a big way, and we want to do that.”\n\nIt’s exactly what they’ll try to do, starting with an important week in Indianapolis. The Bengals must hit on their free agency signings and draft more players who can make an impact right away.\n\nThey believe they can achieve all of that without mortgaging their future.\n\n“We're trying to put the best roster together every year, and this year is no different,” Tobin said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Maxx Crosby trade rumors at 2026 NFL Scouting Combine for Bengals",

    "fullText": "Tyler Black went 3 for 3 with a home run and six runs batted in to power the Brewers to their first Cactus League victory, a 10-0 shutout of the Athletics at Hohokam Stadium in Mesa, Arizona, on Tuesday, Feb. 24.\n\nBlack hit a two-run blast in the first, a bases-clearing single and capped his day with a run-scoring double in the fifth. He also stole a base.\n\nThe three-run single was a statistical oddity, with only two such cases occurring in the major leagues last season.\n\n\"I decided to throw on the parachute there,\" said Black, noting the presence of A's center-field whiz Denzel Clarke.\n\nAmong the four pitchers in major league camp to see action was right-hander Coleman Crow, who allowed a single and hit a batter but came back with a strikeout and then finished the fifth by inducing a groundout.\n\nCrow was added to the Brewers' 40-man roster in the offseason and after starting for the entirety of his minor league career could factor in as a long relief option in the bullpen at some point in 2026.\n\n– Brice Turang worked a 14-pitch walk in the third inning from Mason Barnett. He fouled off nine pitches total, including four straight and seven of eight during one stretch.\n\n– David Hamilton and Akil Baddoo both experienced some buzzard's luck after crushing balls to straightaway center field that hit off the batter's eye and dropped back into the field of play for doubles, which goes according to the ground rules at Hohokam Stadium.\n\nHamilton's shot (425 feet) would have been a homer in 28 of 30 major league ballparks while Baddoo's (434) would have gone out of all 30.\n\n– It's spring training for everyone, apparently, as the headshot on the scoreboard throughout the entirety of the game for Blake Perkins was actually that of former Brewers right-hander Freddy Peralta.\n\n— Todd Rosiak (@Todd_Rosiak) February 24, 2026\n\n\"That's something to work with, huh?\" manager Pat Murphy on 6-foot-3, 250-pound Wande Torres, a left-hander who threw a scoreless seventh inning against the San Diego Padres on Feb. 23. The 21-year-old was 1-10 last season at Class A Carolina but averaged a strikeout an inning and was reaching 97 mph against the Padres.\n\nLuke Adams, starting at third base, had moments both in the field and at the plate. He opened the bottom of the second by playing a slow chopper by Jacob Wilson, gloving the ball on a tough short hop and then firing an on-target throw on the move to first base for the out.\n\nThen in the fifth, Adams rifled a run-scoring triple down the right-field line. He also walked in his second plate appearance.\n\n\"He's a good baseball player,\" Murphy said. \"You can't play third unless you can make that play.

    "description": "Italian clubs are on the brink of a historic Champions League embarrassment, with the prospect of none making the last 16.",
    "fullText": "Italian football stands on the brink of a Champions League \"debacle\" - with the prospect of no Serie A clubs competing in this season's last 16.\n\nSince the reintroduction of the last-16 knockout round to Europe's showpiece competition in 2003-04, there has always been at least one Italian representative - on 12 occasions in the past 22 years, there have been three.\n\nIn fact, there has been at least one Italian side in the last 16 of the competition - or first knockout round when it took other formats - every year since 1987-88, when Napoli went out in the first round of the European Cup to Real Madrid.\n\nBut Inter Milan's shock play-off exit to Norwegian debutants Bodo/Glimt on Tuesday means either Juventus or Atalanta will have to overcome first-leg deficits to keep that run going.\n\nJuventus trail Galatasaray 5-2 heading into a return meeting in Turin, while Atalanta are 2-0 down on aggregate before Wednesday's home leg with Borussia Dortmund.\n\nInter - finalists last season - lost 2-1 at San Siro against Bodo, having suffered a 3-1 defeat in the first leg.\n\nIt is the first time the Milan giants have been knocked out of the Champions League by a team from outside Europe's top five leagues, those from England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France.\n\n\"This is a big wake up for Italian football,\" said Italian football journalist Daniele Verri.\n\n\"Juventus will need to win 4-0 and Atalanta need to win 3-0. [For them all to go out] would be a complete debacle, a disaster for our clubs.\n\n\"Tonight Ronaldo and Christian Vieri were guests at San Siro, and this is a symbolic clash with what has been and what is.\"\n\nInter signed Ronaldo and Vieri for world-record fees in the late 1990s, when Serie A was the envy of world football, blessed with the game's most talented stars.\n\nAC Milan then beat Juventus to win the Champions League in 2003, losing to Liverpool on penalties in the final two years later, before defeating the Reds to become European champions again in 2007.\n\nWhile there have been more recent successes in Europe's other competitions - Atalanta won the Europa League in 2024, Roma won the Conference League in 2021 - Jose Mourinho's Inter were the last Italian side to win the Champions League in 2010.\n\nInter's European exit comes despite being 10 points clear of rivals AC Milan in Serie A and a further four ahead of defending champions Napoli, who failed to make it out of the Champions League's league phase.\n\n\"It is a piece of history,\" said journalist Vincenzo Credendino. \"Speaking about Italy and Inter, this is one of the worst pieces.\n\n\"Inter are the best in Italy, but maybe it is time to think not about what can happen in one or two years, but about 10 or 15 years - and on that side we can see generally Italian football is not on the same level of top European leagues.\"\n\nThe national team must also win through a play-off in March to avoid missing out on a third successive World Cup this summer, having last lifted the trophy in 2006.\n\n\"It is a difficult time for Italian football and this shows it,\" added European football expert Julien Laurens on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"Today, Inter Milan put pressure on but it was not enough from them. They have been the best team in Italy for the last few years. And Napoli as well, they haven't even come close.\n\n\"It's terrible for Italian football at the moment.\"\n\nInter won five of their opening eight league phase games in Europe to finish 10th, with Juventus 13th and Atalanta 15th.\n\nYet in the play-offs, all have come unstuck against sides who finished lower in the table but play a more intense brand of football.\n\n\"What does it say about Italian football? That something needs to be changed,\" added Verri.\n\n\"The level of Italian football is poor. It is a structural issue. We play very slow football. You can ask any manager in Italy and they will all say the same.\n\n\"I was talking to Claudio Ranieri the other day and he said: 'Look, when I was in England at Leicester... people don't train more than in Italy. They just do it with another intensity, and then they keep up that intensity during the games.'\n\n\"We play slow, and in Europe you suffer.\"\n\n'We really messed up' - does European football need more balance?\n\nWhile Inter boast a much more expensively assembled squad on far bigger wages than Bodo, who had nine Norwegians in their starting XI at San Siro, Verri says Italian clubs are seeing their best players move abroad.\n\nLast season's Serie A top goalscorer Mateo Retegui left for Al-Qadsiah in Saudi Arabia, for example, while former team-mate Ademola Lookman joined Atletico Madrid and Tijjani Reijnders left AC Milan for Manchester City.\n\nWhile the majority of Italy's national squad still play in the country, stars such as Gianluigi Donnarumma, Riccardo Calafiori, Sandro Tonali and Retegui are elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, Laurens believes Serie A clubs are no longer producing good enough youngsters.\n\n\"Sporting CP, Club Brugge and Bodo have similarities in their success this season. Their scouting is great and their academies perform well,\" he explained.\n\n\"The academies in Italy are not producing enough players or players who are fit to play in their first team. The way they spend their money is not what we are used to from Italian clubs.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "description": "\"The battle of the mind can be dark and hard and unrelenting,” the Olympic athlete said",
    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn speaks candidly about her mental and physical recovery\n\nThe professional athlete suffered a horrific injury while skiing at the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nShe required a medical airlift and five surgeries, and is now expected to be in a wheelchair for the next two months\n\nLindsey Vonn is beginning to process the severity of her injury at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Feb. 24, the alpine ski racer, 41, admitted, “Today was a hard day.”\n\n“My physical battle began the second I got hurt but the mental battle started today,\" Vonn wrote. \"It hit me like a ton of bricks. It’s a battle I’m used to because I’ve done it so many times. I have always learned from every injury. Each one has made me a better and stronger person in different ways… but the battle of the mind can be dark and hard and unrelenting.\"\n\nThe athlete — who won four World Cup overall championships with titles in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012 — added that someone close to her likened her to a “master at the psychological game of life…”\n\n“I don’t know if that’s true…. I do know hard days are coming but I will find a way back to the top of the mountain of life,” she concluded.\n\nOn Feb. 8, just 13 seconds into her run in the women’s downhill event during the Milan Cortina Games, Vonn suffered a horrifying crash one week after tearing her ACL.\n\nAfter approximately 15 minutes of medical staff tending to the skier, she was placed on a stability board before being airlifted by helicopter to a hospital.\n\n\"Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would,\" Vonn said, breaking her silence on social media the following day. \"It wasn’t a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\"\n\nElsewhere in her lengthy Feb. 9 Instagram post, the Olympian said her \"ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever,\" adding that she \"sustained a complex tibia fracture\" that would “require multiple surgeries to fix properly.\"\n\nLast week, following her fifth surgery, Vonn confessed that she was “struggling a bit” due to “the extent of the trauma.”\n\nIn keeping with her promise to keep her fans updated on her recovery, on Monday, Feb. 23, she said the crash was so bad that it almost resulted in her leg being amputated.\n\n\"After two weeks, I finally made it out of the hospital. It has been quite the journey and by far the most extreme and painful and challenging injury I've ever faced in my entire life times one hundred. I'll give you the full rundown,\" Vonn said in her Instagram video.\n\nShe added that because of her complex tibia fracture, in which “everything was in pieces,\" including her \"muscles, nerves and tendons,” extreme measures needed to be taken.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n\"Dr. Tom Hackett saved my leg. He saved my leg from being amputated,\" she said, becoming emotional.\n\nVonn, who won a gold medal at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games in the women's downhill event, is expected to be in a wheelchair for the next couple of months as she recovers. However, she ended her video on a positive note.\n\n\"It's going to be a long road, but I always fight,\" she said. \"I'll keep going. No regrets. I just appreciate all the love and support. It's been amazing. Overwhelming to an extent. I wish it had ended differently, really, but I'd rather go down swinging than not trying at all.\"",

    "fullText": "Closed mouths don't get fed. Shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll be amongst the stars. Whatever your favorite saying may be, apply it to contract negotiations in the NFL. On Tuesday, it was revealed that Cowboys restricted free agent Brandon Aubrey, the best kicker in the league, is looking to reset the kicker market in a major way.\n\nNot only is he looking to surpass the average salary of the current highest-paid kicker. That's certainly to be expected and is the basis for Cowboys Wire's prediction of a four-year extension for Aubrey. However word emerged on Tuesday that he doesn't just plan to surpass the $6.4 million per-year ceiling established by Kansas City's Harrison Butker, but obliterate it.\n\nDallas Morning News' Calvin Watkins is reporting that Aubrey turned down the club's $7.5 million a year offer is seeking a $10 million per year salary.\n\nThe Cowboys offered Aubrey the largest contract for a kicker in NFL history, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.\n\nAubrey, a restricted free agent, was offered a deal with an average salary of close to $7.5 million but is looking for nearly $10 million per season.\n\nAubrey is represented by Todd France, the agent who got Dak Prescott $5 million more a season than Joe Burrow was making atop the QB totem pole.\n\nFortunately for the Cowboys, they don't have to acquiesce. As Aubrey is a restricted free agent, the Cowboys have a lot of control over the situation, though not total.\n\nDallas will be given the opportunity to place one of two (three actually, but the third is unrealistic) tenders on Aubrey that would guarantee him a one-year salary. Aubrey would still be able to shop for a deal elsewhere, but if he signed an offer sheet with another team, the Cowboys would be allowed to match the offer.\n\nIf Dallas refused to match, the acquiring club would have to send the Cowboys either a first or second-round pick, depending on the amount of the Cowboys' tender.\n\nIf Dallas offered Aubrey a $5.8 million tender for 2026, an acquiring team would have to send the Cowboys a second-round pick. If Dallas offered Aubrey an $8.1 million tender, the acquiring team would have to send the Cowboys a first-round pick.\n\nIn many situations, where a tender is placed but the player doesn't want to return, a trade for slightly less compensation is often worked out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Cowboys FA Aubrey looking to make kicker a 7-figure salary position",

    "description": "The LA Galaxy return to Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday to face Panamanian club Sporting San Miguelito in the second leg of the opening round of Concacaf Champions Cup.",
    "fullText": "After a frustrating draw with NYCFC that felt more like a loss Sunday, the LA Galaxy are back in action at Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday night. This time, for the second leg of their Concacaf Champions Cup opening round against Sporting San Miguelito.\n\nAfter the first leg, LA hold the advantage, last week's 1-1 draw in Panama means a win, or any scoreless draw, sends the Galaxy through to the round of 16, where Jamaican club Mt. Pleasant, the 2025 Caribbean Cup champion, awaits.\n\nIn Concacaf Champions Cup play, the away goals rule acts as the primary tiebreaker for two-legged knockout rounds (Round One through Semifinals). If the aggregate score is tied after two legs, the team with more away goals advances. If away goals are also equal, the tie goes directly to penalties.\n\nBut as head coach Greg Vanney made clear, the away goal conceded in the first leg makes this a precarious lead.\n\n“I think it's really up to them. It's a catch-22,” Vanney said of San Miguelito’s approach. “Ninety minutes is a long time, so I don't think you necessarily have to come out flying... It's really up to us to have the solution to whichever way they come.”\n\nFor a Galaxy side still trying to find its rhythm, that unpredictability is the central challenge. The team returned from Panama and looked sharp early against NYCFC, with new striker João Klauss scoring inside two minutes. But as Vanney noted, that sharpness faded.\n\nYour @LARiotSquad Player of the Match, João Klauss ⭐️ pic.twitter.com/2uKGPBkqbA\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 24, 2026\n\n“We haven't had two back-to-back training sessions in a row since somewhere in Coachella,” Vanney explained. “We're actually trying to evolve a little bit inside of these games and solve some different looks.”\n\nThe \"look\" in Panama was a disciplined, bunkered approach from San Miguelito that the Galaxy couldn't fully break down, surrendering a goal that gave the visitors a precious away tally.\n\nThe \"look\" against NYCFC was a high press that the Galaxy solved early, only to stall after going down to ten men following a lengthy VAR review. The result was another draw, leaving the Galaxy with more questions than answers.\n\nNext up: @TheChampions at home on wednesday ⏭️ pic.twitter.com/aUmWrPJrLN\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 23, 2026\n\n“We got off to a great start, and we just didn't deal with the ball well. I thought we defended really well for large stretches,” Vanney reflected on the NYCFC match. “We're evolving, and tomorrow is another opportunity to take a step.”\n\nThat step will require the Galaxy to dictate the tempo against a San Miguelito team that now has a clear objective: find a goal and hunker down defensively.\n\nVanney believes these dense, high-stakes fixtures are the perfect classroom for his squad.\n\n“What's beautiful about these moments is the team is facing different challenges,” he said. “Playing against a low block in Panama, your team has to change its mentality because they have to add speed into the game with the ball... These are great opportunities for our guys that are going to build a solid foundation.”\n\nThe Galaxy's midfield is slowly getting replenished, Vanney told reporters Isaiah Parente and Elijah Wynder are progressing and could be \"part of the group\" on Wednesday. He added Erik Thommy could make his debut Saturday against Charlotte and defender Chris Rindov was \"a little further behind\"\n\nKickoff is set for 8:30 p.m. from Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nLocation: Dignity Health Sports Park, Carson, Calif.\n\nRadio: LA Galaxy Youtube Channel.",

    "fullText": "The NFL has revealed that one of the more controversial calls from the Pittsburgh Steelers' 2025 season — Aaron Rodgers' near-interception ruled catch in Week 14 — was an officiating mistake.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Talk's Michael David Smith, a league spokesman confirmed that the replay review of Rodgers' Week 14 catch was incorrect and it should've been ruled as an interception made by Baltimore Ravens linebacker Teddye Buchanan.\n\nWith the Steelers leading the Ravens 27-22 with around six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Rodgers' pass attempt was batted down by Ravens defensive tackle C.J. Okoye and was ruled an interception by Buchanan. Replay review overturned the play in favor of Pittsburgh.\n\nAdditionally, NFL Executive VP of Football Operations Troy Vincent suggested that another replay reversal from the game, on Isaiah Likely's touchdown, was also wrong.

    "fullText": "How the 49ers' contract dispute with Trent Williams could impact the NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers cannot afford to lose Canton-bound left tackle Trent Williams.\n\nThe only problem is that they cannot afford to pay him, either.\n\nSan Francisco is dealing with the consequences of an aging roster and an unfulfilled competitive window. With stars demanding raises and a Super Bowl in sight, the 49ers have kicked the cap can down the road long enough. It has come back to bite them, and as Williams inches closer to free agency, San Francisco may have to look to the NFL Draft for his replacement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Adam Schefter reported that releasing Williams is on the table.\n\n\"With five-time All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams scheduled to carry a $39 million cap number this season, he and the 49ers currently are struggling to find a contractual solution, per league sources,\" he posted. \"If the two sides can’t bridge their differences in their standoff, Williams would be expected to join this year’s free-agent class, making him one of the premier players available.\"\n\nOf course, that's not a guarantee of Williams' departure. But Williams is perhaps the most valuable offensive lineman in the sport, appearing bulletproof into his late-30s. He's a stalwart in the game's preeminent rushing attack. And as a crux of Kyle Shanahan's scheme, there's reason to believe the 49ers view the position at a premium.\n\nThe first and most obvious pivot from Williams is an early-round selection in the 2026 NFL Draft. In a tackle class that has fallen short of expectations, a handful of candidates have fallen toward the back of Round 1.\n\nAmong them is Alabama's Kadyn Proctor. At 360 pounds, there are questions about how consistently his athleticism will play at the next level, but high-level play against SEC defensive lines has kept his stock high. Elsewhere, Caleb Lomu held down the blindside for Utah's elite offensive line, offering a more natural fit into Shanahan's zone scheme (at least physically). He's a work in progress as a run blocker, but a first-round pass protector with traits that inspire upside.\n\nLate in Round 1, San Francisco is also in range to capture upward momentum on a prospect like Monroe Freeling, who is bound to rise when athletic testing becomes the most recent source of information.\n\nMORE: 49ers get bad news on Trent Williams amid looming $39 million decision\n\nTaking a first-round tackle could reverberate throughout the NFL's toughest division. The Los Angeles Rams are unsteady at offensive tackle. Right tackle Rob Havenstein has retired, and Warren McClendon Jr. isn't necessarily the long-term answer in his place. The positional difference could render this moot, but the 49ers pick before Los Angeles' second pick in the first round.\n\nThere's a world in which the Rams lose out on their preferred tackle prospect because the 49ers feel they can turn Blake Miller -- or a similarly-valued prospect -- into their franchise left tackle.\n\nFurthermore, it may become clear that replacing Williams isn't a one-man job, but a structural one. San Francisco isn't drafting an upgrade at left tackle in Round 1. Baking in that regression could mean a greater emphasis on other positions, like drafting a receiver for Brandon Aiyuk's vacant snaps or a defensive X-factor to compensate for a step back offensively.\n\nUltimately, teams do an excellent job of keeping their best players in-house for as long as possible. There's little reason why Williams should retire in another team's jersey, and he's enough of a difference-maker to gamble on, even at 37 years old. Losing Williams would be the biggest transaction of San Francisco's offseason, leaving awfully big shoes to fill for whoever the 49ers take at No. 27.\n\nKyle Shanahan has slim pickings to develop next castoff quarterback\n\n49ers get good news on Mac Jones trade rumors\n\nA.J.

Worst feeling I have ever experienced in my life so far,” he wrote in a lengthy Instagram post.\n\nGiacomel’s single photo upload was a selfie of him in a hospital bed with several medical sensors attached to his exposed chest.\n\n“I tried to ski really slow the first part of the third lap but my body wasn’t allowing me to ski anymore,” he continued.\n\nThe athlete added that in the moment, he felt “frustration, anger, [and] disappointment.”\n\n“It’s devastating. It’s devastating to stop but there wasn’t anything I could do against my own body today. Absolutely not the end of the games I was hoping for but I will never give up. 4 years fly by fast and I will try again in France,” Giacomel said.\n\nHe ended his post by letting his supporters know that doctors would continue running medical checks in the coming days to find the root cause of his health issues.\n\n“Get well soon, Tommy! You’ll come back stronger,” the official account for the International Biathlon Union commented.\n\n​​Biathlon is a winter sport that merges cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. It began in 19th-century Scandinavia, originating in ski warfare, and developed from the sport of military patrol.\n\nOn Tuesday, the FISI said their organization’s medical commission completed a series of diagnostic tests on Giacomel in collaboration with Professor Daniele Andreini.\n\nGiacomel “underwent a CT scan, an MRI scan, and a maximal exercise test, all of which were normal.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“A subsequent electrophysiological study revealed an atrial conduction abnormality, which recommended a subsequent ablation, which has already been performed and was a complete success,” the FISI said.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the hospital on Thursday, the Italian athlete who has competed in the Biathlon World Cup since 2019, will have routine check-ups in two weeks.\n\nGiacomel is expected to return to regular training following the completion of those check-ups, FISI said.",

The victory sparked celebrations across the country, but the team went viral after FBI Director Kash Patel was seen celebrating in their locker room and later calling President Donald Trump on the phone so that he could congratulate the athletes and invite them to his State of the Union address.\n\nHowever, the president earned a bit of backlash when a video of the call caught him begrudgingly telling the gold medal-winning team, “I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team,” adding that he “probably would be impeached” if he didn’t invite them. The Women’s U.S. Hockey Team also brought home the gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nWhile the majority of the men’s team made the trip Tuesday to Washington, D.C., visiting Trump at the White House before the SOTU address, five players notably did not attend.\n\nJake Guentzel of the Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nBrock Nelson of the Colorado Avalanche\n\nKyle Connor of the Winnipeg Jets\n\nJake Oettinger of the Dallas Stars\n\nJackson LaCombe of the Anaheim Ducks\n\nMost of the players just returned to their respective homes ahead of more games in the upcoming NHL season. It was reported that Nelson wanted to spend time with family before more travel with the Avalanche in the coming days.\n\nTrump did end up inviting the women’s hockey team as well, but they declined, citing “timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments” for missing the State of the Union.\n\n“We are sincerely grateful for the invitation extended to our gold medal-winning U.S. Women’s Hockey Team and deeply appreciate the recognition of their extraordinary achievement,” a USA Hockey spokesperson said. “Due to the timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games, the athletes are unable to participate.”\n\nThe majority of the players that ended up making the trip to D.C. on Trump’s invite went on a tour of the White House. They snapped photos on the grounds, looked through the West Wing and then got more pictures with President Trump in the Oval Office while sporting USA sweaters and their Olympic gold medals.\n\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) February 24, 2026\n\nThe post Here’s Which US Men’s Hockey Players Skipped the State of the Union Address appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "It’s that time again, time for the annual NFL Scouting Combine, where the top players in college football who have declared for the NFL draft and are specifically invited are brought to Indianapolis, Indiana’s Lucas Oil Stadium. Each player is then run through a variety of drills and tests based on their position, unless they opt out of a certain phase of the testing. The individual teams’ staff also hold personal interviews with various players that they may be interested in drafting during the annual NFL draft held the following April.\n\nThe Combine can make or break an individual player’s draft status and where they are actually selected. Even the highest-rated players can damage their draft stock with poor testing numbers or a poor personal interview. The reverse is also true: guys who are assumed to be picked much later before the combine can move up the draft, sometimes by a substantial amount, if they are better than expected in their testing and interviews.\n\nWith all of that in mind, this evening’s question is something that I have wondered and at times for sure believed as a long-time (like a very long time) Miami Dolphins fan. So this evening’s question of the day is:\n\nDo you think that our own Miami Dolphins or even the NFL in general has, in the past, relied too much on combine numbers and interviews as opposed to what the players have put on tape in college, in the past, when deciding who to draft, especially in the higher rounds?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

    "fullText": "No. 2 Oregon Responds with Statement Win Over No. 3 Quinnipiac\n\nThe second-ranked Oregon acrobatics and tumbling team delivered a sharper, more complete performance in its home opener Saturday, defeating No. 3 Quinnipiac, 270.640–265.425, at Matthew Knight Arena.\n\nOregon set the tone immediately. A perfect 10.0 in the toss heat of the compulsory event gave the Ducks an early edge, and they controlled the meet from start to finish in a wire-to-wire victory between two top-three programs.\n\nThe win marked clear progress from Oregon’s season-opening score of 267.325 at Missouri State. The Ducks improved by more than three points overall and saw a significant jump in the team event, climbing from 89.100 to 92.290.\n\nHow It Happened\nOregon opened strong in compulsory, winning three of four heats. The highlight came in toss, where the Ducks earned the program’s first perfect 10.0 in the skill since 2020. The side-by-side precision of two quintets delivered the milestone score: Shea Barnes, Kamryn Horiuchi, Charlotte Lippa, Ashlyn Parlett and Emily Rezner; and Selah Bell, Molly Dahlager, Makenna Guidish, Angelica Martin and Blessyn McMorris.\n\nThe Ducks exited the opening event with a 38.000–37.700 lead and built on it in acro, outscoring Quinnipiac 65.100–63.300. Cassidy Cu and Angelica Martin anchored the effort with a 9.800 in the five-element heat and a 9.750 in the seven-element heat.\n\nEveryone's effort! #GoDucks | #Power pic.twitter.com/aaYoucAVUI\n\n— Oregon Acro&Tumbling (@OregonAcroTumb) February 22, 2026\n\nOregon maintained a narrow advantage after pyramid, leading 94.300–92.350. Quinnipiac gained ground in toss, but the Ducks responded in tumbling. Nya Womack posted a 9.800 in the aerial pass, and Morgan Willingham matched that mark in the six-element pass, helping Oregon steady its momentum.\n\nEntering the team event with a slim 178.350–177.175 lead, the Ducks closed emphatically.

    "fullText": "Note: I currently work with a Payments Engineering team and wrote this as we are introducing spec-driven development into our development workflow.\n\nIf you've used an AI coding tool in the last year, you've probably had the experience: you describe what you want, the AI generates something that looks right, you run it, and... it doesn't quite work. You refine your prompt. The AI fixes one thing and breaks another. Three iterations later you're debugging code you didn't write and don't fully understand.\n\nThis is the failure mode of what Andrej Karpathy called \"vibe coding\" and it's become the default way most developers interact with AI. Spec driven development (SDD) is the emerging counter movement. Instead of throwing prompts at an LLM and hoping for the best, you write a structured specification first, then let the AI implement against it.\n\nThe idea isn't new. We've been writing requirements documents since forever, but the tooling is new. Tools like GitHub's Spec Kit, Amazon's Kiro, and Fission AI's OpenSpec are attempting to formalize this workflow into something repeatable. Whether that formalization helps or hinders depends entirely on what you're building, how you're building it, and the tradeoffs you're willing to make.\n\nOur team uses OpenSpec, so most of the practical examples in this post come from that experience. But the principles apply regardless of which tool you pick.\n\nThe pitch for AI assisted coding is attractive: describe what you want in English and get working code back. And for simple tasks, a helper function, a config change, renaming a module, it works remarkably well. The challenges starts when changes aren't trivial but require edits to multiple files or packages/modules.\n\nThe core issue is context loss. When you're five prompts deep into a feature, the AI has no persistent memory of the architectural decisions you made in prompt one. It doesn't know you chose a specific idempotency strategy for a reason. It doesn't remember that you explicitly avoided storing raw card data outside the tokenization boundary. Every new prompt starts from a partial view of the world, and the AI fills in the gaps with whatever patterns it's seen most in training data.\n\nIn payments systems, this produces particularly dangerous failures. Reconciliation logic scattered across three different modules because each prompt generated its own approach. A refund handler that doesn't account for partial captures. Currency conversion applied twice because the AI didn't know about the upstream normalization step. And perhaps most critically in our domain, security flaws: API keys committed to source, missing input validation on transaction amounts, authorization checks that live on the client instead of the server. Studies have found that roughly 45% of AI generated code contains security vulnerabilities. In a payments context, that's more than just a bug but a compliance issue.\n\nThe other failure is architectural drift. Without a shared plan, each prompt/response cycle makes locally reasonable decisions that are globally incoherent. The AI can't refactor itself out of architectural problems it doesn't understand. You ask it to add retry logic to a payment gateway call and it builds a standalone retry mechanism, unaware that you already have a circuit breaker pattern in your infrastructure layer. Once the codebase reaches a certain size, the context window can only see fragments of it. You end up with a system that processes transactions but that nobody, including the AI, fully understands anymore.\n\nThis isn't the AI being dumb. It's the natural consequence of building without a map.\n\nAt its simplest, spec driven development means: write down what you're building before you write the code, and make that written artifact the thing your AI agent works from.\n\nThat might sound like waterfall but It's not, or at least, it doesn't have to be. The key differences are timescale and scope. Traditional waterfall specs were project level documents written over weeks and often carved in stone. SDD specs are feature level documents written in minutes and meant to evolve. You're not planning an entire system upfront; you're planning the next meaningful chunk of work in enough detail that an AI can implement it without guessing.\n\nA typical SDD workflow looks like this:\n\nYou're not writing all of this yourself. You describe the intent in natural language, and the AI generates the spec artifacts: the proposal, the requirements, the design, the task breakdown. Your job is to review, refine, and correct. You steer and the AI does the heavy lifting. This is what makes the process fast enough to be practical. Writing a 200 line spec by hand for every feature would be painful. Having the AI draft it in 30 seconds and then spending 5 minutes reviewing and adjusting it is a different proposition entirely.\n\nThe spec becomes a persistent artifact, a \"super prompt\" that doesn't disappear when your chat session ends. It lives in version control alongside your code. When the AI drifts, you point it back to the spec. When requirements change, you update the spec and regenerate.\n\nThe fundamental shift is that the specification becomes the source of truth, and code becomes the derived artifact. Traditional documentation describes code that already exists. SDD inverts that relationship. You define the behaviour, constraints, and architecture in the spec, and the AI produces code that conforms to it. The spec isn't something you write after the fact to explain what was built but the input that determines what gets built. Code is the output.\n\nThree tools have emerged as the most prominent in this space. Each takes a different philosophical approach.\n\nSpec Kit is an open source CLI from GitHub that scaffolds a spec driven workflow into your existing project. It's agent agnostic, working with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others. The workflow follows rigid phases driven by slash commands: /speckit.constitution to establish project principles, /speckit.specify to create feature specs, /speckit.plan for a technical plan, /speckit.tasks for work items, and /speckit.implement to execute.\n\nStrengths: Thorough documentation output, the \"constitution\" concept for project wide principles, works with many agents.\n\nWeaknesses: Heavyweight. Sometimes it get generate a lot of artifacts for simple changes. Rigid phase gates mean you can't easily jump back and forth between planning and implementing.\n\nKiro is a full IDE (a VS Code fork) with spec driven development baked into the editing experience. The workflow follows a similar shape (requirements → design → tasks → implement) but is tightly integrated with the editor. It generates user stories with acceptance criteria, creates technical design documents, and produces task lists. It also introduces \"Hooks,\" user defined prompts triggered by file changes.\n\nStrengths: Most polished integrated experience. The Hooks system is excellent and something you'd have to configure manually if you decide to do it on your own. No context switching between planning and editing because of the IDE integration.\n\nWeaknesses: You're locked into their IDE and limited to Claude models. Can be overkill for small changes. One developer reported a simple bug fix generating 4 user stories with 16 acceptance criteria. The overhead can be significant.\n\nOpenSpec is the most lightweight of the three. It's a TypeScript CLI with a fluid, iterative workflow and no rigid phase gates. Where Spec Kit enforces a strict sequence and Kiro wraps everything in an IDE, OpenSpec gets out of your way and lets you move between planning artifacts freely.\n\nIts distinguishing philosophy is \"brownfield first.\" While the other tools are optimized for building new things from scratch, OpenSpec is designed to work with existing codebases. Each change produces a \"spec delta,\" a document that captures what's being added, modified, or removed relative to the existing system. Over time, these deltas merge into a living specification that reflects the current state of the system.\n\nOpenSpec also handles change history better. Every completed change is archived with its full artifact set: the original proposal, the spec deltas, the design, and the task list. This means you can go back and see not just what changed in the system, but why it changed, what alternatives were considered in the design, and what the original acceptance criteria were. Spec Kit and Kiro generate artifacts during planning but don't have the same structured archive and merge cycle. In OpenSpec, the openspec/changes/archive/ directory becomes a chronological record of every significant change to the system, and the openspec/specs/ directory is always the merged, current truth. For regulated environments where auditability matters, this distinction is significant.\n\nStrengths: Works with 20+ AI tools including Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, and many others. The brownfield focus is valuable in our context as most real work is on existing codebases. Fluid workflow lets you update any artifact at any time and you are not forced into a linear way of working. The archive/merge cycle produces both a living spec and an auditable change history.\n\nWeaknesses: Less hand holding in the spec writing process is the trade-off it makes while allowing you to navigate back-and-forth between spec and implementation. The tool is newer and the ecosystem is still growing.\n\nOpenSpec requires Node.js 20.19.0 or higher.\n\nThen navigate to your project directory and initialize:\n\nThe init process will ask which AI tool you're using and configure the appropriate slash commands or agent instructions for your environment.\n\nOpenSpec also works with pnpm, yarn, bun, and nix. See the official installation docs for alternative paths.\n\nThen refresh agent instructions in each project:\n\nUnderstanding the full lifecycle of an OpenSpec change is worth the time, because the artifacts it generates serve different roles on the team in different ways.\n\nOpenSpec's workflow is built around the opsx slash commands. Here's the complete set, the ones you interact with the most are bolded:\n\nThe typical flow is new → ff → apply → archive, but the power of OpenSpec is that you can break out of that sequence at any point. Need to revisit the design after you've started implementing? Just edit design.md. Want to add acceptance criteria while coding? Update the spec delta. There are no phase gates forcing you to \"finish\" one stage before moving to another.\n\nOne of the first decisions in any OpenSpec workflow is how you enter it. There are two entry points, and choosing the right one makes a real difference in the quality of what comes out the other side.\n\n/opsx:new is for when you know what you're building. You have a clear feature in mind, you understand the requirements well enough to describe them, and you're ready to start generating planning artifacts. Maybe you've already discussed this in a planning meeting. Maybe you've built something similar before. Maybe the ticket is well defined and you just need to formalize it. In these cases, /opsx:new add-feature-name followed by /opsx:ff gets you from zero to a full set of planning documents in minutes.\n\nThis works well when the problem space is familiar and constraints are understood. You've implemented retry logic before, you know the gateway's behavior, you just need to formalize it.\n\n/opsx:explore is for when you're still figuring things out. Maybe you have a vague idea but the requirements aren't clear. Maybe you're investigating a production anomaly and you don't know where the root cause is yet. Maybe a stakeholder said \"we need to support instant payments\" and you need to figure out what that actually means for your settlement architecture before you can spec anything.\n\nExplore opens a broader, open ended conversation with the AI before any change folder is created and before any artifacts are generated. There's no structure imposed, no proposal template to fill out, no pressure to define acceptance criteria. You're just thinking out loud with an assistant that has context on your codebase.\n\nThe explore conversation might last five minutes or an hour. It might branch into several tangents before converging on a clear problem statement. That's intentional. You're doing the messy, nonlinear thinking that produces good requirements, and you're doing it before the spec exists rather than discovering gaps during implementation.\n\nThis is also where existing requirements documents from business analysts become valuable. In payments organizations, BAs often produce detailed feature requirements independently of any SDD tool: field mapping spreadsheets, business rule matrices, sample ISO 20022 payloads (pain.001, pain.008, pacs.008), regulatory constraint documents, and workflow diagrams. These artifacts are the raw material that explore turns into actionable specs.\n\nRather than asking the AI to invent requirements from scratch, you feed it the BA's work:\n\nThe explore phase becomes a bridge between the BA's domain knowledge and the engineering reality of the codebase. The BA doesn't need to know about your GenServer architecture or your Ecto schema conventions. The developer doesn't need to memorize the ISO 20022 payload structure. Explore lets both perspectives converge into a proposal that reflects both business intent and technical feasibility.\n\nWhen you've reached clarity, you transition naturally into the structured workflow:\n\nNow the proposal and specs will be grounded in both the BA's requirements and the technical understanding you built during exploration, rather than being generated from a one line prompt.\n\nUse /opsx:new when you can describe the feature or fix in a sentence and you're confident in the scope. Use /opsx:explore when any of the following are true: you're unsure what the root cause of a problem is, the requirements are ambiguous or underspecified, you need to evaluate multiple approaches before committing to one, or you want to pressure test an idea before investing in formal planning. In practice, we find ourselves using explore more often than we initially expected. The few minutes spent thinking before speccing consistently produce better specs, which in turn produce better code.\n\nWhen you run /opsx:new add-idempotent-refunds, OpenSpec creates a change directory:\n\nRunning /opsx:ff (or stepping through with /opsx:continue) generates the planning artifacts:\n\nEach of these artifacts has a specific purpose and a specific audience. Let's look at what goes into them.\n\nproposal.md is the \"why\" document. It describes the motivation for the change, the scope of what's included and excluded, and any constraints or dependencies. This is the document you'd share in a planning meeting or attach to a ticket. It answers the question: \"Why are we doing this, and what does 'done' look like at a high level?\" For a refunds feature, this might capture that the driver is duplicate refund incidents costing the business money, that the scope includes full and partial refunds but excludes chargebacks, and that the constraint is backwards compatibility with the existing refund API contract.\n\nspecs/ contains the spec delta, the functional requirements for this specific change. Requirements are marked as ADDED, MODIFIED, or REMOVED relative to the current system. Each requirement uses structured language (\"The system SHALL...\") with clear acceptance criteria and scenarios. This is where edge cases live. This is where you define what happens when a refund is submitted with the same idempotency key as a previous request, what the system does when the gateway returns a timeout mid refund, or how partial refunds interact with the original transaction's settlement status.\n\ndesign.md is the technical blueprint. It covers the data model, API contracts, component architecture, sequence flows, and any technology choices specific to this feature. For the refunds example, it's where you'd document the idempotency key storage strategy, the state machine transitions for refund lifecycle, and the gateway adapter interface for multi acquirer support.\n\ntasks.md breaks the work into discrete, ordered implementation steps. Each task is small enough to verify independently, ideally something that can be implemented in under 30 minutes. Tasks have clear completion criteria so both the developer and the AI know when they're done.\n\nWhen all tasks are complete and verified, /opsx:archive does something important: it merges the spec deltas from the change back into the main openspec/specs/ directory. The change folder moves to openspec/changes/archive/, preserving the history. The main specs now reflect the updated state of the system.\n\nThis is the mechanism that turns specs into a living document. After a dozen features have been built and archived, openspec/specs/ contains a comprehensive, up to date description of what the system does. Not what it was designed to do originally, but what it actually does right now.\n\nOne of the underappreciated aspects of spec driven development is that the artifacts aren't just for the developer writing the code. They create value across every role that touches the project.\n\nThe immediate benefit is implementation quality. Instead of translating a vague Jira ticket into code via a series of increasingly frustrated prompts, you're working from a spec that already captures requirements, edge cases, and technical decisions. The AI produces better code because it has better context. You spend less time debugging and reworking because misunderstandings surface during spec review, not during code review.\n\nThe longer term benefit is onboarding and maintenance. When you come back to a feature six months later, or when a new developer joins the team, the spec explains not just what the code does but why it was built that way. The proposal captures the business motivation. The design doc captures the technical rationale. The spec captures the behavioral contract.\n\nThe proposal and spec artifacts are written in structured natural language, not code. A BA or PM can read proposal.md and immediately understand the scope, motivation, and acceptance criteria for a change without needing to parse a pull request.\n\nMore importantly, they can contribute to these documents. If the spec says \"The system SHALL retry failed direct debit collections up to 3 times\" and the BA knows the scheme rules mandate a maximum of 2 retries with specific interval requirements, they can flag that in the spec before any code is written. The spec becomes a shared contract between product and engineering, reviewable by both sides.\n\nBAs in payments organizations often produce detailed requirements documents that exist outside of any development tool: field mapping spreadsheets between internal formats and ISO 20022 messages, business rule matrices for transaction routing, sample payloads for pain.001 or pacs.008 messages, regulatory constraint documents, and scheme specific validation rules. These documents don't need to be rewritten into OpenSpec format. Instead, they serve as input to the /opsx:explore conversation and as reference material that the proposal and specs can point to. The spec might say \"Field mappings follow the BA's pain.008 mapping document (see docs/ba-requirements/sepa-dd-field-mappings.xlsx)\" rather than duplicating that content. OpenSpec captures the engineering requirements; the BA's documents capture the domain requirements. The two reference each other.\n\nFor teams practicing any kind of requirements analysis, the spec delta format (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED) maps naturally to how BAs think about change impact. You can see at a glance exactly what existing behavior is changing and what's new.\n\nThe specs are essentially test plans waiting to happen. Each requirement with its acceptance criteria maps directly to test cases. \"WHEN a refund is submitted with an idempotency key matching a previously completed refund, THEN the system SHALL return the original refund response without processing a duplicate\" is a test case in all but name.\n\nQA can review specs before implementation begins, catching gaps in test coverage at the cheapest possible point in the development cycle. In payments, where edge cases around timeouts, partial failures, and concurrent operations are where bugs hide, having QA eyes on the spec early is especially valuable. They can also use specs to verify completeness: does the implementation actually cover every scenario in the spec? OpenSpec's /opsx:verify command automates part of this check, but human QA review of the spec itself is where the real value lies.\n\nThe design document is where architectural oversight happens. A principal can review design.md to ensure the proposed approach fits the system's overall architecture, without needing to wait for a code review to discover that someone introduced a new database table that duplicates an existing one, or bypassed the payment gateway abstraction layer by calling the acquirer API directly.\n\nThe proposal document is equally valuable at this level. It provides enough context to make prioritization decisions, estimate impact on downstream systems like settlement and reconciliation, and flag dependencies before work begins.\n\nFor organizations running architecture review boards or design review processes, OpenSpec artifacts slot directly into those workflows. The artifacts are markdown in version control, which means they can be reviewed through the same pull request process as code.\n\nThe openspec/specs/ directory, the living spec that accumulates as changes are archived, becomes something like institutional memory for the project. It captures not just the current state of the system but the evolution of requirements over time. New team members can browse the specs to understand the system. Archived changes provide an audit trail of what changed, when, and why.\n\nThis is especially valuable for distributed teams where not everyone is in every meeting. The spec is always available, always current, and always in the repo.\n\nIn most payments organizations, business analysts produce detailed requirements documents long before any developer opens an IDE. These documents are the product of weeks of domain analysis: field mapping spreadsheets that map internal data structures to ISO 20022 message formats like pain.001 or pacs.008, business rule matrices that define transaction routing logic, validation rules derived from scheme specifications, sample XML payloads, regulatory constraint summaries, and workflow diagrams for processes like mandate lifecycle management or chargeback dispute flows.\n\nThese artifacts are enormously valuable. They represent concentrated domain knowledge that no AI model has in its training data. But they exist outside of any development tool, usually in Confluence pages, shared drives, or Excel files. The question is: where do they plug into the SDD workflow?\n\nRather than asking the AI to invent payment domain requirements from scratch (which it will get wrong in subtle, dangerous ways), you feed the BA's existing documents into the explore conversation. The AI reads the BA's field mappings, business rules, and sample payloads, then maps them against your actual codebase. The explore conversation becomes a structured dialogue about feasibility: which business rules can be implemented directly, which ones require architectural changes, where the BA's requirements conflict with existing behavior, and what edge cases the BA may not have considered from a technical perspective.\n\nThis conversation might reveal that 70% of the BA's requirements map cleanly to existing patterns and 30% require new design decisions. Those design decisions then flow into the proposal and spec with full context, rather than being invented by the AI from a one sentence prompt.\n\nThe key principle: the BA's documents are input to the spec, not replaced by it. The OpenSpec proposal can reference them directly (\"Field mappings follow the BA's pain.008 mapping document, see docs/ba-requirements/sepa-dd-field-mappings.xlsx\"). The spec captures the engineering interpretation of business requirements, while the BA's artifacts remain the authoritative source for domain rules. The two complement each other.\n\nFor teams with a strong BA function, this workflow turns explore into the most valuable step in the entire process. It's where domain expertise meets technical reality, and where misunderstandings between product and engineering get caught before they become expensive.\n\nFor years, the standard way to decompose work in software organizations has been the Agile hierarchy: Epics break into Features, Features break into User Stories, User Stories break into Tasks. Each layer adds structure, and each layer adds overhead. Grooming sessions to refine stories. Estimation ceremonies to assign points. Sprint planning to negotiate what fits. Story splitting when something is \"too big.\" Acceptance criteria written in Given/When/Then format.\n\nThis process was designed for a world where humans wrote every line of code, and work needed to be decomposed into pieces small enough for one developer to complete in a sprint. The granularity served a coordination function: if three developers are working on the same feature in parallel, you need clearly bounded units of work to avoid stepping on each other.\n\nWith AI agents handling the bulk of code generation, developers now work in significantly larger chunks. A feature that would have been split into 8 user stories with 24 tasks can be described as a single spec and implemented in one session. The AI doesn't need two week sprints to context switch between stories. It doesn't need story points to estimate effort. It doesn't care whether a unit of work is a 3 or a 5. It needs a clear description of what to build and enough context to build it correctly.\n\nThe overhead of the old hierarchy was always significant. Ceremonies consume 15-30% of a team's time. The BA writes detailed requirements and translates them into epics and stories. The tech lead estimates them. The developer re-interprets them during implementation. Each translation step is an opportunity for information loss.\n\nSDD collapses this. Instead of an Epic with 5 Features containing 20 User Stories containing 60 Tasks, you have a proposal that captures the business intent, a spec that defines the requirements, a design that describes the technical approach, and a task list that the AI executes against. The entire chain from \"why are we doing this\" to \"what code gets written\" lives in one change folder, reviewable as a single unit. There's no translation loss and the spec is the shared artifact that all of those roles read, review, and contribute to.\n\nThis doesn't mean you abandon planning. It means the unit of planning shifts from \"what can one developer finish in two days\" to \"what is the next coherent change to the system.\" That change might be small (fix a settlement rounding error) or large (add multi currency support). The spec scales to fit either. And because the AI generates the task breakdown from the spec, you don't need to spend planning meetings debating granularity. The tasks exist to guide the AI's implementation, not to fill a sprint board.\n\nSDD offers a natural landing spot for a switch to AI-first development. You keep the parts that matter (clear requirements, technical review, incremental delivery) and shed the parts that were only ever coordination scaffolding.\n\nLet's walk through a concrete example using OpenSpec to add multi currency settlement support to a payment processing platform.\n\nStep 1: Explore (optional but useful)\n\nIf the requirements aren't fully clear, or if you have BA created documents that need to be digested before planning, start with exploration:\n\nThis step is for thinking, not committing. No change folder is created yet.\n\nStep 3: Generate planning artifacts\n\nIf you have a clear picture of what to build, fast forward through all planning stages:\n\nAlternatively, use /opsx:continue to step through one phase at a time, reviewing and refining each artifact before moving to the next.\n\nStep 4: Review and refine the artifacts\n\nThis is the most important step. Read the generated proposal, specs, and design. Push back on anything that doesn't match your intent:\n\nReal work isn't linear. OpenSpec handles context switches gracefully because your plan lives in the artifacts, not in the AI's memory.\n\nOne important detail: during /opsx:apply, you can stop the AI at any point while monitoring its output. If you see it heading in the wrong direction on task 1.3, you stop it, correct course, and resume. The task list in tasks.md tracks what's been completed, so nothing about your plan is lost. This is fundamentally different from vibe coding, where stopping mid stream means losing context and hoping you can reconstruct where you were.\n\nThe same principle applies to bigger interrupts. You can pause an entire feature to handle something urgent:\n\nThe multi currency feature picks up exactly where it left off. The artifacts held the plan while you were away, whether that was five minutes or five days.\n\nSDD is not appropriate in all cases. Here are some cases where the overhead isn't worth it:\n\nQuick bug fixes. If you know exactly what's wrong and the fix is a one line change to a gateway timeout value, writing a spec is like filing a building permit to hang a picture frame. Just fix it.\n\nExploratory prototyping. When you're trying to figure out what to build, not how to build it, specs slow you down. Vibe coding is genuinely great for rapid exploration. If you're prototyping a new merchant dashboard layout to see what feels right, just build it iteratively.\n\nHighly visual or interactive work. SDD tools are text based. If your feature is primarily about UI layout, animation, or interaction design, you'll spend more time describing the visual result in markdown than you'd spend just building it with visual feedback (though pairing SDD with TideWave can work wonders for UI work).\n\nTrivial features. Updating an error message string, renaming a config key, bumping a dependency version. These don't need a spec. Use your judgment about the complexity threshold.\n\nRapidly changing requirements. If you're in a phase where the payment scheme keeps revising the spec and requirements shift weekly, maintaining your own specs becomes overhead that fights against your pace. Get to stability first, then spec the features that need to stick.\n\nThe general rule: if you can hold the entire change in your head and verify it by looking at it, you probably don't need a spec. If the change involves multiple files, multiple concerns, or behavior you can't verify visually, a spec starts paying for itself.\n\nHaving used these tools and studied the experiences of others, here are the traps:\n\nSpec bloat. The AI loves to generate exhaustive specifications. A feature that would take you 30 minutes to implement can produce 800+ lines of markdown. You have to be disciplined about trimming specs to what's actually useful. If you're not reading the spec carefully, it's worse than not having one because you'll have false confidence that edge cases are covered when they're not.\n\nThe waterfall trap. SDD can slide into big design up front if you're not careful and start bundling many features into one spec. If changing the spec feels expensive or bureaucratic, you've over formalized. OpenSpec's fluid workflow helps here since there are no phase gates, but you still need the discipline to keep specs lightweight enough to throw away and rewrite if you find yourself going down the wrong path.\n\nSpec drift. The spec says one thing; the code does another. This happens when you make implementation fixes outside the spec workflow. Either update the spec when you deviate, or accept that the spec is aspirational rather than authoritative. OpenSpec's /opsx:sync command can help keep specs aligned during long running changes.\n\nThe AI ignores its own spec. This is a real and documented problem. Context windows are larger, but that doesn't mean the AI attends to everything in them equally. People have reported that AI agents generate code that contradicts the spec they just wrote, creating duplicate classes, ignoring constraints, or implementing patterns the spec explicitly avoided. The /opsx:verify step exists specifically to catch this.\n\nReview fatigue. SDD adds a new category of artifact to review. You're now reviewing specs AND code. If your team doesn't value spec review as highly as code review, specs become rubber stamped documents that provide an illusion of rigour.\n\nOver application to small changes. The tooling doesn't scale down well. Applying the full SDD workflow to a minor feature creates overhead that dwarfs the implementation time. You need a personal threshold for when to spec and when to just build.\n\nEvery discussion of SDD eventually arrives at the same question: isn't this just waterfall with better marketing?\n\nThe comparison is fair to raise and unfair to leave unexamined. Traditional waterfall failed because of long feedback loops: months of design, months of implementation, and discovery at the end that the design didn't match reality. The feedback cycle was measured in quarters.\n\nSDD, practiced well, has feedback cycles measured in minutes to hours. You write a spec for a single feature, not an entire system. You review the generated design before implementation starts. You implement in small, verifiable tasks. And critically, changing the spec and regenerating is cheap. The whole point is that code is a derived artifact you can throw away and recreate.\n\nSDD can slide into waterfall like rigidity if you treat specs as immutable, if the spec writing phase becomes its own bottleneck, or if you use SDD as a substitute for iterative discovery. As Gojko Adzic observed, the movement builds on solid intent-first ideas but could reintroduce rigidity if practitioners aren't thoughtful about it.\n\nThe Thoughtworks perspective captures the nuance well: the problems of vibe coding come from being too fast, spontaneous, and haphazard, while the problems of waterfall come from being too slow, rigid, and disconnected from reality. SDD, when practiced well, occupies the middle ground. It provides a mechanism for shorter and more effective feedback loops than either extreme.\n\nThe honest answer is that SDD sits on a spectrum. At one end, you have \"spec as lightweight sketch,\" a quick outline that gives the AI direction without constraining it. At the other end, you have \"spec as source of truth,\" a comprehensive document that the code must conform to. OpenSpec's fluid approach leans toward the lighter end of that spectrum, which is why it appeals to teams who want discipline without ceremony.\n\nReduced rework. Catching misunderstandings at the spec level is dramatically cheaper than catching them in code. When a BA's field mapping is wrong, you want to discover that while reviewing a proposal, not while debugging a failed settlement file at 2 AM.\n\nPersistent context. Specs survive session boundaries, tool switches, and team changes. Six months from now, when someone asks why the FX rate locking works the way it does, the spec and its proposal explain both the what and the why.\n\nReviewable intent across roles. You can review a spec without reading any code. Product managers, BAs, QA, and principals can participate in spec review and catch requirement gaps before implementation begins. In a payments context, this means compliance can review the spec for regulatory alignment without needing to read Elixir.\n\nTime upfront. Writing and reviewing specs takes time that vibe coding doesn't require. For simple tasks, this overhead is pure cost with minimal benefit.\n\nFalse precision. Detailed specs can create an illusion of completeness. Just because the spec covers edge cases on paper doesn't mean the AI will implement them correctly. You still need to test.\n\nTool immaturity. These tools are all early stage. Expect rough edges, breaking changes, and workflow gaps. The ecosystem is moving fast, which means today's best practices may be obsolete in six months.\n\nSpec driven development is less than a year old as a named practice, and the tooling is evolving fast. The fundamental insight, that AI agents produce better code when given structured intent rather than ad hoc prompts, seems durable even if the specific tools don't survive.\n\nWhat's interesting is the convergence. BDD (Behavior Driven Development), TDD (Test Driven Development), and now SDD all share the same DNA: define the desired behavior before writing the implementation. SDD is that idea adapted for a world where the implementer is an AI agent rather than a human developer.\n\nThe open question is whether specs will remain the domain of dedicated tools, or whether this discipline gets absorbed into the AI coding tools themselves. We're already seeing Cursor, Claude Code, and Copilot add planning and multi step reasoning capabilities that accomplish some of what SDD tools do, without the explicit spec writing step.\n\nFor now, the practical takeaway is simple: if you're doing anything more complex than a quick prototype with AI coding tools, some form of structured planning, whether you call it SDD or just \"thinking before prompting,\" will produce better results than vibing your way through it. The tools can help enforce that discipline, but the discipline itself is what matters.\n\nThe spec isn't the point. The thinking is.",

    "title": "Five security lessons from the FBI's Washington Post raid",
    "description": "Court documents show how investigators can track digital activities, and reveal ways to harden journalists’ devices",
    "fullText": "The January FBI raid of the home of Washington Post federal government reporter Hannah Natanson, in connection with a leak probe involving a government contractor, was a dangerous escalation against press freedom and likely runs afoul of the Privacy Protection Act. It shouldn’t have happened at all.\n\nA judge has since ordered that the government preserve, but not review, the materials seized during the raid. We’ve recently examined a court document that shines light on some specifics of the case, and think journalists can learn something from what it reveals.\n\nThe court filing suggests Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, the government contractor, allegedly viewed a document later published by Natanson and took screenshots before pasting those images into a new Microsoft Word document.\n\nIf you use a work-issued computer or phone at any well-resourced organization, like a government agency, it’s quite likely that there are a handful of technologies to track employee activities baked into your device.\n\nServices like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 provide administrators with audit logs of employees’ activities, such as the user who opened a given document, actions taken in the document, and when they were taken.\n\nIn practice, this means investigators could see a list of everyone who accessed a leaked document and make a short list of likely sources of the leak.\n\nMany workplaces also use mobile device management services to equip workplace devices with security monitoring, control, and visibility into those devices.\n\nIn this case, we see that investigators were able to detect Perez-Lugones’ screenshot, which likely would have removed some metadata — information about the original document — before he printed it out as a new document.\n\nA well-resourced work environment, unfortunately, has an extraordinary level of visibility into employees’ activities on their devices. Sources should therefore generally assume what they do on workplace laptops, phones, networks, and physical spaces is being recorded.\n\nThe document suggests investigators were authorized to force the reporter to use biometrics to unlock devices, using her fingerprints or the face scanners built into her devices.\n\nAfter seizing her MacBook Pro, Natanson was told to unlock it with her fingerprint.\n\nWhile rare, we have seen other examples of law enforcement actors obtaining permission and attempting to use biometric unlocks with tools like Face ID and Touch ID to force reporters to unlock their devices.\n\nThere is a place for biometrics — the alternative would be typing in your passcode dozens or even hundreds of times each day, which would encourage weaker passcodes. (And we hope you use a long, unique passcode!)\n\nBut if you are going into a scenario where you expect it’s possible your phone may be seized, such as when going through airport security, disabling biometrics doesn’t hurt.\n\nNatanson probably couldn’t reasonably have predicted that her devices were about to be seized, and it’s therefore harder to prepare for a situation like this.\n\nWe do know that many raids happen before dawn, so this points to a benefit in shutting down your computer before bed and when not in use.\n\nYou can also quickly disable biometrics at any time by holding the power button and the volume-up button on your phone at the same time. This will immediately disable biometrics on an iPhone, but on Android, you may need to click “Lockdown” afterward. Android users may need to enable this from the Settings app.\n\nIf you feel comfortable simply typing in your passcode on your desktop computer, consider disabling biometrics on your desktop and using a passcode to unlock the device. You can always continue using biometric features like Touch ID on your laptop with other services after the device is unlocked.\n\nOnce investigators unlocked her workplace laptop, they took photos and audio recordings of the conversations in the laptop’s Signal application.\n\nThis also brings up the challenging question of when to use Signal for Desktop. Signal for Desktop is convenient — I use it every day. But Signal is only as secure as your devices.\n\nIt first needs to be installed on your mobile device, which comes with its own risk of being infected with malware that could compromise your messages.\n\nIf you link your Signal account to your desktop, you are introducing even more risk. That’s a choice you’ll have to make.\n\nRegardless, you need to keep your Signal app up to date, along with every device using Signal, to ensure you’re receiving the newest security patches.\n\nLikewise, there are situations where journalists may need to retain their messages, but not all messages need to live on your device indefinitely.\n\nWhen possible, reporters may want to enable Signal’s disappearing messages to minimize the risk of your messages being read if someone snatches your phone, or simply in case of loss or theft. Read our guide to locking down Signal to learn how to set it up.\n\nIt appears data on the reporter’s iPhone could not be extracted using forensic devices, at least in part because Apple’s Lockdown Mode was enabled.\n\nWhat’s Lockdown Mode, you ask? It’s an optional feature built into Apple devices that allows you to harden your device by disabling some features, such as certain forms of message attachments.\n\nImportantly, when your iPhone is locked, it also disables connections from accessories, such as USB devices. Many forensic devices plug directly into your phone in order to connect, and this means they appear to have a tougher time connecting when Lockdown Mode is enabled.\n\nIf you feel at risk, consider trying out Lockdown Mode, or if you have an Android phone, enable Advanced Protection. Disabling some technologies to harden your device may affect how your phone works slightly. But you may appreciate the added assurance.\n\nResearch from forensic companies like Cellebrite shows that they have a tougher time breaking into newer and up-to-date phones. So while you’re at it, download your updates as soon as you can. Read more about mobile device safety.\n\nWe understand that investigators seized multiple devices, including an audio recorder and an external hard drive.\n\nUsually, there is no straightforward way to encrypt certain devices, such as dedicated cameras and recording devices. However, you can off-load information from these devices immediately to a device that you can encrypt, such as your computer.\n\nYou can encrypt your computer’s drive by enabling FileVault for Macs, and BitLocker for Windows Pro’s Enterprise and Education editions. On Linux, you can encrypt your device with LUKS. A modern, up-to-date iPhone or Android device will be encrypted by default by simply having a passcode.\n\nNote that disk encryption is fully enabled until you type in your passcode to decrypt the device. The easiest way to enable disk encryption is therefore to simply power down your device.\n\nThis raid was extraordinary, but the things we can do to protect the data on our devices are not, and may apply to more routine security issues, like the potential for loss or theft. Take some time to learn about things you can do to protect your device by reading our guide to mobile maintenance. And journalists can always reach out to our digital security team for assistance.",

CGIT 1.3 is the first new release in six years and comes with a lot of changes.\r\nFor those not needing to manage pull requests or other features from your Git web interface but simply needing a web-based viewer for reading Git repositories, CGIT remains one of the best options around. CGIT is lightweight, doesn't depend upon JavaScript and is very efficient in being written in C, and also powers the likes of git.kernel.org.\r\nWith CGIT 1.3 there are many bug fixes, updating against the latest Git 2.53 functionality, updates to the CSS styling for CGIT, and also the very first (optional) JavaScript based functionality. JavaScript is being used for CGIT's dynamic aging feature. The JavaScript feature is to dynamically update the \"ages\" of GIt commits and the like on client side. So not too scary and no fundamental loss if blocking JavaScript in your browser.\r\nMore details on CGIT 1.3 can be found via the mailing list release announcement.\n\n 5 Comments",

    "fullText": "\"What an interesting Black History month this has turned out to be,\" Instagram user Danny Price captioned the post revealing the offensive alert.\n\nGoogle is apologizing after publishing a news alert about Sunday's BAFTA Awards racial slur incident, with the N-word written out.\n\nA screenshot of the notification was shared online by Instagram user Danny Price, who shared several photos to his page. The alert linked out to an article by The Hollywood Reporter, which had the headline: \"How the Tourette's Fallout Unfolded at the BAFTA Film Awards.\" The notification then invited readers to \"see more on [the N-word].\"\n\nAlongside the several slides showing the Google alert, Price wrote that the occurrence was \"absolutely f---ed.\"\n\n\"What an interesting Black History month this has turned out to be,\" Price added in the caption of his post.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Entertainment Weekly: \"We're deeply sorry for this mistake. We've removed the offensive notification and are working to prevent this from happening again.\"\n\nThe tech giant told EW that the \"system error did not involve AI\" and was a case of safety filters not catching an error, adding, \"This was a mistake that shouldn't have happened. We're working on improved guardrails for our push notification systems, which are designed to accurately characterize content from across the web.\"\n\nThe tech company shared that its systems recognized \"a euphemism for an offensive term\" on several web pages, and \"accidentally\" used the offensive term in the notification text. \"We caught the mistake quickly, and immediately removed it from people's devices,\" the company added. \"Only a very small subset of Google app users who get push notifications received it. This system error did not involve AI. Our safety filters did not properly trigger, which is what caused this.\"\n\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\nThe upset follows a bevy of reactions in the aftermath of Tourette syndrome activist John Davidson — who attended the BAFTAs in honor of I Swear, a film about his experience living with Tourette's — shouting the N-word when Sinners stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented the Best Visual Effects award to Avatar: Fire and Ash. Afterwards, the show continued on, and host Alan Cumming addressed the incident with a brief statement.\n\nSinners' production designer and nominee Hannah Beachler alleged on X that she had also had a racial slur directed at her, and criticized what she called a \"throw away\" apology from the BAFTAs.\n\nBeachler also alleged that she heard Davidson use the word for a \"third time\" directed \"at a Black woman\" at the event.\n\nMany have called out the BBC for its handling of the situation, considering the broadcast aired this moment unaltered on BBC One with a two-hour delay. BBC typically airs the ceremony with alterations and indeed made edits, but this moment went untouched.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Warner Bros. raised immediate concerns after the incident on Sunday and requested that the incident be removed from the BBC broadcast within minutes. A source told Deadline that the studio received assurances that its concerns would be passed to the BBC and producer Penny Lane TV during the recording of the ceremony.\n\nLindo even claimed that nobody from the British Academy of Film and Television approached him or Jordan to offer an apology or acknowledge the incident directly after. While speaking to Vanity Fair at a Warner Brothers' after-party, Lindo said that he and Jordan \"did what we had to do\" when they were on stage, but added that he wishes \"someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, BBC removed the show from its streaming platform, iPlayer, and announced plans to re-edit and cut this moment.\n\nThe British Academy of Film and Television also took \"full responsibility\" for the incident in a statement shared with EW, which read, \"We take the duty of care to all our guests very seriously and start from a position of inclusion. \"\n\nThe British Academy went on to \"apologize unreservedly\" to Jordan and Lindo, thanking them for \"their incredible dignity and professionalism.\"\n\nIt concluded, \"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologize to all. We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\"\n\nDavidson addressed the incident on Monday, sharing a statement that reiterated that his verbal tics and uncontrollable swearing, which are symptoms of Tourette's, are involuntary. He stated that he is and always has been \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I have spent my life trying to support and empower the Tourette’s community and to teach empathy, kindness and understanding from others and I will continue to do so.\"\n\nDavidson additionally noted that he \"chose to leave the auditorium early\" of his own volition in acknowledgement of \"the distress my tics were causing.\"\n\nEW has reached out to representatives for Davidson, Cumming, Jordan, and Lindo for comment.",

    "title": "Anthropic Drops Flagship Safety Pledge",
    "description": "In an abrupt shift, the company may release future AI models without ironclad safety guarantees",
    "fullText": "Anthropic, the wildly successful AI company that has cast itself as the most safety-conscious of the top research labs, is dropping the central pledge of its flagship safety policy, company officials tell TIME.\n\nIn 2023, Anthropic committed to never train an AI system unless it could guarantee in advance that the company’s safety measures were adequate. For years, its leaders touted that promise—the central pillar of their Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)—as evidence that they are a responsible company that would withstand market incentives to rush to develop a potentially dangerous technology.\n\nBut in recent months the company decided to radically overhaul the RSP. That decision included scrapping the promise to not release AI models if Anthropic can’t guarantee proper risk mitigations in advance.\n\n“We felt that it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models,” Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan told TIME in an exclusive interview. “We didn't really feel, with the rapid advance of AI, that it made sense for us to make unilateral commitments … if competitors are blazing ahead.”\n\nThe new version of the policy, which TIME reviewed, includes commitments to be more transparent about the safety risks of AI, including making additional disclosures about how Anthropic’s own models fare in safety testing. It commits to matching or surpassing the safety efforts of competitors. And it promises to “delay” Anthropic’s AI development if leaders both consider Anthropic to be leader of the AI race and think the risks of catastrophe to be significant.\n\nBut overall, the change to the RSP leaves Anthropic far less constrained by its own safety policies, which previously categorically barred it from training models above a certain level if appropriate safety measures weren’t already in place.\n\nThe change comes as Anthropic, previously considered to be behind OpenAI in the AI race, rides the high of a string of technological and commercial successes. Its Claude models, especially the software-writing tool Claude Code, have won legions of devoted fans. In February, Anthropic raised $30 billion in new investments, valuing it at some $380 billion, and reported that its annualized revenue was growing at a rate of 10x per year. The company’s core business model of selling direct to businesses is seen by many investors as more credible than OpenAI’s main strategy of monetizing a vast consumer user base.\n\nKaplan, the Anthropic executive and co-founder, denied the company’s decision to change course was a capitulation to market incentives as the race for superintelligence accelerates. He framed it instead as a pragmatic response to emerging political and scientific realities. “I don’t think we’re making any kind of U-turn,” Kaplan says.\n\nWhen Anthropic introduced the RSP in 2023, Kaplan says, the company hoped it would encourage rivals to adopt similar measures. (No rivals made quite as overt a promise to pause AI development, but many published lengthy reports detailing their plans to mitigate risk, which Kaplan chalks up as Anthropic exerting a good influence on the industry.) Executives also hoped the approach might eventually serve as a blueprint for binding national regulations or even international treaties, Kaplan claims.\n\nBut those regulations never materialized. Instead, the Trump Administration has endorsed a let-it-rip attitude to AI development, even going so far as to attempt to nullify state regulations. No federal AI law is on the horizon. And while a global governance framework may have seemed possible in 2023, three years later it has become clear that door has closed. Meanwhile, competition for AI supremacy—between companies but also between nations—has only intensified.\n\nTo make matters worse, the science of AI evaluations has proven more complicated than Anthropic expected when it first crafted the RSP. The arrival of powerful new models meant that, in 2025, Anthropic announced it could not rule out the possibility of these models facilitating a bio-terrorist attack. But while they couldn’t rule it out, they also lacked strong scientific evidence that models did pose that kind of danger, which made it difficult to convince governments and rivals of what they saw as the need to act carefully. What the company had previously imagined might look like a bright red line was instead coming into focus as a fuzzy gradient.\n\nFor nearly a year, Anthropic executives discussed ways to reshape their flagship safety policy to match this new environment, Kaplan says. One point they kept coming back to was their founding premise: the idea that to do proper AI safety research, they had to build models at the frontier of capability—even though doing so might accelerate the arrival of the dangers they feared.\n\nIn February, according to Kaplan, Amodei decided that keeping the company from training new models while competitors raced ahead would be helpful to nobody. “If one AI developer paused development to implement safety measures while others moved forward training and deploying AI systems without strong mitigations, that could result in a world that is less safe,” the new version of the RSP, approved unanimously by Amodei and Anthropic’s board, states in its introduction. “The developers with the weakest protections would set the pace, and responsible developers would lose their ability to do safety research.”\n\nChris Painter, the director of policy at METR, a nonprofit focused on evaluating AI models for risky behavior, reviewed an early draft of the policy with Anthropic’s permission. He says the change is understandable — but also a bearish signal for the world’s ability to navigate potential AI catastrophes. The change to the RSP shows Anthropic “believes it needs to shift into triage mode with its safety plans, because methods to assess and mitigate risk are not keeping up with the pace of capabilities,” Painter tells TIME. “This is more evidence that society is not prepared for the potential catastrophic risks posed by AI.”\n\nAnthropic argues the retooled RSP is designed to keep the biggest benefits of the old one. For example, by constraining itself from releasing new models, Anthropic’s original RSP also incentivized it to quickly build safety mitigations. (Because otherwise the company would be unable to sell its AI to customers.) Anthropic says it believes it can maintain that incentive. The new policy commits the company to regularly release what it calls “Frontier Safety Roadmaps”: documents laying out a list of detailed goals for future safety measures it hopes to build.\n\n“We hope to create a forcing function for work that would otherwise be challenging to appropriately prioritize and resource, as it requires collaboration (and in some cases sacrifices) from multiple parts of the company and can be at cross-purposes with immediate competitive and commercial priorities,” the new RSP states.\n\nAnthropic says it will also commit to publishing so-called “Risk Reports” every three to six months. The reports, the company says, will “explain how capabilities, threat models (the specific ways that models might pose threats), and active risk mitigations fit together, and provide an assessment of the overall level of risk.” These documents will be more in-depth than the reports the company already publishes, a spokesperson tells TIME.\n\n“I like the emphasis on transparent risk reporting and publicly verifiable safety roadmaps,” says Painter, the METR policy official. But he said he was “concerned” that moving away from binary thresholds under the previous RSP, by which the arrival of a certain capability could act as a tripwire to temporarily halt Anthropic’s AI development, might enable a “frog-boiling” effect, where danger slowly ramps up without a single moment that sets off alarms.\n\nAsked whether Anthropic was caving to market pressure, Kaplan argued that, in fact, Anthropic was making a renewed commitment to developing AI safely. “If all of our competitors are transparently doing the right thing when it comes to catastrophic risk, we are committed to doing as well or better,” he said. “But we don't think it makes sense for us to stop engaging with AI research, AI safety, and most likely lose relevance as an innovator who understands the frontier of the technology, in a scenario where others are going ahead and we're not actually contributing any additional risk to the ecosystem.”",

    "description": "I tested bralettes for large busts to find the styles that deliver real support and feel comfortable under everyday outfits.",
    "fullText": "These days, if a bra isn't comfortable, I'm simply not wearing it. Somewhere in my 30s, the calculus shifted — the lift and structure I once prioritized began to take a backseat to softness and ease. The underwire styles that used to feel essential now sit untouched, while stretchy bralettes have taken over my drawer.\n\nOf course, making that switch isn't as simple when you wear a DD cup. Underwire exists for a reason, and most bralettes aren't engineered to do the same level of support. I've tried plenty that looked promising but didn't hold up past the first hour.\n\nOver time, though, I've figured out what actually works. The bralettes worth buying share a few key traits: a wide, supportive band; adjustable straps; cups cut deep enough to avoid spillover; and fabric with real structure, not just stretch. When those details are right, you get something rare — a bra that feels barely there but still does its job.\n\nFor more of our recommendations for folks with larger chests, see our articles on the best swimsuits for large busts.\n\nThis bralette has it all: adjustable straps, a smoothing back, and even a bonded cradle for maximum support without the wires. I can convert the straps to a criss-cross back, making it versatile enough to wear with a range of tops and dresses, and I really appreciate that it has an adjustable band — something that a lot of bralettes are lacking.\n\nTo be honest, there's not much I don't like about this bralette. It even features removable cups for occasions when I need a little extra coverage — and the mesh and lace detailing add some unexpected sex appeal.\n\n\"The bonded underband lifts the bust without the wires for a perky loo, and the rounded shape makes this a great non-wired t-shirt bra,\" says Katie Weir, the bra fitting expert and founder of Curvy Kate.\n\nSee more of our favorite Honeylove products and hear more about the Crossover bra in our Honeylove review.\n\nI bought this bralette on a whim when I was looking for comfy underthings to sleep in — and I'm so glad I did. In fact, I ended up ordering it in several more colors — and luckily, there are a whopping 21 options to choose from. It's lightweight, seamless, incredibly stretchy, and my go-to for lazy Sundays and Friday nights in.\n\nThis bralette boasts a barely there feel, making it ideal for warmer months since. That said, it is worth noting that because the fabric is so thin and there's no padding, you may want to use nipple covers if you wear it out. (Or don't, you do you!)\n\nI also appreciate that the straps are adjustable on this one. Since the band isn't adjustable, however, make sure you size down if you're between two sizes to make sure you get adequate support.\n\nExecutive Editor Sally Kaplan is deeply passionate about Evelyn & Bobbie's smoothing bralettes. We've featured the V-neck Evelyn Bra above, but she loves the whole collection — the Bobbie scoop-neck, the Beyond bra  and the Defy bra.\n\n\"Evelyn & Bobbie's wireless bras are legitimately the most comfortable I've ever worn. They're supportive, structured, not too constrictive, and they actively take weight off my shoulders,\" says Sally. To hear her full thoughts, see our Evelyn & Bobbie review.\n\nThe comfort of the bralettes is down to a support feature called the \"EB Core,\" which is a patented technology that helps keep the bra's shape while preventing \"pancaking.\" The bralettes also have thicker straps that help with weight distribution.\n\nThe Evelyn Bra, in particular, is fantastic for wearing under lower-cut tops because of the V-neck design. It's smoothing on your back while giving your breasts a lift that doesn't sacrifice comfort.\n\nDespite the fact that this bralette has no cups, underwire, padding, or foam, it offers remarkable lift and separation. Best of all, it's available up to size 6XL, so it accommodates larger band sizes.\n\n\"I love the wide back band, and the fact that [larger sizes] have a higher center gore in front to ensure less spillage,\" says Weir.\n\nThe v-neckline gives this bralette some extra points in the versatility department, and the front-adjusting straps make finding your perfect fit so much easier. Did I mention that the fabric feels as soft as silk?\n\nBuying a bralette in alpha sizing is almost impossible if you have larger breasts. The band is always too tight or too loose, and the cups can create an unflattering squishing effect.\n\nThis bralette solves those issues by offering two cup sizes specifically for those with larger breasts: D/E and F/G. In addition, the pieces come in band sizes from 30 to 42.\n\nThe Cup-Sized Lace Bralette also has convertible straps and, unlike most bralettes, a hook-and-eye closure at the back. This means that you can keep using the piece even as the elastic stretches over time.\n\nIf you're looking for a bralette that's anything but basic, your search is over. This gorgeous little number proves that lingerie doesn't have to be uncomfortable: it's wireless, has plenty of stretch, and offers plenty of support thanks to the longline cut and wide straps.\n\nThis is a great option for larger busts because both the straps and the band are adjustable, making it easier to achieve the perfect fit. Admittedly, it can take some time to fasten all the hook and eye closures in the back, but I like that there are three rows so I can tighten or loosen the band as needed.\n\nIt's the details, though, that really make this bralette stand out — like the scalloped edge tricolor lace and multi-dimensional floral design.\n\nLike so many other SKIMS bralettes, this one is made with buttery soft fabric that's so comfortable you might even forget you're wearing it. I love that it comes in such a wide range of neutrals to accommodate every skin tone, and since it's so lightweight and breathable, you won't have to worry much about that dreaded underboob sweat.\n\nThe only caveat is that you can't adjust the band, and as many reviewers noted, it does run a little small.\n\nAs someone with a 32DD bra size, it's supremely difficult to find bralettes that fit just right because most of them don't cup in band/cup sizes. If I buy a size small, the band fits perfectly but I'm spilling out of the cups. If I buy a medium, the cups fit fine but the band is way too big to offer adequate support. So, I was thrilled when I discovered that every size in this bralette (XXS-XXL) comes in a D/DD cup size option.\n\nBut that's not all there is to love about this bra: it feels super soft against the skin, has adjustable straps, and features a four-row hook and eye closure for max adjustability. Not only that, but the floating cups are designed to mold to your unique bust size and shape.\n\nAnd apparently, I'm not the only one who's a big fan — because this best-selling bralette has garnered hundreds of five-star reviews.\n\nParfait is a lingerie line that specializes in accommodating larger bust sizes — I've owned several of their bras, and the quality speaks for itself: all of them have lasted at least a couple of years.\n\nKaitlin Vachon, a bra fitting expert and founder of Bra Emporium, says this is one of her favorite bralettes for large busts in part because it's available in traditional cup and band sizes. She also notes that the wide band and thick adjustable straps offer ample support, and it's super size-inclusive — in fact, it's available up to a size 42K.\n\nWhile it doesn't have any underwire in the cups, it does feature some side boning for a bit more structure than many other bralettes. Another perk? It can easily be converted into a racerback style, thanks to the J-hook in the back.\n\nI've been enamored with Negative Underwear for a while now — not only because of the minimalist designs, but also because of the brand's focus on sustainability: they only use high-quality fabrics that are free of harmful chemicals, and sourced from OEKO-TEX certified mills.\n\nThe Sieve Non-Wire is arguably the line's most supportive bralette, thanks in part to the Belgian micromesh that holds you up like a firm hug. In her Negative Underwear review, Insider Reviews Executive Editor Sally Kaplan raved about this one.\n\n\"Bralettes like these are really hard to get right for larger chest sizes, but this one worked incredibly well for my DDs (which are sometimes DDDs depending on the time of the month),\" she said. \"Of all the bralettes I've tested in my many years covering women's basics for Insider Reviews, this is my favorite. It lifts them up without separating too much or squishing together — plus, it's the perfect silhouette for V-neck sweaters or shirts.\"\n\nDid you know that a majority of a bra's support comes from the band? I learned this during a bra fitting years ago, and it really stuck with me — I'd always assumed it was the straps or the cups that were holding my girls up. That's what made this Bombas bralette stick out for me: the ribbed band is wider than most, lending ample support and lift without the wires. In fact, it can accommodate up to an F cup size. It's also thoughtfully designed with a tighter knit in the center and around the sides for added support.\n\nI often wear this bra to sleep because the fabric is super stretchy, seamless, and breathable — but it's also great for lounging around the house or running casual errands. Note that this bralette will feel pretty snug when you first put it on, but it stretches out a teeny bit with time.\n\nYes — but with caveats. Traditional bralettes are designed for light support, so not all styles work well for fuller busts. The best options for larger busts include wide bands, structured cups, and supportive fabrics that combine comfort with reliable hold — especially for everyday wear.\n\nA well-fitting bralette should feel snug around the band without squeezing, and your breasts should feel supported without bulging out of the top or sides. If the band rides up or the straps dig in, it's probably not the right fit.\n\nMost bralettes won't replace a proper sports bra for high-impact workouts. However, some structured bralette styles with strong bands and supportive fabrics can work for low-impact activities like yoga or walking. For running or HIIT, stick with a dedicated sports bra.",

    "description": "The AI boom could bring us amazing discoveries — and massive unemployment. Both scenarios are worth taking seriously.",
    "fullText": "You know all that money and effort everyone's putting into AI because they're convinced it's a technology that will change everything? What if they're right?\n\nThat's a kind of fair summary of a Substack post that went viral over the weekend, and then turned into a Wall Street phenomenon Monday, when lots of tech stocks lost value because of AI fears.\n\nI say \"kind of fair\" because the \"what if\" post, published by Citrini Research, isn't just a \"what if\" post, but a \"if it happens, we're in big trouble\" post.\n\nAnd now the blowback: AI boosters are calling the Citrini post \"AI doomerism\" and are poking at some of its doomsday scenarios.\n\nI'm not here to argue whether any of Citrini's individual points are reasonable — I have no idea how AI will affect the likes of, say, DoorDash.\n\nBut this also seems like a forest/trees issue. Maybe the details are wrong, but the big picture should be a sobering one: If the AI future we are being promised comes to pass, it could have a massive effect on our economy, and part of that effect could be meaningful unemployment.\n\nBecause that's not just a wild-eyed anti-AI thesis, but one that's core to the pro-AI thesis, too. It's what accounts for the enormous investments tech companies are making in AI, and the crazy valuations we're seeing for the likes of Anthropic ($380 billion) and OpenAI ($850 billion).\n\nIn short: The only way those companies are going to be worth anything close to those numbers* is if they end up having a massive impact. Yes, some of the value may be justified by amazing innovation AI could unlock, like wonder-drugs that get discovered in a fraction of the time. But a lot of the value will come from the fact that AI will let computers do lots of work humans do now.\n\nYou can't have the upside without the downside. Full stop.\n\nIt's easy to imagine all the ways this ripples through our economy. And every couple weeks or so, we get a new impetus to fire up our imaginations. Right now, for instance, the market is trying to get its head around the notion that AI might dramatically cut into the enterprise software industry, which is why we saw companies like IBM plummet on Monday. But you can do the same exercise for all kinds of work, in all kinds of industries: Lawyers. Consultants. Screenwriters. Truckers. Etc.\n\nNor do you have to be an AI \"doomer\" to think this way — it's baked into the pitch of the biggest AI companies. \"There are cases where entire classes of jobs will go away,\" OpenAI's Sam Altman said last year. His rival, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, is blunter and more pessimistic, predicting that AI will wipe out half of entry-level white collar jobs and send unemployment skyrocketing.\n\nIt is a little weird to see Wall Street whip-sawing as it thinks through how all of this might go. On Tuesday, tech stocks gained again, presumably because investors have now decided they overreacted on Monday. But I won't be surprised to see the markets lurch again down the line when someone else makes a convincing case that computers will disrupt a different industry.\n\nMaybe Citrini is wrong about DoorDash and right about lawyers. Maybe it's the other way around. But the general shape of the problem stays the same: The more AI lives up to the hype, the more it will affect the way people work — or if they work at all. You can be optimistic about that prospect, or terrified. But you can't ignore it.\n\n*Bear in mind these are private companies, which someday expect to be worth much more when they go public.",

    "description": "The State of the Union is not often a market-moving event, but Trump could address two key issues that have impacted markets during his speech.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump will deliver the first official State of the Union address of his term on Tuesday, and there are a few things investors should be listening for that could move markets.\n\nThe State of the Union isn't typically a market-moving event, but uncertainty around Trump's tariff regime following the Supreme Court's ruling and ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran mean investors are looking for signals of what's next from the president.\n\n\"This is usually a non-market-moving event and shouldn't cause a ripple effect on Wall St., with the speech telegraphed with little surprise or fanfare. However, the one constant under President Trump is that we can predict the unpredictable,\" Freedom Capital Markets chief market strategist Jay Woods said ahead of Tuesday evening's address.\n\nThe remarks are expected to be highly watched, with a poll from Scripps News/Talker Research finding that two-thirds of Americans see this State of the Union address as more important than previous years.\n\nHere is what investors should be keeping on their radar during Trump's speech.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that the majority of Trump's tariffs are illegal, finding that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act doesn't justify the import duties.\n\nTrump doubled down, lifting global tariffs to 15% using alternative frameworks to justify his trade war.\n\nLegal battles around tariffs are expected to continue, leaving investors without a clear picture of what's to come. In particular, the fight over tariff rebates for companies may just be getting started.\n\nAny comments from Trump about his trade plans could reshape Wall Street's expectations and move stocks.\n\n\"In his speech, we might learn more of his intent to continue to levy tariffs despite the SCOTUS decision,\" Woods said, adding that these comments could impact markets.\n\nOil prices have been volatile amid tensions between the US and Iran.\n\nWoods says that if Trump were to indicate an escalation of war against Iran, it could move markets.\n\nThe US has been building up its military presence in the Middle East. Updates from Trump about the US presence in Iran could add to volatility in the oil market, putting pressure on a key input for inflation.\n\nIt might be less of a market-moving update than tariffs or military action against Iran, but Trump is also expected to harp on the economy and his push to make life more affordable for everyday Americans.\n\nThe US economy has avoided what many feared would be the worst-case scenario under some of his policies, but worries persist.\n\nAlmost half of Americans are most interested in what Trump says about the economy, the Scripps News/Talker Research poll showed.\n\nComments from Trump about the economy could impact investor perception on inflation and the labor market, which could change expectations for the timing of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.",

Filtering rage, removing vanity metrics and translating sensationalism into calm, factual language. Preserving signal and eliminating noise,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I never want to see the raw feed.

He spends around $2 million a year to do so, focusing on extreme treatments such as plasma therapy alongside his strict diet and exercise routine.\n\nHis wish for an AI social media buffer also ties into his quest for a longer life, he says: \"I want social media to become a longevity intervention, not a longevity threat.\"",

    "description": "Nvidia's results come as investors deal with a bout of AI anxiety. Analysts say the chip giant must handily beat earnings and guidance estimates.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia earnings reports tend to be market-moving events, and the company's report on Wednesday could be particularly momentous as Wall Street goes through a bout of AI anxiety.\n\nWith AI spending from hyperscalers increasingly under scrutiny, any waning in demand for Nvidia's products could signal a slowdown of the AI boom, which investors have bet big on over the last few years.\n\nThe AI trade is also generally under close watch at the moment, as Anthropic's Claude AI disrupts industries and reorders the list of stock winners and losers.\n\n\"Nvidia remains central to the AI narrative. We see hyperscaler capex as the clearest real-time indicator of AI demand,\" said Lauren Goodwin, the chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, in an email on Tuesday. \"As long as companies continue to deploy capital aggressively into AI infrastructure, we do not see evidence of a rollover in this theme. The foundational layer of AI remains supply-constrained.\"\n\nWall Street is expecting the chip giant to deliver $65.91 billion of revenue, with $60 billion of that coming from its all-important data center business.\n\nAs the market heads toward the blockbuster report on Wednesday afternoon, here's what analysts say to keep an eye out for.\n\nDan Ives, the bullish Wedbush tech analyst, said he expects Nvidia to handily beat earnings estimates.\n\nBut perhaps above all else, investors will be paying attention to CEO Jensen Huang's tone and outlook for chip demand going forward.\n\n\"There is one company that is the foundation for the AI Revolution and that is Nvidia with the Godfather of AI Jensen having the best perch and vantage point to discuss overall enterprise AI demand and the appetite for Nvidia's AI chips looking forward,\" Ives wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley's analyst covering Nvidia, says he would buy the stock heading into earnings on Wednesday, as his contacts in the industry continue to sound optimistic about the company.\n\nMoore has a $250 a share price target on the stock, implying 29% upside.\n\nIn the weeks following the report, Moore said to keep an eye on Jensen Huang's appearances at Morgan Stanley's TMT conference and a GTC developer event \n\nAnthony Saglimbene, the chief market strategist at Ameriprise, said to keep an eye out for updates on how successfully Nvidia is ramping up production of its new Rubin model.\n\n\"Execution on next-generation platforms, like Rubin, needs to give investors confidence that the company is on track with deployment schedules and that lead times are manageable.\"\n\nHe added that the firm needs to demonstrate that \"it can continue to successfully manage an industrial-scale manufacturing ramp not often seen in history.\"\n\nJoe Mazzola, the head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, said to watch for heightened investor scrutiny on the firm's profit margins as their production costs grow.\n\n\"Though AI spending shows little sign of easing, Nvidia and fellow chip firms face higher bandwidth memory costs amid sector shortages, and this could affect projected margin growth,\" Mazzola said in an email on Tuesday.\n\nOn the revenue front, he said that data centers will be the most important driver to watch, and guidance must also beat the average forecast.\n\n\"Nvidia remains under pressure every quarter not to just exceed quarterly consensus, but to guide for growth exceeding analysts' average estimates.\"\n\nSimilar to Ives, Luke Rahbari, a co-Portfolio Manager for The Rational Equity Armor Fund, said forward guidance is going to be the most important thing to watch. Any hint of negativity could mean trouble for the stock and the rest of the AI trade.\n\n\"They're going to have to say that they're seeing year-to-year growth, and that number has to be healthy. It doesn't have to be as healthy as how it's been growing here, but staying steady and growing at that year-to-year clip is what's going to be important,\" Rahbari wrote. \"If they mention any type of slowdown, if they say that year-to-year growth is going to be significantly lower, or if they pull back on investing in some of their own customers, that's going to signal that demand for the chips is lower.\"",

    "description": "Elon Musk's AI startup alleged in the lawsuit that Sam Altman's OpenAI recruited former xAI employees to steal trade secrets.",
    "fullText": "A California federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk's AI startup xAI, accusing OpenAI of poaching staff to steal trade secrets.\n\nIn a ruling released on Tuesday, US District Judge Rita Lin sided with a request to dismiss the case filed by the Sam Altman-led AI company behind ChatGPT, citing the lack of evidence against it.\n\n\"Notably absent are allegations about the conduct of OpenAI itself,\" Lin wrote in her order. \"xAI does not allege any facts indicating that OpenAI induced xAI's former employees to steal xAI's trade secrets or that these former xAI employees used any stolen trade secrets once employed by OpenAI.\"\n\nInstead of pointing to \"misconduct\" by OpenAI, xAI cited \"eight former xAI employees who left for OpenAI at around the same time,\" the judge said.\n\nLin gave xAI until March 17 to file an amended complaint \"correcting the deficiencies\" outlined in her order — giving Musk's company a chance to try again.\n\nThe ruling is the latest in an escalating feud between tech billionaires Musk and Altman.\n\nLast year, xAI sued Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of monopolistic behavior. Musk has also separately sued Altman and OpenAI — the company the two men cofounded in 2015 — over claims that it betrayed its nonprofit mission by shifting into a for-profit structure. OpenAI countersued, accusing Musk of a \"years-long campaign of harassment.\" That case is scheduled to go to trial in April.\n\nIn a statement in social media platform X, OpenAI said it welcomed the court's decision and called the lawsuit \"yet another front in Mr. Musk's ongoing campaign of harassment.\" Lawyers for x.AI didn't immediately return Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nIn the lawsuit that was dismissed on Tuesday, Musk's company alleged that OpenAI engaged in a \"deeply troubling pattern\" of recruiting former xAI employees to gain access to confidential information related to Grok, xAI's flagship chatbot.\n\nIn an amended complaint filed last year, xAI accused rival OpenAI of violating California and federal law by \"inducing\" several ex-employees to \"steal and share xAI's trade secrets.\"\n\n\"Threatened by xAI's innovations, OpenAI is not merely soliciting or hiring a competitor's employees,\" the lawsuit said. \"OpenAI is waging a coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign: OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI's key technologies and business plans.\"\n\nThe complaint alleged that, in just a few months, OpenAI poached at least eight xAI employees, including early xAI engineer Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive. Two former employees, the lawsuit said, have admitted to stealing xAI's trade secrets.\n\nAltman's OpenAI has denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit the \"latest chapter\" in Musk's \"ongoing harassment\" against the company.\n\nIn OpenAI's motion to dismiss the complaint, the company alleged that Musk and xAI have \"lobbed baseless claims of trade secret misappropriation\" to \"intimidate current and former xAI employees from working at their place of choice.\"\n\n\"XAI's federal trade secret misappropriation claim fails as a matter of law,\" OpenAI's attorneys argued in the motion. \"Remarkably, xAI never alleges that OpenAI actually acquired or disclosed xAI's trade secrets.\"",

    "description": "\"We're deeply sorry for this mistake,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement.",
    "fullText": "Google apologized on Tuesday for a news alert about a controversial moment at the British Academy Film Awards that contained the unedited N-word.\n\n\"We're deeply sorry for this mistake,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We've removed the offensive notification and are working to prevent this from happening again.\"\n\nThe now-deleted news alert previewed a story about Sunday's BAFTA awards, where an attendee with Tourette syndrome shouted the N-word while \"Sinners\" stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo — both of whom are Black — were on stage to present an award.\n\nDeadline.com initially reported that AI was to blame for the racial slur appearing in the push alert. Google said that was not the case, and Deadline has since clarified its report.\n\nGoogle said it caught the mistake quickly and only a \"small subset of users\" received the alert with the unedited racial slur. The search giant said that its push alert systems recognized a euphemism for the slur used in stories and incorrectly inserted the full word.\n\n\"This system error did not involve AI,\" Google said. \"Our safety filters did not properly trigger, which is what caused this.\"\n\nTourette syndrome advocate John Davidson, whose life story served as the inspiration for the BAFTA-nominated film \"I Swear,\" later said in a statement that he was \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning.\"\n\nAccording to the Tourette Association of America, roughly 10% of the millions of people living with Tourette and tic disorders experience coprolalia, which is \"the involuntary vocalization of obscene or socially inappropriate words or phrases.\"\n\n\"Importantly, these vocal tics are not reflective of the beliefs or values of the person experiencing them,\" the association said in a statement.\n\nThe BBC and the BAFTAs have faced intense criticism for broadcasting the moment, even though the award ceremony was subject to a two-hour tape delay. On Monday, both the BBC and BAFTAs offered separate public apologies for the moment.\n\n\"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologize to all,\" the BAFTAs said in a statement. \"We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\"\n\nKate Phillips, the BBC's chief content officer, said in a note to staff that another racial slur was edited out of the broadcast.\n\n\"We take full responsibility for what happened,\" Phillips wrote on Tuesday in the note, which was provided to Business Insider. \"When I was made aware it was audible on iPlayer, I asked for it to be taken down. As I'm sure you're aware we put out a statement yesterday morning apologising that the remark was not edited out prior to broadcast.\"\n\nDuring the award ceremony, host Alan Cumming made multiple statements about the language the audience might be hearing. Variety reported that \"shut the fuck up\" among other phrases could also be heard during the show.\n\n\"You may have noticed some strong language in the background,\" Cumming told the audience. \"This can be part of how Tourette's syndrome shows up for some people as the film explores that experience.\"",

    "description": "Matthew Breen has been in Puerto Vallarta with his husband and parents since November. They're ending their trip early due to the cartel violence.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Matthew Breen, a 51-year-old podcast producer and talent manager based in New York who's currently in Puerto Vallarta. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm based in New York City most of the year, but for the past couple of winters, I've been coming to Puerto Vallarta with my husband to escape the cold. We rent an apartment year-round in Zona Romántica. My parents eventually decided to winter here, too.\n\nIt started as holiday trips, then gradually grew into staying for a few months at a time. I work remotely as a podcast producer and talent manager.\n\nWe've all loved it for years. I've never felt unsafe until this past weekend, and now we're heading home early.\n\nI've been here this winter since mid-November, and I monitor my parents nearby. They rent an apartment in the same building, just downstairs from us.\n\nFriends who have grown up here said they've seen cartel violence elsewhere, but never in Zona Romántica.\n\nFrom our roof and window, we could see giant plumes of smoke rising a few blocks away. Friends in other parts of town said the explosions were car fuel tanks blowing up.\n\nWe heard from friends, family, and neighbors of two different unrelated acquaintances who were forced out of their cars at gunpoint. The explosions ceased for a while and then resumed early afternoon.\n\nFrom our balcony, we watched a car race down our block with two people on a motorcycle chasing it, a gun aimed at the driver. The car turned the corner and disappeared, the motorcycle close behind, and then we heard a gunshot. We didn't see smoke afterward, so we hoped the car got away.\n\nFrom the same vantage point, we saw five or six guys on motorcycles pull into a mattress store parking lot about 100 feet away. The storefront itself was out of view, but we heard glass shatter, and soon after, huge plumes of black smoke poured from the building. There's nothing left to go inside.\n\nAt around 8:30 Monday morning, people were outside, mostly neighbors talking to each other. We walked the neighborhood and saw one tourist bus still smoldering. There were at least 20 burned-out shells of cars, several burned convenience stores, and a burned hotel around the corner.\n\nThere were a couple of fruit and vegetable stands open and a few smaller local family places, but none of the big chains were open, as far as we could tell. Apart from that, the fires have gone out.\n\nWe haven't heard any more explosions. We've just seen a few military trucks with people in camo and machine guns walking the streets.\n\nMy parents were planning to leave town toward the end of March for the season, and I was going to accompany them and assist with travel. Now we're moving up the dates as soon as possible. I don't feel unsafe here, generally. Sunday was the aberration.\n\nI'll accompany my parents to Denver, then fly home to New York with my husband. We'll monitor what things look like from a distance and come back as soon as we can. Otherwise, we would stay longer. We've been able to rebook the flights we had scheduled for early next week.\n\nThe town is very resilient; we've battled disasters before, like hurricanes. It's important to us locals to patronize companies as they rebuild. It's a wait-and-see kind of thing.\n\nWe're cautious but seeing signs of life in town again, so we feel much better about going out.",

    "title": "I tried Honeylove's internet-famous bras, here's what surprised me",
    "description": "I tested several bras from Honeylove, the shapewear brand behind the viral CrossOver Bra, to see how they fit and feel in real life.",
    "fullText": "Honeylove has shapewear to accommodate every kind of outfit, from smoothing tanks and bodysuits to sculpting shorts and underwear. But without a doubt, the products I've been most excited to test out are the bras. As someone who has a large bust but hates the rigidity of an underwire, I was eager to see if their wireless bras could offer support without sacrificing comfort.\n\nWith that in mind, I tried three of the brand's best-selling items for my Honeylove review: the CrossOver Bra, SoftForm Bra, and Silhouette Bra. I also tested another one of their bestsellers that I'd been seeing all over Instagram: the SuperPower Short.\n\nIf you're looking for more intimates, check out our guides to the best bras and underwear for women.\n\nI found that certain items run a little large in the band, but not quite large enough to advise that you size down completely. I would stick with your usual size, and if you're willing to order an alternative size, try sizing down on the band to see if that works better for you (especially if you tend to be in between band sizes). You can see my thoughts below on the specifics of each style before you decide which ones might work best for you.\n\nBefore trying the Honeylove CrossOver Bra, I had pretty much given up on finding a wireless bra that actually held my chest up. What makes this one work so well is that the straps are fully adjustable all the way from the band to the cup, which allows me to achieve a customized fit. These are key features for me, because most bra straps tend to be far too long on my shoulders, and as a result, fail to provide adequate lift.\n\nAnother advantage of this bra is that it features four rows of hook-and-eye closures, so there's plenty of room to loosen or tighten the band as needed. As someone who's a 32DD, it can be tough to find bras that offer enough coverage but also aren't too loose in the band — and my only concern here is that I'm already wearing it on the tightest hook. That said, it shouldn't be an issue as long as this bra doesn't stretch out too much over time.\n\nThese are just a few reasons why, on my quest for the best bralettes for large busts, this one topped the list.\n\nI'll admit that I was super skeptical about the Honeylove SoftForm bra — mainly because there's no adjustability — but I was pleasantly surprised when I slipped it on. The soft and stretchy microfiber feels like a second skin, and there's just enough firm compression to make me feel secure and supported. I love that it's hardware-free with bonded seams, making it invisible under clothing, and the bonding at the cradle helps to lend a little extra lift.\n\nThe Honeylove SoftForm Bra is a great pick if you're concerned about side or back bulge — thanks to the ample coverage around the back and the thick, compressive fabric, it instantly smooths out any lumps and bumps.\n\nOne thing worth pointing out is that this bra does seem to stretch out a little as you wear it — which is a slight issue since you can't adjust the band or straps. Luckily, though, I did notice that it reverted right back to its original size after washing. This bra also seems to provide less separation than the crossover bra. I certainly wasn't dealing with that dreaded uniboob situation, but I did feel like my bust was pushed inward a bit.\n\nThere are two reasons why I don't usually buy bras with skinny straps. One, they typically aren't supportive enough for my fuller bust. Two, they tend to dig into my shoulders more than wider straps do. So, imagine my shock when this bra — which has extra slender straps — turned out to be my favorite in the Honeylove collection.\n\nMore recently, I learned that the majority of the bra's support actually comes from the band, not the straps. And the main reason why these straps often dig into my shoulders is that I tighten them too much to compensate for the bra's lack of support in the band. Fortunately, the Honeylove Silhouette Bra fits like a glove, and thanks to all the supportive features, I didn't have to tighten the straps so much that they left indentations in my skin.\n\nThe only drawback to this bra is that it has three hook settings on the band as opposed to four (which the Crossover Bra has). Luckily, the bra fit me snugly on the middle hook, meaning I still have room to tighten (or loosen) it as needed.\n\nIt's pretty easy to see why this shapewear piece has garnered thousands of five-star reviews. The SuperPower Short offers waist-to-thigh smoothing, and despite having a high level of compression, they really don't feel restrictive.\n\nIt definitely takes a little shimmying to get the SuperPower Short on, but that's to be expected with shapewear pieces like this. I was able to sit down and move around pretty freely in them, and never felt like I couldn't eat or breathe comfortably. Thanks to the anti-slip silicone strips at the top of the waistband and structured boning down the sides and upper back, I was relieved to find that SuperPower Shorts don't shift around or roll down. Plus, the BoostBands that encircle the upper back of the legs offer a nice, subtle booty-lifting effect.\n\nThe Super PowerShort features a seamless design, and for the most part, they remained undetectable under the variety of dresses, skirts, and jumpsuits I slipped on over them. The only time I saw the waistband show through a little was with a particularly skin-tight dress that's made with ultra-thin fabric.\n\nThe advantage to a shapewear piece like this is that you can wear your own preferred bra with it, making it a little more versatile than a lot of shapewear bodysuits. And since there are strategically placed tabs on both sides of the waistband, you can attach a set of straps for some extra support and staying power. I also really appreciate that there's a slit opening at the gusset so I can pee without having to fully undress.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty impressed with the products I tried from Honeylove. Some of the pieces tend to stretch out somewhat with wear, but I also think that's to be expected with anything that has Spandex in the construction. Fortunately, after washing, they seem to shrink back down again.\n\nThe seamless bras don't show underneath my clothes, and they're so soft and stretchy that I often forget I'm wearing them. Not only that, but they're remarkably supportive considering that they don't have underwire. My favorites are definitely the Silhouette Bra and the CrossOver Bra, both of which are fully adjustable and oh-so-flattering. The SoftForm Bra is nice for lounging around the house, but I personally feel like the other bras offer a little \n\nI can also say with certainty that I'll be using the SuperPower Short under a range of outfits, from fit and flare dresses to pencil skirts. While shapewear is never a necessity, and sometimes I'm more than happy to go without it, I definitely feel a little more confident when I'm wearing this under tighter-fitting garments.\n\nUltimately, what makes Honeylove's pieces stand out is how comfortable they are. As it turns out, beauty isn't pain.\n\nShop all Honeylove bras and shapewear here.\n\nFor bras, Honeylove recommends sizing up if you're in between cup sizes. If you're in between band sizes, it's best to size up if you want a looser and more comfortable fit or size down if you want a more supportive fit.\n\nFor bodysuits, it's best to size down if you're in between sizes since the material is stretchy. They also recommend sizing down if you are petite or if you have a small waist compared to your bust size. The only reason to size up would be if you have notably wider hips.",

    "fullText": "Some US presidents have more of the gift of the gab than others.\n\nThe American Presidency Project has tracked the length of every president's State of the Union address since 1964, with the timer beginning when the president opens with \"Mr. Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker.\"\n\nIn the State of the Union, which is mandated by the Constitution, presidents typically highlight their administration's accomplishments and lay out their legislative agenda in a speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nPresidents usually also introduce their legislative priorities in a joint address during their first year in office, a tradition started by President Ronald Reagan. Though this speech doesn't technically qualify as a State of the Union, it is widely regarded as such and is included in the American Presidency Project's dataset.\n\nOn average, State of the Union speeches from 1964 onwards have lasted 56 minutes and 24 seconds, according to the American Presidency Project. President Richard Nixon gave the shortest-ever State of the Union speech in 1972 at 28 minutes and 55 seconds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and President Bill Clinton have given eight of the top 10 longest State of the Union speeches in history. In 2025, Trump broke Clinton's record when his joint address to Congress clocked in at 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 32 seconds.\n\nIt's a record Trump could break again when he delivers the State of the Union on February 24 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nHere's how the top 10 longest State of the Union addresses stack up.",

    "description": "Mexico is much more than its worst moments, says a travel writer who has made Puerto Vallarta her home base for five years and is itching to go back.",
    "fullText": "After cartel violence erupted across the Mexican state of Jalisco this week, images and videos of burning cars and buildings, shuttered storefronts, and cities grinding to a halt hit the news. Flights into and out of Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara were canceled. Residents were told to shelter in place and to ensure they had enough food and water. Tourists were on lockdown and frightened.\n\nI watched it all from far away in Seattle, where I'm currently traveling, as my phone lit up every 15 seconds with messages of panic, forwarded video footage, and WhatsApp voice notes from friends and loved ones on the ground in Puerto Vallarta.\n\nFor most people, Puerto Vallarta was just one of several cities mentioned in the news cycle, but for me it was different — it's been my chosen home base for the last five years.\n\nMy relationship with this city on Mexico's Pacific coast began more than a decade ago, on my first visit in 2013. At the time, Puerto Vallarta was just another reporting assignment at a beach destination, but something hit differently, and I kept returning. It became the place I ran to whenever I needed a break from real life. Each visit stretched longer. By much of 2024 and 2025, I was there full-time.\n\nWhen you spend that much time in a place, it stops feeling like an escape and becomes the backdrop of real life. You learn the traffic patterns, see familiar faces at the coffee shops and bars, pick up your mail. Routine sneaks up on you; it becomes home.\n\nYou also build relationships. As I watched footage of a still-smoldering flame-licked car skeleton at an intersection just a few blocks from my last address, I listened to voice notes from friends. Fear sounds different when it comes from people you love.\n\nYou don't need to be a seasoned traveler or an adrenaline seeker to feel comfortable there. There are direct flights, large resorts, familiar comforts, and an infrastructure built around welcoming visitors.\n\nPlus, it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous with that broad, blue curve of the Bay of Banderas and the jungle-covered crown of peaks that rise behind it.\n\nFor many Americans, Vallarta has been shorthand for \"safe Mexico.\" Could incidents like this change that perception? Inevitably, for some.\n\nTravel decisions are rarely driven by data alone. They are fueled by emotion, personal tolerance for uncertainty, and individual experience. As happens after virtually every high-profile incident in Mexico, reactions tend to fall into familiar categories. There will be people who write Mexico off forever as a country to visit or live. Others will decide to wait and see.\n\nAnd there will be people, like me, who are already itching to return because they understand something fundamental about moments like this: They're traumatic precisely because they are disruptions, not constants.\n\nViolence in Mexico is real. It's serious. It's also limited to very specific parts of a massive country. Mexico is vast and regionally complex. Episodes of cartel-related violence, while alarming, do not function as a constant across daily life in most destinations Americans visit.\n\nMoments like Sunday's violence highlight a perception gap that often shapes how Americans think about risk abroad versus risk at home. Americans tend to discuss violence in Mexico as though it exists in a fundamentally different category of danger. Yet in recent years, the US has developed its own unsettling familiarity with public acts of violence, mass shootings, random attacks, and sudden disruptions.\n\nThere is no longer a clean psychological divide between \"safe at home\" and \"dangerous abroad.\" We are, increasingly, navigating variations of the same reality.\n\nLiving in Puerto Vallarta has not made me dismissive of safety concerns. What happened across Jalisco is devastating and serious. But living there has grounded my understanding of the city in lived experience rather than episodic headlines. It has made moments like Sunday's violence feel personal without altering my relationship to Puerto Vallarta.\n\nWatching the videos didn't make me want to run further from Vallarta. If anything, it made me wish I were there with the community I love.\n\nSo, when do I plan to return? Soon. I'll be heading back to Mexico in early March, this time to Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, nearly 1,000 miles away from Puerto Vallarta. (Yes, Mexico is really big.) I have no hesitation about going. And, truthfully, if logistics allowed, I would go back to Puerto Vallarta this week. It's not just a vacation destination to me, and it's not just a clip on the news. It is nearly 13 years of memories, friendships, routines, and a sense of home that I have built over time.\n\nLike any place anywhere, Puerto Vallarta and Mexico are larger than their worst moments. Like any place you love, those moments do not erase the steadier, more enduring reality of everyday life that surrounds them.",

    "fullText": "Wayve is revving up its global robotaxi ambitions with fresh funding as it prepares to take on Waymo in London.\n\nThe UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup announced early Tuesday in the UK that it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and major automakers.\n\nThe funding round, which values the startup at $8.6 billion, includes $1.2 billion from investors including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Uber, as well as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis.\n\nIt also includes additional capital from Uber, which is tied to deployments of Wayve-powered robotaxis across the globe. The two companies have a deal to launch self-driving vehicles on Uber's app in over 10 markets worldwide, starting with London this year.\n\n\"We've been learning to drive on British roads for the last eight years, and so this is our home turf,\" Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve, told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nThe CEO said the latest funding round is key to pursuing the company's ambition to license its software to major automakers and robotaxi fleet platforms like Uber.\n\nUnlike Tesla or Waymo, Wayve is solely focused on developing software for other companies looking to deploy self-driving cars. It is not building its own fleet of robotaxis.\n\nKendall said owning a fleet is expensive, and Tesla's approach to building its own car can be a constraint since it limits the company to one vehicle platform.\n\n\"Everyone wants autonomy, but not everyone wants to buy a Tesla,\" he said.\n\nKendall added that Wayve's AI driver is designed to be generalizable — the same way a human can quickly learn to drive different cars and in new cities.\n\nThat allows Wayve's technology to quickly adapt to new driving environments and learn new road rules, from switching to the opposite side of the road to right turns at a red light, without relying on high-definition mapping and sensors, the approach taken by rivals like Waymo. It also allows the AI driver to be adapted by different automakers, which may have different sensor configurations on their cars, such as lidar or cameras.\n\n\"Because that's what we've built, it enables us to take this business model that enables high-margin software revenues,\" Kendall said.\n\nWayve says that over the past year, its fleet of Ford Mach-Es outfitted with its AI driver has driven in more than 500 cities across Europe, North America, and Japan without being trained on city-specific data.\n\nThe company is also planning to license its technology to carmakers as an advanced driver-assistance system like Tesla's Full Self-Driving, which handles most driving tasks with human supervision. Wayve has a deal with Nissan that will see its AI tech power the Japanese carmaker's ProPilot driver assistance system from 2027.\n\nThe UK-based startup has been testing its tech in London since 2017, and its public debut comes as the city's robotaxi scene gets increasingly crowded.\n\nWaymo is aiming to begin operating its autonomous vehicles in London, its first international location, this year, while Wayve vehicles will be joined on the Uber app by robotaxis from Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is also partnering with Lyft.",

    "description": "The HR and finance software company framed the technology as a growth opportunity on its Tuesday earnings call.",
    "fullText": "Workday is betting on artificial intelligence taking over more work.\n\nWhile software stocks — including Workday's — have sunk recently amid concerns over AI advancements, the company framed the technology as a growth opportunity on its Tuesday earnings call.\n\n\"We're working really hard to figure out how do we improve business process execution for our customers at a lower cost,\" CEO Anil Bhusri said.\n\n\"I think that's where the agentic model fits in. What can agents do to replace human labor?\" he said. \"And then obviously longer term, we've got to figure out what we're going to do with those humans that are displaced.\"\n\nBhusri's remarks came after Workday reported revenue and net-income growth for the January-ended quarter. Shares fell around 10%, however, as the company projected slower subscription revenue growth than Wall Street expected for the fiscal year ahead.\n\nA spokesperson for Workday said that Bhusri's comments were not about Workday planning to replace its employees or its customers' employees, but rather about industry-level shifts.\n\nBhusri said the outlook reflects that the AI products Workday is building aren't expected to generate meaningful revenue until later in the year.\n\nWorkday's stock drop marks another setback for the company, whose shares have slid in recent weeks amid a broader software selloff driven by fears that artificial intelligence could upend the industry.\n\nThe rout began in early February, tipping the sector into a deep bear market and spilling into adjacent industries as investors grapple with AI's disruptive potential. Other companies affected include LegalZoom, Thomson Reuters, and Okta.\n\nOn the call, Workday didn't directly address those concerns directly and instead emphasized its investments in agentic products to expand its footprint in HR and finance software.\n\nEarlier this month, Workday said it was laying off about 400 employees, citing a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities. A week later, Bhursi was renamed CEO, succeeding Carl Eschenbach, who stepped down. \n\nBhusri has held the top job three times before. He told analysts on Tuesday's earnings call that while he's optimistic about the business, he tends to set guidance cautiously and aim to outperform it.\n\n\"I don't know if you know you remember me when I was a CEO before, but I do try to be conservative on the guide and then beat it,\" he said.",

    "description": "The State of the Union will be broadcast across several major networks. Learn how to live stream the 2026 address online.",
    "fullText": "All eyes are on the Capitol ahead of the annual State of the Union address. Below, you can find everything you need to know about how to watch the State of the Union in 2026, including free live streaming options.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver the 2026 State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress beginning at 9 p.m. ET on Tuesday evening. The presidential address typically lasts at least an hour, especially in recent years, and is expected to cover a variety of policy subjects. The address typically serves as a reflection on the past year and looks ahead to the agenda for the year to come. After the speech, Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response. TV guides have the event blocked out until 11 p.m. ET.\n\nThe State of the Union will be held in the House of Representatives Chamber at the US Capitol building, and the event will be available to watch live across most major news networks and several streaming services. We've outlined some of the best ways to stream the event below, featuring international options.\n\nThe good news is that pretty much every major news network will carry full coverage of the event, including ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX, Fox News, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC), and NBC, among others.\n\nYou can watch these networks through one of the best live TV streaming services we've tested, such as DirecTV, Fubo, or Sling TV. DirecTV carries all of these channels in its MyNews genre pack, which costs $40 a month. Subscriptions come with a five-day free trial for new users.\n\nFubo and Sling TV are also solid options, though each is missing a few key channels. Fubo is a good option for ABC, CBS, FOX, and Fox News, but it's missing CNN, NBC, and MS Now. Subscriptions start at $56 a month for the Fubo Sports + News pack. New customers can get a five-day free trial and save on their first month of service.\n\nSling TV's Blue plan carries CNN, Fox News, and MS NOW, along with ABC, FOX, and NBC in select regions. Local channel coverage varies by region, so you should check what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. CBS is missing from all Sling plans. Sling Blue costs $50 a month with local channels.\n\nYou can live stream CBS directly through Paramount Plus Premium, which costs $14 a month. FOX and Fox News are available to live stream directly through FOX One, which costs $20 a month. At $17 a month, Peacock Premium Plus offers a live stream of NBC.\n\nSeveral of the networks' free counterparts — like ABC News Live, CBS News 24/7, LiveNOW from FOX, and NBC News NOW — will also carry coverage of the event. You can live stream most of these options directly on their respective websites, without creating an account.\n\nIn the UK, coverage will be available for free on the BBC website and TV channel. Special coverage will be available beginning at 8 p.m. ET or 1 a.m. GMT.\n\nIf you'll be traveling away from home, you can still keep up with your usual viewing options with the help of a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs are handy cybersecurity tools that let users temporarily change the virtual location on their electronic devices, so they can access their go-to websites and apps from anywhere. They're also instant ways to upgrade online security and privacy.\n\nNordVPN is one of the best options on the market. It's user-friendly, offers a massive selection of international servers, and has a 30-day money-back guarantee if you find that it's not what you're looking for. You can learn \n\nNote: VPN use is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content may constitute a breach of the terms of use for some services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

They are shifting millions of dollars into defensive positions and speculative bets.\n\nThis urgent movement follows a series of shocks that have left the global financial system on edge.\n\nThe market tension traces back to a major legal blow delivered last week on Feb. 20.\n\nIn a 6–3 decision, the US Supreme Court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority when he used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote:\n\n“We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.”\n\nTrump first launched the tariff wave on April 2, 2025, a day he branded “Liberation Day.” His administration argued that persistent US trade deficits constituted a national emergency, allowing him to bypass Congress under IEEPA.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling specifically invalidated tariffs imposed under IEEPA but left intact sector-based tariffs enacted under other trade laws.\n\nTrump called the decision “deeply disappointing” and insisted the Court had only limited one legal pathway. In a TruthSocial post, he wrote:\n\n“As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs. It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!”\n\nWithin hours, Trump signed a proclamation invoking Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose a new 10% global tariff for up to 150 days, later stating he would raise it to 15%.\n\nMajor gold giant shrinks as Trump-linked firm surges\n\nRich Dad Poor Dad buys Bitcoin again\n\nViral AI agent bans ‘Bitcoin,' ‘crypto’ mentions\n\nUS stock futures turned lower, with S&P 500 futures down roughly 0.8% and Nasdaq futures off about 1% following the renewed tariff push.

    "fullText": "The only thing better than one pair of Bose earbuds is getting two for the same price. Right now, the company is running a BOGO sale of sorts: When you buy a pair of either the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds ($299) you'll get a free pair of refurbished Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (a $249 value). Or, you can get the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds for $299 and get a free refurbished pair of first-gen QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (a $249 value).\n\nI've reviewed the Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen), and they have the best ANC I've ever tried. As the name implies, they're comfortable and offer a friendly, minimalistic user experience that I've come to appreciate after testing so many earbuds. The audio is nothing less than what I expect from Bose, and the immersive mode is incredible, making the music truly come to life. I also love their practical features, like the transparency mode coming on when you take one earbud out. Simple, yet so appreciated.\n\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have the sort of open-ear design that has been growing in popularity, likely because active noise-canceling tech has gotten so good that people have forgotten what nature sounds like. The Ultra Open Earbuds are Bose's stab at the trending tech, and they're pretty decent. But when you get a free refurnished pair of QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (1st Gen) along with them, they become a great option for those looking for an open-ear feel.\n\nThis BOGO deal is perfect for people who want to experience both ANC and an open-ear design. Both have very different uses: ANC is great when trying to focus or really get into your media. The open ear design is great for outdoor activities when you need to be aware of your surroundings, or when you want to interact with your environment, like in an office, or working with people. This is an affordable way to get earbuds for either situation.",

    "description": "These Galaxy devices can install Samsung's latest patches.",
    "fullText": "This is going to be a big week for Samsung. The company is making some major announcements at Galaxy Unpacked 2026 on Wednesday, revealing the next generation Galaxy S Series devices (which almost assuredly means the Galaxy S26), as well as some new AI updates. In the lead up to this event, Samsung is also now rolling out its latest security updates for its Galaxy devices—at least, some of its devices.\n\nSamsung's February security update contains 37 patches for issues the company discovered since the January update. This time, there are no critical patches, but there are plenty of fixes for \"High\" severity issues. According to SamMobile, 25 of these patches were provided by Google, which fix issues with Android in general, while the other 12 were specific to Samsung to patch issues within its own ecosystem. That includes issues for Emergency Sharing, Knox Guard Manager, Samsung Dialer, Samsung's Settings app, face and fingerprint authentication systems, and the PACM module—things that only apply to Samsung's own OS.\n\nNot all Galaxy phones are getting this update right away. Samsung is kicking things off with its Galaxy S25 series, meaning the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. It also appears to be rolling out to its latest foldable devices as well, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and Z TriFold. If you bought Samsung's latest and greatest—at least until the S26 series launches—you'll likely see the update in your Settings app imminently. If your Galaxy device is on the older side (or even one year older than the S25 series), you may need to wait a bit before the patches appear.\n\nSpeaking of waiting, Samsung started rolling this update out to Korean users first, so if you're in another region, you might not see it right away. But it does seem evident the patch is on its way, especially with Unpacked airing Wednesday.\n\nOnce the security update hits your device, open the Settings app, then choose either Software update or System updates. (This may differ depending on your device.) From here, depending on your carrier, tap either Download and install, Check for system updates, or Check for software updates. The latest update may begin downloading automatically, but if it doesn't, tap Download now. Finally, follow the on-screen instructions to install the update.",

    "fullText": "Samsung Unpacked 2026 is nearly upon us. On Wednesday, Feb. 25, Samsung will take the stage in San Francisco to make some pretty major product and feature announcements. Unlike some other big tech companies, however, Samsung isn't being 100% secretive here. The company has already told us that it will reveal the next Galaxy S Series, and while they haven't said exactly what it will be called, it's pretty safe to assume this will be the Galaxy S26 series. The rumors suggest Samsung has plenty of other updates up its sleeve, too, including the new Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy AI announcements.\n\nBased on the leaks and rumors, it seems the S26 series will likely be a small year-over-year update to the S25 series, which is largely to be expected from a smartphone OEM as big as Samsung. While there may not be too much incentive to update from the S25 series, users of older Galaxy devices, or older smartphones in general, may find the processor and camera upgrades worthwhile. There may also be unique features, like Privacy Display, which can make it more difficult for others to see your screen when they're not looking at it head-on. We'll have to see exactly which rumors pan out to know for sure.\n\nYou don't need to be seated in San Francisco in order to keep up with all the Samsung news, though. We'll be covering the event live as it happens, posting to this live blog throughout the day. That means we'll be reporting when Samsung reveals the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra; all the new features those devices come with; and any new accessories and AI advancements you can expect from the Samsung ecosystem. For all the latest Samsung Unpacked 2026 news, keep checking this live blog throughout Wednesday.",

    "title": "Two New Features in YouTube Premium Lite Just Made the Pricier Tier Unnecessary",
    "description": "Unless you're really into YouTube Music, you probably don't need to upgrade.",
    "fullText": "As Lifehacker has previously argued, YouTube Premium is probably the best streaming service for most people. Ads can eat into your free time faster than you might realize, and because YouTube's user-generated videos can be quite short, they're especially annoying there—and blocking them without a paid subscription is tough.\n\nYouTube Premium is also a bit pricey as streaming services go, at $14/month. Fortunately, the company also offers a \"Premium Lite\" plan that's much cheaper—and thanks to the recent addition of a few key features, it no longer pales in comparison to a full subscription. In fact, the $8/month YouTube Premium Lite may now be the best paid YouTube tier for most people.\n\nStarting today, YouTube Premium Lite now offers both background play and download options on most videos, features that were previously exclusive to a full YouTube Premium plan. The update is currently rolling out, so it might take a little bit for it to reach you, but the change essentially gives you parity with a full YouTube Premium plan on the vast majority of YouTube content. According to YouTube, the company has \"heard feedback about wanting these additional features included in the service,\" which prompted the change.\n\nNow, for the same $8/month price, you can get most of the full YouTube Premium experience, normally a $14/month value. The only catch? You'll still get ads when streaming music and music videos, hence the \"most videos\" disclaimer. Ads also \"may appear when you search or browse,\" but as for interruptions while watching non-music content? You should be in the clear.\n\nEssentially, unless you're a big YouTube Music user, getting YouTube Premium Lite instead of a full-cost subscription is now a no-brainer. There are a few smaller bonuses you'll be leaving behind, like the ability to \"Jump Ahead\" (instantly skip frequently skipped parts of a video, usually ad reads), but your subscription will also be around half the price. You win some, you lose some.\n\nThe only real gap now, at least for me, is for households with lots of different YouTube viewers YouTube Premium Lite still only applies to one profile at a time, so if everyone in your household wants to have their own separate algorithms instead of sharing a profile, you'll need to get YouTube Premium Family, which costs $23/month, giving six people in the same household the benefits of a full YouTube Premium subscription. My husband and I have pretty different viewing habits, so we're unlikely to switch to this cheaper tier any time soon. But if you live alone or you're OK sharing a profile, you might as well save yourself some moolah.\n\nAlternatively, you can also still get a YouTube Music Premium plan for $11/month. That removes ads and allows background play and downloads, but only for music and music videos. It's essentially the opposite of YouTube Premium Lite, and faces stiff competition from the likes of Spotify and Apple Music. Personally, I'd just pay the extra for a full YouTube Premium subscription, which has all the same benefits of YouTube Music Premium, but also works for non-music content and only costs $3/month more.\n\nStill, while adding new features to Premium Lite is ultimately a discount, it does follow a move from YouTube to block people from accessing background play for free. Perhaps this is Google's attempt at a compromise?",

    "title": "Now Discord Is Saying It's Delaying Global Age Verification",
    "description": "Discord is taking its age verification rollout back to the drawing board.",
    "fullText": "Since it was announced a little over a week ago, Discord's global age verification rollout has been a bit of a mess. First, the chatroom and voice chat company had to clarify that it won't require all adults to upload an ID or facial scan to prove how old they are, as the initial post left many users with that impression. Second, the announcement came shortly after one if its existing customer service partners was breached, which lead to hackers getting a hold of user information, including government IDs provided for age verification. Third, users discovered that Discord had partnered with Peter Thiel-backed company Persona for an experiment in the UK, which raised flags about surveillance and security, and saw some personal identifying information being uploaded to the cloud when users thought it would be processed on-device. Now, Discord is admitting that it messed up, and is trying to make amends.\n\nIn a post on its website, titled \"Getting Global Age Assurance Right: What We Got Wrong and What's Changing,\" Discord admitted that its new \"teen-by-default\" age settings haven't had the warmest reception. The company said that it \"knew this rollout was going to be controversial,\" but added that \"we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we're doing and why.\" It then reiterated that \"over 90% of users will never need to verify their age to continue using Discord exactly as they do today,\" while still doubling down on providing \"real safeguards\" for teenage users. That said, corporate damage control aside, the company also said it's going to delay the global age verification rollout, and is going to make concrete changes to attempt to address user concerns.\n\nTo that end, Discord is making the following changes to its controversial global age verification rollout:\n\nGlobal age verification will now be delayed from March to the \"second half of 2026.\" Until that point, age verification will only remain active in areas where it is legally required, like the UK and Australia.\n\nOn launch, Discord will provide a list of every age verification vendor it works with and their practices.\n\nAll age verification partners will only offer facial scanning on-device.\n\nBefore global age verification launches, Discord will develop alternative age verification methods beyond scanning your face or providing an ID, like providing credit card information instead. However, such methods might not be legally allowed in certain area, like Australia, the UK, and Brazil.\n\nDiscord will add spoiler channels as an option for communities, so they don't need to use age-restricted channels to hide age appropriate, but still sensitive, content anymore. This will allow accounts that aren't able to age verify to access these channels.\n\nThe company will publish a technical blog once age verification launches going into detail on how its systems work, and will add age verification metrics, including how many users were asked to verify or which age verification methods they used, to ongoing transparency reports.\n\nEssentially, the idea is that if you're an adult Discord user (and you live in a region that allows it, which Discord says may not be everywhere), Discord will likely be able to use factors like your signup email, your account age, and your activity to guess your age. If so, you'll be automatically filtered into the correct age group and will be able to keep using the app as usual. Otherwise, you'll be labeled a teen, and will need to verify by either scanning your face, providing a government ID, or using one of Discord's new alternative methods. Or, you could keep using the app unverified, but you'll lose access to age-restricted channels and any content Discord thinks is inappropriate enough to block for you.\n\nTo that end, not much has changed about Discord's end goals, and the company did acknowledge that \"we know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all.\" However, Discord also said that its hand is being forced in regions including the UK, Australia, and Brazil, with \"Europe and multiple US states close behind.\" In scaling age verification globally, Discord says it wants to \"show regulators that it's possible to verify age without collecting identity,\" also stating that \"we don't want to know who you are. We just need to know whether you're an adult.\"\n\nTo be fair, that still seems to involve knowing who users are to some extent, as you'll still need to hand over some type of personal identifying information to verify, or rely on Discord's age prediction to collect information to estimate your age in the background. But as a show of good faith, Discord acknowledged its \"experiment\" with Persona, and that Persona's use of off-device facial scanning did not meet its bar for privacy.\n\nWhat happens next is unclear. Discord's made a lot of promises, but now it has to follow through on them. The company also didn't provide a strict deadline for its age verification rollout, so its possible it could continue to get pushed back in regions that don't legally require it. However, Discord is also up for for an IPO sometime this spring. Certainty and a happy consumer base will likely make investors happy, but that probably also means keeping regulators and concerned parents appeased. Continue to expect compromises, especially when Discord has already come under fire for exposing teens to sensitive material and adult conversations before.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that Americans can't sue the U.S. Postal Service, even when employees deliberately refuse to deliver mail.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing for a majority of five conservative justices, said the federal law that generally shields the Postal Service from lawsuits over missing, lost and undelivered mail includes “the intentional nondelivery of mail.”\n\nIn dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that while the protection against lawsuits is broad, it does not extend to situations when the decision not to deliver mail “was driven by malicious reasons.” Justice Neil Gorsuch joined his three liberal colleagues in dissent.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Republican administration had warned that a ruling for Konan would have led to a flood of similar lawsuits against the cash-strapped Postal Service.\n\nKonan, who's also a real estate agent and an insurance agent, claims two employees at a post office in Euless, Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, deliberately didn’t deliver mail belonging to her and her tenants because, she alleges, they didn’t like that she is Black and owns multiple properties.\n\nAccording to court documents, the dispute began when Konan discovered the mailbox key for one of her rental properties had been changed without her knowledge, preventing her from collecting and distributing tenants’ mail from the box. When she contacted the local post office, she was told she wouldn’t receive a new key or regular delivery until she proved she owned the property. She did so, the documents say, but the mail problems continued, despite the USPS inspector general instructing the mail to be delivered.\n\nKonan alleges the employees marked some of the mail as undeliverable or return to sender. Konan and her tenants failed to receive important mail such as bills, medications and car titles, according to the lawsuit. Konan also claims she lost rental income because some tenants moved out due to the situation.\n\nAfter filing dozens of complaints with postal officials, Konan finally filed a lawsuit under the 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows some lawsuits against the government. The case focused on the reach of the special postal exemption to the law.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA new Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests that Americans are increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump’s age and state of mind.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted online between February 18 and 23, measured the attitudes of 4,638 American adults. It found that 89% of Democrats, 30% of Republicans, and 64% of independents believe that the president is becoming “erratic with age.” Taken altogether, 61% of respondents described Trump that way.  Forty-five percent, meanwhile, still believe that he “is mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges.” Forty-nine percent say he is not.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of respondents indicated that “elected officials in Washington, D.C.” more generally “are too old to represent most Americans.”\n\nTrump’s approval rating ticked up two points to 40% and net approval rating went up by four points to -18%. The former number had  stood pat at 38% in the previous two Reuters/Ipsos polls, which were conducted in mid-February and late January, when his net approval rating came in at -22% and -21%, respectively.\n\nThe president’s approval rating has slipped with among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics since February of last year, but most precipitously with that last group, from 36% to 29%. His economic approval rating has also taken a notable dip over that timeframe, from 41% to 36%.\n\nThe post Most Americans — Including 30% of Republicans — Believe Trump Is Becoming ‘Erratic With Age’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

For Larne, Matt Ridley glanced a header just wide from a Chris Gallagher corner.\n\nDavid Healy brought on Adam Frizzell at the break and that turned into an inspired move as the former Derry City man appeared to get the final touch on a Sam Taylor corner albeit it could well have been an own goal.\n\nEither way, the Blues were level but the game turned somewhat niggly and bitty with free-kicks being dished out at great frequency by referee Chris Morrison.\n\nThe game was simmering away and it all boiled over on 80 minutes when goal-scorer Milar was sent off for a studs-up lunge on Ethan McGee.\n\nUltimately, the best chance for the visitors was another effort from Frizzell but his looping volley dipped too late to trouble Ferguson meaning it was honours even at Inver Park.\n\nAfter a quiet opening at Solitude, the Glens came closest to breaking the deadlock after Ryan Cooney let fly from 25 yards, but his dipping, curling effort was pushed to safety by an alert Lewis Ridd.\n\nDeclan Devine's men continued to threaten from set plays and went close as MJ Kamson Kamara met Danny Amos's inviting corner, but failed to hit the target.\n\nThat pressure should have told minutes later when Pat Hoban out-muscled Shaun Leppard and raced through with Lewis Ridd to beat, only for the Cliftonville goalkeeper to stand tall and deny the former Derry City striker.\n\nAfter the interval, the away side maintained their momentum as Ross Clarke cut in from the right to exchange passes with Aaron McEneff before seeing his right-footed strike from 20 yards tipped behind by Ridd.\n\nThe breakthrough arrived just after the hour mark when Pat Hoban converted coolly from the penalty spot after Joe Toole's high challenge on Aaron McEneff prompted Tim Marshall to point to the spot.\n\nThe visitors doubled their advantage midway through the second half as MJ Kamson Kamara diverted Ryan Cooney's corner into the path of substitute Stewart, who pounced to head home from close range.\n\nThe points were effectively secured five minutes later when Stewart collected possession from McEneff under no pressure and curled into the far bottom corner.\n\nDeep into injury time, Hoban rounded off a memorable night for Declan Devine's men after latching onto a mistake from the Cliftonville rearguard and slotting home his 19th league goal of the season.\n\nBallymena almost struck within the opening two minutes when Kian Corbally's pass split the Glenavon defence but keeper Jacob Carney was quickly off his line to block Success Edogun's effort with his body.\n\nGlenavon's best opening of the first half came when full-back Paddy Burns whipped in a cross from the left which Paul McGovern met with a glancing header and Ballymena keeper Brad Wade was relieved to see the effort whistle narrowly wide.\n\nBallymena broke the deadlock a minute before the interval when Matthew Clarke got to the bye-line and stood up a cross which David Toure headed back towards the far post, leaving Kian Corbally with a close-range headed tap-in.\n\nRemarkably, Glenavon levelled in first-half injury time when Paul McGovern kept his cool to drill home a low shot through a ruck of players after United keeper Brad Wade had kept out a couple of initial efforts.\n\nBallymena had the ball in the net again before the half-time whistle but Aaron Jarvis' effort from a Dylan McGeouch free kick was ruled out for offside.\n\nThe Lurgan Blues went in front on 57 minutes as they broke quickly with Luke McGerrigan feeding Peter Campbell. He tried to curl a low shot into the far corner with the ball eventually breaking for Nathaniel Ferris to slide home from close range.\n\nBallymena levelled on 62 minutes when half-time substitute Sean Murray's low shot trundled past Carney and into the net with the aid of a couple of deflections.\n\nGlenavon almost won it in the closing stages when Ferris' low shot was cleared off the line by Ballymena defender Daithi McCallion.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been one to hold back on social media, and his latest outburst has the internet buzzing. The Tesla CEO took to X, the platform he owns, to blast The New York Times over a decade-old opinion piece that recently popped back into the spotlight.\n\nThe article in question suggested viewing pedophilia through a mental health lens rather than purely as criminal behavior. Musk's sharp words have reignited debates about media responsibility and child safety, drawing in politicians, influencers, and everyday users. Let's break down what happened, why it matters, and the wave of reactions it sparked.\n\nBack in October 2014, The New York Times published an op-ed by Margo Kaplan, a law professor at Rutgers University. Titled \"Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime,\" the piece argued that attractions to children should be treated as a psychiatric issue.\n\nKaplan pointed out that the DSM-5, the manual used by mental health professionals, classifies pedophilia as a paraphilic disorder when it causes distress or leads to harmful actions. She stressed that while any abuse of children remains illegal, recognizing the attraction as a disorder could help people get therapy before they act on impulses.\n\nThis wasn't a news story from the paper's reporters; it was an opinion column meant to spark discussion. Kaplan used examples from other mental health conditions, like substance abuse disorders, where treatment focuses on prevention rather than punishment for thoughts alone. At the time, it drew some criticism, but it faded from headlines.\n\nFast forward to early 2025, and the piece resurfaced amid broader talks about child exploitation cases, including references to high-profile figures like Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. Senator Mike Lee from Utah shared a screenshot of the headline on X, calling the idea \"delusional\" and insisting, \"No, it's a crime.\" His post quickly gained traction, setting the stage for Musk's involvement.\n\nMusk didn't hesitate to jump in. Replying to Lee's post, he labeled The New York Times \"utterly disgusting\" for running the op-ed. In another related comment, he went further, calling the outlet \"evil propaganda.\"\n\nThis fits Musk's pattern of clashing with mainstream media; he has accused them of bias and sensationalism on multiple occasions. For instance, he has previously criticized The Times for their coverage of Tesla and his personal life, once even tweeting that he might create a site to rate journalists' credibility.\n\nWhat made this slam stand out was the timing. Musk has positioned himself as a vocal advocate for child protection online. He has pushed for stricter content moderation on X to combat child exploitation material, and he often shares posts highlighting threats to kids. Users on the platform amplified his words, with his response racking up millions of views in hours.\n\nOne X user echoed Musk by saying the framing was \"dangerous\" and eroded trust in legacy media. Musk's history adds layers here; he once faced a defamation lawsuit after calling a British cave explorer \"pedo guy\" during the 2018 Thai cave rescue drama. A jury cleared him in 2019, ruling the term was an insult, not a factual claim.\n\nKaplan's piece wasn't defending child abuse; it made clear that actions like molestation are crimes deserving punishment. Instead, she highlighted how stigma prevents people with these attractions from seeking help.\n\nShe cited studies showing that many pedophiles never offend, but fear of legal repercussions keeps them silent. For example, she referenced Germany's Dunkelfeld project, which offers confidential therapy to non-offenders and has reportedly reduced risks.\n\nCritics, however, argue this approach blurs lines. They say labeling it a disorder risks normalizing something society views as morally wrong. Senator Lee's post captured this sentiment, rejecting any nuance and focusing on protection.\n\nThe op-ed also discussed legal barriers, like mandatory reporting laws that might deter therapy seekers. Kaplan suggested reforms to balance help with safety, such as better access to treatment without automatic criminalization for attractions alone. Despite these points, the headline's stark phrasing has fueled misinterpretations, leading some to claim The Times was soft on pedophilia.\n\nThe online response split sharply, with many echoing Musk's disgust. One X user wrote, \"Elon calling out NYT’s disgusting 2014 piece loud & clear — pedophilia is a CRIME, not a disorder to normalize. No debate. No excuses. Protect kids first, always.\"\n\nNot all agreed, though; some defended the op-ed's intent to promote treatment and reduce harm. A commenter noted, \"If The New York Times thought they were publishing nuance, they ended up serving nonsense. Elon calling them 'utterly disgusting' is blunt but when the subject is pedophilia, there’s no room for clever spin.\"\n\nOthers brought up unrelated scandals, like Epstein files, to question media priorities. The debate spilled into broader talks on U.K. policies releasing offenders for space, with Musk previously saying, \"I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.\"\n\nThis episode highlights ongoing tensions between free speech, mental health advocacy, and zero-tolerance for child harm. Musk's platform amplified the debate, showing how old content can fuel new fires in today's fast-paced online world. As discussions continue, one thing is clear: topics like this touch deep nerves, prompting calls for accountability from all sides.",

    "description": "Ethan Ives-Griffiths' paternal grandmother says the public deserves clear answers \"about what went wrong\".",
    "fullText": "The family of a toddler murdered by his grandparents has criticised the delay of a review into social services' contact with the little boy.\n\nEthan Ives-Griffiths, two, was murdered by Michael and Kerry Ives at their home in Garden City, Flintshire, in August 2021. Their daughter, Shannon Ives – Ethan's mother – was convicted of child cruelty and of causing or allowing his death.\n\nThe North Wales Safeguarding Board had expected to receive a report in early 2026, looking into agency contact with Ethan. However, the board said further interviews were still needed, and it is not known when the report will be published.\n\nEthan's paternal grandmother, Kellie Shone, said any delay was \"another failure\".\n\nToddler murdered by grandparents 'failed' by system\n\n'My son was killed by his evil grandparents'\n\nCouple guilty of murdering two-year-old grandson\n\nShone, who lives in Flint, said: \"Ethan was failed by social services when he needed the protection the most.\n\n\"Now, after everything our family has been through, the delay in releasing the review feels like another failure.\n\n\"Not just to us, but to the public who also deserve answers - and so does every child who relies on the system to keep them safe.\n\n\"When a child dies after system failures, delaying the independent review only deepens concern and undermines confidence in those responsible for protecting vulnerable children.\n\n\"There must be accountability when the system meant to protect children fails.\n\n\"The public deserves clear answers about what went wrong and what will change moving forward.\"\n\nEthan died in August 2021 after suffering a catastrophic brain injury which the prosecution claimed was caused by one, or both, of his maternal grandparents.\n\nDuring the seven weeks he lived with them, he became severely malnourished and dehydrated, and had more than 40 injuries on his body when he died.\n\nEthan was placed on the child protection register after his mother, Shannon, and father, Will Griffiths, split in June 2021.\n\nThe toddler, his siblings and his mother went to live with the Ives.\n\nA trial at Mold Crown Court in 2025, heard Ethan should have been seen every 10 days because he was on the register.\n\nHowever, the last time he was seen by a social worker was 22 July 2021 - more than three weeks before he died on 16 August.\n\nSocial workers and health visitors made a number of attempts to see Ethan in the weeks before his death, but were given excuses.\n\nDuring one visit, on 5 August, a social worker remained on the doorstep for about 45 minutes - because of Covid restrictions - but did not see Ethan because his mother said he was napping.\n\nThere was no answer when the social worker and a health visitor attempted to visit Shannon Ives and Ethan on 12 August.\n\nShannon Ives did not respond to a call the next day either.\n\nAt the conclusion of the trial last year, Flintshire Council said: \"In keeping with our determination to protect those who need us most\", it was \"co-operating with the North Wales Safeguarding Board, who are leading a multi-agency review of this tragic case\".\n\nThe North Wales Safeguarding Board is overseeing a Child Practice Review. It had anticipated the report being presented to the board in the early part of 2026.\n\nBut following a \"learning event\" held earlier this month, further work is needed.\n\nThe safeguarding board told BBC Wales: \"At present, the board is unable to provide an exact publication date.\n\n\"It's always difficult to predict exactly when a Child Practice Review will be published as the reviewers will always be led by the information which comes forward.\n\n\"On this occasion, and following the initial learning event held in February, the panel identified the need to undertake further interviews to ensure that the knowledge that informs the review is as robust as possible.\n\n\"As a result, the publication is likely to be later in 2026.\"\n\nMichael Ives was jailed for life in October 2025, with a minimum term of 23 years. His wife Kerry was also jailed for life, with a 17-year minimum term. Ethan's mother, Shannon, was jailed for 12 years.\n\nBBC Wales has learned there will be a hearing next month to decide whether to increase the sentences of Michael and Kerry Ives.\n\nA spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said: \"We received a request for this sentence to be considered under the Unduly Lenient Sentence (ULS) scheme.\n\n\"The Law Officers referred Michael and Kerry Ives' sentences to the Court of Appeal as they agree that both their sentences appear unduly lenient. It is now for the court to decide whether to increase the sentences.\"\n\nLast surviving teacher of Aberfan disaster still remembers faces of the children who died\n\nI'm a doctor but will never be able to pay off my ever-growing student debt\n\nSon lived with mum's body for months after Covid lockdown let him hide murder",

    "description": "Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight in September in a rematch of their 2015 blockbuster, but with both men nearning 50 years old, is it a fight that can deliver?",
    "fullText": "Floyd Mayweather, 49, and Manny Pacquiao, 47, will contest their rematch in a professional bout in Las Vegas on 19 September.\n\nIt is a weird fight, \"a carnival\" as Steve Bunce aptly puts it. It is not one that boxing fans have been clamouring for. Nor were they ever considering how the first fight went in 2015 – delivered five years too late and as stale as feared.\n\n\"Carnival\" boxing events, however, have become Netflix's trademark. The streaming platform values one-off, big impact fights that may have little shelf life but burn bright in the moment.\n\n\"It's not the first carnival fight on Netflix,\" 5 Live Boxing expert Bunce told 5 Live Breakfast.\n\n\"We've had Mike Tyson against Jake Paul. We've had Jake Paul against Anthony Joshua.\n\n\"We're so far down the freak fight road that this one doesn't actually raise any alarms bells.\n\n\"It'll just be two men, way past their best in a legitimate fight that is nothing more than an ego-driven sparring session.\n\n\"This circus just gets deeper and deeper and deeper.\"\n\n'White humiliated Aspinall' - Hearn warns Benn after exit\n\nBoxing has a long history of carefully constructed mismatches. Mayweather championed and perfected the genre, fighting UFC star Conor McGregor in a competitively pointless but massively lucrative bout in 2017.\n\nMcGregor was a novice and Mayweather carried him through ten rounds before bringing an end to the contest.\n\nNormally, exhibitions and \"freak fights\" were confined to the top of some luxury building with the wealthy paying a massive fee to see their favourite boxer up close.\n\nThe great Muhammad Ali reaped the benefit of this custom, fighting Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976 in front of 14,00 in Tokyo.\n\nIrish boxer Mick Conlan believes money will be the driving factor for both men.\n\n\"They are two of the greatest of their generation but they are very old and must need money or this fight wouldn't be happening,\" he tells BBC Sport Northern Ireland.\n\nThis is the sell, an anything can happen event where anything is definitely not going to happen.\n\nMayweather brought this tradition to the big stage when he fought McGregor on pay-per-view at the T-Mobile Arena and people have been following his example ever since.\n\nWith Jake Paul turning the art into the biggest industry in boxing with Netflix in recent years, it is perhaps no surprise Mayweather has returned to get in on the act.\n\nBut unlike many of these weird and worrying events - see Paul v 58-year-old Mike Tyson - this contest seems at least from a health point of view, easy to digest.\n\n\"They are both similarly aged,\" Bunce says.\n\n\"One's 49, one's 47. They've had similar amount of fights.\n\n\"In theory, that's a good thing. They are equal in decay or decline. So they're not going in with a young dangerous fighter.\"\n\nIt is yet to be confirmed what exactly the rules will be, but the rematch will be a professional bout and count to each man's record.\n\nPacquiao has been in and out of the ring professionally and in exhibitions for years.\n\nHe was the oldest welterweight champion at the age of 40 in 2019 and came close to making it aged 46 when he drew with WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in the summer of 2024.\n\nMayweather has not fought professionally since becoming 50-0 by beating McGregor in 2017, but he has competed in eight exhibition bouts since then, including against YouTuber and WWE star Logan Paul.\n\nBoth men will be subject to extra tests as they are over the age of 40, but neither will be expected to fail.\n\n\"The claims are that this will be a real fight,\" Bunce adds.\n\n\"They'll wear 10oz gloves, 12, three-minute rounds and there will be no special rules – allegedly.\"\n\n\"[In boxing] we either have exhibition fights or a real fight. This one is a blend of the two.\"\n\nDespite the fact a fight between two boxers nearing 50 is unlikely to set the sporting world alight, the competitive aspect seems secondary to the product.\n\n\"[The first fight] generated unbelievable sums of money. The gate itself, the tickets, generated $72m,\" Bunce says. \"[But] it was a dreadful fight. It was a stinker.\"\n\nMayweather, however, is a master promoter, Pacquiao is loved by millions – the build-up will be as much the offering as the fight night.\n\nNetflix has over 200m households globally and the bout will take place at the Sphere in Las Vegas which can hold 20,000.\n\nAfter what the UFC achieved visually with their event there in 2024, it could be a completely new kind of viewing experience for a boxing fight.\n\nNetflix has offered a fresh approach to fights, blending a big-show American style broadcasting with big-name expert analysts and presenters and drawing in the entertaiment world.\n\nAnd these are two legends of the sport reviving one of boxing's most famous rivalries of the last 50 years.\n\nThe appetite, as proven by Paul and Netflix's past success, is absolutely there.\n\n\"You wll naturally watch it,\" Bunce says and Conlan agrees.\n\n\"It's unwanted but then people will think, 'it's Pacquiao v Mayweather - of course I will watch',\" Conlan says.\n\n\"I would love Pacquiao to win,\" he adds.\n\n\"If he did, they'll probably do another one.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Scientists believe they’ve uncovered the meaning of some of the Moai stone monoliths found on Rapa Nui, better known as Easter Island. Here's the truth.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nScientists believe they’ve uncovered the meaning of some of the Moai stone monoliths found on Rapa Nui, better known as Easter Island.\n\nThe scientists analyzed soil in the vicinity of two of the Moai statues and found traces of banana, taro, and sweet potato, according to research published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.\n\nThese traces indicate the statues could have been used to celebrate the crop fertility of soils in the region.\n\nThe famed stone monoliths that tower over the island of Rapa Nui—colloquially known as Easter Island—have puzzled scientists for centuries.\n\nBut archaeologists and soil scientists studying the ancient Moai believe they’ve uncovered the meaning of the famous statues. Clues in nearby soils suggest the statues may have been placed there to celebrate the fertility of crops in the area.\n\nFor more than three decades, Jo Ann Van Tilburg, of the University of California, Los Angeles, has studied the origins of the Moai along with Rapanui artist Cristián Arévalo Pakarati and other members of the local community. They recruited soil scientist Sarah Sherwood, of the University of the South in Tennessee, to analyze the soil the base of two statues found peculiarly perched upright in the Rano Raraku quarry on the eastern part of the island, where most of the more than 1,000 Moai statues originated. (The scientists suspect that work in the quarry began around A.D. 1455.)\n\nThe team analyzed soils at the foot of two of the structures, which archaeologists believe were erected by or before A.D. 1510 to A.D. 1645, and found chemical evidence of common food crops. The soils revealed traces of foods like taro, banana, and sweet potato, according to research published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.\n\nThe findings suggest locals on the island may have actually utilized the quarry itself as a place to grow food.\n\n“When we got the chemistry results back, I did a double take,” Sherwood said in a statement. Soils across much of Rapa Nui are in poor shape—either highly eroded or leeched of the vital nutrients that help plants grow. Analysis showed that soils within the quarry are far more fertile than previously thought, with plenty of water and elevated levels of elements like calcium and phosphorus, which are essential in increasing crop yields.\n\n“This study radically alters the idea that all standing statues in Rano Raraku were simply awaiting transport out of the quarry,” Van Tilburg said in the same statement. “That is, these and probably other upright Moai in Rano Raraku were retained in place to ensure the sacred nature of the quarry itself. The Moai were central to the idea of fertility, and in Rapanui belief their presence here stimulated agricultural food production.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Snoop Dogg walking around the Swansea.com Stadium to the soundtrack of his greatest hits blaring from the sound system, waving a Snoop and Swansea City-branded towel above his head while the capacity crowd did the same and chanted \"Snoop Dogg's barmy army\".\n\nThis was not a fever dream, nor was it the effect of \"the smell of weed in the tunnel\" as visiting manager Paul Heckingbottom put it.\n\nNo, this was a midweek Championship fixture between Swansea and Preston North End.\n\nThe difference between this and other second-tier matches being that one of the Welsh club's co-owners happens to be a hip-hop legend.\n\nCullen rescues Snoop Dogg's Swans party against Preston\n\nSnoop Dogg and Swansea - the story behind football's unlikeliest link-up\n\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views\n\nSnoop is used to rolling up at some of the biggest sporting events in the world.\n\nHe was an 'honorary coach' for the United States at this month's Winter Olympics in Italy, having fulfilled a similar role at the Paris summer Games of 2024.\n\nTwo years before that, he was one of the performers in the Super Bowl half-time show. Global audiences do not get much bigger.\n\nSo, a meeting between teams 14th and eighth in the Championship was not the most obvious next destination for Snoop's sporting bucket list.\n\nBut these are strange times. Wrexham are owned by Hollywood actors and Swansea count former Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric and US television personality and billionaire Martha Stewart among their minority investors.\n\nIn terms of fame and worldwide reach, however, Snoop is on another level.\n\nFans had been lining up outside the stadium five hours before kick-off to get a glimpse of Snoop, who signed autographs and posed for photographs in the kind of sunshine that will have made the Californian feel at home.\n\nInside the ground, he had arranged for every single seat to have a Snoop and Swansea-branded towel inspired by those waved by supporters of his beloved American football team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOnce darkness had fallen, the show began.\n\nSwansea and Preston's players were still warming up when Snoop emerged to an explosion of noise and colour.\n\nThe visitors did not seem fazed, though.\n\nPreston had only brought around 200 fans for what was a sell-out. With tickets in the away end sold to Swansea supporters, this was a record number of home fans at a game in this stadium.\n\nYet the away fans were loudest during a first half in which their team led to puncture the party atmosphere.\n\n\"Snoop Dogg, what's the score?\" sang Preston's travelling contingent, before later chanting: \"Where's your towel gone?\"\n\nSat in the directors' box in a long Swansea puffer coat, which would not have looked out of place on the slopes of the Winter Olympics in northern Italy, this was Snoop's first experience of football's tribal fan culture.\n\nFortunately for him, he got to sample the soaring high of an injury-time equaliser as well, as substitute Liam Cullen headed the Swans level in the 95th minute.\n\n\"After the game, he [Snoop] came to the dressing room, spoke with the players,\" said Swansea head coach Vitor Matos.\n\n\"He's someone that likes to be involved. He was involved not only with us, but as well with the [US] Olympic team. He really loves sports.\n\n\"It's good for him to be involved. I'm happy that we have someone like him who loves the club, loves the city, wants to be here.\"\n\nWhen Swansea's American owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen brought Snoop in as a minority investor in July, the idea was not that the rapper would spend large amounts of his own enormous wealth on the club.\n\nInstead, the Swans wanted to increase their global appeal by tapping into Snoop's huge reach which includes more than 100m social media followers.\n\nSome at the club believe that could create business and sponsorship opportunities which could outstrip those they had when they were in the Premier League.\n\nGetting back to the top flight is the aim. After such a spectacular preamble, this first act at least produced a dramatic finish.\n\nNow Swansea and Snoop wait to see what the next episode brings.",

The new machine design directly targets growing demand for next generation AI chips, an area that has become a key focus across the semiconductor industry.\n\nFor investors watching ENXTAM:ASML, the bigger question is how this technology shift could influence customer investment plans and the competitive gap with other equipment makers. The reported 50% efficiency potential by 2030 may shape long term capacity decisions across foundries and integrated device manufacturers that rely on EUV tools.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for ASML Holding by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on ASML Holding.\n\n2 things going right for ASML Holding that this headline doesn't cover.\n\nThis EUV light-source breakthrough goes straight to the economics of chip production. If a tool can process around 50% more wafers per hour without needing extra floor space or duplicate systems, it can change how customers such as TSMC and Intel think about their long term fab build outs. For ASML, that can translate into a stronger case for its most advanced EUV platforms as fabs push to supply AI and high performance computing chips. It also reinforces why ASML is often treated as a way to get exposure to AI chip demand without choosing a specific chip designer. At the same time, a more productive tool could slow the need for incremental units at the margin if customers can get more output from each system, so investors may want to watch how pricing, service and upgrade revenues evolve alongside unit volumes, especially as U.S. and Chinese equipment makers work on competing technologies.\n\nThis EUV advance aligns with the narrative that ASML’s EUV and High NA platforms support productivity and cost reductions for chipmakers, which can support equipment adoption tied to AI demand.\n\nIf High NA adoption timing or tool maturity proves more complex than expected, the focus on current generation EUV power gains could delay some of the earnings contribution that narrative writers associate with future platforms.\n\nThe news puts more weight on ASML’s installed base and upgrade potential, which is mentioned in the narrative, but the specific impact of higher light output on long term service and upgrade revenue may not yet be fully reflected.",

    "description": "After an immature winter, Harry Brook's mature and majestic century against Pakistan proved he is England's leader for the future, writes Matthew Henry.",
    "fullText": "Leaders in English cricket have come in many varieties.\n\nThere was Michael Vaughan the man-manager and Sir Andrew Strauss the strategist, who carefully planned England's route to the top.\n\nSir Alastair Cook and Heather Knight led through pure determination. Ben Stokes is as inspiring as they come.\n\nIt is unlikely Harry Brook will ever have the poise of Strauss or the aura of Stokes.\n\nBrook's penance in Pallekele - a T20 international century as good as any by an England batter, which secured victory over Pakistan and a place in the World Cup semi-finals - was the moment he truly became a leader for England.\n\nStunning Brook century leads England into semis\n\nBrook century blasts England into semi-finals\n\nYou know the story of Brook's winter by now.\n\nAn altercation with a nightclub bouncer in Wellington, a wasteful Ashes performance and a foolish attempt to hide the truth, for which he later had to come clean.\n\nFew England captains have toured with such oversized baggage.\n\nThousands of England fans travelled to Australia for the Ashes. Thousands more set alarms night after night, day after day back home.\n\nBrook owed them a performance and boy did he repay them here. It was the most mature of knocks after the most immature of winters.\n\nIt is curious that Brook, a man with a T20 World Cup winner's medal from 2022 and a Test triple century, could perhaps have been accused of not having delivered a match-winning knock on the very biggest stage.\n\nHis highest score against Australia is 85 in 10 Tests.\n\nBoth of his hundreds against India last year were in Tests England lost - the second in the fifth Test at The Oval when his careless dismissal opened the door for India's fightback to draw the series 2-2.\n\nBrook's highest score at the last 50-over World Cup was 66 and the previous T20 edition 53. Those doubts are silenced now.\n\nBecause, with his side teetering - Phil Salt out first ball and England soon 58-4 as they chased 165 to win - Brook stood up like never before.\n\nMany have questioned Brook's brainpower during his England career and at times this winter he has made it hard not to wonder.\n\nThere were the drives in Perth and Brisbane and the reverse sweep in Adelaide before even considering the issues off the field.\n\nHis 'beer smash' celebration when making a hundred against Sri Lanka last month showed another flash of childishness.\n\nBut those close to Brook and the England dressing room have always spoken of his sharp cricket brain.\n\nThis innings was the perfect example.\n\nIn 2022 he used a four-month break after the death of his grandmother to shed pounds not because he needed to fill his time or appear on the next series of Love Island.\n\nHe spoke then about how it would help him run twos in the 2024 T20 World Cup, thus getting himself back on strike to hit boundaries in the latter overs.\n\nIn Pallekele, Brook's 100 from 51 balls was destructive, brutal at times, but he also ran nine twos.\n\nIt meant he could both attack - England took 11 from the second over and 17 from both the sixth and the 11th as Brook pushed on - but also go down the gears after wickets fell.\n\nWhen Tom Banton was caught behind off Usman Tariq, Brook calmly took singles off his next five balls.\n\nIt was a perfectly paced innings, showing his wish for batters not to be \"too careful\" does not simply mean whack boundaries from every ball.\n\n\"I know we were losing wickets, but my job was still to try to go out there and put them under pressure throughout,\" Brook said.\n\nThat is the smartness people talk about.\n\nThere is, of course, one other man Brook owed a performance to.\n\nHis coach Brendon McCullum was pushed to the brink by the Ashes defeat. Some will say he has already gone beyond the point from which he can return.\n\nBut in securing a semi-final spot, Brook has nudged England closer to a result that will keep the New Zealander in a job should he want it.\n\nBrook could yet be the Mark Robins to McCullum's Sir Alex Ferguson - granted the New Zealander has a long way to go.\n\nBrook has always been one of Bazball's most devoted believers.\n\nMcCullum is the only Test coach Brook has had, the only permanent coach he has worked under as white-ball captain. He often speaks straight from the McCullum philosophical handbook.\n\nIt was no surprise, therefore, that he credited his coach with the plan to promote Brook from number five to bat at three for the first time in his international career.\n\nIt was McCullum who put the idea to his captain early on Tuesday morning, less than 12 hours before the start of the game.\n\nSome England players, like Jacob Bethell, who was nudged down to number four by Brook's promotion, were told earlier in the day, but the rest were not fully made aware of the plan until McCullum spoke in the pre-match huddle.\n\n\"Baz was the mastermind there,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He had the discussion with me this morning about going up the order and trying to maximise the powerplay.\"\n\nMcCullum's move means England now have a free hit in their final Super 8 match against New Zealand on Friday. After that they will travel to India for a semi-final.\n\nSomehow, after stuttering and struggling to this point, they are the closest side to winning the title. Australia have gone already and defending champions India could follow before the week is out.\n\nIf the co-hosts remain, one of South Africa or West Indies will surely be knocked out.\n\nBrook is two wins from becoming the fourth England men's captain - after Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler - to lift a World Cup.\n\nHe is leading his way, which will bring moments that will leave you scratching your head. Now is the time for Brook to be backed, however.\n\nHe is not only a captain, one sharp tactically on the field and supremely talented with the bat, but a leader.",

I didn't really get the chance to say a proper goodbye,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff with Helmut advising from the side-line.\n\n\"I think ultimately things changed within the business, within the group.

    "fullText": "Jacob Murphy did not think twice.\n\nThe Newcastle United winger had just been asked whether he wanted Barcelona or Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\n\"Anyone,\" he immediately responded on Amazon Prime after his side beat Qarabag 3-2 to secure a dominant 9-3 win on aggregate.\n\n\"Honestly, with this group of players, we will take anyone on. Especially with knockout football, we back ourselves. Bring on whoever's to come.\"\n\nIt was a mindset shared by his manager.\n\nNewcastle have achieved their initial target of reaching the next round, but head coach Eddie Howe does not want his side's journey to end yet.\n\nHe believes his team can \"raise our game and compete with anybody\".\n\n\"We have to believe in ourselves,\" he said. \"We have seen the best of ourselves when we have gone into cup games and one-off games, where we have been able to rise to whatever challenge we have had in front of us.\n\n\"We will have to go in with that mindset again, whoever we get in the next round.\"\n\nNewcastle are certainly enjoying life back at Europe's top table.\n\nHowe's side are the top scorers in the Champions League with 26 goals, and have won six games in a single campaign in the competition for the first time.\n\nIt has been quite a turnaround in the last two-and-a-half weeks.\n\nHowe was the first to admit he was not doing his job \"well enough\" after his side were booed off by a section of supporters following a 3-2 defeat against Brentford in the Premier League in their previous game at St James' Park earlier this month.\n\nThe Newcastle head coach embarked on some soul searching in the aftermath of the loss, while his players set out to \"fight for the manager\".\n\nNewcastle have won four of their last five games in all competitions since, and secured a place in the knockout stage proper.\n\nGiven the revenue gap between the Premier League and a number of clubs on the continent, and the competitiveness of the top-flight, outsiders may question whether that should necessarily come as a huge surprise.\n\nEven beleaguered Tottenham Hotspur, who are hovering above the relegation zone in the Premier League, finished in the top eight of the league phase.\n\nYet the manner of Newcastle's six Champions League victories against Qarabag, Benfica, PSV Eindhoven, Athletic Club and Union Saint-Gilloise were far from foregone conclusions.\n\nQarabag, for instance, had drawn against Chelsea and defeated Benfica, Eintracht Frankfurt and Copenhagen. Newcastle hammered the Azerbaijan Premier League champions.\n\nAlthough Howe wanted more from his much-changed side in the 3-2 second-leg win on Tuesday night, Newcastle have shown they can battle the continent's elite on their day.\n\nNewcastle drew 1-1 against holders Paris St-Germain in the French capital last month and suffered a narrow 2-1 defeat at the hands of Barcelona in their opening game of the competition.\n\nNo wonder, then, defender Dan Burn feels Newcastle can \"compete with anybody\" at their best.\n\n\"We've shown that, especially against Paris St-Germain, how good we can be,\" he wrote in his programme notes.\n\n\"I think we elevate our game going into those games because there are bigger, better teams at this stage of the competition.\"\n\nNewcastle have a lot of work to do in the Premier League, where they currently lie in 11th place.\n\nBut they are no longer stargazed by life in the Champions League.\n\nEven playing in the opening round of the competition was a new experience for the majority of those at the club last time around.\n\nThis was a stage these players dreamed of playing on – nothing said that quite like Murphy's wide-eyed wonder as he lined up for the Champions League anthem for the first time at the San Siro in 2023 – but they now feel like they belong.\n\nNot only are the squad able to draw on the experiences of their last campaign, when they faced Paris St-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan in the group of death, they have also accumulated big-game experiences in the interim. This includes, of course, ending a 70-year wait to win a major domestic trophy by beating Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final last March.\n\nThat is why Friday's last 16 draw will bring eager anticipation rather than trepidation as former Newcastle striker Dwight Gayle knows better than most.\n\n\"Knowing all of the boys in the dressing room, they will be excited about who they get in the next round,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"They will buzz off someone like Barcelona and that will create an unbelievable tie. To continue this run is perfect for them and they will be hungry for more.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "A Secret Soviet Plan to Nuke America From the South Pole Was Working. Until UFO Hunters Looked Up.",
    "description": "When a glowing crescent appeared over Moscow in 1967, alien enthusiasts panicked—unaware they were tracking a 3-megaton weapon meant to bypass American radar.",
    "fullText": "During the late 1960s, a top-secret Soviet program to sneak nuclear weapons around U.S. early warning radars was mistaken for a rash of UFO sightings by Moscow’s citizens. The weapon, known as FOBS, created a mysterious pattern in the night sky that many mistook for signs of alien visitation.\n\nIn the spring of 1967, people living in the western Soviet Union noticed something odd in the sky at dusk: a mysterious crescent-shaped sliver of light, about the size of the moon from most directions but larger from others. The crescent appeared six times in 1967, always at the same time of day, before it finally disappeared.\n\nAccording to veteran space expert James Oberg at Air & Space Magazine, the Soviet press speculated they were UFOs, and UFO enthusiast groups sprang up across the country to record the sightings.\n\nSuddenly, after the sixth incident, Soviet press coverage of the incidents abruptly stopped. Someone in Moscow with the right clearance realized that the crescents in the sky at sundown were actual evidence of a top-secret weapons test—one that violated existing treaties on the deployment of nuclear weapons into space.\n\nThe “UFO” sightings were actually test launches of the R-36 Orb, a secret nuclear space missile. Developed from the SS-9 Scarp intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-36 Orb was designed to rocket into low-Earth orbit and de-orbit over the United States. Launched in a southern direction, the weapon could pass over the South Pole and then come at the United States from the direction of Mexico, bypassing the network of early warning radars facing north.\n\nThe trip would be longer, but would catch the Americans by surprise, allowing the Soviets the chance to detonate a 2-3 megaton thermonuclear weapon wherever they might choose.\n\nThe R-36 was a so-called “first strike” weapon. The only logical reason to have such a weapon was to use it first in a nuclear war, as a surprise weapon meant to destroy American leadership and nuclear command and control systems. The problem? The R-36 was not accurate.\n\nOn average, half of R-36s launched in a war would land within three miles of their target. That’s not a deal breaker with a 5-megaton warhead, but it does rule out destroying enemy missile silos. Still, the R-36 would retain use when it came to wiping out the White House, Pentagon, U.S. nuclear bombers sitting on the tarmac, and other vital U.S. installations in a surprise attack.\n\nThe Soviet military conducted six tests of the R-36, each at the exact time of day when the missiles were illuminated but the recording cameras were in shadow. The illuminated crescent was caused by the weapon’s braking maneuver, in which the de-orbit engine fired up and spewed exhaust as the weapon turned 180 degrees. This created a clearly visible letter “C” in the early evening sky. This slowed the R-36 down so that it entered low earth orbit, and would be fired back up again later to begin the de-orbiting process.\n\nAlthough the Soviets initially explained away the tests as launches of “scientific research satellites,” American intelligence eventually figured out what they were up to and called the USSR out on it. Within eight months of the first test, according to Oberg, the U.S. claimed the R-36 was a first-strike weapon that used an orbit/de-orbit scheme.\n\nThis would run afoul of the Outer Space Treaty, which was nearing completion and which would ban the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit. It would also run counter to U.N. Resolution 1884, passed in 1963, which called on the U.S. and U.S.S.R. not to place nuclear weapons in space.\n\nThe Soviet Union never came clean about the R-36. Eighteen of the weapons were based in silos near Tyuratam, and later banned by the SALT II arms control treaty. The weapons had long since been obsolete, foiled by the deployment of new, southward-facing American early warning radars and Soviet ballistic missile submarines that could launch an attack from that direction much more quickly. The UFOs, it turned out, were not so unidentified after all.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "JOHANNESBURG, Feb 24 (Reuters) - South Africa's government said on Tuesday that 11 of a group of 17 men who ‌were lured into fighting for Russia in Ukraine were set ‌to return home soon, after an initial four landed back in the country last ​week.\n\nA further two remained in Russia, with one in a hospital in Moscow, President Cyril Ramaphosa's office said in a statement.\n\nRamaphosa raised the fate of the 17 men, who sent distress calls to the South ‌African government in November ⁠after getting trapped in Ukraine's Donbas region, in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin this ⁠month.\n\nReports of African men being lured into Russia with promises of jobs and ending up on Ukraine's front line have become more frequent in ​recent months, ​creating tensions between Moscow and ​some of the countries involved.\n\nA ‌Kenyan intelligence report presented to lawmakers last week estimated that more than 1,000 Kenyans had been recruited to fight on Russia's side in the war in Ukraine. Kenya's foreign minister has said he plans to visit Russia to address the issue.\n\nSouth Africa has sought to ‌maintain a non-aligned stance on the ​conflict in Ukraine, while preserving strong ties ​with Moscow as a fellow ​BRICS member alongside Brazil, India and China.\n\nUnder South ‌African law, it is illegal for ​citizens to provide ​military assistance to foreign governments or participate in foreign armies unless authorised to do so.\n\nMuch of the Donbas is controlled ​by Russian forces and ‌fighting has been heavy there since Russia invaded Ukraine four ​years ago.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal authorities are barred from conducting an “unsupervised, wholesale search” of electronic devices that they seized from a Washington Post reporter’s Virginia home while investigating allegations that a Pentagon contractor illegally leaked classified information to the journalist, a magistrate judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Porter said he will independently review the contents of Post reporter Hannah Natanson's devices instead of allowing a Justice Department “filter team” to perform a search. Porter said he balanced the need to protect Natanson's free speech rights with the government's duty to safeguard top secret national security information.\n\n“The Court finds that seizing the totality of a reporter’s electronic work product, including tools essential to ongoing newsgathering, constitutes a restraint on the exercise of First Amendment rights,” he wrote.\n\nThe case has drawn national attention and scrutiny from press freedom advocates who say it reflects a more aggressive posture by the Justice Department toward leak investigations involving journalists.\n\nFederal agents seized a phone, two laptops, a recorder, a portable hard drive and a Garmin smart watch when they searched Natanson’s home in Alexandria, Virginia, on Jan. 14. Last month, Porter agreed to temporarily bar the government from reviewing any material from Natanson’s devices. Tuesday's order extends that prohibition.\n\n“The Court’s genuine hope is that this search was conducted — as the government contends — to gather evidence of a crime in a single case, not to collect information about confidential sources from a reporter who has published articles critical of the administration,” he wrote.\n\nThe Post sought an order requiring the government to immediately return the devices to its reporter, but Porter denied that request. He said it is reasonable for the government to keep nothing more than the “limited information” responsive to the search warrant. The rest of the contents must be returned to Natanson, he ruled.\n\nAllowing the government to search a reporter’s work material, including unrelated information from confidential sources, “is the equivalent of leaving the government’s fox in charge of the Washington Post’s henhouse,” Porter wrote.\n\nPentagon contractor Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones was arrested on Jan. 8 and charged with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents. Perez-Lugones is accused of taking home printouts of classified documents from his workplace and later passing them to Natanson.\n\nThe newspaper’s attorneys accused authorities of violating legal safeguards for journalists and trampling on Natanson’s First Amendment rights.\n\nJustice Department attorneys argued that the government is entitled to keep the seized material because it contains evidence in an ongoing investigation with national security implications.\n\nThe FBI began investigating after the Post on Oct. 31 published an article containing classified information from an intelligence report, according to the government. The Post reporter co-wrote and contributed to at least five articles that contained classified information provided by Perez-Lugones, authorities said.\n\nNatanson has been covering Republican President Donald Trump’s transformation of the federal government. The Post published a piece in which she described gaining hundreds of new sources from the federal workforce, leading one colleague to call her “the federal government whisperer.”\n\nThe Post says the seized material spanned years of Natanson’s reporting across hundreds of stories, including communications with confidential sources.\n\nThe Justice Department has internal guidelines governing its response to news media leaks. Last April, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued new guidelines restoring prosecutors’ authority to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to hunt for government officials who make “unauthorized disclosures” to journalists.\n\nThe new guidelines rescinded a policy from Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration that protected journalists from having their phone records secretly seized during leak investigations.\n\nPerez-Lugones, 61, of Laurel, Maryland, has remained jailed since his arrest. He held a top-secret security clearance while working as a systems engineer and information technology specialist for a government contractor.\n\nInvestigators found phone messages between Perez-Lugones and the reporter in which they discussed the information that he provided, authorities said. “I’m going quiet for a bit ... just to see if anyone starts asking questions,” Perez-Lugones wrote after sending one of the documents, according to the government.",
